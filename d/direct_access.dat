5|$|At Altoona, {{the route}} again {{overlaps}} I-80 until Newton, where it splits away from I-80. The highway passes near {{or through the}} cities of Kellogg, Grinnell, Victor, Marengo, the Amana Colonies, and Tiffin before entering the Coralville / Iowa City area. Through Coralville and Iowa City, US6 has no <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> to I-80, I-380, or US218; other routes like Iowa Highway 1 (Iowa1) and Iowa965 provide <b>direct</b> <b>access.</b> From Iowa City, the highway heads to the east-southeast through West Liberty and Atalissa. Near Wilton, the route heads north to I-80 where it again overlaps to Davenport. At Davenport, US6 then follows I-280 and US61 before entering the city. On {{the eastern side of}} Davenport, it joins I-74 and enters Bettendorf before leaving Iowa for Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, the Airport Drive {{extension}} was completed, {{creating a}} second major {{link to the}} airport. The link starts at the M80 Western Ring Road and provides <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> to Melrose Drive 1.5 kilometres from the terminal area.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an effective memory access method for a high-speed data transfer on mobile systems using a <b>direct</b> memory <b>access</b> controller that considers {{the characteristics of}} a multi-port memory controller. The <b>direct</b> memory <b>access</b> controller has an integrated channel management function to control multiple <b>direct</b> memory <b>access</b> channels. The channels are physically separated and operate independently from each other. Experimental results show that the proposed <b>direct</b> memory <b>access</b> method improves the transfer performance by up to 72 % and 69 % on read and write transfer cycles, respectively. The total number of transfer cycles of the proposed method is 63 % less than in a commercial method under 4 -channel access...|$|R

30|$|Two trials {{compared}} the <b>direct</b> optical <b>access</b> to the Veress needle technique [80, 81]. The first study {{was performed in}} postmenopausal women. Estrogen loss at menopause {{is known to have}} a profound influence on skin, with postmenopausal atrophy and loss of tone and elasticity. The study demonstrated significantly lower entry time (65.7 [*]±[*] 11.9 vs. 192.8 [*]±[*] 5.6  s) and lower overall blood loss in the <b>direct</b> optical <b>access</b> group (9.6 [*]±[*] 8.1 19.2 [*]±[*] 7.3  ml) [80]. Similar results were found, in premenopausal women, by the same group of investigators. <b>Direct</b> optical <b>access</b> led to a shorter entry time [81]. When comparing the <b>direct</b> optical <b>access</b> to the Hasson technique, there was lower blood loss (9.6 [*]±[*] 8.1 vs. 19.2 [*]±[*] 7.3  ml) and a shorter mean entry time (61.8 [*]±[*] 10.4 vs. 163.1 [*]±[*] 9.2  s) [82]. Based on these results, the <b>direct</b> optical <b>access</b> can be considered a feasible and safe alternative for first laparoscopic entry in both pre- and postmenopausal women.|$|R
5|$|The {{completed}} project {{resulted in}} the creation of Highway427 between the QEW and Dixon / Airport Road, north of which traffic was defaulted onto Indian Line. The entire Airport Expressway was removed {{to make way for the}} new interchange, but the new route still included <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> to the airport.|$|E
5|$|The current scheme {{does not}} provide any <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> between High Speed 2 at Euston and the {{existing}} High Speed 1 from St Pancras. In 2015, plans were announced to link the two stations via a travelator service.|$|E
5|$|A {{narrow slit}} {{along the north}} wall's outside surface {{indicates}} {{the presence of an}} ancient balcony. There are several rooms attached {{to the rear of the}} structure that lack <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> to the main building; these are believed to have been dedicated to community storage. Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Bonito are the only two great houses in Chaco Canyon with corner doorways.|$|E
50|$|In computing, remote <b>direct</b> memory <b>access</b> (RDMA) is a <b>direct</b> memory <b>access</b> {{from the}} memory of one {{computer}} into that of another without involving either one's operating system. This permits high-throughput, low-latency networking, which is especially useful in massively parallel computer clusters.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{sections}} of the route may become motorway. Part of the N25 dual carriageway in Midleton is to have all its junctions grade-separated and all <b>direct</b> <b>accesses</b> removed from the route (by {{the construction of a}} parallel road), thus making it suitable for upgrade to motorway status.|$|R

5|$|Australia and New Zealand {{were built}} with a {{different}} arrangement. The spotting top on the main mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the conning tower where it was better protected, had an improved field of vision and <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> to the primary conning position. The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were built with the improvements listed above.|$|E

On Steelers and Pitt Panthers game days, access is also provided from Station Square parking facilities via the Gateway Clipper Fleet.|$|E
5|$|State Route 67 (SR67) is a {{state highway}} in San Diego County, California. It begins at Interstate8 (I-8) in El Cajon and {{continues}} to Lakeside as the San Vicente Freeway before becoming an undivided highway through {{the eastern part of}} Poway. In the town of Ramona, the route turns into Main Street before ending at SR78. SR67 provides <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> from the city of San Diego to the East County region of San Diego County, including Ramona and Julian.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a single root view is that processes may be run on any available node and access needed files with no special precautions.

5|$|Surrounded by hills, Lam Tin {{does not}} have <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> to the Victoria Harbour. However, {{merchant}} ships and ferries dock at Kwun Tong Pier and Lei Yue Mun Pier, which are both within 15 minutes' walk from Lam Tin, and provide surface transport for Lam Tin residents. Another reason for Lam Tin's absence of an outlet to the Harbour {{is the presence of}} an Eastern Harbour Crossing entrance inside the district, whose buses and MTR overtook ferries for cross-harbour transport.|$|E
5|$|TfL {{has also}} {{suggested}} {{there may be}} potential for the turnback siding adjacent to Milkwood Road to be converted for passenger use. This would require substantial changes to the station {{as there is no}} <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> to the platforms from Milkwood Road and the current subway for accessing the platforms does not extend east of the southbound platform.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} {{housed the}} boiler room, a smaller waiting room, kitchen storerooms, and baggage rooms. The station {{appears to have}} had two side platforms serving four tracks, accessed through a basement-level tunnel that was reached from the main waiting room by a staircase. The steep roof over the center block had several dormers, {{some of which were}} later removed. A covered ramp from the west wing, which had <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> from the south platform, led to a small trolley station on Glenwood Avenue.|$|E
50|$|The {{address bus}} was 16-bits wide {{in the initial}} {{implementation}} and later extended to 24-bits wide.

5|$|The {{station was}} {{proposed}} by the North London Railway (NLR). The line originally opened as the East & West India Docks & Birmingham Junction Railway in 1850, in order to transport freight between the London and Birmingham Railway and the London Docklands. By the time it had been renamed to the NLR in 1853, passenger traffic had grown in equal importance, so {{it was decided to}} build a station with <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> to the City.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} methods of {{accessing}} messages on devices: directly, indirectly, and with specialized access devices. <b>Direct</b> <b>access</b> methods involve physical {{contact with the}} system, by using a keyboard or a touch screen. Users accessing SGDs indirectly and through specialized devices must manipulate an object in order to access the system, such as maneuvering a joystick, head mouse, optical head pointer, light pointer, infrared pointer, or switch access scanner.|$|E
5|$|Through the mid-2000s, EVA Air's {{route network}} was {{affected}} by the political status of Taiwan, which has historically limited access for Taiwanese airlines to Europe and certain Asian countries. Because Taiwanese carriers did not have <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> to China, EVA Air has used Hong Kong, Bangkok and Macau as interline destinations. EVA Air operated regular charter flights to China in 2008. The airline began regularly scheduled, direct cross-strait operations in December 2008, following the restoration of direct travel links.|$|E
