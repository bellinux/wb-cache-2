40|$|Objective—Earlier age at {{menopause}} onset {{has been}} associated with increased all cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality risks. Risk of <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> at menopause associated with primary and secondary tobacco smoke exposure was assessed. Design—Cross-sectional study using a nationally representative sample of US women. Methods— 7596 women participants (representing an estimated 79 million US women) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III were asked: time since last menstrual period, occupation, and tobacco use (including home and workplace secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure). Blood cotinine and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were assessed. Logistic regressions for the odds of <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> at menopause, stratified on race/ethnicity in women 25 - 50 years and adjusted for survey design, were controlled for age, BMI, education, tobacco smoke exposure, and occupation. Results—Among 5029 US women ≥ 25 years with complete data, <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> at menopause was found among all smokers, and among service and manufacturing industry sector workers. Among women age 25 - 50 years, there was an increased risk of <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> at menopause with both primary smoking and with SHS exposure, particularly among Black women. Conclusions—Primary tobacco use and SHS exposure were associated with an increased odds of <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> at menopause in a representative sample of US women. <b>Earlier</b> <b>age</b> at menopause was found for some women worker groups with greater potential occupational SHS exposure. Thus, control of SHS exposures in the workplace may decrease the risk of mortality and morbidity associated with <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> at menopause in US women workers...|$|R

The formulations which can be used as guidance for planning <b>early</b> <b>aged</b> performing art are as follows: 1) Searching out and excavating creative ideas; determining themes; finding out innovations 2) Determining inspiring ideas, determining the dancing style based on the child’s character. 3) Exploring the studio process through which creative and move inspiring ideas are poured out, making various performing possibilities such as where to face, moving around, moving backward and forward, alternating, volume, dynamics, composition applying various aspects of composition in group design, pattern arrangement: performing design, making the performing structure complete.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} scanning electron microscope-backscattered electron (SEM-BSE) {{image analysis}} was used to evaluate capillary porosity and pore size distributions in high-strength concretes at <b>early</b> <b>ages.</b> The Powers model for the hydration of cement was applied to the interpretation of the results of image analysis. The image analysis revealed that pore size distributions in concretes with an extremely low water/binder ratio of 0. 25 at <b>early</b> <b>ages</b> were discontinuous in the range of finer capillary pores. However, silica-fume-containing concretes with a water/binder ratio of 0. 25 had larger amounts of fine pores than did concretes without silica fume. The presence of larger amounts of fine capillary pores in the concretes with silica fume may be responsible for greater autogenous shrinkage in the silica-fume-containing concretes at <b>early</b> <b>ages...</b>|$|R
