40|$|Experimental {{autoimmune}} encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disorder {{widely used}} {{as a model for}} hu-man multiple sclerosis (MS). In this issue of The <b>Journal,</b> <b>Cross</b> et al. (1) describe the successful treatment of murine EAE using a soluble form of the T cell activation molecule, CTLA- 4. To-gether with two other recent studies (2, 3), this demonstrates a crucial role of the CD 28 /CTLA- 4 :B 7 receptor system in EAE and suggests potential therapies for human MS. Role of CD 28 in T cell activation The interactions ofT lymphocytes with antigen-presenting cells (APC) lead to T cell activation crucial for immunity to foreign pathogens, transplanted organs, or to self tissue during autoim-mune disease. T lymphocyte activation by interaction with APC is consistent with a two signal model (4). The specificity of T cel/APC interactions (signal one) is provided by the recognitio...|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} implementation of a curriculum reform effort is not without considerable barriers. To be effective, change efforts need more than the development of materials and procedures. They require attention to and involvement {{of the people who}} administer these changes. Knowledge of the barriers they may face in their efforts to implement change facilitates the adoption of those changes. The research question guiding this study was: What are the perceived barriers to change encountered by family and consumer sciences teachers involved in a curriculum reform effort? In order to obtain in-depth personal accounts of change experiences and barriers encountered, fifty-three teachers involved in a curriculum reform effort kept a journal of their reactions and feelings regarding change. Chronological case data analysis was used to identify themes, trends and significance in individual teachers 2 ̆ 7 <b>journals.</b> <b>Cross</b> case data analysis was conducted to compare findings between individual teachers.;Patterns, similarities, and differences were identified. Four categories of barriers emerged from the analysis: resources, readiness, beliefs/attitudes, and professional. Resources barriers included: knowledge, time, financial resources and alternative approaches. The barrier of readiness involved personal costs, commitment, professional growth and collaboration, empowerment and administrative support. Beliefs/Attitudes about the value of the innovative program and perceptions of self-efficacy determined teachers 2 ̆ 7 receptivity to changes in the curriculum and were often a barrier. Professional barriers to change included lack of clarity as to the specifics of change in family and consumer sciences as well as lack of professionalism amongst the professionals. The results of this study contribute current data to the knowledge base of program development for family and consumer sciences education, enhance teacher preparation and provide a basis for designing more effective staff development programs...|$|R

The defintive version is available at: [URL] adjustment has been a prominent theme in international management research. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of adjustment have rarely been investigated. This paper addresses the issue by introducing a conceptual framework, which integrates the theoretical notion of adjustment ‘modes’ used in expatriation research with empirical descriptions of adjustment behaviours from the literature on intercultural management. The paper further reports on a qualitative, in-depth study of German expatriates in the People’s Republic of China. Participants detailed the differences they perceived in the new environment, as well as ways of adjusting to them. These included changes of expatriates’ norms of interaction, the implemention of new working methods in the Chinese workplace, and the acquisition of new living habits. Perceived environmental conditions and adjustment behaviours were contingent upon a number of factors, such as education and job level of Chinese colleagues. Conclusions are drawn and implications for organisational practice and future research are made...|$|R
50|$|Changes to {{the diesel}} engined models saw the 2,495 cc Td5 (in-line direct-injected straight-five engine) introduced, {{in line with}} the updated Defender models. This {{electronically}} managed engine was smoother, producing more usable torque at lower revs than its 300Tdi predecessor. The Td5 engine is often mistakenly attributed to BMW; it was derived from the Rover L-series passenger car engine and further developed by Land Rover. The 3,948 cc V8 petrol version from the Discovery 1 was replaced with the Range Rover P38 Thor 4.0-litre Rover-derived V8. There was no actual increase in capacity over the previous 3.9-litre engine. Although the basic design of the engine was similar, it was actually quite different internally: it used a different crankshaft, had larger bearing <b>journals</b> with <b>cross</b> bolted caps, different con rods, and different pistons. The blocks were machined differently, to accept extra sensors for the Gems and Bosch (Thor) injection system and to allow the extra stroke of the 4.6 crankshaft. For the 2003 and 2004 model year Discovery II they changed to the 4.6-litre V8 (though the 4.0 continued as the only V8 option offered in the UK). ACE (Active Cornering Enhancement, an electronically controlled hydraulic anti-roll bar system) was fitted to some versions, which reduced cornering roll. Self-levelling air springs were fitted to some models and European type-approval for seven-seat vehicles was only given to air-sprung examples.|$|R
