50|$|Relays {{are used}} {{wherever}} {{it is necessary to}} control a high power or <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> with a low power circuit, especially when galvanic isolation is desirable. The first application of relays was in long telegraph lines, where the weak signal received at an intermediate station could control a contact, regenerating the signal for further transmission. High-voltage or high-current devices can be controlled with small, low voltage wiring and pilots switches. Operators can be isolated from the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit.</b> Low power devices such as microprocessors can drive relays to control electrical loads beyond their direct drive capability. In an automobile, a starter relay allows the high current of the cranking motor to be controlled with small wiring and contacts in the ignition key.|$|E
50|$|Around the 1970s {{the primary}} breaker points were largely {{replaced}} with a Hall effect sensor or optical sensor. As this is a non-contacting device and the ignition coil is controlled by solid state electronics, {{a great amount of}} maintenance in point adjustment and replacement was eliminated. This also eliminates any problem with breaker follower or cam wear, and by eliminating a side load it extends distributor shaft bearing life. The remaining secondary (<b>high</b> <b>voltage)</b> <b>circuit</b> stayed essentially the same, using an ignition coil and a rotary distributor.|$|E
50|$|Before World War II Latécoère was a {{prolific}} aircraft manufacturer, particularly known for large flying boats. Post-war they produced many projects but no new designs were built and flown for almost 40 years. By the mid-1950s they had diversified, {{with a wide}} range of technical products, many with their own Latécoère type number. Some of these numbers duplicated those of earlier aircraft, for example the Latécoère 300 was an early 1930s flying boat but a 1960s <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker. Just one of their diversifications produced an aircraft; the Latécoère 225 ultralight shares its number with a post-war four engine bomber project.|$|E

If the <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> is de-energized, but if lower-voltage circuits connected remain energized, the <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> will remain energized.

With the distance between the wells varying, the lateral bipolar effect is illustrated.

5000|$|Shunts {{are rated}} by maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500 A, 75 mV shunt {{would have a}} {{resistance}} of 0.15 milliohms, a maximum allowable current of 500 amps and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 millivolts. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50 mV, 75 mV or 100 mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100 mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, {{at which point the}} derating factor must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly. At 80 °C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120 °C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140 °C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to annealing resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. [...] If the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself. Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg (grounded side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit.</b> Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are Hall effect current sensors and current transformers (see clamp meters). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common accuracy of such devices are ±0.1% & 0.25% and 0.5%.|$|E

40|$|The cost {{of several}} circuit {{configurations}} for large (5 MW) array fields were investigated {{to assess the}} relative costs of <b>high</b> and low <b>voltage</b> configurations. Three source <b>circuit</b> NOC <b>voltages</b> were evaluated: 400 V (ungrounded), 800 V (+ or 400 V center grounded), and 2000 V (+ or - 1000 V center grounded). Four source circuit configurations were considered {{for each of the}} three NOC voltages. The configurations correspond to source circuit currents of 15, 30, 45, and 60 amperes, respectively. Conceptual layouts for 5 MW building blocks for each of the above configurations were developed. The designs were optimized to minimize BOS electrical and structural costs. Only the BOS electrical costs were evaluated. The designs were broken down into the following elements for cost: (1) basic source circuit intermodule wiring, bypass diodes and associated hardware, source circuit to J-Box wiring, etc; (2) J-Box blocking diodes, varistors, heat sinks, and housing; (3) disconnects source circuit disconnects, fuses, and housing; (4) bus cabling J-Box to PCU interface wiring, and trenching; (5) interface bus bar, group disconnects, and fuses; and (6) fault detection shunts, signal wire, electronics, and alarm.
