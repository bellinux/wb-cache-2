In addition, synthetic HAp powders are frequently used in medical and chemical applications. Insights into the ultrastructural alterations of skeletal hard tissues exposed to thermal treatment are {{crucial for the}} estimation of temperature of exposure in forensic and archaeological studies. However, at present, only limited data exist on the heat-induced structural alterations of human <b>dental</b> <b>tissues.</b> In this paper, advanced non-destructive small- and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) synchrotron techniques were used to investigate the in situ ultrastructural alterations in thermally treated human <b>dental</b> <b>tissues</b> and synthetic HAp powders. The crystallographic properties were probed by WAXS, whereas HAp grain size distribution changes were evaluated by SAXS. The results demonstrate {{the important role of}} the organic matrix that binds together the HAp crystallites in responding to heat exposure. This is highlighted by the difference in the thermal behaviour between human <b>dental</b> <b>tissues</b> and synthetic HAp powders. The X-ray analysis results are supported by thermogravimetric analysis. The results concerning the HAp crystalline architecture in natural and synthetic HAp powders provide a reliable basis for deducing the heating history for <b>dental</b> <b>tissues</b> in the forensic and archaeological context, and the foundation for further development and optimization of biomimetic material design...|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{morphology}} of the hypsodont tooth is {{suited to}} a more abrasive diet, hypsodonty was thought to have evolved concurrently with the spread of grasslands.

50|$|Calculus {{formation}} in animals is less well studied than in humans, {{but it is}} known to form {{in a wide range}} of species. Domestic pets, such as dogs and cats, frequently accumulate large calculus deposits. Animals with highly abrasive diets, such as ruminants and equids, rarely form thick deposits and instead tend to form thin calculus deposits that often have a metallic or opalescent sheen. In animals, calculus should not be confused with crown cementum, a layer of calcified <b>dental</b> <b>tissue</b> that encases the enamel crown and is gradually worn away through abrasion.|$|E
50|$|Different {{protocols}} {{are used}} {{depending on the}} field and the period. On present teeth, classical histological methods are often used and require decalcification of the <b>dental</b> <b>tissue</b> and staining protocol for collagen. In archaeology where collagen can be poorly preserved, tooth root is embedded in an epoxy resin and dried in a vacuum chamber. On human teeth, the crown and the upper third of the root are removed. 100-μm, non-decalcified cross sections are prepared from the middle third of the root using a Low Speed Saw fitted with a diamond-coated blade. The polishing of both faces can be performed to remove cutting marks. Each slice is washed and sections are mounted on slides. Observations are conducted using an optical microscope at ×400 magnification. Segments that showed readable cementum layers are captured with a digital camera and readings are performed on selected segments.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This {{study used}} three lasers (red, green and blue) with a {{spectrophotometer}} {{to compare the}} light propagation [Absorption (A), Transmittance (T), Attenuation (K) and Scattering Anisotropy Coefficient (g) ] in <b>dental</b> <b>tissues</b> and nano filled resin based composite using three incremental build-up techniques: one shade (Body), two shades (Enamel and Dentin), and three shades (Enamel, Transparent and Dentin). Methods: Twenty un-erupted recently extracted human 3 rd molars (shade: B 1) were used to obtain 40 tooth slabs (1. 5 mm thickness x 4 mm length). The samples were randomized and equally distributed into four experimental groups: Positive Control (<b>Dental</b> <b>Tissues</b> – enamel, dentino- enamel-junction and dentin), Technique 1 (T 1 = 1 shade, B 1 B), Technique 2 (T 2 = 2 shades, A 2 Dentin/B 1 Enamel), and Technique 3 (T 3 = 3 shades, A 2 Dentin/Transparent/B 1 Enamel). One calibrated operator performed all procedures and tests. Cavity preparation was standardized using a # 58 carbide bur. Using the spectrophotometer, each specimen was irradiated by the three LASERs. A Voltmeter recorded the light output signal and from this raw data the following optical constants were calculated: absorption (A), transmittance (T), attenuation coefficient (K) and Scattering Anisotropy Coefficient (g). The {{data were analyzed using}} One-way ANOVA, followed by the post-hoc Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s test. All tests utilized a significance level of 0. 05. Results: Regarding absorption and transmittance, <b>dental</b> <b>tissues</b> were significantly different compared to the three build-up techniques for all lasers. Regarding the attenuation coefficient, <b>dental</b> <b>tissues</b> were not significantly different for T 2 and T 3 for the blue and red lasers, however they were significantly different for the green laser. There was no significant difference among the three lasers for T 2 and T 3. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, none of the build-up techniques used was able to reproduce the <b>dental</b> <b>tissues</b> optical properties and Technique 2 (2 shades) and Technique 3 (3 shades) resulted in a similar pattern of light propagation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduce: Loss of hard <b>dental</b> <b>tissues</b> from noncarios {{etiology}} is multifactorial irreversible process, {{occur as}} a result of chemical and physical factors. These disorders are associated with the terms of abrasion, erosion and atricion - functional disorders. The severity of the defects can significantly depending on the predominant etiologic factor. These disorders rarely occur individually and in isolation, often in the same patient observed several forms of loss of hard <b>dental</b> <b>tissues,</b> which are mutually combined. Aim: In this theme we set a purpose about solving combined functional disorders at an advanced stage. Case report: For the realization of our purpose, we had a 43 years old patient with advanced stage of combined functional disorders. The patient had impaired aesthetics and difficulty mastication. At the same patient was suggested high aesthetic restauration, with porcelain crowns. Final result is achievement of normal occlusion, articulation and satisfactory esthetics by setting porcelain crowns on teeth with combined functional impairments. Conclusion: Thanks to the developed aesthetic restoration, except getting aesthetics, we prevent the deepening of the tooth defect and enabled smooth realization of the function of masticator apparatus.

50|$|Since the {{morphology}} of the hypsodont tooth is {{suited to}} a more abrasive diet, hypsodonty was thought to have evolved concurrently with the spread of grasslands. During the Cretaceous Period (145-66 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow inland sea called the Western Interior Seaway which began to recede during the Late Cretaceous to the Paleocene (65-55 million years ago), leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain. During the Miocene and Pliocene epochs (25 million years), the continental climate became favorable {{to the evolution of}} grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new niche for mammals, including many ungulates that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Grass contains silica-rich phytoliths (abrasive granules), which wear away <b>dental</b> <b>tissue</b> more quickly. So the spread of grasslands was linked to the development of high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth in grazers.|$|E
50|$|Decay is {{the process}} or result of {{demineralisation}} (softening) of an area of <b>dental</b> <b>tissue,</b> creating a decayed lesion on the tooth. The process of restoring decay begins with {{an analysis of the}} decayed lesions together with their location and severity, with particular regard to the state of reversibility. Where decay is reversible, it is referred to as non-cavitated decay, where healing is possible by the hardening process of remineralisation. Where a cavity has formed from excessive demineralisation, the decay has reached {{the point of no return}} where the tooth structure has been lost and the decay is permanent and non-reversible. In this situation of cavitated decay, the cavity will have to be filled to restore the tooth. Minimal intervention dentistry is focused on filling only cavitated regions, leaving non-cavitated decay to be remineralised, thus restoring the tooth while removing as little of the tooth structure as possible, enhancing the strength and aesthetics of the restoration. Classifications of the location and severity of decay are made in order to establish guidelines for suitable treatment methods.|$|E

40|$|High-resolution {{studies of}} <b>dental</b> <b>tissues</b> are of {{considerable}} interest for biomedical engineering and clinical applications. In this paper, we demonstrate {{the application of}} piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to nanoscale imaging of internal structure of human teeth by monitoring the local mechanical response to an electrical bias applied via a conductive tip. It is shown that PFM is capable of detecting dissimilar components of <b>dental</b> <b>tissues,</b> namely, proteins and calcified matrix, which have resembling morphology but different piezoelectric properties. It is demonstrated that collagen fibrils revealed in chemically treated intertubular dentin exhibit high piezoelectric activity and can be visualized in PFM with spatial resolution of 10 nm.

Furthermore, it is found that the peritubular dentin and intertubular dentin exhibit different piezoelectric behavior suggesting different concentration of collagen fibrils. The obtained results demonstrate a high potential of PFM in providing an additional insight into the structure of <b>dental</b> <b>tissues.</b> It is suggested that the PFM approach can be used to study the structure {{of a wide range of}} biological materials by monitoring their electromechanical behavior at the nanoscale...|$|R
