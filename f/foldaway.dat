25|$|In the 1950s, most railroads {{took the}} cue from circuses and started loading their own flatcars in this manner. But, loading even {{up to six}} {{automobiles}} onto one flat car left {{a large amount of}} space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flatcars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flatcar, <b>foldaway</b> bridges were added {{to the ends of the}} flatcar decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Such flatcars eliminated the need for specialized equipment to load and unload boxcar racks. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. Navy {{attempted}} {{to launch a}} German V-2 rocket at seaone test launch from the aircraft carrier USS Midway was performed on 6 September 1947 {{as part of the}} Navy's Operation Sandy. The test launch was a partial success; the V-2 went off the pad but splashed down in the ocean only some [...] from the carrier. The launch setup on the Midway's deck is notable in that it used <b>foldaway</b> arms to prevent the missile from falling over. The arms pulled away just after the engine ignited, releasing the missile. The setup may look similar to the R-7 launch procedure {{but in the case of}} the R-7 the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket, rather than just reacting to side forces.|$|E
2500|$|The second-generation Marlin did {{not have}} its own catalog, but was {{described}} within the large Ambassador sales brochure. The Ambassador's standard features and options also came on the Marlin. The interiors continued to offer premium materials and fittings, including wood-grain trim, and {{were the same as}} on the Ambassador 990 and DPL two-door hardtop models (with the exception of the [...] "Custom" [...] package that had two matching pillows) that [...] "rival more expensive cars for luxury and quality, yet are durable enough to take years of normal wear." [...] Many Marlins were ordered with the reclining buckets seats that not only featured a center armrest between them (with a center cushion for a third occupant or a floor console with gear selector), but also a <b>foldaway</b> center armrest for the rear seat. The interior design was new and featured a safety-oriented dashboard with the instruments and controls grouped in front of the driver, {{while the rest of the}} dash was pushed forward and away from the passengers. Protruding knobs and controls were eliminated from any area that the passenger or driver could strike them. The steering wheel was smaller than used before and the column was now designed to collapse under impact. A new lane change feature was made standard for the turn signal.|$|E

It also improves accuracy, because it reduces the force needed to pull the trigger.|$|E
5000|$|The station came {{equipped}} with a shower, a standing sleeping station, {{as well as a}} <b>foldaway</b> bed. The floor was covered with Velcro to assist the cosmonauts moving around the station. Some entertainment on the station included a magnetic chess set, a small library, and a cassette deck with some audio cassette tapes. Exercise equipment included a treadmill and Pingvin exercise suit. [...] The first water-recycling facilities were tested on the station; the system was called Priboy.|$|E
50|$|The fashionably stream-lined {{body was}} {{available}} as a two-door “Limousine” (sedan/saloon) priced in 1934 at 2,650 Marks. Also offered was a four-door “six-light” limousine. A “Cabrio-Limousine” with a <b>foldaway</b> roof-hood was available with either two or four doors. Buyers preferring {{to make their own}} arrangements could select an Opel 1.3-litre in “base-chassis” form for 2,150 Marks. The listed prices increased by 200 Marks in 1935, which was consistent with the continuing period of inflation experienced by the German economy in 1934.|$|E
50|$|This flat wagon, {{built from}} 1928, was longer and, at 40 tons, {{also had a}} higher maximum load than its Verbandsbauart {{predecessor}} based on technical drawing A3. The most obvious new feature was the fish belly girder. All wagons had a hand brake. On the welded versions which appeared from 1934 there was an open, <b>foldaway</b> brakeman's platform instead of the brakeman's cab (secondary letter a), {{in order to be}} able to transport longer loads over the ends of the wagon.|$|E
50|$|Boeing {{offered a}} gravel runway kit for early 737s {{that allows the}} plane to be used from {{unimproved}} and gravel runways, in spite of having very low-slung engines. This kit included gravel deflectors on the landing gear; <b>foldaway</b> lights {{on the bottom of}} the plane; and screens that prevented gravel, entering the open wheelwells when the gear was extended, from hitting critical components. It also included vortex dissipators, devices that would reduce the airflow into the engine from the bottom so as to reduce the likelihood of ingesting gravel.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinctive}} XEvo {{element is}} its boot, a large understeat storage space with 56 L capacity, {{enough for two}} full-face helmets or objects up to 80 cm long, and the remote style key that separately opens {{the front and rear}} storage compartments. The storage compartment also has a <b>foldaway</b> seat cover and a courtesy light. The front shield area, besides the odometer, trip computer and tachometer, provides further space to place small items and is also equipped with a 12 volt plug to use a GPS, or recharge a mobile phone.|$|E
50|$|The Colorale Prairie {{was by far}} {{the best-selling}} Colorale. Featuring a six-light (three side windows on each side) body, it was a 4-door family car able to {{accommodate}} 6 people and offering a generous cargo area: with the rear seat folded down, the Prairie provided nearly three cubic meters of load space. Externally similar to the Prairie was a taxi version which featured a central row of rear-facing <b>foldaway</b> seats after the manner of a standard London taxi in the later twentieth century, but this had disappeared from the model listings by 1952.|$|E

Beardowear holds several patents for this beardhat design {{as well as}} other original products in Canada, USA, the UK and European Union. Beardo Beard hats and their other products are currently sold through their online store and are also available through several retailers, specialty outlets and other online stores. In June 2011, Beardowear was featured in the Globe and Mail Newspaper [...] which lists the company {{as one of the top}} twelve quintessentially Canadian small businesses.|$|E
50|$|Lenslok was {{released}} in 1985 as a plastic lens in a <b>foldaway</b> frame. The Lenslok device was essentially a row of prisms arranged vertically in a plastic holder. Before the game started, a two-letter code was displayed on the screen, but it was corrupted by being split into vertical bands which were then rearranged on screen. By viewing these bands through the Lenslok they were restored to their correct order and the code could be read and entered allowing access to the game. The device was small enough when folded flat to fit next to an audio cassette in a standard case.|$|E
50|$|All {{ballpoint pen}} knives come with {{straight}} blades, which {{are easier to}} conceal than curved blades. These 2 to 5 in blades are fixed to the topmost part of the pen, hidden inside a hollow cap, serving as both the pen's end and the knife's sheath. Common blades may be the single-edged thrusting type or the double-edged stiletto type. Blades can be razor-sharp or deeply serrated {{for use in a}} range of situations. Swiss Army Spectrum Series released their S.A.S.S. Ballpoints, which look and function like regular ballpoint pens. They come with an array of <b>foldaway</b> blades and tools including knife, scissors, file, opener, screwdriver and battery-powered light.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{launched}} {{with the usual}} range of bodies. The entry level car was the open-topped two-seater which was priced in 1931 at 2,000 Marks. With price deflation {{a feature of the}} economy at this time, it was possible in 1932 to reduce the manufacturer’s listed price to 1,890 Marks. There were two and four-seater cabriolets which came with a <b>foldaway</b> roof-cover and there was a two-door four-seater “Limousine” (sedan/saloon) retailing for 2,700 Marks in 1931: by 1935,following a more general upgrade for the model in 1934, the price for two door four seater “Limousine” was down to 1,850 Marks, presumably helped by economies of scale resulting from the car’s popularity.|$|E
50|$|The two modules {{are named}} HEM 'C' and HEM 'D'. HEM 'C' is {{designed}} to contain a wardroom arrangement of a viewscreen with a central table for group meetings and conferences with Earth. HEM 'D' would contain improved sleeping and personal work arrangements. HEM 'D' features six separate compartments which each contain a small sleeping area (0.9 x 2 m), a <b>foldaway</b> desk, and {{a small amount of}} space for personal effects and other items. From a personal privacy point of view, it affords each crew member an area where they can close a door and be entirely private {{from the rest of the}} crew, where they can dress and undress, or perform other acts of a personal nature.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1930s some glider {{designers}} {{were beginning}} to think about incorporating an engine, to form a self-launching aircraft. One {{of the first of}} these, the Carden-Baynes Auxiliary flew in 1935. It was very clearly primarily a glider, particularly when its engine and propeller were folded away into the fuselage, an operation possible in flight. [...] The BS.19 Alca of 1936 was closer to a high aspect ratio light aircraft, with no provision of a <b>foldaway</b> propeller.

50|$|Thai {{people who}} live {{naturally}} and self-sufficiently showed their ingenuity, when they got the reed (Ton-aor = ต้นอ้อ) in the forest for sugar skewers and the mould from baked clay. They have to simmer the sugar day by day. Namtarn Paan’s <b>foldaway</b> tool has embers under the tray of sugar since Namtarn Paan’s makers have to sculpt a shape and form it when it is still hot. When it cools down, it will be hard. To create the Namtarn Paan sculpture, makers have to follow the trends like common cartoon characters, dolls or produce for events, such as flowers on Valentine’s Day for teenagers to buy for their lover. The image of Namtarn Paan {{has a lot of}} power to attract children and also bring the old memories of adults to take the Namtarn Paan as a memento.|$|E
5000|$|In 1938 Fiat put on sale a long-wheelbase six-passenger variant, named 508 L. Besides the [...] mm {{extended}} wheelbase (at 2700 mm), other {{differences from}} the 508 C were wider {{wheels and tyres}} (5.50-15 instead of 5.00-15 tyres) and a shorter final drive ratio, which reduced top speed to 95 km/h. The 508 L was sold as a 4-door, 6-window saloon, pillarless and with rear-hinged aft doors like the 508 C, able to carry six passenger thanks to two <b>foldaway</b> seats. Additionally there was a 4-door, 6-window taxi (Tassì) version, which differed in possessing a B-pillar—to which all four doors were hinged—and a partition between the driver and passenger compartments. Indeed, most 508 L saloons saw service as taxis or livery cars. The lengthened 508 L also formed the base for two light commercial vehicles, a van (Italian name 508 L Furgoncino) and a platform lorry (508 L Camioncino).|$|E

[...] The premium materials and fittings included wood-grain trim, and even an optional [...] "Custom" [...] package with special upholstery and two matching pillows. Ambassador DPL hardtops included reclining bucket seats with a center armrest between them (with a center cushion for a third occupant or a floor console with gear selector), {{as well as a}} <b>foldaway</b> center armrest for the rear seat. The new safety-oriented instrument panel grouped all gauges and controls in front of the driver, {{with the rest of the}} dashboard pushed forward and away from the passengers. Focusing on safety, there were now no protruding knobs, the steering column was designed to collapse under impact, and the steering wheel was smaller than previous Ambassadors.|$|E
5000|$|The WC54 was {{designed}} to replace the WC9, WC18 and the WC27 Truck, 1/2 ton, 4×4 Dodge Ambulance (G505).Based on the 3/4 Ton [...] "Beep" [...] Dodge chassis, it featured a longer wheelbase and adjusted suspension to make its ride softer. The closed sheet-metal body was made by Wayne Body works. It had room for a driver and four to seven patients plus a medic. If the fold-away bunk stretchers were used, four patients could be transported lying down.Because of its intended role, the WC54 featured a large matrix cab heater fitted on the firewall, providing comfort for patients and crew. It was fitted with a <b>foldaway</b> step to its rear to allow easier access for stretcher bearers and injured personnel. Early models featured a stuck out fuel filler cap which was changed to a recessed one in the later model, a modification that was retrofitted to some early model trucks.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{develop a}} new {{aircraft}} for their <b>foldaway</b> power plant and propeller experiments, {{it was decided to}} save on time and money by using the wings and tail of a Göppingen Gö 4. A new, steel framed rather than wooden, fuselage was constructed with very similar length and profile to the original. The propulsion unit, when deployed, consisted of a vertical, faired column carrying a pusher propeller with its hub about 700 mm (2 ft 3 in) above the fuselage, so the tips just cleared the structure. The column was pivoted just inside the fuselage with the engine at its short lower end. Engine and propeller were connected by a shaft within the column; at its top gears turned the drive-shaft through 90° and reduced the output speed by a factor of 2.3. After a powered climb to altitude, the unit was rotated on its pivot so the propeller fitted into a dorsal slot in the fuselage and the engine lay immediately behind the cockpit bulkhead.|$|E
