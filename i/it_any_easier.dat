500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>easier.</b> When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E

[...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C− and criticized the laziness of the writing, saying, [...] "Maybe I'm missing something here. There {{could be some}} subtext in, um, yeah, I got nothing. The dead rats in the toilet were freaky, right? And they did kill that dog off, so that's hardcore. Really, though, I'm just too disappointed to say much else.

[...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode a scathing review, only awarding it 1/10. He criticized {{the seriousness of the}} plot and wrote, [...] "Overall, this has {{to be one of the}} worst episodes of the series. In nearly every possible way, the episode fails to live up to the usual expectations. Perhaps aware of how silly the whole thing sounds, the cast and crew seem weary of it all from beginning to end. Even some of the bad ideas in the later seasons don’t fall to this level of inadequacy." [...] Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called the Jaguar Spirit one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters" [...] and wrote, [...] "In this fairly ridiculous Season 3 episode, an Ecuadorian artifact possessed by a Jaguar Spirit (or something) causes tabbies to go bonkers and murder people. This scene of Scully fighting a cat deserves the GIF treatment. Make it happen, folks!" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one stars out of five, calling the premise [...] "achingly unambitious". The two roundly criticized the plot, calling it a [...] "retread of a cursed mummy movie without a mummy", as well as the performances of Trevino, Duchovny, and Anderson. Despite the overall negativity, Shearman and Pearson noted that the [...] "much derided" [...] cat sequence was not [...] "that badly handled." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} ‘measurement’ {{and other forms of}} poverty knowledge in a context where the nature and direction of global economic growth is creating ‘surplus populations’ suffering various forms of marginalisation in the global economy. It links the development of different forms of poverty knowledge with the ways in which states and non-state agents seek to ‘govern’ poverty and poor populations, and with the ‘biopolitics’ whereby calculations are made about the differential allocation of resources towards different sectors of the global population. The paper argues that addressing the root causes of poverty requires social actors to go beyond the narrow limits of institutionally sanctioned and bureaucratically invested ‘poverty knowledge’ that currently dominate policy thinking. Rather than seeking to understand poverty by measuring the characteristics of members of populations, they should try to understand poverty as an aspect of social relations, and try {{to come to grips with}} differential insertion of populations in the fields of force of modern globalised capitalism. Analysis should abandon simple notions of ‘marginalisation, and come to grips with the agency of poor people and the complex relationships between informality, marginality, exclusion and incorporation. Ultimately, however, a more nuanced understanding of the role of poverty knowledge in present day biopolitics does not bring with <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>easy</b> answers: rather, <b>it</b> challenges applied social scientists to be more aware of the responsibilities they bear as producers of 'useful' knowledge in a time of increased global instability.

40|$|We explore three results {{related to}} {{hardness}} of counting. Interestingly, at their core {{each of these}} results relies on a simple — yet powerful — technique due to Valiant and Vazirani. 1. 1 Hardness of Unique-SAT Does SAT become <b>any</b> <b>easier</b> if we are guaranteed that the formula we are given has at most one solution? Alternately, if we are guaranteed that a given boolean formula has a unique solution does <b>it</b> become <b>any</b> <b>easier</b> to find <b>it?</b> We show here {{that this is not}} likely to be the case. Define the following promise problem: USAT USAT def = {φ: φ has exactly one satisfying assignment} def = {φ: φ is unsatisfiable}. Clearly, this problem is in promise-N P. We show that if it is in promise-P, then N P = RP. We begin with a lemma about pairwise-independent hashing. Lemma 1 Let S ⊆ { 0, 1 } n be an arbitrary set with 2 m ≤ |S | ≤ 2 m+ 1, and let Hn,m+ 2 be a family of pairwise-independent hash functions mapping { 0, 1 } n to { 0, 1 } m+ 2. Then Pr [there is a unique x ∈ S with h(x) = 0 h∈Hn,m+ 2 m+ 2] ≥ 1 / 8. Proof Let 0 def = 0 m+ 2, and let p def = 2 −(m+ 2). Let N be the random variable (over choice of random h ∈ Hn,m+ 2) denoting the number of x ∈ S for which h(x) = 0. Using the inclusion/exclusion principle, we have Pr[N ≥ 1] ≥ ∑ Pr[h(x) = 0]...|$|R

6000|$|He {{lay awake}} a long time; and his slumbers, when they came, were {{unsatisfactory}} and short. The morning light had no joy for his eyes. He listened dismally to the {{movements in the}} house. The Chinamen were unlocking and flinging wide {{the doors of the}} public rooms which opened on the veranda. Horrors! Another poisoned day to get through somehow! The recollection of his resolve made him feel actually sick for a moment. First of all the lordly, abandoned attitudes of Mr. Jones disconcerted him. Then there was his contemptuous silence. Mr. Jones never addressed himself to Schomberg with any general remarks, never opened his lips to him unless to say [...] "Good morning"--two simple words which, uttered by that man, seemed a mockery of a threatening character. And, lastly, it was not a frank physical fear he inspired--for as to that, even a cornered rat will fight--but a superstitious shrinking awe, something like an invincible repugnance to seek speech with a wicked ghost.

40|$|This study focuses upon a bout {{of racial}} killing that {{occurred}} on the South African Witwatersrand during a while miners' strike in 1922. By demonstrating {{that most of the}} racial victims of the strikers and their supporters were not African miners, or Africans working with the police to suppress the strike, <b>it</b> argues against <b>any</b> <b>easy</b> explanation of the racial killings in narrow terms of class conflict. A more complex account is then offered, one that relies upon close attention {{to the nature of the}} victims, the liming and location of the killings, as well as to the rumours that accompanied them. In essence, the article proposes that the murders are to be understood as part of a (subconsciously impelled) process by which many in the striking communities sought to reconstitute the white racial community then sundered by acute class antagonisms. This attempt was made as the strike rolled towards civil war, and on the basis of a putative 'black peril'. Set in a comparative frame, the article closes by reflecting upon the importance in the murders of white workers' sense that their identity had been destabilized by changes in and outside the workplace. © 1999 Cambridge University Press...|$|R

After getting the touchdown from their running back, the Browns scored again on a slant rout to their receiver once again burning the Falcons secondary...going up 14-0. The Falcons could only manage to score a field goal before the half, but not before a wacky play of laterals on the Falcons half failing to find the endzone. But they did manage to get a drive going scoring a touchdown to Michael Jenkins diving in the endzone, it seemed that the Falcons would make a stand. However, the Falcons did not get a call for a safety, and on the next drive the Browns scored another field goal. With a chance to go for the winning touchdown on the two-minute offense thanks to Roddy White's leaping catch, the Falcons threaten deep inside Browns territory. But soon a weary Michael Vick, unable to find open receivers tried to make the play for himself and scrambled, but he held the ball loosely like in the lions game. Without a guy hitting him, he fumbled the ball bouncing twice into his chest, but then popped loose to the Browns ending their chance for a victory as the team fell to 5-4.|$|R
