5|$|Telopea 'Olympic Flame' is a {{form with}} {{prominent}} bracts around the flowerheads.

5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or big red, is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>spring</b> soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>early</b> <b>spring</b> AD 15, Germanicus {{crossed the}} Rhine and struck the Chatti. He sacked their capital Mattium (modern Maden near Gudensberg), pillaged their countryside, then {{returned}} to the Rhine. Sometime this year, he received word from Segestes, who was held prisoner by Arminius' forces and needed help. Germanicus' troops released Segestes and took his pregnant daughter, Arminius' wife Thusnelda, into captivity. Again he marched back victorious and at the direction of Tiberius, accepted the title of Imperator.|$|E

5|$|Bajkam {{opened a}} {{campaign}} against al-Baridi <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>spring</b> 941. His lieutenants were at first defeated by the Baridis, whereupon Bajkam himself left Wasit to take the field. On his way to join his army, however, he was informed that his generals had achieved a major victory over the Baridis, and {{decided to return to}} Wasit. On 21 April 941, while travelling, he took part in a hunting excursion, during which he and his party inadvertently encountered a band of Kurdish brigands. During a brief skirmish, Bajkam was slain when one of the Kurds stabbed him in the back with his lance.|$|E
5|$|Near Benton, Fishing Creek's pH {{ranges from}} around 5.6 to 7.25, while near Bloomsburg, {{a wider range}} has been recorded, from 5.8 to 8.5. Near Camp Lavigne, it ranges from 5.5 to 7.1. East Branch Fishing Creek is the only stream in the {{watershed}} whose pH drops below 5.5; it can fall as low as 4.9. West Creek and Coles Creek are the least acidic streams in the watershed, with pH levels usually above 6.3 and often above 7. Typically, the creek and its tributaries are not at risk of becoming too acidic for the optimal health of fish, but <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>spring</b> during snowmelts, the levels approach the limit that brook trout can tolerate. Fishing Creek's waters are acidic because of acid rain.|$|E
5|$|Urnula craterium is {{a species}} of cup fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. It is {{parasitic}} on oak and various other hardwood species; it is also saprobic, as the fruit bodies develop on dead wood after it has fallen to the ground. Appearing <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>spring,</b> its distinctive goblet-shaped and dark-colored fruit bodies have earned it the common names devil's urn and the gray urn. The distribution of U.craterium includes eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. It produces bioactive compounds that can inhibit the growth of other fungi. The asexual (imperfect), or conidial stage of U.craterium is a plant pathogen known as Conoplea globosa, which causes a canker disease of oak and several other hardwood tree species.|$|E

5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>spring</b> the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the siege}} of Berat {{continued}} through the winter of 1280/1281. By early December, the Angevin forces had seized a number of outlying forts around the city and penetrated its suburbs. Charles, however, remained anxious to take the city before the Byzantine relief force arrived. He ordered his governors in Albania to direct all their resources towards the siege, and displayed his close interest {{by a series of}} letters to Sully, instructing him to take the city by assault if necessary. The Byzantine force advanced cautiously, and arrived in the area <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>spring</b> 1281. The megas domestikos Tarchaneiotes avoided a direct confrontation and relied on ambushes and raids instead. He also managed to resupply the besieged fortress with provisions, which were loaded onto rafts and then left to float down the river Osum which flows by the citadel.|$|E
5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>spring,</b> {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E
