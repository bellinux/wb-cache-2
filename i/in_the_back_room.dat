He is voiced by Jason Marsden.|$|R
50|$|Segni {{was also}} a {{professor}} of law at University of Sassari. Straightforward, witty and courteous, Segni was more at ease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom or the law court than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> of Italian politics. He died on 1 December 1972, <b>in</b> Rome. <b>The</b> frail, often ailing Segni, was affectionately called malato di ferro—"the invalid with the iron constitution".|$|R
5|$|While {{active as}} a runner, Nurmi {{was known to}} be secretive about his {{training}} methods. Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him. Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him. After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden. However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games. In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki. It became a popular tourist attraction, and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi. The Finn spent his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> running another new business venture; construction. As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each. Within five years, he was rated a millionaire. His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price. Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.|$|E

25|$|Banbury {{played an}} {{important}} part in the English Civil War as a base of operations for Oliver Cromwell, who is reputed to have planned the Battle of Edge Hill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> (which can still be visited) of a local inn, the Reindeer Inn as it was then known (today's Ye Olde Reine Deer Inn). The town was pro-Parliamentarian, but the castle was manned by a Royalist garrison who supported King Charles I. In 1645 during the Civil War, Parliamentary troops were billeted in nearby Hanwell for nine weeks and villagers petitioned the Warwickshire Committee of Accounts to pay for feeding them.|$|E
25|$|Giosue's elder brother, Gennaro Gallucci, {{was shot}} dead on November 14, 1909, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> of the family bakery. The assassin entered the bakery and yelled for Gennaro. When he appeared, he {{was shot and killed}} immediately. His {{activities}} as a collector of protection payments had caught the attention of the authorities earlier, and he had to leave New York City for a while. Gennaro arrived in New York from Italy in December 1908, having escaped from prison after serving 23 years of a life sentence for murdering two men. He lived on East 109th Street with his brother, Giosuè, and sister-in-law, Assunta. Soon after his arrival, the police began receiving complaints about extortion practices, but when the plaintiffs were told that they had to confront him in court, they dropped the charges.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1830s, the Paris police counted 271 wandering street musicians, 220 saltimbanques, 106 players of the barbary organ, and 135 itinerant street singers. The goguettes , or working class singing-clubs, continued to grow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> popularity, meeting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> of cabarets. <b>The</b> repertoire of popular songs ranged from romantic to comic and satirical, to political and revolutionary, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1840s. <b>in</b> June, 1848, <b>the</b> musical clubs were banned from meeting, as the government tried, without success, to stop the political unrest, which finally exploded into the 1848 French Revolution.|$|R

500|$|During D'Amato's tenure, the 500 Club began {{attracting}} top-name talent. It {{opened at}} 5 p.m. and closed at 10 a.m. The last show was at 4 a.m., while illegal gaming at [...] "roulette wheels, craps tables, baccarat and high-stakes card games" [...] went on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>The</b> door to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> was beyond <b>the</b> main showroom and was guarded by a doorman; it opened on D'Amato's nod or word. D'Amato shut down <b>the</b> illegal casino <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1950s <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake {{of pressure on}} organized crime exerted by <b>the</b> Kefauver Committee <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate and expanded the supper club aspect.

25|$|If {{a filling}} station allows {{customers}} to pay at the register, {{the data from}} the dispensers may be transmitted via RS232, RS485 or Ethernet to the point of sale, usually inside the filling station's building, and fed into the station's cash register operating system. The cash register system gives a limited control over the fuel dispenser, and is usually limited to allowing the clerks to turn the pumps on and off. A separate system is used to monitor the fuel tank's status and quantities of fuel. With sensors directly in the fuel tank, the data is fed to a terminal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> where it can be downloaded or printed out. Sometimes this method is bypassed, with the fuel tank data transmitted directly into an external database.|$|E
25|$|The next evening, Zack is {{preparing}} to film a scene between Stacey and another actor, Lester, {{that was supposed to}} have been with Lester and Miri. Zack is dismayed when Miri shows up and insists on shooting the scene as originally planned. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> an incredulous Zack asks if she is doing this as a form of retaliation, pointing out that Stacey told him that Miri did not mind her sleeping with Zack. Miri corrects him, clarifying that she did not mind that Stacey merely made the offer to sleep with him. Perceiving this to have been some type of test, Zack admits that during the sex scene they filmed together, they were actually making love and that there was an emotional connection between them, and that he loves Miri. When Miri does not reciprocate, Zack storms out of the coffee shop, quitting the film and his job, and moves out of the apartment.|$|E
25|$|Bogan {{was placed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> {{of a local}} saloon, as there was no jail at the time, but before his shotgun wound had healed, {{the next day in}} fact, he took {{advantage}} of the poor security and made an escape during a roaring blizzard. Owens, knowing that Bogan was badly wounded, believed he could not go far. He was right, as two weeks later Bogan, burning up with fever and with his wound infected, sent word to Owens that he wished to surrender and receive medical attention. Bogan met with Owens sixteen miles outside of Lusk, and voiced to Owens that he feared a lynch mob would be waiting for him when they reached Lusk, as Gunn was extremely well liked and respected in the town. As they entered town, Owens backed down a mob that was intent on hanging Bogan, then Owens shackled Bogan {{in the back of the}} Sweeney Saloon. The next day, Owens left with Bogan en route to Cheyenne, Wyoming, and by February 4 he had him secured in the Laramie County jail.|$|E

5000|$|With growing {{political}} tensions at home, Caesar needs a voice {{within the}} Senate, and Mark Antony is not above accepting {{the gift of}} a bought office. Escorting the new [...] "Tribune of the People" [...] to Rome, Vorenus and Pullo {{return to their homes}} for <b>the</b> first time <b>in</b> years: Vorenus to his family, and Pullo to his vices. Atia rewards those who return her lost son to her. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> of Rome powerful men strike bargains to strip Caesar of his growing power, and in growing political tensions of Rome the actions of the basest of men will shake the foundations of the city.|$|R

It discharged when the hammer hit the floor. [...] "The ball passed through his coat, struck the north wall then glanced off and passed out through the ceiling."

When asked by Nolot if these activities are financed by organized crime, Slim hesitates, then says no.|$|E

Truby also had [...]45 caliber bullet wounds in his back, indicating that somebody else had shot him during the shootout.|$|E

When I came back to journalism, I realised that the experience I'd had <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> of politics was like gold for me—in terms of being able to understand and second guess what was really going on behind that sort of opaque screen that the political processes, the processes of government throw up." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> {{addition}} to <b>the</b> gift basket shop Sinito opened in Beachwood, Ohio, he also co-owned the Appliance Mart {{with his brother}} Chuck. The Appliance Mart was a business front for the Cleveland family. The mart, which opened in 1972, had two locations, one in Euclid, Ohio and <b>the</b> other <b>in</b> Bedford, Ohio on Northfield Road. The Bedford store soon became a major base of operations for Sinito, from which he regularly met with Lonardo and other mobsters, discussed various illegal activities, short term as well as long term criminal plots, schemes and scams, and operated various illegal activities. Detailed plans for drug trafficking, conspiracies to kill police informers and other violent measures were conceived and acted on from meetings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> of Appliance Mart.|$|R
500|$|Although Kennedy was an {{accomplished}} legislator, {{his personal life}} was troubled during this time. His weight fluctuated wildly, he drank heavily at times– although not when it would interfere with his Senate duties– and his cheeks became blotchy. Kennedy later acknowledged, [...] "I {{went through a lot}} of difficult times over a period in my life where [...] may have been somewhat of a factor or force." [...] He chased women frequently, and also was in a series of more serious romantic relationships but did not want to commit to anything long-term. He often caroused with fellow Senator Chris Dodd; twice in 1985 they were in drunken incidents in Washington restaurants, with one involving unwelcome physical contact with a waitress. In 1987, Kennedy and a young female lobbyist were surprised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> of a restaurant in a state of partial undress.|$|E
500|$|In early 1932 she met George Smith, {{who lived}} {{across from the}} {{hospital}} where she worked, and to which he delivered milk every morning.

Smith started courting Mimi, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference. Stanley would only allow the couple to sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> at Newcastle Road when he or his wife were in the front room, and before it grew too late he would burst into the back room and loudly order Smith home. The courtship lasted almost seven years, but Smith grew tired of waiting.

500|$|When {{other girls}} were {{thinking}} of marriage, Mimi Stanley talked of challenges and adventures.

She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital, to which Smith delivered milk every morning. Smith started seriously courting Mimi in the spring of 1932, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference.
