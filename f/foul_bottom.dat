"The disgust of Landgraf Wilhelm was infinite; who, honest man, saw in {{all this}} merely an {{artifice}} of Carteret's, To undo the Kaiser with his French Allies, to quirk {{him out of his}} poor help from the French, and have him at their mercy. 'Shame on it!' cried Landgraf Wilhelm aloud, and many others less aloud, Klinggraf and King Friedrich among them: 'What a Carteret!' The Landgraf turned away with indignation from perfidious England; and began forming quite opposite connections. 'You shall not even have my hired 6,000, you perfidious! Thing done with such dexterity of art, too!' thought the Landgraf,--and continued to think, till evidence turned up, after many months. [CARTERET PAPERS (in British Museum), Additional MSS.

The Captain and Caraccioli were for stretching {{over to the}} African, and the others for the New-England Coast, alledging, that the Ship had a <b>foul</b> <b>Bottom,</b> and was not fit for the Voyage; and that if they met with contrary Winds, and bad Weather, their Stock of Provision might fall short; and that as they were {{not far from the}} English Settlement of Carolina, they might either on that or the Coast of Virginia, Maryland, Pensylvania, New-York, or New-England, intercept ships which traded to the Islands with Provisions, and by that Means provide themselves with Bread, Flower, and other Necessaries. An Account of the Provisions were taken, and finding they had Provisions for four Months. Captain Misson called all Hands upon Deck, and told them, as the Council differed in the Course they should steer, he thought it reasonable to have it put to the Vote of the whole Company. That for his Part, he was for going to the Coast of Guiney, where they might reasonably expect to meet with valuable Prizes; but should they fail in their Expectation one Way, they would be sure of having it answered another; for they could then throw themselves in that of the East- India Ships, and he need not tell them, that the outward bound dreined Europe of what Money they drew from America. He then gave the Sentiments of those who were against him, and their Reasons, and begg'd that every one would give his Opinion and Vote according as he thought most conducive to the Good of all. That he should be far from taking it ill if they should reject what he had proposed, since he had no private Views to serve. The Majority of Votes fell on the Captain's Side, and they accordingly shaped their Course for the Coast of Guiney, in which Voyage nothing remarkable happened.

In order to seek a paint suitable for "the Nagasaki-maru" which had been at anchor {{for a long time in}} Nagasaki Harbor where the ship's bottom is liable to be fouled by attaching organisms, the authors painted the bottom in seven kinds of paint in seven sections and obtained some data from the experiment at her docking after 134 days. Some studies on these results are reported here. 1) The species of the <b>bottom</b> <b>fouling</b> animals most abundant in Nagasaki Harbor from February to June was Hydroides norvegica, as shown by the results of the practical tests on the ship's bottom: 99. 8 % of Hydroides norvegica and 0. 2 % of Balanus amphitrite communis. The predominant bottom foulers are generally believed to be Balanus, and the contradictory result of the present experiment to this may be due to the environmental condition of Nagasaki Harbor, 2) The most suitable bottom paint for anti-fouling in Nagasaki Harbor was a combination of copper poison and mercury. A mixture of copper poison and organic poison proved to be unsuited for the antifouling bottom paint. The mixing rates of mercury and of modified rosin varnish relating to the leaching rate of the poison are left as problems for a future study. 3) In order to control the leaching rate of the poison which is influential in the anti-fouling properties of the paints, the ship's bottom should be coated with a thick layer of the paint suitable for her mother port or with a combination of the paint with some other paints of different ingredients having a property of anti-sea-water-defacement, according to the sailing plan from the time of docking. Thus, the <b>bottom</b> <b>fouling</b> will be prevented for a long time. 4) In parallel with the study to keep the <b>bottom</b> from <b>fouling</b> for a long time by selecting the suitable paint for the harbor and controlling the leaching rate of the poison, the preventive of propeller fouling must be devised﻿ 5) Based on the facts obtained from these experiments, furthe tests on sectional painting of the bottom, and studies on the larvae of attaching animals, which are important factors of the <b>bottom</b> <b>fouling,</b> are being carried out. ﻿(1) 長崎港内に於て, 2 月より 6 月までの間に,船底汚損生物は,カサネカンザシが大部分であり,実船試験による結果は,カサネカンザシ 99. 8 %フジツボ 0. 2 %であった. 一般に船底汚損生物にはフジツボが多いと云われて居るが,これは長崎港の環境条件によるものと思われる.

In the present work, measurements of heat transfer performance and thermophysical properties of Al 2 O 3 –H 2 O nanofluids, with nanoparticle concentration within the range of 0. 01 – 0. 12 vol. %, are compared to those for pure DI water that serves as a benchmark. The natural convective chamber induces thermal instability in the vertical direction in the test medium by heating the medium from below and cooling it from above. Fixed heat flux at the bottom hot plate and constant temperature at the top cold plate are the imposed boundary conditions. The Al 2 O 3 –H 2 O nanofluid is tested under different boundary conditions and various nanoparticle concentrations until steady state conditions are reached. It is found that while the Rayleigh number, Ra, increases with increasing nanoparticle concentration, the convective heat transfer coefficient and Nusselt number, Nu, decrease. This finding implies that the addition of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles deteriorates the heat transfer performance due to natural convection of the base fluid, mainly due to poor nanofluid stability. Also, as the nanoparticle concentration increases the temperature at the heating plate increases, suggesting <b>fouling</b> at the <b>bottom</b> surface; a stationary thin layer structure of nanoparticles and liquid seems to be formed close to the heating plate that is qualitatively observed to increase in thickness as the nanoparticle concentration increases. This layer structure imposes additional thermal insulation in the system and thus appears to be responsible in a big extend for the reported heat transfer degradation. Also, for relatively high nanoparticle concentrations of 0. 06 and 0. 12 vol. %, as the heating flux increases the rate of heat transfer deterioration increases. Specifically in the case of maximum nanoparticle concentration, 0. 12 vol. %, when the turbulence intensity increases, by increasing the applied heat flux, the Nusselt number remains constant in comparison with lower nanoparticle concentrations. This behavior can be attributed mainly to the physical properties of the Al 2 O 3 nanopowder used in this study and the resulting interactions between the heating plate and the nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|Niro {{designed}} and built five near-identical milk evaporators for Fonterra’s production site at Clandeboye and five at the Edendale site. Tubes in the Clandeboye evaporators often fouled excessively and occasionally blocked, requiring water blasting to clear them. Large amounts of undesirable foam from milk were observed in the second effect of some evaporators. This {{was known to be}} related to fouling and early shutdowns. The fouling increased the cleaning chemical and utility usage, and the evaporator downtime. The problems were believed {{to be related to the}} liquid distribution system at the top of the tubes. Evaporator liquid distribution has received relatively little research but it has been shown that the efficiency of evaporation reduces when there is poor wetting. Some estimates were available from previous work for the minimum flowrates required to obtain a complete falling film inside a tube. Many tasks were performed to assess the performance of the liquid distribution systems. The minimum wetting rates of three different milks were found in a model evaporator tube under isothermal, heat transfer and evaporation conditions at 60 ºC. Numerous measurements of evaporators at Clandeboye were made to thoroughly analyse the evaporator performance. The overall heat transfer coefficients and wetting rates were calculated throughout the evaporators. Physical measurements were taken of the dimensions of the distribution systems in every evaporator. Many potential problems were found including warping, inconsistent hole sizes and fabrication faults. An analysis of the tube and distribution hole arrangements showed that every pass had some liquid misdistribution which was confirmed by a water trial. The evaporators were inspected before cleaning after 22 hours of whole milk production and after 5 hours of milk protein concentrate (MPC) production. There was considerable <b>fouling</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of some tubes that received low whole milk flows and large particles of MPC were blocking distribution plate holes. Observation and analysis showed that the foaming was likely to be caused by an upward flow of vapour from some passes which disrupted the downward flow of milk. As a result of this project there is sufficient confidence to justify modification of effects 2 and 4 of the evaporators. Sixteen tubes in effect 4 will be welded shut and the distribution systems in effects 2 and 4 will be redesigned to give a better liquid distribution. For effect 2, vertical tubes called ‘vapour risers’ should be installed to allow the vapour to flow upwards through the distribution plate without creating foam. The heights of the partitions dividing the effect 2 passes will be modified to encourage any foam in pass 1 to flow preferentially to pass 2. Installing a filter after the MPC direct steam injector will reduce the number of blocked distribution plate holes. Both modifications are expected to enable the evaporators to run continuously for 20 hours instead of 15 hours, giving up to 33 % fewer cleans. The cleaning costs are approximately $ 700 and milk losses are approximately $ 200 per clean. The modifications should save up to $ 438, 000, based on cleaning and water blasting in the 2003 - 2004 milk powder season. The design of future evaporator distribution systems must be improved to avoid retrofitting...|$|R
