5|$|According {{to a story}} {{published}} in Century magazine in September 1898, Edwin Emerson, Jr., was {{pretending to be a}} German journalist. He presented himself to the German Consul in St. Thomas and asked for the names of Puerto Ricans of German descent whom he could interview. Among the names which the consul gave him were that of the Riefkohl family of the town of Maunabo. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met 14-year-old Rudolph W. Riefkohl and asked the lad in German <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> map of Puerto Rico (Emerson had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, however it was decidedly too big for Emerson's use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that Emerson was a spy, and quickly drew another with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. Emerson used the map and it is believed by some that he may have given the map to the U.S. Army Commanding General, Nelson A. Miles, influencing Mile's decision on the landing points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A photostatic copy of Riefkohl's map was {{published in}} the Century article.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a private-values buyer-seller problem with multiple objects. Valuations are binary, i. i. d., and {{such that the}} problem does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> trivial solution. We characterize mechanisms that span the Pareto frontier. These <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very simple form: Call the seller "good " <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> low valuation and "bad " <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> high valuation. Call the buyer "good " <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> high valuation and "bad " <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> low valuation. For each object, if both say "bad" — there is no trade. If both say "good " — they trade. If agent j says "bad " and the other says "good", they trade only {{if the number of}} good objects in j’s announcement is above a certain threshold (at the threshold itself they trade with probability between 0 and 1). The thresholds depend on the weights given to each agent in the designer’s objective function: as she leans more towards one of the agents, his trading threshold weakly decreases, and the rival’s weakly increases. ∗We thank Eddie Dekel, Matt Jackson, Nadav Levy and semimar participants at Tel Aviv University for helpful comments and discussions. 1...|$|R

25|$|Social Credit {{was below}} the 12 seats needed for {{official}} party {{status in the}} House of Commons. However, the six seats {{would have been just}} enough to give Clark's government a majority had the Progressive Conservatives formed a coalition government with Social Credit, or had the two parties otherwise agreed to work together. Clark managed to lure Socred MP Richard Janelle to the government caucus, but this still left the Tories five seats short of a majority. Clark however decided that he would govern as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> majority, and refused to grant the small Socred official party status, form a coalition, or co-operate with the party in any way.|$|E
25|$|Ceballos {{then brought}} a section 1983 claim in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserting that his {{supervisors}} violated the First Amendment by retaliating against {{him for his}} memo. His supervisors claimed {{that there was no}} retaliation, that the changes in his job were instead dictated by legitimate staffing concerns, and that regardless, Ceballos’ memo was not constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment. The District Court granted their motion for summary judgment, concluding that because Ceballos wrote his memo pursuant to the duties of his employment, he was not entitled to First Amendment protection for the memo’s contents. In the alternative, it ruled that even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> protected speech right in this context, the right was not clearly established and so qualified immunity applied to his supervisors' actions.|$|E

In the thirteenth century, the husband of the eldest daughter inherited the Earldom automatically; in the fifteenth century, the Earldom reverted to the Crown, who might regrant it (often to the eldest son-in-law); in the seventeenth century, it wouldn't be inherited by anybody unless {{all but one of the}} daughters died and left no descendants, in which case the remaining daughter (or her heir) would inherit.|$|E

25|$|Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives {{formed a}} {{minority}} government after the 1979 federal election. The Socreds had just enough seats {{to give the}} Tories {{a majority in the}} House of Commons. However, Clark declared that he would govern as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> majority and refused to grant the small Social Credit caucus the official party status it wanted or make concessions to the party in order to gain its votes. Clark convinced one Socred MP, Richard Janelle from Lotbinière, to cross the floor and join the government caucus. In December 1979, the remaining five members of the Social Credit caucus demanded that the Conservatives amend their budget to allocate the controversial gas tax revenues to Quebec. Clark refused and the Socreds abstained in a vote on a Motion of non-confidence, which, along with several Conservative party members not being able to attend the vote, caused the government to fall.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1898, as a young 14-year-old, Riefkohl was {{involved}} in a curious encounter with an American spy {{on the eve of the}} Spanish–American War. As recounted by the spy, Edwin Emerson, Jr. in Century magazine in September 1898, Emerson, who was pretending to be a German journalist, had been given Riefkohl's father's name by the German consul in St. Thomas. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met young Rudolph and asked the lad in German <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> map of Puerto Rico (Emerson had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, but it was decidedly too big for Emerson's use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that Emerson was a spy, and quickly drew another map with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. It is believed that Emerson gave Riefkohl's map to another spy, Lieutenant Henry Howard Whitney, who posed as a British crew member in the furnace-room of the merchant ship, and that Whitney gave the map to General Nelson A. Miles, thereby influencing the general's decision as to the disembarkation points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A Photostat copy of Riefkohl's map was published in the Century article. After the war Riefkohl moved to the United States and concluded his secondary education in Concord, Massachusetts, serving as a cadet in the Sixth Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteers, the same regiment that saw service in the southern areas of Puerto Rico in 1898 during the Puerto Rico Campaign. In 1910, Riefkohl earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT).|$|E
