25|$|It is {{generally}} held that every Jew {{is bound to}} observe the mitzvot (commandments of Judaism) by following the customs appropriate to <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> origin: see Minhag. For this reason a number of rabbis disapprove of the adoption of Nusach Sefard by Ashkenazi Jews.|$|E
25|$|The monarchy {{comprises}} the reigning monarch, <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family,</b> and the royal household organization which supports and facilitates the monarch {{in the exercise}} of his duties and prerogatives. The Spanish monarchy is represented by King Felipe VI, his wife Queen Letizia, and their daughters Leonor, Princess of Asturias, and Infanta Sofía.|$|E
25|$|India has {{legislation}} since 1986 {{which allows}} work by children in non-hazardous industry. In 2013, the Punjab and Haryana High Court gave a landmark order that directed that there shall {{be a total}} ban on the employment of children up {{to the age of}} 14 years, be it hazardous or non-hazardous industries. However, the Court ruled that a child can work with <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> in family based trades/occupations, for the purpose of learning a new trade/craftsmanship or vocation.|$|E
50|$|International {{marriages are}} subject to {{separate}} rules within Japan. Foreigners in Japan do not have their own family registration sheet, and therefore those who marry a Japanese national are listed on <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> sheet. Foreign spouses in Japan are eligible for a long-term dependent visa.|$|R
50|$|For skaters {{from the}} United States and Canada, {{it is more}} typical to see a skater look back to <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> country of origin. In {{previous}} years, this meant looking back towards Europe, but, more and more, skaters from the United States are looking south towards Puerto Rico and Mexico for countries to represent.|$|R
5000|$|In both cum manu and sine manu {{marriage}}s, if {{both the}} husband and wife were alieni iuris (persons under patria potestas, that is, under the power of <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> pater familias) the marriage could only take place with the approval of both of the patres familias. However, the creation and termination of the marriage somewhat depended on the type of marriage.|$|R
25|$|However, {{in spite}} of the enthusiasm for EBP over the last decade or two, some authors have redefined EBP in ways that contradict, or at least add other factors to, the {{original}} emphasis on empirical research foundations. For example, EBP may be defined as treatment choices based not only on outcome research but also on practice wisdom (the experience of the clinician) and on family values (the preferences and assumptions of a client and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> or subculture).|$|E
25|$|Given the benign {{nature of}} the {{condition}} and the low seizure frequency, treatment is often unnecessary. If treatment is warranted or preferred by the child and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family,</b> antiepileptic drugs can usually control the seizures easily. Carbamazepine is {{the most frequently used}} first-line drug, but many other antiepileptic drugs, including valproate, phenytoin, gabapentin, levetiracetam and sultiame have been found effective as well. Bedtime dosing is advised by some. Treatment can be short and drugs can almost certainly be discontinued after two years without seizures and with normal EEG findings, perhaps even earlier.|$|E
25|$|Images of {{the reigning}} monarch and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> have also {{traditionally}} been printed on Canadian postage stamps since 1851, when Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert, were shown on 12- and 6-pence stamps, respectively, for mail in the Province of Canada. Stamps previously issued in other British North American colonies showed images of crowns and, {{into the late}} 1800s, bore some variation of the Queen's cypher. Starting in 1939, {{when she was still}} Princess Elizabeth of York, Queen Elizabeth II has been depicted in 59 successive stamp designs in Canada, continuing on to the Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamps released in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|During a {{greeting}} ritual, {{the person who}} has entered the contact answers a series of questions about <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> whole <b>family,</b> from the person who was already there. The answer is sewa, which means that everything is fine. Then the Dogon who has entered the contact repeats the ritual, asking the resident how <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> whole <b>family</b> is. Because the word sewa is so commonly repeated throughout a Dogon village, neighboring peoples have dubbed the Dogon the sewa people.|$|R
5000|$|A home’s {{nutritional}} gatekeeper {{usually has}} the biggest food {{influence in the}} nutrition life of most people. They are the biggest food influence {{in the lives of}} their children {{as well as in the}} life of their spouse or partner. Regardless of the gatekeeper’s sex or age and regardless of whether they are a great cook or whether they are [...] "culinarily challenged", the gatekeeper has a huge day-to-day influence on <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family’s</b> nutrition.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, many courses {{used for}} these Thanksgiving events are run at major {{certified}} USA Track and Field road race distances between 5,000 and 42,195 meters. Some organizations hold their turkey trots the week prior to Thanksgiving {{in order to}} provide festive holiday meals to homeless and low-income families in their community. Turkey trots range in size from just a few dozen runners to tens of thousands. Most turkey trots benefit local charities. First prize for winning turkey trots is often an actual frozen turkey that the winner can use for <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> Thanksgiving feast.|$|R
25|$|To {{discourage}} Poles {{from giving}} shelter to Jews, the Germans often searched houses and introduced ruthless penalties. Poland {{was the only}} occupied country during World War II where the Nazis formally imposed {{the death penalty for}} anybody found sheltering and helping Jews. The penalty applied not only to the person who did the helping, but also extended to <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family,</b> neighbors and sometimes to entire villages. In this way Germans applied the principle of collective responsibility whose purpose was to encourage neighbors to inform on each other in order to avoid punishment. The nature of these policies was widely known and visibly publicized by the Nazis who sought to terrorize the Polish population.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Marxist-Leninist government in the country had a significant influence on the average Russian's economic ability to maintain <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family.</b> Because of the large population of bears in Russia and an increasing demand for bear parts, especially bile, poaching of bears became increasingly popular. Its main trade partners in bear parts are primarily nearby Asian countries like South Korea and the People's Republic of China. Poaching of the snow leopard is also a serious problem in Russia along with Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, People’s Republic of China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The situation for antelopes has deteriorated significantly since the {{collapse of}} the Soviet system. There has been increase in poaching of the saiga antelope which reduced the saiga population in the country.|$|E
25|$|For {{military}} {{ranks of}} colonel and above, recommendations for {{appointment to the}} Order of Military Merit are made by a commanding officer or military advisory committee to the Chief of the Defence Staff, who then forwards the name or names to the governor general; per the Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces, neither the nominee, nor any member of <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family,</b> can be notified or otherwise made aware {{that they have been}} suggested for induction into the order. Nominations are processed by the Advisory Committee for the Order of Military Merit, which {{is a part of the}} Chancellery of Honours at Rideau Hall, and has six members: one appointed by the governor general, four by the Chief of the Defence Staff, and the Chief of the Defence Staff him or herself; the Secretary to the Governor General serves as the Secretary General of the Order of Military Merit.|$|E
2500|$|A further new {{option is}} hyphenation. In our example, {{the family name}} [...] or [...] will be {{introduced}} for one or both parties. A sole party not assuming the hyphenated form keeps <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> original <b>family</b> name.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "plenary {{adoption}}" [...] distinguishes it {{from the}} other form of adoption practised in France, simple adoption, which allows some of the legal bonds between an adopted child and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> birth <b>family</b> to remain.|$|R
50|$|Simple {{adoption}} (adoption simple) {{is a type}} {{of adoption}} which allows some of the legal bonds between an adopted child and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> birth <b>family</b> to remain. It is formalized under articles 343 and following of the French Civil Code.|$|R
25|$|Official duties {{involve the}} {{sovereign}} representing the state {{at home or}} abroad, or other Royal Family members participating in a government-organised ceremony either in Australia or elsewhere. The sovereign and/or <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> have participated in events such as various centennials and bicentennials; Australia Day; the openings of Olympic and other games; award ceremonies; D-Day commemorations; anniversaries of the monarch's accession; and the like. Other royals have participated in Australian ceremonies or undertaken duties abroad, such as Prince Charles at the Anzac Day ceremonies at Gallipoli, or when the Queen, Prince Charles, and Princess Anne participated in Australian ceremonies for the anniversary of D-Day in France in 2004. On 22 February 2009, Princess Anne represented the Queen at the National Bushfires Memorial Service in Melbourne. The Queen also showed her support {{for the people of}} Australia by making a personal statement about the bushfires and by also making a private donation to the Australian Red Cross Appeal. The Duke of Edinburgh was the first to sign a book of condolences at the Australian High Commission in London.|$|E

Since 2002, when the first fallen Canadian soldiers were repatriated from Afghanistan, crowds have lined the overpasses to [...] as convoys pass.|$|E
500|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{developed}} a legal system that applied throughout the territories he ruled. [...] He {{was the first}} Merina king to establish formal civil and penal codes, the latter ameliorated and transcribed by his son Radama. He declared twelve crimes to be capital offenses, while many others entailed collective punishment for the guilty party and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> members including forced labor in chains and being reduced to slave status. These harsh penalties were intended {{to act as a}} strong disincentive to engage in antisocial acts; the consumption of alcohol, marijuana and tobacco were also outlawed, although they remained prevalent. To judge infractions of his laws, the king often relied on the tradition of tangena, whereby surviving the ingestion of poison indicated an accused person's innocence.|$|E
50|$|Between one {{and three}} people are chosen every month by the organization. Nominations can {{originate}} from the person's own application, <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> friends, <b>family</b> members <b>or</b> medical caretakers. Applicants must also currently be under treatment and suffering hair loss due to treatments.|$|R

2500|$|The koseki {{simultaneously}} {{fills the}} function of birth certificates, death certificates, marriage licenses, and the census in other countries. It is based on family rather than each individual. For married couples, only one family name may appear on the koseki, which means that one person has to abandon <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> name {{when he or she}} marries. Usually it is the woman. On December 15, 2015, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Japan's Supreme Court upheld a legal provision forcing married couples to use the same surname. Plaintiffs had argued that the legal provision amounts to [...] "de facto discrimination against women." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{a member}} of the Imperial family becomes a noble or a commoner, the emperor gives him or her a family name. In medieval era, a family name [...] "Minamoto" [...] was often used. In modern era, princely family names are used. For example, many members of the {{extended}} Imperial family became commoners after World War II, and adopted their princely family names, minus the honorific [...] "no-miya" [...] ( [...] "Prince"), as regular surnames. Conversely, at the time that a noble or a commoner become {{a member of}} the Imperial family, such as through marriage, <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> name is lost. An example is Empress Michiko, whose name was Michiko Shōda before she married prince Akihito.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{generally}} held—even by Luria, the AriZal, himself—that every Jew {{is bound to}} observe the mitzvot (commandments of Judaism) by following the customs appropriate to <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> origin: see Minhag. Originally, Luria taught that twelve gates of prayer exist, {{one for each of}} the 12 tribes of Israel, hence twelve nusachs for Jewish prayer ("nasachot ha-tefillah") emanated accordingly. In alteration of this concept, especially in 18th/19th-century Hassidism the claim emerged that a superior Nusach Sefard would reach a believed [...] "thirteenth gate" [...] (Shaar ha-Kollel) in Heaven. Almost naturally Nusach Sefard, with its variant Nusach Ari, became predominant among the various sects of Hasidic Judaism. For this reason, a number of [...] non-Hasidic rabbis (see Mitnagdim) disapprove of the adoption of these different rather recent 18th/19th-century devised customs by Ashkenazi Jews.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the article}} [...] "Family System Characteristics, Parental Behaviors, and Adolescent Life Satisfaction" [...] by Carolyn S. Henry, {{adolescent}} life satisfaction has much different origins than the life satisfaction of adults. An adolescent's life satisfaction is {{heavily influenced by}} <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> dynamic and characteristics. Family bonding, family flexibility, parental support are all huge factors into the adolescent's life satisfaction. The more bonding, flexibility, and support there is within a family the higher the adolescent's life satisfaction. Results of this study also revealed that adolescents living in a single-parent family home had significantly lower life satisfaction that adolescents in a two-parent home. An adolescent's age is extremely {{important in terms of}} life satisfaction coming from their family (Henry).|$|R

2500|$|Indonesians {{comprise}} {{more than}} 300 ethnic groups. Not {{all of these}} groups traditionally have surnames, and in the populous Java surnames are not common at all – [...] regardless of {{which one of the}} six officially recognized religions the name carrier profess. For instance, a Christian Javanese woman named Agnes Mega Rosalin has three forenames and no surname. [...] "Agnes" [...] is her Christian name, but [...] "Mega" [...] can be the first name she use and the name which she is addressed with. [...] "Rosalin" [...] is only a middle name. Nonetheless, Indonesians are well aware of the custom of family names, which is known as marga or fam, and such names have become a specific kind of identifier. People can tell what a person's heritage is by <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> or clan name.|$|E
2500|$|NPs {{may serve}} as a patient's primary {{healthcare}} provider, and they may treat patients of all ages depending upon their specialty. With commensurate education and experience, NPs may specialize in areas such as cardiology, dermatology, oncology, pain management, surgical services, orthopedics, women's health, and other specialties. The core philosophy of the nurse practitioner role is individualized care that focuses on a patient's medical issues as well as the effects of illness on the life of a patient and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family.</b> NPs tend to concentrate on a holistic approach to patient care, and they emphasize health promotion, patient education/counseling, and disease prevention. [...] The main classifications of nurse practitioners are: adult (ANP); acute care (ACNP); gerontological (GNP); family (FNP); pediatric (PNP); neonatal (NNP); and psychiatric-mental health (PMHNP). Adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioner (AGPCNP) is a classification that has recently evolved.|$|E
2500|$|The {{review of}} the Bail Act 2013 by John Hatzistergos {{investigated}} whether the risk management approach adequately reduced {{the risk that the}} accused would endanger others' safety, commit a serious offence while on bail, interfere with witnesses in their case, or not attend court; whether the Act was balanced in looking after the safety of the community as well as the rights of the accused; and looking at bail decisions. The review found that the two-stage test as to whether a risk was 'unacceptable' but could be mitigated through bail conditions was confusing to the public, and recommended that the test be altered so that an 'unacceptable risk' was defined as a risk that would preclude granting bail. It recommended adding the following reasons to the 'unacceptable risk' test: the criminal connections of the accused, the views of the victim or the victim's family (for serious offences and where known), and the conduct of the accused toward the victim and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> after the event. The review noted that there was little guidance as to what constituted a serious offence. Reforms to the Bail Act passed parliament in September 2014. The burden of proof was placed on people accused of [...] "the most serious crimes" [...] to show why they should be released on bail. The amendment incorporated all the recommendations of the review.|$|E
5000|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} by {{mental health professionals}} about the effects on the emotional health and development of returning veterans' infants and children, due to the increased rates of interpersonal violence, posttraumatic stress, depression, and substance abuse that have been reported among these veterans. [...] Moreover, the stressful effects of physical casualties and loss pose enormous stress for the primary caregiver that can adversely affect <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>his</b> parenting, {{as well as the}} couple's children directly. The mental health needs of military families in the aftermath of combat exposure and other war-related trauma have been thought likely to be inadequately addressed by the military health system that separates mental health care of the returning soldier from <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> care, the latter of whom is generally covered under a contracted, civilian managed-care system.|$|R
