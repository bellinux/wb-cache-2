5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or <b>do,</b> <b>just</b> think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's {{distribution}} {{arrangements were}} {{an essential part}} of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK. Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail-order retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through mail-order – but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, an opportunity to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that was provided by W.H. Smith, a venerable book- and magazine-seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unfavorable}} {{developments in}} South Vietnam, North Vietnamese General Tran Van Tra believed North Vietnam and the Viet Cong could still {{win the war}} if they pursued a strategy of attrition. In other words, the Communists would have to fight on {{for as long as}} possible, until the United States recognized that the war was unwinnable and would disengage from the conflict in Vietnam. To achieve that objective at the tactical level, Tra argued that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would have to destroy American military units, and cause as many casualties as possible until they got tired and left. Indeed, towards mid-1967 General Thanh, who had the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Division at his disposal, was out to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that. In June, U.S. military forces in III Corps Tactical Zone began to detect the build-up of Viet Cong troops in northern Phuoc Vinh located War Zone D. To stop a major enemy attack on Phuoc Vinh, Major General John H. Hay—commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division—launched Operation Billings with the objective of trapping three Viet Cong battalions in War Zone D.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the loss}} of the Tapestry {{everything}} seems to be <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> fine in the Ark. Lefar starts helping Bernard satisfy his curiosity about the bees that colonised after the Ark came to be and everything seems to be <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> fine.|$|R

5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E
25|$|Mulling {{over the}} cases, Rebus visits a Catholic church and confesses {{to the priest}} that he has bought a gun. The priest advises him to throw it into the sea. Rebus decides to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that.|$|E
25|$|When Hussey {{was playing}} for Australia A, the Australian reserve team, Allan Border once jokingly {{suggested}} he get match practice by {{staying in the}} nets for a full six hours; surprisingly, Hussey went on to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that.|$|E
60|$|If God be just, he {{must show}} his justice by <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> things.|$|R

30|$|The model {{validation}} can be <b>done</b> <b>just</b> for real device models. Refer to Section 3.2.|$|R
25|$|Warren {{connected}} {{his forces}} before receiving {{a message from}} Meade's chief of staff, Brigadier General and Brevet Major General Alexander S. Webb, to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that. Webb stated that {{it was believed that}} Sheridan was advancing but in fact they were being pushed back by Pickett's force at the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House.|$|E
25|$|Limited range: It {{can move}} (but not jump) {{up to three}} free squares along {{one of the eight}} diagonals and orthogonals. (Q3aK) HOWEVER - sources {{describe}} this piece as 'lion plus lion dog' (aKafavK)- therefore some players <b>do</b> <b>just</b> this - a similar situation to the teaching king 'queen plus lion dog', both sets of move being available - a matter of choice.|$|E
25|$|The {{holdfast}} {{can also}} be used for clamping work {{to the side of the}} bench for jointing. If the legs on your base are not too far under the top, simply bore a hole in the side of the leg and use the holdfast horizontally. A woodworker can <b>do</b> <b>just</b> about anything he needs on a bench with only a planing stop and a holdfast or two.|$|E

60|$|And doubtless Reddy {{would have}} <b>done</b> <b>just</b> that thing {{but for the}} wisdom of sly old Granny.|$|R
25|$|Because {{the courts}} did not {{specifically}} establish abortion as a right, Parliament has leave to legislate on {{this aspect of}} the matter; and in 1989, the Progressive Conservative government attempted to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that. A bill was introduced that would allow abortion only if two doctors certified that the woman's health was in danger. This bill passed the House of Commons but was defeated by a tie vote in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolt of}} Mortimer and the Percys very quickly gives him {{his chance to}} <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that. The high and the low come {{together}} when the Prince makes up {{with his father and}} is given a high command. He vows to fight and kill the rebel Hotspur, and orders Falstaff (who is, after all, a knight) to take charge of a group of foot soldiers and proceed to the battle site at Shrewsbury.|$|E
25|$|By this point, the Arabs {{appeared}} to the Romans as invincible, and thus, could only hinder themselves. Fortunately for Byzantium, the Arabs began to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that. The Caliph Uthman ibn Affan {{was assassinated in}} Medina. As a result, Ali, the Islamic Prophet Muhammed's son-in law was elected as his successor. However, Muawiya, the governor of Syria who led the Arab fleet against Byzantium, was proclaimed Caliph in Syria, as well. Only when Ali was assassinated in 661 did the civil strife end, much to Byzantium's disappointment.|$|E
60|$|And when Mr. Lingnam {{appeared}} half-an-hour {{later with}} the Agent-General for Penfentenyou's Dominion, he <b>did</b> <b>just</b> that.|$|R

25|$|First baseman Dan Johnson {{was signed}} to a $500,000 {{contract}} {{for one year}} on January 11. Johnson, who played the 2009 season in Japan's Central League, {{was regarded as a}} hero for the Rays in the 2008 season for a game-tying solo home run in the 9th inning of a game in early September against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. The Rays, who needed a win that night to keep their division lead over Boston, went on to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that.|$|E
25|$|Some modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} Josephus’s ostensible citations of Menander from a literary-analysis standpoint. The important question {{that they were}} addressing was whether Josephus’s quotations were just that, or were another example of his putting his own ideas and words into someone else’s mouth (pen). Josephus was frequently bold to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> this, notably in cases such as when a general, addressing his troops, provided an opportunity for Josephus to display his own eloquence. However, three lines of evidence indicate {{that this was not}} the case with the texts purporting to come from Menander. The first line of evidence is literary.|$|E
25|$|The Lorentz transformations have a {{mathematical}} property called linearity, since x and t are obtained as linear combinations of x and t, with no higher powers involved. The linearity {{of the transformation}} reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that we tacitly assumed while performing the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere. All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion. Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, {{but there is nothing}} absolute about them. Another observer's conventions will <b>do</b> <b>just</b> as well.|$|E

25|$|Young spiders do not {{generally}} build yellow-colored silk, {{and the young}} Nephila themselves can be easily mistaken for young Orchard Spiders (Leucauge) in general color and shape (both genera sport silver stripes or patches on their abdomens, described in some references {{as a form of}} heat control). The best distinction between Leucauge and Nephila juveniles is web structure: Leucauge tends to build a horizontal orb that is a perfect circle, whereas Nephila build vertical, elliptical orbs that are incomplete (missing the portion of the orb over the hub, the center where the spider sits). Nephila seem to prefer more open habitat such as second-growth scrub or forest edges. Fences or building overhangs often <b>do</b> <b>just</b> as nicely.|$|E
25|$|While Turing's proof {{shows that}} there can be no general method or {{algorithm}} to determine whether algorithms halt, individual instances of that problem may very well be susceptible to attack. Given a specific algorithm, one can often show that it must halt for any input, and in fact computer scientists often <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that as part of a correctness proof. But each proof has to be developed specifically for the algorithm at hand; there is no mechanical, general way to determine whether algorithms on a Turing machine halt. However, there are some heuristics that can be used in an automated fashion to attempt to construct a proof, which succeed frequently on typical programs. This field of research is known as automated termination analysis.|$|E
25|$|In 1863 Bulloch {{contracted}} with the Laird shipyard {{for the construction}} of two ironclad rams to be used against the Union blockade. However, if it could be proven that the contract (or commission) for building these ships was in violation of Britain's neutrality law, the ships could be seized. The Union's minister to Britain, Charles F. Adams, tried to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> that; but he could only gather circumstantial evidence, as Bulloch {{went to great lengths to}} conceal his movements. Adams threatened the British government with reprisal: that if the rams escaped, the United States would consider it an act of war. After further consideration, British authorities seized the two vessels and from that point on kept a close watch on Bulloch and other such propositions made by the Confederate government, forcing C.S.A. officials to turn to the French for future commissions. Following that turn of events Bulloch then commissioned a shipbuilder in France to construct the Stonewall, an other armored ram.|$|E
