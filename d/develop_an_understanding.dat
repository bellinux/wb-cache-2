5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> {{of the techniques}} and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at {{the relationships between the}} masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E

Although the units went off scale after 8.5 seconds at Gifu and 13.5 seconds at Nagoya (probably due to an inundation of large S-waves) the seismograms they produced have been beneficial for seismologists to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of the fault rupture process. The records from the stations at Gifu and Nagoya were especially useful as they were the closest to the fault zone.|$|E

Kennedy's 1961 {{commitment}} to a staffed moon landing {{before the end of}} the decade, the United States, under NASA leadership, launched a series of unstaffed probes to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of the lunar surface in preparation for staffed missions: the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ranger program produced the first close-up pictures; the Lunar Orbiter program produced maps of the entire Moon; the Surveyor program landed its first spacecraft four months after Luna 9. The staffed Apollo program was developed in parallel; after a series of unstaffed and staffed tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit, and spurred on by a potential Soviet lunar flight, in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first staffed mission to lunar orbit. The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the Space Race.|$|E

5|$|Nojpetén fell to a Spanish {{assault on}} 13 March 1697, more than 150 {{years after the}} conquest {{of the rest of}} the Yucatán Peninsula and more than 160 years after the conquest of the Guatemalan Highlands. The lengthy delay in conquering the Petén region was due to a {{combination}} of its geographical remoteness and inhospitality and the fierce reputation of its Maya inhabitants. During this time the Itza used the Yalain as an eastern buffer against Spanish approach from Belize. The lengthy indirect contact between the Itza and the Spanish invaders allowed the Itza to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of Spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over the period of almost two centuries that the Itza were surrounded by European-dominated territories. This understanding distinguished the conquest of Petén from the 16th-century conquests of the Aztecs, Maya and Incas. In contrast, the Spanish had a very poor understanding of the Itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages whose kingdom was protected by Satan from the Christianising efforts of the Spanish Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. From the time that Hernán Cortés crossed Petén in the early 16th century, the Spanish mistakenly believed the king of the Itza (the Aj Kan Ek) was the overlord of the entire central Petén region.|$|E

25|$|Patient {{focus in}} the {{curriculum}} begins on day one, {{in the introduction to}} being a physician course. Students interview patients about their experience of illness and experiences with their physicians, and they visit community settings to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of their roles as medical professionals. Medical interviewing and physical examination courses follow, along with exercises examining the many facets of physician life—in society, ethical settings, and at the patient bedside. Throughout the first two years, students apply their new skills in local practices and hospitals one afternoon per week. The basic science block runs through three-fourths of the first year and provides language and concepts that underlie the scientific basis of medical practice. Organ system block courses integrate physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and patient with concurrent courses in the patient care and patient, physician and society blocks. Weekly discussions, patient interviews, and examination of hospitalized patients reinforce essential clinical skills.|$|E
25|$|Simulations in {{education}} are somewhat like training simulations. They focus on specific tasks. The term 'microworld' {{is used to}} refer to educational simulations which model some abstract concept rather than simulating a realistic object or environment, or in some cases model a real world environment in a simplistic way so as to help a learner <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of the key concepts. Normally, a user can create some sort of construction within the microworld that will behave in a way consistent with the concepts being modeled. Seymour Papert {{was one of the first}} to advocate the value of microworlds, and the Logo programming environment developed by Papert is one of the most famous microworlds. As another example, the Global Challenge Award online STEM learning web site uses microworld simulations to teach science concepts related to global warming and the future of energy. Other projects for simulations {{in education}}s are Open Source Physics, NetSim etc.|$|E

The hook [...] "was designed so explosive force will seal off the non-curved portion of tunnel nearest the detonation before gases and fission fragments can be vented around the curve of the tunnel's hook". This test would become the prototype for larger, more powerful tests. Rainier was announced in advance, so that seismic stations could attempt to record a signal.

[...] The prevailing scientific philosophy in Germany at the time asserted that experiments need not be performed to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of nature because nature is so well ordered, and that scientific truths may be deduced through reasoning alone. [...] Also, Ohm's brother Martin, a mathematician, was battling the German educational system. These factors hindered the acceptance of Ohm's work, and his work did not become widely accepted until the 1840s.
