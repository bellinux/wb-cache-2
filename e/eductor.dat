40|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} {{becoming}} an attractive option for supplying the world with clean and sustainable energy. One of the highlighted issues in utilising the energy from geothermal systems is removal of non-condensable gases (NCGs) from geothermal waters. This paper discusses and reviews existing technologies for removing NCG with emphasis on their energy requirements further the possibility is investigated of using two-phase ejectors (also known as <b>eductors)</b> to remove NCGs from geothermal waters. Energy analysis of isothermal and adiabatic vacuum processes for removing non-condensable gases by an ideal vacuum machine are presented and later compared with the measured performance and with the energy consumption of commercial vacuum pumps and <b>eductors.</b> Advantages of removal of NCG using a passive method employing <b>eductors</b> {{and the prospect of}} improving the efficiency of these devices are also presented. Based on the experimental data, it is shown that <b>eductors</b> offer a sustainable alternative for NCGs removal from geothermal waters...|$|R

50|$|A water <b>eductor</b> {{or water}} dredge is an eductor-jet pump-based tool used by {{underwater}} archaeologists to remove sediments from an underwater archaeological site. Airlifts {{may be used}} for the same purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Eductors {{are used}} in {{aircraft}} fuel systems as transfer pumps; fluid flow from an engine-mounted mechanical pump can be delivered to a fuel tank-mounted <b>eductor</b> to transfer fuel from that tank.|$|E
50|$|Eductors or eductor-jet {{pumps are}} {{an example of}} entrainment. They are used onboard many ships to pump out flooded compartments: {{in the event of}} an accident, {{seawater}} is pumped to the <b>eductor</b> and forced through a jet, and any fluid at the inlet of the <b>eductor</b> is carried along to the outlet and up and out of the compartment. Eductors can pump out whatever can flow through them, including water, oil, and small pieces of wood. Another example is the pump-jet, which is used for marine propulsion. Jet pumps are also used to circulate reactor coolant in several designs of boiling water reactors.|$|E
50|$|Water <b>eductors</b> {{are also}} used by marine {{treasure}} hunters to suck sediments for filtering for buried artifacts. Using the water dredge to directly suck sediments means that archaeological information on context and stratigraphy is not recorded.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Eductors</b> {{are used}} in ships to pump {{residual}} ballast water, or cargo oil which cannot be removed using centrifugal pumps due to loss of suction head and may damage the centrifugal pump if run dry, which may be caused due to trim or list of the ship.|$|R
50|$|The bubbles may be {{generated}} by an impeller, <b>eductors</b> or a sparger. The bubbles {{adhere to the}} suspended matter, causing the suspended matter to float {{to the surface and}} form a froth layer which is then removed by a skimmer. The froth-free water exits the float tank as the clarified effluent from the IGF unit.|$|R

5000|$|These {{technological}} advances {{are projected to}} produce 16% lower fuel consumption. Reliability is also supported by use of an eductor-based oil cooling system {{similar to that of}} the GenX, featuring coolers mounted on the inner lining of the fan duct. According to Aviation Week's article, [...] "The <b>eductor</b> device produces a venturi effect, which ensures a positive pressure to keep oil in the lower internal sump."

40|$|Reverse osmosis {{membranes}} at many {{desalination plants}} are disinfected by periodic shock treatments with sodium metabisulphite, which have potentially toxic effects {{to the environment}} for marine life, although no empirical and experimental evidence for this is yet available. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterise for the first time, the physico-chemical modification of the marine environment and its biological effects, caused by hypersaline plumes during these membrane cleaning treatments. The case study was the Maspalomas II desalination plant, located in the south of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). Toxicity bioassays were performed on marine species characteristic for the infralittoral soft bottoms influenced by the brine plume (Synodus synodus and Cymodocea nodosa), and revealed a high sensitivity to short-term exposure to low sodium metabisulphite concentrations. The corrective measure of incorporating a diffusion system with Venturi <b>Eductors</b> reduced nearly all the areas of influence, virtually eliminating the impact of the disinfectant.

50|$|A venturi siphon, {{also known}} as an <b>eductor,</b> is not a siphon but a form of vacuum pump using the Venturi effect of fast flowing fluids (e.g. air), to produce low {{pressures}} to suction other fluids; a common example is the carburetor. See pressure head. The low pressure at the throat of the venturi is called a siphon when a second fluid is introduced, or an aspirator when the fluid is air, {{this is an example}} of the misconception that air pressure is the operating force for siphons.|$|E
50|$|The tool {{consists}} {{of at least}} two concentric pipes which are forming two hydraulic channels - one for pumping down a high-pressure working agent (water) and second for delivering pregnant slurry back to the surface. A BHM tool usually has (down-up): an <b>eductor</b> (waterjet pump) section, a hydromonitor section, an extension section and a hub, connecting it all to a drill pipe string. This string extends the tool up to the surface. Above the surface, the tool has a swivel allowing its suspension and rotation in a hole, and also connections to the working agent supply (pump station) and a slurry collector. A drill rig is normally required to operate a BHM tool.|$|E
50|$|The impact {{created a}} hole, {{estimated}} at 1 to 2 ft in diameter, in the Terminator’s aft lazarette area (a storage space between decks). The incoming water flooded the shaft alley. The watertight door between the shaft alley and main engine compartment was permanently affixed open. A cutting torch was needed {{before the door}} could be secured. This process took 20 minutes and only slowed the water coming into the engine room. Pumps to de-water the vessel operated only intermittently. There was no <b>eductor</b> (a type of water pump). The aft peak tank and bilge were filled with concrete (presumably for stability) and this extra weight could not be shifted to another area of the vessel from where the vessel was taking on water.|$|E
25|$|Floating wind {{turbines}} {{can be used}} to provide motive power for achieving artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface for enhancing fisheries growth in areas with tropical and temperate weather. Though deep seawater (below 50 metres depth) is rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, the phytoplankton growth is poor due to the absence of sunlight. The most productive ocean fishing grounds are located in cold water seas at high latitudes where natural upwelling of deep sea water occurs due to inverse thermocline temperatures. The electricity generated by the floating wind turbine would be used to drive high–flow and low–head water pumps to draw cold water from below 50 meters water depth and mixed with warm surface water by <b>eductors</b> before releasing into the sea. Mediterranean sea, Black sea, Caspian sea, Red sea, Persian gulf, deep water lakes/reservoirs are suitable for artificial upwelling for enhancing fish catch economically. These units can also be mobile type to utilise the seasonal favourable winds all around the year.|$|R
40|$|NASA's Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) {{program is}} being {{developed}} to meet national needs for civil and commercial space access with goals of reducing the launch costs, increasing the reliability, and reducing the maintenance and operating costs. To this end, NASA is considering an all- electric capability for NGLT vehicles requiring advanced electrical power generation technology at a nominal 20 kW level with peak power capabilities six times the nominal power. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell {{has been identified as}} a viable candidate to supply this electrical power; however, several technology aspects need to be assessed. Electrochem, Inc., under contract to NASA, has developed a breadboard power generator to address these technical issues with the goal of maximizing the system reliability while minimizing the cost and system complexity. This breadboard generator operates with dry hydrogen and oxygen gas using <b>eductors</b> to recirculate the gases eliminating gas humidification and blowers from the system. Except for a coolant pump, the system design incorporates passive components allowing the fuel cell to readily follow a duty cycle profile and that may operate at high 6 : 1 peak power levels for 30 second durations. Performance data of the fuel cell stack along with system performance is presented to highlight the benefits of the fuel cell stack design and system design for NGLT vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The physical, performance, {{and cost}} {{characteristics}} of f i b for recirculating etch baths are discussed. However, {{to choose the}} proper filter for a production operation, knowledge of the etching application and practical experience ate also needed. A complete cleanliness; no particles should appear downstream, and n ideal chemical filter should provide total retention {{and there should be}} no extractables. The filter should behave like an open pipe (i. e., no pressure drop). Its initial cost should be low; it should not degrade or "plug in " the chemical and so should not need to be changed. In real world applications, some of these characteristics are mutually exclusive and tradeoffs must be made. Particle retention and flow rate, for instance, are in contlic ~ the more retentive the fiiter, the lower the flow rate. The desire for low cost conflicts with the high expense of filter materials required to achieve low extractables in aggressive chemical environments. To achieve downstream cleanliness, filters must be manufactured in clean environments and cleaned in postmanufacture pmcesses, which also add to cost. This article examines these issues and describes the testing of filtration devices for recirculated buffered oxide etch (BOE) applications. Here, flow rate and freedom from particles are very important and, due to the high surface tension and low gas solubility of many etch bath formulations, fdter wettability is also signifcant. Figure 1. Recirculation etch bath system. Treated polysulfone Recirculating etch baths BOE solutions are used extensively in silicon processing to remove oxide layers while leaving Si unaffected. A traditional BOE bath consists of 7 :l 40 % ammonium fluoride, 49 % HF [l]. More recent fondations use lower concentrations of ammonium fluoride, which results in an unsaturated solution with lower surface tension [21. Buffered oxide etching is often accomplished in recirculating etch baths (REB) (Fig. 1). Fluid in the tank flows over a weir into the suction of a pump (either a singlestage centrifugal pump or a positive displacement diaphragm pump), through a particle-removing filter, back into the tank through <b>eductors</b> {{in the bottom of the}} tank, and then up past the wafers to complete the loop...|$|R

50|$|The most {{westerly}} of the terminals {{is owned}} by Eni of Italy. It receives gas from two 30-inch pipelines from the Hewett field (27.7 km and 32.8 km long) and a 62 km long 20-inch pipeline from Lancelot 48/17A offshore installation (LAPS complex). A decommissioned 24-inch pipeline formerly delivered gas from the Thames 49/28A offshore installation. Gas and liquid from each pipeline are received and processed separately. After gas and condensate are separated in vessel-type slugcatchers and filter-separators each gas stream is fiscally metered (for tax purposes). The two Hewett field gas streams are combined and increased in pressure through an <b>eductor.</b> The gas stream was formerly treated with amine to remove sulphur compounds, this facility was decommissioned in 2000 when production from the sour Hewett Upper Bunter reservoir was shut-in. The gas is comingled with the LAPS gas then compressed. It was formerly dehydrated using triethylene glycol and underwent hydrocarbon dew point reduction by chilling with propane. Finally it was fiscally metered (for sales) and transferred to the Bacton NTS plant. Formerly the terminal had pentane storage tanks and a truck loading facility. The terminal has two GE 11MW Frame 3 and one GE 3.7MW Frame 1 gas turbines, connected to three centrifugal compressors. In 2011 the Eni Terminal was split by segregating the reception {{and some of the}} compression facilities from the dehydration and dewpoint control plant, the latter was decommissioned. Now after compression the gas is sent to the Perenco site for dehydration and dewpoint control. The separated condensate is also sent to the Perenco site. During late 2013/2014 the redundant processing facilities were removed and now the majority of the Eni site is unused.|$|E

An <b>eductor</b> {{has been used to}} both dilute and transfer a plutonium containing solution between tanks. Eductors have the advantages of simplicity and no moving parts. Reliable control of dilution is important because the geometry of the receiving tank could potentially allow a nuclear criticality. Dilution factor was to have been controlled by the appropriate choice of flow restrictor in the line between the plutonium solution tank and the <b>eductor.</b> However, dilution factors measured for liquid transfers with different flow restrictors showed unexpected trends, causing concern that the process was not well understood.

The existing Indian River Inlet (IRI), Delaware, <b>eductor</b> and a new design (the DRP <b>eductor)</b> were compared to evaluate relative performance to determine what, if any, production differences may exist in routine bypass operations. Background Fixed sand bypass plants {{have been used in}} the United States since the 1930 s (Jones and Mehta 1980), though their designs were based on conventional hydraulic dredge systems (Watts 1962). During the late 1970 s and the 1980 s a limited number of <b>eductor</b> (or jet pump) based bypass plants operated on the U. S. east and Gulf coasts. These plants experienced limited effectiveness, primarily because debris problems reduced production and there were difficulties in deploying and retrieving eductors. In 1986 a large bypass plant was constructed at the Nerang River Entrance in Southport, Queensland, Australia (Clausner 1988). This plant uses 10 eductors spaced at 100 -ft intervals along a pier extending through the surf zone, and has effectively bypassed large quantities of sand (in excess of 500, 000 cu yd/year). However, even in this innovative plant, the operators experienced significant debris problems which often reduced production and exacerbated difficulties retrieving the eductors. A research effort within the Dredging Research Program was therefore initiated {{to address the problem of}} debris clogging which hinders deployment and removal of eductors used in sand bypassing operations...|$|E
