40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the changes in the {{perception}} of the university environment that occurred in four selected. groups of <b>freshmen</b> residence hall students: females residents in single-sex halls (N = 150), female residents in coeducational halls (N = 89), male residents in single-sex halls (N = 95), and male residents in coeducational halls (N = 96). The College and University Environment Scales was the instrument utilized to measure the students' perceptions of the university environment. Additional data were gathered from files in the Residence Hall Programs Office and from a brief questionnaire compiled by the investigator. During the week prior to the Fall term 1970 at Oregon State University the participants were administered the CUES and the supplemental questionnaire. The CUES was readministered six months later following two terms of in-residence living by the participants. The data was subjected to statistical analysis with the. 05 level of significance being accepted as indicating degrees of confidence that differences were real. Hypotheses were stated in the null form indicating that, by comparison, no significant differences would appear. The following groups were statistically treated relative to the perceptual change in the university environment that occurred: 1. <b>Freshmen</b> females residing in single-sex residence halls. 2. <b>Freshmen</b> females residing in coeducational residence halls. 3. <b>Freshmen</b> males residing in single-sex residence halls. 4. <b>Freshmen</b> males residing in coeducational residence halls.

Interaction of coeducational and single-sex residence halls and <b>freshmen</b> male and female residents.
