40|$|Forward {{contracting}} of fed cattle increased {{sharply in}} the 1980 s, causing questions to be raised about forward contracting and its impacts on prices. Earlier {{research has found that}} basis forward contracting resulted in lower net prices to cattle feeders than futures market hedging. In still other research, cattle feeders implied there was a financing advantage with forward contracting. This study compared basis forward contracting of fed cattle with hedging fed cattle using the live cattle futures market and assessed lender attitudes toward managing price risk via forward contracts versus alternative price risk management tools. Daily fed cattle basis data for the Texas Panhandle and Western Kansas regions were analyzed for the period 1980 to 1990. The monthly average basis and variability of the basis for futures market nonexpiration and <b>expiration</b> <b>months</b> were compared. Generally, nonexpiration-month basis means were significantly different than for expiration-months. Also, nonexpiration months were found to have significantly higher basis variation than <b>expiration</b> <b>months.</b> Trend and seasonality in fed cattle basis from 1980 to 1990 for each region was estimated with regression analysis. A significant positive trend in basis and a significant negative trend in basis variation was found for Western Kansas but not for the Texas Panhandle. The seasonal basis pattern was quite consistent acros...|$|R

50|$|A bear call spread is {{a limited}} profit, limited risk options trading {{strategy}} {{that can be used}} when the options trader is moderately bearish on the underlying security.

50|$|When trading a {{calendar}} spread, {{try to think}} of this strategy as a covered call. The only difference is that you do not own the underlying stock, but you do own the right to purchase it. By treating this trade like a covered call, it will help you pick <b>expiration</b> <b>months</b> quickly. When selecting the expiration date of the long option, it is wise to go at least two to three months out. This will depend largely on your forecast. However, when selecting the short strike, it is a good practice to always sell the shortest dated option available. These options lose value the fastest, and can be rolled out month-to-month {{over the life of the}} trade.|$|R

The expiration date can be figured out as follows: The year is in {{the centre of the}} sticker, and the stickers are attached with the month of expiration pointing upwards. The black marking on the side (near the 12) thus makes it easy for the police to see the <b>expiration</b> <b>month</b> from a distance. Like a clock, the marking shows the same position of a number on the face of a clock. For example, the black marking is on the left side, so it is the ninth month (or 9 o'clock) and hence the expiry date is 30 September.

40|$|Liquidity {{costs in}} futures markets are not {{observed}} directly because {{bids and offers}} occur in an open outcry pit and are not recorded. Traditional estimation of these costs has focused on bidask spreads using transaction prices. However, the bid-ask spread only captures the tightness of the market price. As the volume increases measures of market depth which identify how the order flow moves prices become important information. We estimate market depth for lean hogs and live cattle markets using a Bayesian MCMC method to estimate unobserved data. While the markets are highly liquid, our results show that cost- and risk-reducing strategies may exist. Liquidity costs are highest when larger volumes are traded at distant contracts. For hogs the market becomes less liquid prior to the <b>expiration</b> <b>month.</b> For cattle this occurs during the <b>expiration</b> <b>month</b> when the liquidity risk is also higher. For both markets this coincides with periods of low volume. For the nearby contract highest trading volume occurs {{at the beginning of}} the month prior to expiration and lowest trading volume occurs in the <b>expiration</b> <b>month.</b> For both commodities the cumulative effect of volume on price change may lead to liquidity costs higher than a tick.

Strike probabilities are significantly affected by the duration and <b>expiration</b> <b>month</b> of the previous agreement. Dispute rates are also increased by the occurrence of a short strike during the previous negotiations and reduced by the occurrence of a long strike.

40|$|The time {{structure}} of volatility in futures prices and implied volatility implicit in option premia {{is derived from}} an underlying model of spot price behavior. The model suggests a number of characteristic features that should be present in observed market prices. These features are found in soybean futures and options on soybean futures. Introd uction Futures and options are derivative assets whose value depends {{on the behavior of}} other, underlying, assets. The derivative nature of futures and options, however, is often ignored in empirical analysis. For example, it is common to treat futures prices as if they were an ordinary time series of observations, despite the obvious problem that futures contracts mature. To address this problem, it is common to artificially create a continuous sequence of prices by "rolling over " in the next nearby contract when one reaches its <b>expiration</b> <b>month.</b> Unfortunately, using off-the-shelf times series approaches to model derivatives can result in misrepresentation of their dynamic behavior. The alternative is to treat the behavior of the underlying assets as primitive and exploit the implications of the derivative nature of futures and options in modeling their time series behavior...|$|E
