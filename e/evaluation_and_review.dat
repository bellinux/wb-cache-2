5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E

After serving as the Deputy Commanding General of the United States Army Vietnam, Norton commanded the 1st Air Cavalry Division from May 1966 to April 1967. After undergoing a colectomy in June 1967, Norton became the Commanding General of the United States Army Aviation Systems Command, a position he held until September 1969. From October 1969 to October 1970, Norton was the Deputy Director of Modern Army Selected Systems Test <b>Evaluation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Review</b> project ("Project MASSTER") in Fort Hood, Texas, tasked with developing sensors to use in weapons systems in Vietnam. After initially being tasked with the position of Force Development in the Pentagon, Norton was instead made Commanding General of the United States Army Combat Developments Command. Occupying the position until June 1973, Norton assisted in the continued reorganization of the Army, unsuccessfully attempting to preserve the Combat Development Command, which was later reestablished at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. While serving in this position, Norton oversaw the early development of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and M1 Abrams tank. In his final assignment, Norton served as Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces of Southern Europe from June 1963 to August 1975.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, topological orderings of DAGs {{can be used}} {{to order}} the {{compilation}} operations in a makefile. The program <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> technique uses DAGs to model the milestones and activities of large human projects, and schedule these projects to use as little total time as possible. Combinational logic blocks in electronic circuit design, and the operations in dataflow programming languages, involve acyclic networks of processing elements. DAGs can also represent collections of events and their influence on each other, either in a probabilistic structure such as a Bayesian network or as a record of historical data such as family trees or the version histories of [...] distributed revision control systems.

40|$|CONTEXT: For the {{diagnosis}} of the diseases which affect the terminal ileum, the colonoscopy allows macroscopic <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> the performing of biopsies. Studies with criteria for the endoscopic and histological characterization of this segment are scarce {{and there are still}} some doubts about the need of biopsies in patients with normal ileoscopy. OBJECTIVE: Study the terminal ileum of patients who underwent colonoscopy considering: endoscopic and histological correlation; agreement between results of the initial histological <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> slides <b>review,</b> <b>and</b> the chance of subjects with normal ileoscopy with abdominal pain and/or chronic diarrhea to show histological alterations. METHODS: In a prospective study, 111 patients who presented smooth mucosa without enanthema in the endoscopic exam of the terminal ileum were selected. Biopsies of the ileal mucosa of such patients were performed, being the slides routinely examined <b>and</b> <b>reviewed</b> afterwards. RESULTS: The correlation between patients with normal ileoscopy and ileum with preserved histological architecture was of 99. 1 %. The agreement between initial histological <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> slides <b>review</b> calculated by the Kappa test was 0. 21. In patients with abdominal pain and/or chronic diarrhea, the chance of showing histological alterations was 2. 5 times higher than the others. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between endoscopic and histological findings was high. The agreement between the initial histologic <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> slides <b>review</b> was not satisfactory. The chance of subjects with normal ileoscopy with abdominal pain and/or chronic diarrhea, showing histological alterations was higher in relation to the asymptomatic ones or with other symptoms, although the clinical importance of this datum was not evaluated...|$|R
