40|$|AbstractSimulation and {{prediction}} of the machining {{process and the}} machined results of milling process is an important link in the control of milling quality. It is important on improving the machined surface quality, improving processing efficiency, and reducing processing errors. In the milling process, the assembly error of the cutting tool has great importance {{that should not be}} ignored for the forming of milled surface. Aiming at the problem of machining error in milling process caused by tool assembly error, this article investigated the milling process of peripheral milling, and researched the surface topography caused by the tool assembly error. Then the author established a simulation model to forecast the processing error caused by peripheral milling cutter assembly error. The model calculates the location of the tooth tipoff the milling tool by analyzing the <b>knife</b> <b>tooth</b> trajectory variation caused by the tool assembly error. Then discrete tracks of the teeth, to obtain the final processed surface by calculating the minimum value of all the teeth traces at discrete points. Through this model, we can get different surface morphology formed by different tool assembly errors to explore how the tool assembly error influences the processing quality. The study shows that when the cutter assembly errors exist, each tooth tip trajectory changes, making the surface topography phenomena that surface rises and falls, and cutting grooves’ size shrinks and expands. Cutting groove depth will change {{in the direction of the}} tool axis direction. The surface roughness will increase when the cutter assembly error increases, but the roughness does not change after increasing to a threshold value...|$|E

The Dolmen graves of the A-Schwörstadt type date from about the 3rd millennium BC. Gmeiniwald was discovered in 1907, and excavated in 1907 and again in 1909. A central, rectangular grave chamber of 2.4 x 4.1 m was found under a shallow mound of about 9 m in diameter.

40|$|The {{thorough}} investigation of both grain threshing and grain separating processes {{is a crucial}} consideration for effective structural design and variable optimization of the tangential flow threshing cylinder and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder composite units (TLFC unit) of small and medium-sized (SME) combine harvesters. The objective {{of this paper was}} to obtain the structural variables of a TLFC unit by theoretical modeling and experimentation on a tangential flow threshing cylinder unit (TFC unit) and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder unit (LFC unit). Threshing and separation equations for five types of threshing <b>teeth</b> (<b>knife</b> bar, trapezoidal <b>tooth,</b> spike tooth, rasp bar, and rectangular bar), were obtained using probability theory. Results demonstrate that the threshing and separation capacity of the knife bar TFC unit was stronger than the other threshing teeth. The length of the LFC unit was divided into four sections, with helical blades on the first section (0 - 0. 17 m), the spike tooth on the second section (0. 17 - 1. 48 m), the trapezoidal tooth on the third section (1. 48 - 2. 91 m), and the discharge plate on the fourth section (2. 91 - 3. 35 m). Test results showed an un-threshed grain rate of 0. 243 %, un-separated grain rate of 0. 346 %, and broken grain rate of 0. 184 %. Evidenced by these results, threshing and separation performance is significantly improved by analyzing and optimizing the structure and variables of a TLFC unit. The results of this research can be used to successfully design the TLFC unit of small and medium-sized (SME) combine harvesters. </p...|$|R

2500|$|In 1904, the London Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} challenged Houdini {{to escape}} from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinée performance at London's Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his [...] "ghost house" [...] (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the <b>knife</b> in his <b>teeth,</b> used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage {{and gave him a}} kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs.

After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to provide {{additional}} data to supplement the work reported in NASA/CR- 2015 - 218868 (Berdanier and Key, 2015 b). The aim of that project was to characterize the fundamental flow physics and the overall performance effects due to increased rotor tip clearance heights in axial compressors. Data have been collected in the three-stage axial research compressor at Purdue University with a specific focus on analyzing the multistage effects resulting from the tip leakage flow. Three separate rotor tip clearances were studied with nominal tip clearance gaps of 1. 5 percent, 3. 0 percent, and 4. 0 percent based on a constant annulus height. Overall compressor performance was previously investigated at four corrected speedlines (100 percent, 90 percent, 80 percent, and 68 percent) {{for each of the}} three tip clearance configurations. This study extends the previously published results to include detailed steady and time-resolved pressure data at two loading conditions, nominal loading (NL) and high loading (HL), on the 100 percent corrected speedline for the intermediate clearance level (3. 0 percent). Steady detailed radial traverses of total pressure at the exit of each stator row are supported by flow visualization techniques to identify regions of flow recirculation and separation. Furthermore, detailed radial traverses of time-resolved total pressures at the exit of each rotor row have been measured with a fast-response pressure probe. These data were combined with existing three-component velocity measurements to identify a novel technique for calculating blockage in a multistage compressor. Time-resolved static pressure measurements have been collected over the rotor tips for all rotors with each of the three tip clearance configurations for up to five loading conditions along the 100 percent corrected speedline using fast-response piezoresistive pressure sensors. These time-resolved static pressure measurements reveal new knowledge about the trajectory of the tip leakage flow through the rotor passage. Further, these data extend previous measurements identifying a modulation of the tip leakage flow due to upstream stator wake propagation. Finally, a novel instrumentation technique has been implemented to measure pressures in the shrouded stator cavities. These data provide boundary conditions relating to the flow across the shrouded stator <b>knife</b> seal <b>teeth.</b> Moreover, the utilization of fast-response pressure sensors provides a new look at the time-resolved pressure field, leading to instantaneous differential pressures across the seal teeth. Ultimately, the data collected for this project represent a unique data set which contributes to build a better understanding of the tip leakage flow field and its associated loss mechanisms. These data will facilitate future engine design goals leading to small blade heights in the rear stages of high pressure compressors and aid in the development of new blade designs which are desensitized to the performance penalties attributed to rotor tip leakage flows...|$|R
