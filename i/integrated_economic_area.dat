40|$|After a {{temporary}} surge for European Studies {{in higher education}} in the United Kingdom in the 1990 s, the subject area has in recent years been affected by a substantial decline. This {{is the result of a}} wider domestic climate of Euro-scepticism, which has been largely driven by a sustained campaign against the European Union in large sections of the British tabloid media. The domestic debate on the EU in Britain concentrates mainly on the adverse effects of British membership on national sovereignty and consequently leaves little room for the detailed analysis of institutional and policy development. This has led to the widespread perception that the study of the history of the integration process and of EU institutions and procedures is a marginal subject area, which does no longer necessarily have to be part of the core curriculum in British universities. Instead the attention has shifted towards the wider international relations environment, particularly the United States and Asia. The proposed article considers this development as an opportunity to re-energise interest in European Studies in the UK and proposes to promote it on the basis of the acknowledgement that it needs to be put in the context of the changes in the wider global environment. The curriculum in the area of European Studies should therefore predominantly concentrate on the EU as an increasingly influential actor in the global economy and international relations. This calls for a new emphasis on the analysis of the development of the internal dimension of the EU- 27 Single Market and its external impact as one of the most dynamic <b>integrated</b> <b>economic</b> <b>areas</b> in the world.

This property is then used to develop a composite indicator of the degree of economic integration within an IEA that indicates the distance between the theoretical and actual distribution of shares: the closer is the actual distribution to the expected distribution, the greater the degree of integration.

40|$|Economic {{integration}} {{alters the}} growth {{path of the}} involved economies through scale, factor reallocation and factor trade effects. Scale effects arising from positive spillovers are best known from literature. Provided that the growth mechanism in autarky is the more efficient the larger is the economy, integration increases the relevant scale of an economy which unambiguously fosters growth. However, if spillovers are not intensive enough or if they arise from an average value of the capital stock, long-term growth remains unaffected by trade. Furthermore, integration leads to a reallocation of factors between sectors. If trade causes a reallocation of inputs from dynamic sectors to other sectors, the growth rate decreases. This can happen {{in the case of}} integration with countries being rich in the factor that is extensively used in the dynamic sectors, assuming a low substitutability of inputs in production. If all sectors contribute to the dynamics of an economy, the probability of negative factor reallocation effects becomes lower. Factor trade between the economies can reinforce differences in the countries' growth rates leading to growth centers in an <b>integrated</b> <b>economic</b> <b>area.</b> The present paper demonstrates these mechanisms in an integrated approach providing a compact survey of the recent literature on trade and growth.

40|$|European {{economic}} integration is commonly {{believed to be}} incomplete, and that further reforms are needed. In this context, the union of U.

We derive three theoretical predictions about the distribution of output and factor stocks that will arise among members of a fully <b>integrated</b> <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> (IEA) in which goods and factors are freely mobile and policies are harmonized. These theoretical predictions are then empirically tested using data on the output and factor stocks of 14 E. U. member states and the 51 U.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{regional}} issues have gradually {{moved into the}} centre-stage of the debate on economic integration and international trade in Europe. The fading influence of the nation-state goes together with a transfer of sovereignty to the European level combined with {{a renewed interest in}} the region as a relevant economic unit. Regional authorities are welcoming this evolution as a new opportunity for greater regional autonomy. They are developing political and economic ties with other regions but are at the same time promoting the strategic interests of their own region. This twofold strategy draws a hesitant response from European Union (EU) regulators. They applaud the fact that economic integration strengthens regional complementarities and co-operation. But the increased regional competition raises the prospect of a greater use of policies that distort competition in an <b>integrated</b> <b>economic</b> <b>area.</b> Moreover, EU regional policies that seek convergence between high and low income regions would suffer from a systematic policy of the stronger regions to expand their influence {{at the expense of the}} weaker regions. From a theoretical point of view, those issues raise several questions that are addressed in this paper. What are the driving forces for regional complementarities and regional competition? How does economic integration affect regional competition ? What can "strategic" regional policy do to promote narrowly defined regional interests ? And how do EU-wide policies prevent distortions in regional competition? This paper addresses those theoretical questions based on the literature in international trade, regional agglomeration and multinational companies. Section 1 starts with a look at theories that predict regional convergence as the outcome of the regional integration process. Section 2 assesses recent theoretical contributions that focus on regional agglomeration and explore the regional consequences of multinational companies. In a third section, the scope for EU policies that prevent destructive regional competition is discussed. ...|$|E
