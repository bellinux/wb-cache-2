50|$|<b>Dicopper</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>trihydroxide</b> Cu2(OH)3Cl is a green {{crystalline}} solid. It decomposes above 220 °C with {{elimination of}} hydrochloric acid to oxides of copper. It is largely stable in neutral media, but decomposes by warming in alkaline media, yielding oxides. It is virtually {{insoluble in water}} and organic solvents, soluble in mineral acids yielding the corresponding copper salts (eq. 1), soluble in ammonia, amine and EDTA solutions under complex formation. It can easily be converted to copper hydroxide by reacting with sodium hydroxide (eq. 2). Its pH in water is 6.9 measured by EPA method SW846-9045.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dicopper</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>trihydroxide</b> [...] is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula Cu2(OH)3Cl. It {{is often referred}} to as tribasic copper chloride (TBCC), copper trihydroxyl chloride or copper hydroxychloride. It is a greenish crystalline solid encountered in mineral deposits, metal corrosion products, industrial products, art and archeological objects, and some living systems. It was originally manufactured on an industrial scale as a precipitated material used as either a chemical intermediate or a fungicide. Since 1994, a purified, crystallized product has been produced at the scale of thousands of tons per year, and used extensively as a nutritional supplement for animals.|$|E
50|$|Any {{other organisms}} that cause {{damage to the}} avocado plant could be {{considered}} a threat {{to the health of the}} plant; especially in growing regions where some disease is already present. It is important to remove infected fruit as it is the primary source of inoculum, and to perform regular maintenance to allow sun and wind to interact with the foliage completely. These interactions help to keep conditions dry and prevent fungal infections and/or growth. Some fungicides including benomyl, <b>dicopper</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>trihydroxide,</b> copper sulfate and copper hydroxide may be used as flower buds begin to appear on the avocado tree. Mexican varieties bloom the earliest from January through February on average, West Indian varieties bloom during February and March, and Guatemalan varieties from March to April. The respective geographic regions experience drier weather conditions during the blooming periods. It is critical to prevent disease at this time because the plant tissue is most susceptible to infection.|$|E
40|$|Copper(II) bromide and {{chloride}} complexes {{of the new}} heptadentate ligand 2, 6 -bis(bis(2 -pyridylmethyl) amino) methylpyridine (L) {{have been}} prepared. For the bromide complexes, chains of novel, approximately C- 2 -symmetric, chiral [Cu- 2 (L) Br- 2](2 +) 2 ̆ 7 wedge-shaped 2 ̆ 7 tectons are found. The links between the dicopper tectons and the overall chirality and packing of the chains are dictated by the bromide ion content, not the counter anion. In contrast, the chloride complexes exhibit linked asymmetric [Cu- 2 (L) Cl- 3](+) tectons with distinct N 3 CuCl 2 and N 4 CuCl 2 centres in the solid. The overall structures of the <b>dicopper</b> bromide and <b>chloride</b> units persist in solution irrespective of the halide. The redox chemistry of the various species is also described...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the solubility of copper (Cu) in two sources of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO 4) including monohydrate and pentahydrate and three sources of <b>dicopper</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>trihydroxide</b> (dCCTH) including α-form (dCCTH-α), β-form (dCCTH-β), and a mixture of α- and β-form (dCCTH-αβ) at different pH and a 3 -step in vitro digestion assay for pigs. In Exp. 1, Cu sources were incubated in water-based buffers at pH 2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 8, and 6. 8 for 4 h using a shaking incubator at 39 °C. The CuSO 4 sources were completely dissolved within 15 min except at pH 6. 8. The solubility of Cu in dCCTH-α was greater (p< 0. 05) than dCCTH-β but was not different from dCCTH-αβ during 3 -h incubation at pH 2. 0 and during 2 -h incubation at pH 3. 0. At pH 4. 8, {{there were no significant differences}} in solubility of Cu in dCCTH sources. Copper in dCCTH sources were non-soluble at pH 6. 8. In Exp. 2, the solubility of Cu was determined during the 3 -step in vitro digestion assay for pigs. All sources of Cu were completely dissolved in step 1 which simulated digestion in the stomach. In Exp. 3, the solubility of Cu in experimental diets including a control diet and diets containing 250 mg/kg of additional Cu from five Cu sources was determined during the in vitro digestion assay. The solubility of Cu in diets containing additional Cu sources were greater (p< 0. 05) than the control diet in step 1. In conclusion, the solubility of Cu was influenced by pH of digesta but was not different among sources based on the in vitro digestion assay...|$|E

O estudo foi conduzido na área {{experimental}} do Departamento de Agricultura da Universidade Federal de Lavras. Observou-se efeito significativo de controle da ferrugem asiática para todos os fungicidas avaliados. A aplicação de pyraclostrobin + epoxiconazole em R 1 proporcionou o controle efetivo da doença, não diferindo estatisticamente de V 6 + R 1 e R 1 + R 5. As aplicações em R 5 e V 6 + R 5 apresentaram elevada severidade, no entanto, com rendimento de grãos semelhante a aplicações do mesmo fungicida nos estádios R 1, V 6 + R 1 e R 1 + R 5. The aim of {{this work}} was to verify {{the effect of the}} fungicides <b>dicopper</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>trihydroxide,</b> thiophanate methyl, chlorothalonil+thiophanate methyl, chlorothalonil, and pyraclostrobin+epoxiconazole applied at the stages V 6, R 1, R 5, V 6 +R 1, V 6 +R 5, R 1 +R 5 on the control of the Asian rust and on the agronomic characteristics of the soybean. The experiment was carried out at the experimental area of the Agriculture Department, Federal University of Lavras, Lavras MG, Brazil. Significant effects were observed for all fungicides on Asian rust control, in comparison with the control. The treatments with fungicide sprays pyraclostrobin + epoxiconazole at the growth stage R 1 provided the effective control of the disease, no significant differences were observed between V 6 + R 1 and R 1 + R 5. The sprays at R 5 and V 6 + R 5 showed high disease severity however, with grain yield similar to the applications of the same fungicide at the stages R 1, V 6 + R 1 and R 1 + R 5...|$|E
