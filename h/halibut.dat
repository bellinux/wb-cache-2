5|$|As {{a fishing}} port, Calais has several notable fishing markets {{including}} Les Délices de la Mer and Huîtrière Calaisenne on the Boulevard La Fayette, {{the latter of}} which is noted for its oysters, lobster and crabs from Brittany. The Emile Fournier et Fils market on the Rue Mouron sells mainly smoked fish including salmon, trout, herring and <b>halibut.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fish steaks are cut {{perpendicular}} to the spine and include bones. Although their delicate flesh requires quicker cooking than beef, steaks from swordfish, <b>halibut,</b> tuna, salmon and mahi-mahi can be grilled. They are frequently cooked whole or as fillets. Fish steaks may also be poached or baked using a court bouillon, wine or sauce or cooked en papillote.|$|E
5|$|The {{black dogfish}} is {{harmless}} to humans and of little commercial value. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep-sea trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries operating throughout the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Greenland <b>halibut</b> fishery, the French mixed-species trawl fishery, and the Canadian Greenland <b>halibut,</b> crab, redfish, monkfish, and witch fisheries. Captured sharks are usually discarded, though {{in recent years}} this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal. Reported catches by European countries, of which France made the largest contribution, have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006. The average catch by Canadian fisheries was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005. The black dogfish occurs mostly too deep for fisheries off southern Africa; {{in the remainder of}} its range, little information is available on fishery impact.|$|E

50|$|They {{include many}} {{important}} commercially fished species, including {{not only the}} various fish called flounders, but also the European plaice, the <b>halibuts,</b> the lemon sole, the common dab, the Pacific Dover sole, and the flukes.|$|R
5|$|Fish {{are also}} braised, as in a dish called hraime, in which fish such as grouper (better known in Israel by its Arabic name lokus) or <b>halibut</b> is {{prepared}} in a sauce with hot pepper and other spices for Rosh Hashanah, Passover and the Sabbath by North African Jews. Everyday versions are prepared with cheaper kinds {{of fish and}} are served in market eateries, public kitchens and at home for weekday meals.|$|E
5|$|The fishing {{industry}} remains {{an important part}} of the provincial economy, employing 26,000 and contributing over $440 million to the GDP. The combined harvest of fish such as cod, haddock, <b>halibut,</b> herring and mackerel was 150,000tonnes (165,000tons) valued at about $130million in 2006. Shellfish, such as crab, shrimp and clams, accounted for 195,000tonnes (215,000tons) with a value of $316million in the same year. The value of products from the seal hunt was $55million.|$|E
5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E

5|$|Bowie Seamount {{supports}} a biologically rich {{area with a}} vigorous ecosystem. Studies have recorded high densities of crab, sea stars, sea anemones, sponges, squid, octopus, rockfish, <b>halibut</b> and sablefish. Eight species of marine mammal {{have been found in}} the Bowie Seamount area, including Steller sea lions, orca, humpback and sperm whales, along with 16varieties of seabirds. This has made Bowie Seamount a rare habitat in the northeast Pacific Ocean {{and one of the most}} biologically rich submarine volcanoes on Earth. The rich marine life is due to the intense food supply of microscopic animals and plants, including phytoplankton and zooplankton.|$|E
5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, <b>halibut</b> and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} array of {{wildlife}} and, along with the connected San Joaquin River Delta represents one of California's most important ecological habitats. California's Dungeness crab, Pacific <b>halibut,</b> and the California scorpionfish are all significant components of the bay's fisheries. The bay's salt marshes now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh and support a number of endangered species and provide key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers. Most famously, the bay is a key link in the Pacific Flyway and with millions of shorebirds annually visiting the bay shallows as a refuge, is the most important component of the flyway south of Alaska. Many endangered species of birds are also found here: the California least tern, the California clapper rail, the snowy egret, and the black crowned night heron.|$|E
2500|$|In {{view of the}} {{worsening}} military {{situation for}} Japan on the islands of the Pacific, on 20 October 1943 [...] "Tatsuta" [...] was sent to Truk and made several troop transport runs to Ponape {{over the next couple}} of weeks. On its return to Japan on 5 November, the Tatsuta convoy was attacked by the submarine [...] near the Bungo Channel. However, <b>Halibuts</b> main target was the aircraft carrier [...] and battleship , and Tatsuta was ignored.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, Esbeck {{left the}} band during the {{recording}} of The Velvet Touch of Los Straitjackets {{and was replaced by}} Pete Curry, formerly of the <b>Halibuts,</b> a 1980s surf-revival group. In 2005, Lester left and was replaced by Jason [...] "Teen Beat" [...] Smay. They've become known as frequent collaborators, recording Sing Along With Los Straitjackets with a number of different artists. They were nominated for a Grammy Award for their collaboration with blues singer Eddy Clearwater, Rock 'N' Roll City.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific sand sole, {{belongs to}} the order Pleuronectiformes, and the family Pleuronectidae. They are {{considered}} a flatfish due to their body shape, just like Hippoglossus (<b>halibuts),</b> Solea (soles), and Platichthys (flounders). This fish can get over 62.95 cm (24.78 in) in length and on average this fish can weigh approximately 2.484 kg (5.476 lbs). Their dorsal side, which houses both of their eyes, can {{come in a variety}} of colors like gray, green, or brown, with blotches of dark brown or black. Their underside or ventral side is usually white. By obtaining these colors, the pacific sand sole fish can have a better advantage of camouflaging into their surroundings; making them harder to see by their prey.|$|R
25|$|The Pacific <b>halibut</b> {{is found}} on the {{continental}} shelf of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Fishing for the Pacific <b>halibut</b> is mostly concentrated in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, off {{the west coast of}} Canada. Small <b>halibut</b> catches are reported in coastal Washington, Oregon, and California. Pacific <b>halibut</b> is broken up into 10 regularity management areas.|$|E
25|$|Young <b>halibut</b> {{are highly}} migratory and {{generally}} migrate in a clockwise direction {{east and south}} throughout the Gulf of Alaska. <b>Halibut</b> in older age classes {{tend to be less}} migratory, but continue to move predominately on a clockwise direction. Mature fish are also involved in winter spawning migrations towards deeper waters, migrating across several areas in some instances. Research has indicated small, localized spawning populations may occur in deep waters such as in Chatham Straight in northern Southeast Alaska. However, because of the free-floating nature of larvae and subsequent mixing of juvenile <b>halibut</b> from throughout the Gulf of Alaska, only one genetic stock of <b>halibut</b> is known in the northern Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The federally {{controlled}} {{fur seal}} industry dominated {{the economy of}} the Pribilofs until 1985. St. Paul is a port for the Central Bering Sea fishing fleet, and major harbor improvements have fueled economic growth. Trident Seafoods and Icicle Seafoods process cod, crab, <b>halibut</b> and other seafoods in St. Paul. 30 residents hold commercial fishing permits for <b>halibut.</b> Several offshore processors are serviced out of St. Paul. The community is seeking funds to develop a <b>halibut</b> processing facility. Fur seal rookeries and more than 210 species of nesting seabirds attract almost 700 tourists annually. There is also a reindeer herd on the island from a previous commercial venture. Residents subsist on <b>halibut,</b> fur seals (1,645 may be taken each year), reindeer, marine invertebrates, plants and berries.|$|E
40|$|Authors {{listed in}} {{alphabetic}} order) A {{review of the}} past 50 years climate conditions off West Greenland is given. We find large variability in the atmospheric, oceanographic and sea-ice conditions {{as well as in}} the fish stocks. A positive relationship is found between the hydrographic conditions expressed by the water temperature and the fish recruitment of cod and redfish whereas the recruitment of shrimps and <b>halibuts</b> seems to react positive to lower temperatures. Observed shifts in the hydrographic conditions during the second half of the 1990 s indicate, that a change in the fish stock environment may be expected in the coming years. Relationships between the past variations in fisheries resources, hydrographic conditions, and the large-scale climate conditions, expressed by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), are analyzed and tested for links. 1...|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, he {{was often}} the support act for punk bands, {{including}} The Jam, The Alarm, Newtown Neurotics, New Model Army and performed extensively with fellow punk-inspired ranting poets Swift Nick (Nick Swift), Kool Knotes (Richard Edwards), Porky the Poet (Phill Jupitus) and Steven Wells (Seething Wells). Manic Street Preachers supported him at a performance at Swansea University. In the 1990s, he toured with John Otway as Headbutts and <b>Halibuts,</b> and together they wrote a surreal rock opera called Cheryl, a tale of Satanism, trainspotting, drug abuse and unrequited love. He has performed at every Glastonbury Festival since 1983, and continues to write topical, satirical material {{on all kinds of}} subjects. He puts on an annual beer and music festival 'Glastonwick', currently held at Coombes Farm, near Shoreham though originally in Southwick, his home town nearby. Late May 2015 saw the 20th Glastonwick.|$|R

25|$|Being strong swimmers, <b>halibut</b> {{are able}} to eat a large variety of fishes, {{including}} cod, turbot, and pollock, and some invertebrates, such as octopus, crab and shrimp. Sometimes, <b>halibut</b> leave the ocean bottom to feed on pelagic fish, such as salmon, sand lance, herring and even seal remains {{have been found in}} their stomach.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the type}} of fish used depends on {{availability}} in a given region. Some common types are cod, <b>halibut,</b> flounder, tilapia or, in New England, Atlantic cod or haddock. Salmon is growing common on the West Coast, while freshwater catfish is most frequently used in the Southeast. In Canada, pollock, haddock, and <b>halibut</b> are popular choices, alongside cod.|$|E
25|$|<b>Halibut</b> {{are strong}} {{swimmers}} {{and are able}} to migrate long distances. <b>Halibut</b> of all ages and sizes are involved in a predominantly clockwise (northwest to southeast) migration from their settlement areas (western part of the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea), reproductive fish also make regular seasonal migrations from more shallow feeding grounds in summer to deeper spawning grounds in winter.|$|E
25|$|Bottom seines – {{deployed}} {{by small}} vessels for flounder, cod, <b>halibut</b> and other demersal fishes.|$|E
25|$|Alaska {{provides}} rich resources. Pacific salmon, shellfish, groundfish, flatfish, Pacific <b>halibut,</b> and herring are underutilized.|$|E
25|$|Bottom trawls – {{restricted}} use by medium and large sized trawlers, for demersal fishes such as <b>halibut,</b> cod, redfish, flounder.|$|E
25|$|Other {{commercial}} fisheries include <b>halibut,</b> herring and herring roe, sea urchin and other specialty sushis, hake, haddock, cod, crab and shellfish.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{significant}} commercial fisheries of many salt-water species, including Atlantic cod, haddock and <b>halibut,</b> {{although some of}} these are in decline.|$|E
25|$|Many Makah {{tribal members}} derive {{most of their}} income from fishing. Makah fish for salmon, <b>halibut,</b> Pacific whiting, and other marine fish.|$|E
25|$|On the Pacific Coast {{important}} {{species are}} Pacific <b>halibut,</b> Pacific salmon, groundfish, pelagic fishes and nearshore species. The stocks are mostly overfished or fully exploited.|$|E
25|$|The city is {{also known}} for its fishing. Its waters contain five {{different}} species of salmon and yearly runs of steelhead. <b>Halibut</b> {{can also be found}} in the saltwater inlets near the city.|$|E
25|$|The salmon {{species in}} Alaska (chinook, coho, pink, sockeye, and chum) {{generally}} produce good harvest, though some stocks are declining. Up to 1977, foreign fishing controlled the groundfish fisheries in Alaska (apart from Pacific <b>halibut).</b>|$|E
