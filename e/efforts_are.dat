5|$|Ron, Hermione, and Harry {{join the}} effort to save Hagrid's hippogriff, Buckbeak, from being {{executed}} for attacking Draco Malfoy, after Draco provoked him. Their <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> unsuccessful, but Scabbers reappears shortly after they hear Buckbeak being executed.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds {{and humans}} {{have a long}} history together: they have {{provided}} food to hunters, guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land. Many species are currently threatened by human activities, and conservation <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> under way.|$|E
5|$|Women's rights – The ACLU {{works to}} {{eliminate}} {{discrimination against women}} in all realms. The ACLU encourages government to be proactive in stopping violence against women. These <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> led by the ACLU's Women's Rights project.|$|E
25|$|<b>Efforts</b> <b>were</b> made {{to offer}} the Nazis money {{for the release of}} Jews. However, these <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> {{systematically}} (and, according to Segev, cynically) destroyed by the British.|$|R
50|$|Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> a {{quantity}} varied by speakers when adjusting {{to an increase}} or decrease in the communication distance. The communication distance is {{the distance between the}} speaker and the listener. Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> a subjective physiological quantity, and is mainly dependent on subglottal pressure, vocal fold tension and jaw opening. Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> different from sound pressure. To measure vocal <b>effort,</b> listeners <b>are</b> asked to rate the distance between speaker and addressee.|$|R
50|$|Another tourism <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> {{to install}} a novel {{roadside}} attraction: a 52,000 pound lava lamp, formerly a Target advertisement in Times Square.That <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> profiled in the 2010 documentary film, World's Largest.|$|R
5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy {{in many parts of}} the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.|$|E
5|$|<b>Efforts</b> <b>are</b> {{being made}} to monitor the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill, led by Vassar College's Environmental Research Institute and the Cornell University Cooperative Extension Dutchess County Environment Program. Three sites are {{regularly}} sampled for water quality while devices such as sondes continuously record temperature, conductivity, and pH. Benthic macroinvertebrates are frequently counted and fecal coliform counts are also run.|$|E
5|$|<b>Efforts</b> <b>are</b> {{underway}} {{to determine how}} the extra chromosome 21 material causes Down syndrome, as currently this is unknown, and to develop treatments to improve intelligence in those with the syndrome. One hope is to use stem cells. Other methods being studied include the use of antioxidants, gamma secretase inhibition, adrenergic agonists, and memantine. Research is often carried out on an animal model, the Ts65Dn mouse.|$|E
50|$|An <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> made to {{relaunch}} {{the publication}} {{under a new}} name, the Art Young Quarterly, in 1922, but the <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> stillborn, with only one issue of the revised magazine seeing print.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of Nazi propaganda in occupied Poland {{can be divided}} into two main phases. Initial <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> directed towards creating a negative image of pre-war Poland, and later <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> aimed at fostering anti-Soviet, antisemitic, and pro-German attitudes.|$|R
30|$|Minimum {{pneumatic}} braking: in this region, {{the electric}} braking <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> {{limited to a}} maximum value, often related to the motor currents. If a higher braking <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> required, then the pneumatic brake is activated to supply the difference.|$|R
5|$|<b>Efforts</b> <b>are</b> {{underway}} {{to develop new}} drugs. Some of these involve targeted therapies against the cancer cells' molecular mechanisms. Others aim to target the highly resistant cancer stem cells. Still others aim to affect the non-neoplastic stroma and microenvironment of the tumor, which is known to influence cell proliferation and metastasis. A further approach {{involves the use of}} immunotherapy, such as oncolytic viruses.|$|E
5|$|Mercury also {{enters into}} the {{environment}} through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{people make}} {{a wide range}} of uses of insects, both {{practical}} and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> made to kill them. The widespread use of insecticides has failed to exterminate any insect pest, but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.|$|E
50|$|After the {{prototype}} proved successful, a larger R&D <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> initiated in 1990, led by Herman Kading. One {{of the primary}} accomplishments of this <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> to migrate the product to UNIX Platforms, including Sun, SGI, HP, and IBM.|$|R

5|$|Ongoing <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> {{being made}} by the {{government}} at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away. One of the underlying goals {{is to reduce the}} time needed to evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30years, to two or three days.|$|E
5|$|Paulinus' missionary <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> {{difficult}} to evaluate. Bede {{implies that the}} mission in Northumbria was successful, {{but there is little}} supporting evidence, and {{it is more likely that}} Paulinus' missionary efforts there were relatively ineffectual. Although Osric, one of Edwin's successors, was converted to Christianity by Paulinus, he returned to paganism after Edwin's death. Hilda, however, remained a Christian, and eventually went on to become abbess of the influential Whitby Abbey. Northumbria's conversion to Christianity was mainly achieved by Irish missionaries brought into the region by Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald.|$|E
5|$|Plankton is an {{intellectual}} planktonic copepod {{who runs the}} unsuccessful Chum Bucket restaurant alongside Karen, who is a talking supercomputer. Plankton is the arch-rival of Mr. Krabs, who owns the far more profitable Krusty Krab restaurant and sells a fictional burger called the Krabby Patty. Plankton and Karen often devise schemes to steal the secret Krabby Patty recipe, but their <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> always thwarted by Krabs and his employees.|$|E
50|$|During the 1920s, an <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessfully made to make Avery’s Hill into a park. In 1976, after private {{ownership}} of the land had changed hands, an <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> successfully made to prevent further tilling and destruction of the scenic area.|$|R
50|$|Various {{fundraising}} <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> {{required to}} allow the Australian athletes to compete at Heidelberg. Among these fundraising <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> exhibitions from the ‘Amazing Wheelchair Wizards’, who would challenge local darts teams to tournaments and put on displays of trick archery shooting.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> to {{investigate}} the Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) operation under various conditions to determine what effect, if any, there is on the TIMS performance. This <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> undertaken because of reports from investigators that the TIMS is not performing as expected when flown on the ARC C- 130. This <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> initiated with a meeting at Stennis Space Center (SSC) with representatives from SSC, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and ARC...|$|R
5|$|The 610 Office's {{intelligence}} collection <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> bolstered through he cultivation of paid civilian informants. 610 Offices at local levels {{have been found}} to offer substantial monetary rewards for information leading to the capture of Falun Gong practitioners, and 24-hour hotlines have been created for civilians to report on Falun Gong-related activity. In some locales, 'responsibility measures' are enacted whereby workplaces, schools, neighborhood committees and families are held accountable for monitoring and reporting on Falun Gong practitioners within their ranks.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} {{literacy}} {{in the last}} decade of the twentieth century was particularly remarkable with special emphasis on the eradication of illiteracy. While it is feared that Birbhum may not be able to fulfill the national objective of sending all children in the age group 6–14 years to school by 2010, <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> on in that direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{red deer}} {{population}} {{has been the subject}} of research for many years, recently under the leadership of Tim Clutton-Brock of the University of Cambridge. These <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> based at the remote bay of Kilmory in the north of the island. It has been important in the development of sociobiology and behavioural ecology, particularly in relation to the understanding of aggression through game theory.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the growing}} {{backlash}} in American society against communism in the 1940s and 1950s, new <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> made to introduce Christianity into the Constitution, although these <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> {{now in the}} form of standard constitutional amendments.

40|$|By definition, giving 100 % effort all of {{the time}} is sustainable, but begs the {{question}} of how to define 100 % effort. As a corollary, once a benchmark for defining 100 % <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> chosen, it may be possible, even optimal, to give a greater amount of effort for a short period of time, while recognizing that this level of <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> not sustainable. This dynamic <b>effort</b> provision problem <b>is</b> analyzed in the context of effort and performance by National Basketball Association (NBA) players over the course of a season. Within this context, several benchmarks for sustainable <b>effort</b> <b>are</b> considered, but these are rejected by the data. Meanwhile, the data are consistent with the proposition that NBA players put forth optimal effort, even if such <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> not always sustainable. Sports, NBA, effort...|$|R
50|$|During World War II many <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> {{expended}} in {{the electronic}} location of enemy targets and aircraft. These included radio beam guidance of bombers, electronic counter measures, early radar systems etc. During this time very little if any <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> expended on consumer electronics developments.|$|R
5|$|Unlike audible {{signatures}}, tornadic signatures {{have been}} isolated; {{due to the}} long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. Tornadoes also produce a detectable seismic signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process.|$|E
5|$|We {{believe the}} enemy has {{undoubtedly}} suffered a crushing defeat. We thank Admiral Kinkaid for his intervention yesterday. We thank Lee for his sturdy effort last night. Our own aircraft has been grand in its relentless hammering of the foe. All those <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> appreciated but our greatest homage goes to Callaghan, Scott and their men who with magnificent courage against seemingly hopeless odds drove back the first hostile attack and {{paved the way}} for the success to follow. To them the men of Cactus lift their battered helmets in deepest admiration.|$|E
5|$|With the {{cooperation}} of the United States Department of Agriculture, <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> under way to promote G.brachycera as a groundcover for use in landscaping. Box huckleberry is commercially available from at least one source {{but it is difficult to}} propagate, making it unprofitable for many nurseries to carry. In New Bloomfield, PA, the box huckleberry has become part of the local New Year's celebrations, as a papier-mâché replica of a huckleberry is dropped, instead of a ball, to mark the new year.|$|E
