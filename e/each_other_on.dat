Martel and Santana faced <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> the November 11 episode of Wrestling Challenge, and Roberts interfered. Unable to see clearly, he accidentally attacked Santana but vowed revenge against Martel. Bad News Brown left the WWF after SummerSlam, citing broken promises as his reason.|$|E

5|$|Evolve uses an {{asymmetrical}} multiplayer structure, where five players—four {{playing as}} hunters and one as the monster—battle against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> an industrialized alien planet called Shear. The hunters' gameplay {{is based on}} the first-person shooter design, while the monsters are controlled from a third-person perspective. The hunters' goal is to eliminate the monster, while the monster's goal is to consume wildlife and evolve to make themselves stronger. The game can be played alone or with multiple players.|$|E

Despite repeated pleas from Lincoln and Halleck, which continued over the next week, Meade did not pursue Lee's army aggressively enough to destroy it before it crossed back over the Potomac River to safety in the South. The campaign continued into Virginia with light engagements until July 23, in the minor Battle of Manassas Gap, after which Meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions across from <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> the Rappahannock River.|$|E

Slaughter and Volkoff also faced <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> many house shows throughout {{the second half of}} 1990.

The two species typically encounter <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, brown hyenas will stand their ground {{and raise their}} manes while emitting growls. This usually {{has the effect of}} seemingly confusing spotted hyenas, which will act bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between spotted and striped hyenas in the Serengeti.|$|E

This was Lord's only {{appearance}} as Leiter, as he asked for more money and a better billing to return as Leiter in Goldfinger and was subsequently replaced.|$|E

As in his earlier life, Reitz remained a man of outspoken convictions, which he aired freely.

5|$|An Assisted Elopement is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Gladys and Charlie who meet <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> the train home and they become romantically interested in each other. It turns out their parents are friends and wish {{for them to get}} married, souring the relationship between them. In a ploy to get their children to elope, the fathers become bitter enemies in public and the couple elopes much to their enjoyment and intention. A surviving film still shows several of members of the cast, including Frank H. Crane, Violet Heming, and Alphonse Ethier. The film was released on August 30, 1910 and saw a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

With Will now forever bound to escort souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> the beach of an abandoned island.

Baljit Sahni scored the opening goal in the 22nd minute before Iain Hume {{equalized}} for the Blasters to earn the Blasters their first point of the season. In the second game, on 21 November 2014, it was the Kerala Blasters who came out on top as 2–1 winners. Iain Hume and Pedro Gusmão gave the Blasters the 2–0 lead before Fikru Teferra scored the consolation for Kolkata.|$|E

5|$|Booth was not {{cleared for}} full-contact {{practice}} with the team until January 25, 2010.

The game included four fights, including one between Panthers defenceman and captain Bryan McCabe and Richards. The teams met again with Booth in the lineup on March 3, 2010. After fighting Richards in the first period (one of four fights in the game and Booth's first in the NHL), Booth scored a goal and three assists (completing a Gordie Howe hat trick) to help the Panthers to a 7–4 win.|$|E
5|$|By 1153, {{the castle}} {{garrison}} was running very low on food, and Roger {{made a deal}} with Stephen allowing him to leave the castle with his followers. Henry, the Empress' son and the future Henry II, then intervened, marching his forces to relieve the castle and placing Stephen's counter-castles under siege himself. King Stephen marched back from Oxford, and the two forces confronted <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> the meadows outside the castle. The result was an embryonic peace deal called the Treaty of Wallingford, leading on to the permanent Treaty of Winchester that would ultimately {{bring an end to the}} civil war and install Henry as king following Stephen's death in 1153. Brien, who had no children, chose to enter a monastery, and surrendered Wallingford Castle to Henry at the end of the conflict in 1153.|$|E
5|$|Casualties in {{the battle}} are {{notoriously}} hard to calculate exactly. With only one exception (Scipion), records made by the French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-André and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither {{of which can be}} treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200.|$|E
