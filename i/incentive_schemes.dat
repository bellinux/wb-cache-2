25|$|The {{existence}} of strong reciprocity implies that systems developed based purely on material self-interest may be missing important motivators in the marketplace. This section gives {{two examples of}} possible implications. One area of application is {{in the design of}} <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes.</b> For example, standard contract theory has difficulty dealing with the degree of incompleteness in contracts and the lack of use of performance measures, even when they are cheap to implement. Strong reciprocity and models based on it suggest that this can be explained by people's willingness to act fairly, even when it is against their material self-interest. Experimental results suggest that this is indeed the case, with participants preferring less complete contracts, and workers willing to contribute a fair amount beyond what would be in their own self-interest.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} a Fuel Automobile (FA) {{supply chain}} and an electric-and-fuel automobile supply chain in a duopoly setting, under a government 2 ̆ 7 s subsidy <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> that is implemented {{to promote the}} use of Electric Automobiles (EAs) for the control of air pollution. Benefiting from such a scheme, each EA consumer can enjoy a subsidy from the government. It is shown that the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> is more effective in increasing the sales of EAs when consumers 2 ̆ 7 bargaining power is stronger. The impact of the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> on consumers 2 ̆ 7 net surplus is the largest among all components in the social welfare. A higher subsidy may not result in a greater reduction in the environmental hazard. Moreover, {{a larger number of}} service and charging stations can reduce the negative impact of the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> on the FA market while enhancing its positive impact on the EA market. An <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> with the centralized control with no subsidy is also considered and it is found that the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> is more effective in promoting EAs and protecting the environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper treats illegal {{landings}} as a {{moral hazard}} problem that arises, since individual catches are unobservable to society and hence private information. A tax/subsidy mechanism {{taking into account the}} asymmetric information problem is formulated as a solution to problems with illegal landings. The <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> uses fish stock size as the tax variable, and can be seen as an alternative to a control policy. Rough estimates from a simulation study suggest that the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> is potentially useful. The <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> also has potential application as an instrument to the solution of by-catch and discard problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Our {{purpose is}} to explore how {{performance}} in Swedish financial companies {{is affected by the}} presence of a female chief executive officer (CEO), the presence of an <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme,</b> and the proportion of female board members. The results indicate that a female CEO is associated with a lower return on equity (ROE) and a lower Tobin’s Q, but we find no significant association between the proportion of female board members and firm performance. An <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> is generally associated with a lower return on assets (ROA) and a higher Tobin’s Q. In particular, a share-based <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> is associated with a lower ROA, a lower ROE, and a higher Tobin’s Q...|$|R

Group rewards generally lead to higher expected emissions than individual rewards. The attraction of the group reward scheme may lie in its fairness and its tough-looking targets.

The principal updates the <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> aft er {{observing the}} agent's first-period performance. The agent has superio r {{information about his}} ability. The principal offers a first-period <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> and observes some measure of the agent's first-perio d performance (cost or profit), which depends on the agent's ability an d (unobservable) first-period effort.

40|$|One {{conclusion}} {{from the}} EU-OSHA economic incentives project is that <b>incentives</b> <b>schemes</b> {{should not only}} reward past results of good OSH management (such as accident numbers in experience rating), but should also reward specific prevention efforts that aim to reduce future accidents and ill-health. Experts from the economic incentives project therefore suggested the development of compilations of innovative and evidence-based preventive solutions, starting with the three sectors construction, health care and HORECA (hotels, restaurants, catering). The preventive measures from these compilations are worth promoting in their own right, {{as well as being}} applied in economic <b>incentives</b> <b>schemes.</b> These preventive solutions {{can be used as a}} basis for incentive-providing organisations to develop their own <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme,</b> adapted to the specific situation in their sector and country...|$|R
