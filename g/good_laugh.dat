5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a <b>good</b> <b>laugh.</b> It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
25|$|Known {{for being}} team players, Ron and Fez worked on split shifts, did drop-ins for WJFK's Redskins broadcasts, did live {{commercials}} and appearances, and helped mentor the hosts of a weekend show (later to become weeknight show), The Hideout. A {{good relationship with}} lead-in show Don and Mike, along with improved call-ins, freshly funny bits, and a community needing a <b>good</b> <b>laugh</b> during the 2004 presidential election propelled Ron and Fez to stellar ratings in January 2005.|$|E
500|$|From {{the text}} itself, the ending is ambiguous: {{according}} to one view, Batman breaks the Joker's neck out of panel, causing the laughter to stop abruptly. Some people theorise that the title, [...] "The Killing Joke" [...] is {{in reference to the}} ending scene, in which The Joker and Batman laugh, over a joke, thus triggering Batman to kill The Joker. According to another view, Batman and the Joker, who have been fighting for years, end all of their disputes by having a <b>good</b> <b>laugh</b> about it all. Still another theory maintains that the first and last panels of the book are both purposely of rain falling on the ground, which symbolizes that nothing has changed except for the two parties' respect for each other.|$|E
50|$|Humour was an {{important}} element of Tillieux's work even in his detective stories. At their best Félix and Gil Jourdan could provide <b>good</b> <b>laughs</b> as well as good adventures and mysteries.|$|R
5000|$|Sawit {{describes}} Saving Sally as a [...] "fun {{and straightforward}} love story, with <b>good</b> <b>laughs</b> and visual gags" [...] on face value which makes references to both Philippine and Western pop culture but adds {{that it also}} tackles darker themes such as escapism and physical abuse.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film three stars, saying, [...] "It's worth seeing for the acting, and it's got some <b>good</b> <b>laughs</b> in it, and New York is colorfully observed, but don't {{tell me this}} movie is about human nature, because it's not; it's about acting." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{recording}} Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too, Alexander {{stated that}} he [...] "completely ripped up the rules that applied to [...] first two records." [...] While the album was credited to the New Radicals, it is often {{considered to be a}} Gregg Alexander album, as he wrote and produced most of its songs, played several instruments on it, and is the only constant member of the band. In reference to the wide variety of musicians he recruited to record the album, Alexander stated, [...] "Most of that record was me pulling favors with studios or musicians that had played on earlier records and were like, 'Oh, Gregg's down on his luck — let's go play on his demo for the hell of it, we'll have a <b>good</b> <b>laugh,</b> have a couple of beers and maybe smoke a jay or whatever.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Wenger's first {{match was}} a 2–0 away victory over Blackburn Rovers on 12 October 1996, however, he did suggest [...] "one or two changes" [...] to Rice in Arsenal's UEFA Cup defeat to Borussia Mönchengladbach on 25 September, nine {{days prior to}} taking charge of the club. The {{interference}} upset club captain Tony Adams, who on {{his first meeting with}} the manager expressed his disappointment: [...] "I said to him that he had put our entire season in jeopardy by doing what he had done." [...] Wenger chose to take the criticism on board upon arrival, and made an effort listening to Adams' assessment of the club. This particular approach of management resonated with the other players, who were sceptical of his ideas at first. The English players often set up pranks on Wenger to relieve hostility and nicknamed him [...] "Inspector Clouseau", due to his clumsy nature. Adams said his sense of humour helped build team spirit: [...] "Not only does Wenger love a <b>good</b> <b>laugh,</b> but he can laugh at himself. He is this gangly wise man".|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... and I thought he was a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out. If I run into him again, we can have a <b>good</b> <b>laugh</b> about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E
5000|$|After their shock wore off, Hubert Zervas recalled, [...] "Her {{parents were}} highly edified at her composure, her {{resignation}} to her condition… and her joyful bearing of an affliction sent by a loving Providence. They remained {{with her two}} days, and had many <b>good</b> <b>laughs</b> at Sister Annella’s witty remarks." ...|$|R

2500|$|Mays was {{mentioned}} numerous times in Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts. One {{of the most}} famous of these strips was originally published on February 9, 1966. In it, Charlie Brown is competing in a class spelling bee and he is asked to spell the word, [...] "Maze". He erroneously spells it M-A-Y-S and screams out his dismay when he is eliminated. When Charlie Brown is later sent to the principal's office for raising his voice at the teacher regarding the incident, he wonders if one day he will meet Willie Mays and will have a <b>good</b> <b>laugh</b> together about the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Another [...] "feud" [...] {{seemed to}} be looming when, in one run of Sunday strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip Mary Worth as [...] "Mary Worm." [...] The title {{character}} was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody. Allen Saunders, {{the creator of the}} Mary Worth strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character [...] "Hal Rapp," [...] a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist, (Capp was a teetotaler). Later, it was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders [...] "feud" [...] fooled both editors and readers, generated plenty of free publicity for both strips—and Capp and Saunders had a <b>good</b> <b>laugh</b> when all was revealed.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1956 Lady Avon {{hosted a}} dinner at Chequers for the visiting Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin. Khrushchev noted that Lady Avon's (sober) {{behaviour}} contradicted briefing from the Soviet Embassy in London that she shared some of Winston Churchill's [...] "traits {{in the matter}} of drinking". Over dinner (when, according to his hostess, he ate nothing despite his reputation for eating and drinking greedily), he responded rather bluntly to her question about the range of Soviet missiles that [...] "they could easily reach your island and quite a bit farther". The following morning Khrushchev mistook Lady Avon's room for Bulganin's but, having provoked a cry after almost walking in on her, beat a hasty retreat and did not identify himself. He confided later in Bulganin with whom he [...] "had a <b>good</b> <b>laugh</b> over the incident".|$|E
5000|$|The A.V. Clubs Marcus Gilmer {{awarded the}} episode a grade of B-, {{summarizing}} his review with: [...] "Despite some <b>good</b> <b>laughs,</b> it wastes a great premise {{by trying to}} do too much. Sometimes, it's okay to just slim it down and let the jokes fly. Sometimes, it's okay to leave the real world out of it; the show has always done just fine staying within its own universe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why Charlie, your explosions {{illustrate}} my remarks {{almost as}} aptly as the chemist's imitation volcano did his lectures. But even if experience did not sanction the proverb, that a <b>good</b> <b>laugher</b> cannot {{be a bad}} man, I should yet feel bound in confidence to believe it, since it is a saying current among the people, and I doubt not originated among them, and hence must be true; for {{the voice of the}} people is the voice of truth. Don't you think so?" ...|$|R

2500|$|According to Vikernes, the {{anonymous}} interview was planned {{by himself and}} Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete. At the time, Burzum was about to release the Aske mini-album. Vikernes said of the interview: [...] "I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we [...] had a <b>good</b> <b>laugh,</b> because he didn't seem to understand that I was pulling his leg". He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, [...] "the journalist edited the interview and [...] published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it." [...] Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Jørn Inge Tunsberg of Hades said that the interview had [...] "grave consequences" [...] {{for the rest of}} the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as [...] "he had said nothing". He added that they became [...] "bloody angry" [...] and he, Tunsberg, was [...] "pissed off".|$|E
2500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. In his review for IGN, contributor Colin Moriarty {{stated that the}} episode was [...] "as strong as we've come to expect in recent weeks" [...] and called it [...] "undeniably fun to watch and {{has the ability to}} get a laugh out of you even if you're in the worst of moods". Moriarty praised the chemistry that was developing between the actors, and hoped that [...] "all of the characters will get more involved to really see where they are all going". He hoped that the show [...] "ends on the high note it's been reaching towards rather than heading towards a decrescendo that hurts many a promising show" [...] and added that [...] "in the meantime, check out this episode for a <b>good</b> <b>laugh,</b> and wait patiently for the culmination of the first season". Overall, the installment was given a rating of 8, or [...] "great", tying it for the best rated episode of the show {{at the time of the}} review; it was rated as being equal to the preceding episode, [...] "Weekend Warriors".|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Mail ran {{the story}} again on 20/October, {{comparing}} Haringey council to Nazi Germany. [...] Again, the council attempted {{to set the}} record straight, with a press statement that noted the irony of the Daily Mail comparing the council to Nazi Germany when the Mail itself had supported Hitler right up until the eve of World War II. [...] And again, only the British black community newspapers (the 3 November Asian Herald and the 5 November West Indian News) carried Haringey council's corrections. [...] The story continued to be carried by many newspapers for months thereafter, including The Economist on 1 November and the Islington Gazette on 20 February 1987, this time with Islington council as the ban-issuer, a fact that was explicitly denied by a council spokesman in the piece, who said [...] "it is not council policy to ban Baa Baa Black Sheep but if individual nursery workers find it offensive the council is {{not in the business of}} forcing them to teach that rhyme rather than others." [...] The Daily Express carried the new Islington variant on the same day ("School bars boy's Baa-baa Black Sheep 'racist' rhyme"), as did the Daily Telegraph ("Boy's first rhyme upsets nursery staff"), the Daily Mirror ("Baa Baa blacked"), and the Sun ("Baa Baa nursery ban on sad little Dan"), whose lead article the next day then began with [...] "Loony left councils have given us a <b>good</b> <b>laugh</b> over the years." ...|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, [...] "The plot ... {{sounds like}} a gimmick. That's {{because it is a}} gimmick. But it's a good gimmick. And Rumor Has It works for good reasons, {{including}} sound construction and the presence of Kevin Costner ... a natural actor with enormous appeal ... This is not a great movie, but it's very watchable and has some <b>good</b> <b>laughs.</b> The casting of Aniston is crucial, because she's the heroine of this story, and ... has the presence to pull it off." ...|$|R
50|$|While {{living in}} Albuquerque {{he went to}} an open mike night at Laffs comedy club and figured he could do {{just as well as}} some of the people he was seeing there. The host of the open mike night was Marc Maron. He went on stage and got some <b>good</b> <b>laughs</b> and was soon {{spending}} all the time he could at the club and fighting for stage time. Becka spent a number of years on the road as a stand up comic, working with acts including Jerry Seinfeld, Sam Kinnison and Lewis Black.|$|R

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "The movie {{passes the}} time pleasantly {{and has a}} few <b>good</b> <b>laughs</b> ... But the {{screenplay}} relies {{too much on the}} first level of its premise and doesn't push into unexpected places. Once we get the setup, we can more or less anticipate the sitcom payoff, and there aren't the kinds of surprises, reversals and explosions of slapstick that made La Cage Aux Folles so funny. In the rating system of the Michelin Guide, it's worth a look, but not a detour or a journey." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{political}} {{comedy is}} directed by Jang Jin, well known for using a unique sense of humor to add spice to a plot, poking fun at politics, and providing some <b>good</b> <b>laughs.</b> On top of good humor and laughter, the movie presents the director's ideal vision of how Korean presidents should be. The three presidents depicted in the movie are charismatic, moral and unselfish, although they agonize over their choices between public interest and personal happiness. The director, who also wrote the script, said it was free of political ideology and instead was a [...] "fun movie everyone can enjoy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kill Your Stereo's {{review of}} the album was also positive, {{awarding}} the album a score of 85/100. The review states that [...] "if you’re {{a fan of the}} current pop-punk, Warped Tour era of bands and you grew up on the [...] "veteran" [...] bands of this scene, then ‘Friendville’ {{is really going to be}} for you", commenting on the album's humour by adding that Friendville is [...] "a genuinely funny record that will pump you up, make you bang your head and have some <b>good</b> <b>laughs,</b> and sometimes all of those will happen at the same time." ...|$|R

50|$|Cassie and Jake are dragged {{along by}} Rachel {{and the others}} to the school dance. They have a few <b>good</b> <b>laughs</b> when Ax's unfamiliarity with human culture scares {{away some of the}} crowd. The {{laughter}} stops, however, when he demorphs involuntarily. It soon becomes apparent that Ax is suffering from an inflamed Tria gland (as well as a fever)—much like the lymphatic tonsils in the human mouth. Unlike humans, though, this gland is located at the back of Ax's brain. If it bursts, it will cause irreversible and fatal damage to the brain. Cassie hides the sick alien in her barn, and Erek the Chee erects a hologram around them both.|$|R
