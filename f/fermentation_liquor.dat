40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis was chosen {{originally}} {{as a result of}} a suggestion made by a manufacturer of lactic acid.

There was no reference in the literature to the electrolysis of calcium lactate, and little reference to the electrolysis of lactates in general, and what there was appeared to be conflicting, so it was decided to continue the investigation into the subject in order to determine what are the products of the anodic oxidation of calcium lactate.

The greater degree of microbial metabolism because of a longer, higher temperature conversion phase of incubation is also said to provide certain organoleptic qualities that would be otherwise unachievable in the final distilled liquor. This also directly relates to the greater use of Daqu as an ingredient in making Baiijou rather than simply as an inoculant. Daqu typically constitutes 15-25% of the overall fermentables, whereas Xiaoqu is used only to inoculate a fermentation (3-8%).

The pH of the diluted rumen liquor at the beginning of each fermentation was adjusted to 7. 0 with 5 N NaOH or 5. 5 with 3 N HCl. The EO blend was added to each fermentation tube at doses of 8, 16, 24 and 32 μl/tube, equivalent to 160, 320, 480 and 640 μl/l, using 3 tubes for each dosage level plus 3 tubes without EO as controls (i. e., 30 tubes in total/run). After 24 h of incubation, <b>fermentation</b> <b>liquor</b> was collected and analyzed for volatile fatty acids (VFA), ammonia N and pH. In both experiments, pH and ammonia N concentration of the <b>fermentation</b> <b>liquor</b> were lower (P< 0. 01) at the initial pH of 5. 5. The reduction of initial pH from 7. 0 to 5. 5 depressed VFA yield (138 mM versus 120 mM and 132 mM versus 111 mM, P< 0. 01, respectively, for DC and FB rumen liquors), and modified end products of fermentation by lowering the acetate:propionate ratio (4. 3 versus 3. 6 and 3. 2 versus 2. 5, P< 0. 01, respectively, for DC and FB rumen liquors). Butyrate concentration was higher at the lower pH in the DC rumen liquor fermentation (22. 4 mM/ 100 mM versus 16. 2 mM/ 100 mM, P< 0. 01), but not in the FB fermentation. In both experiments, addition of the EO blend did not depress total VFA concentrations, except at the highest dose in the experiment with rumen fluid from DC (122 mM versus 128 mM, P< 0. 01). In both experiments, there was an interaction (P< 0. 01) between EO addition and initial pH on acetate proportion; at the initial pH of 5. 5, EO addition decreased acetate from 65. 0 to 63. 9 and from 62. 6 to 61. 8 mM/ 100 mM, respectively, for DC and FB rumen liquors, while there were no effects of EO at the initial pH of 7. 0. In the experiment with DC rumen liquid, EO addition tended (P< 0. 08) to increase propionate proportion (from 16. 1 to 16. 6 mM/ 100 mM), while there was no effect in FB rumen liquid.

Purified Bacillus thuringiensis crystals that were exposed to <b>fermentation</b> <b>liquor</b> after cell lysis were more quickly degraded by sunlight than were crystals from cells that were lysed in water. This effect is attributed to adsorption of chromophores by crystals exposed to the fermenter liquor and the subsequent ability of these chromophores to act as photosensitizers. The importance of a photosensitization mechanism in crystal degradation was further emphasized by irradiating Bacillus thuringiensis crystals in vacuo. The latter crystals were found to be less damaged (20 % tryptophan loss after 24 h irradiation by the solar spectrum) compared with crystals from the same sample irradiated in air (60 % (60 % tryptophan loss). Other methods of decreasing exposure of the crystals to oxygen, e. g. by using glycerol as a humectant, were also found to be successful in controlling photodamage. The results concerning photodegradation support a photosensitization mechanism involving the presence of exogenous (and possibly endogenous) chromophores which create singlet oxygen species upon irradiation by light...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{impurities}} in the {{fermentation broth}} of antibiotic production impose great {{difficulties in the}} crystallization and recovery of antibiotics from the concentrated waste liquor. In the present laboratory study, the inhibitory effect of biopolymers on antibiotic crystallization was investigated using oxytetracycline (OTC) as the model antibiotic. Organic impurities separated from actual OTC <b>fermentation</b> waste <b>liquor</b> by ultrafiltration were dosed into a pure OTC solution at various concentrations. The results demonstrated that small organic molecules with an apparent molecular weight (AMW) of below 10, 000 Da did not affect OTC crystallization significantly. However, large biopolymers, especially poly saccharides, in the fermentation waste caused severe retardation {{of crystal growth and}} considerable deterioration in the purity of the OTC crystallized. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that OTC nuclei formed in the solution attached to the surfaces of large organic molecules, probably polysaccharides, instead of being surrounded by proteins as previously thought. It is proposed that the attachment of OTC nuclei to biopolymers would prevent OTC from rapid crystallization, resulting in a high OTC residue in the aqueous phase. In addition, the adsorption of OTC clusters onto biopolymers would destabilize the colloidal system of organic macromolecules and promote particle flocculation. OTC crystallization would therefore take place with the precipitation of abundant organic impurities. Hence, the removal of polysaccharides and other biopolymers by ultrafiltration can be an effective means of improving the recovery of OTC and similar antibiotics by crystallization from the fermentation waste.

40|$|Cacha a is the {{denomination}} {{of a typical}} and exclusive Brazilian spirit produced from the distillation of fermented sugarcane juice must. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of adding yeast extract to the sugarcane juice used for sugarcane liquor production, because for the artisanal process no studies are available on nitrogen addition nor beverage quality, involving nitrogen complementation. Results of previous studies in the laboratory scale showed that sugarcane juice complementation with proteic nitrogen can be a beneficial practice for yeast multiplication and cellular growth, and also for the improvement of <b>fermentation</b> yield and <b>liquor</b> productivity. In this pilot scale study, using recycled yeast, the addition of proteic nitrogen influenced positively the cell viability, confirmed the yeast recycling operation, and also reduced the fermentation time. The proteic nitrogen addition did not affect the sensory acceptance of the distillate, and did not change the contents of volatile compounds, indicating that assimilable forms of proteic nitrogen can be helpfull to improve the alcoholic fermentation for cachaca production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the efficacy of our Bacillus cereus isolate (NRRL 100132) in reducing concentrations of nitrogenous wastes and inhibiting growth of fish pathogens. In vivo efficacy and tolerance {{to a range of}} physiological conditions in systems used to rear Cyprinus carpio make this isolate an excellent candidate for aquaculture applications. Production cost is an impor-tant consideration in development of commercially relevant biological products, and this study examines the optimiza-tion of nutrient supplementation, which has an impact on high-density production of spores by <b>fermentation.</b> Corn steep <b>liquor</b> (CSL) was identified as a lower cost and more effective nutrient source in comparison to conventional nutrient substrates, in particular yeast extract and nutrient broth. The improved sporulation performance of B. cereus could be related to the increased availability of free amino acids, carbohydrates, and minerals in CSL, which had a positive effect on sporulation efficiency. The impact of nutrient concentration on spore yield and productivity was modeled to develop a tool for optimization of nutrient concentration in fermentation. An excellent fit of the model was confirmed in laboratory fermentation studies. A cost comparison revealed that production using liquid phytase and ultrafiltered-treated CSL was less expensive than spray-dried CSL and supported cultivation of B. cereus spores at densities higher than 1 × 1010 CFU ml− 1...|$|R
