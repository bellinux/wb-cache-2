5|$|Angelou {{followed}} her first two installations of her autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969) and Gather Together in My Name (1974), with Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, published in 1976.

She also published two volumes of poetry entitled Just <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975).|$|E
5|$|The Heart of a Woman, {{published}} in 1981, {{is the fourth}} installment of Maya Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The success of her previous autobiographies and the publication of three volumes of poetry had brought Angelou {{a considerable amount of}} fame by 1981. And Still I Rise, her third volume of poetry, was {{published in}} 1978 and reinforced Angelou's success as a writer. Her first volume of poetry, Just <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.|$|E

5|$|Stossel {{has written}} three books. <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel– Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails– But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.|$|E

25|$|I have {{a sinking}} fastball {{to either side}} of the plate, a cutter (which changes the {{direction}} of my fastball so it breaks instead of sinking), {{to either side of}} the plate, a curveball I throw at three speeds and three angles, a straight change—using the same arm speed and position as a fastball but with a grip and a release that slows it dramatically, and changeups to different locations that I throw off my sinker which look like batting practice fastballs. Different locations, different speeds, and slightly different arm angles on all those pitches <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> wide palette of choices.|$|E

500|$|Angelou chose [...] "Just <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" [...] as the volume's title {{because of}} her {{interest}} in unconscious innocence, which she says is [...] "even lovelier than trying to remain innocent." [...] The title is a reference to her belief that [...] "we as individuals... are still so innocent that we think if we asked our murderer just before he puts the final wrench upon the throat, 'Would you please <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> cool drink of water?' and he would do so'". [...] Angelou has said that if she [...] "didn't believe that, [...] wouldn't {{get up in the}} morning".|$|E

500|$|Angelou began, {{early in}} her writing career, {{alternating}} the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. [...] Her first volume of poetry, Just <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which {{was nominated for a}} Pulitzer Prize, followed her first autobiography, and Oh Pray followed the publication of her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name (1974). [...] Her publisher, Random House, placed the poems in Oh Pray in her first collection of poetry, The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou (1994), perhaps to capitalize on her popularity following her reading of her poem [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993. [...] Also in the 1994 collection was Just <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie and two more published after Oh Pray, And Still I Rise (1978) and Shaker, Why Don't You Sing? (1983). [...] Angelou's publisher placed four more poems in a smaller volume, entitled Phenomenal Woman, in 1995.|$|E
500|$|Angelou's {{long and}} {{extensive}} career also included poetry, plays, screenplays for television and film, directing, acting, and public speaking. [...] She was a prolific writer of poetry; her volume Just <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971) {{was nominated for}} the Pulitzer Prize, and she was chosen by President Bill Clinton to recite her poem [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] during his inauguration in 1993.|$|E
500|$|Just <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie is Maya Angelou's {{first volume}} of poetry. [...] She studied and began writing poetry at a young age. [...] After her rape {{at the age of}} eight, as recounted in her first {{autobiography}} I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, she dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature, including poetry, which helped bring her out her self-imposed muteness.|$|E
