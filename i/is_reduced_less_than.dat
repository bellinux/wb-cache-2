Using a 2 -D wave-current coupling hydrodynamic model of the Mike 21 software package, the hydrodynamics condition on the Pingang Operation Area of Baima Port in the Sanduao Bay is simulatated. The {{results show that the}} current field in the berth is smooth that is beneficial to maintenance of water depth and reduction of siltation in berth. And the velocity in reclamation and dredging area <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 05 m/s. the reclamation near the coastline and dredging in the berth make the velocity varied and the varying range is between 0. 3 m/s and 0. 4 m/s...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} recent {{progress}} of the FZP (Fresnel Zone Plate) beam profile monitor constructed at KEK-ATF damping ring. This monitor {{is based on an}} X-ray imaging optics with two FZPs [1]. In this monitor, the transverse electron beam image at bending magnet is twenty-times magnified by the two FZPs and detected on an X-ray CCD camera. The expected spatial resolution is less than 1 µm in R. M. S. Recently, we install the new mechanical shut-ter to improve time resolution of the monitor and avoid the effects of the short-term movement of beam or the mon-itor itself. By applying this shutter, the shutter opening time <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1 ms and the beam profile could be measured more accurately.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} form of static charge {{susceptibility}} χ(q) in underdoped cuprates near axial momenta (Q, 0) and (0,Q) at which short-range static charge order has been observed. We show that the momentum dependence of χ (q) is anisotropic, and the correlation length in the longitudinal direction is larger than in the transverse direction. We show that correlation lengths in both directions decrease once the system evolves into a superconductor, {{as a result of}} the competition between superconductivity and charge order. These results are in agreement with resonant x-ray scattering data [R. Comin et al., Science 347, 1335 (2015) ]. We also argue that density and current components of the charge order parameter are affected differently by superconductivity [...] - the charge-density component <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the current component and hence extends deeper into the superconducting state.

40|$|When a {{gravitational}} wave (GW) {{from a distant}} source propagates through the universe, its amplitude and phase change due to gravitational lensing by the inhomogeneous mass distribution. We derive the amplitude and phase fluctuations, and calculate these variances {{in the limit of}} a weak gravitational field of density perturbation. If the scale of the perturbation is smaller than the Fresnel scale ∼ 100 pc(f/mHz) − 1 / 2 (f is the GW frequency), the GW is not magnified due to the diffraction effect. The rms amplitude fluctuation is 1 − 10 % for f> 10 − 10 Hz, but it <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 5 % for a very low frequency of f < 10 − 12 Hz. The rms phase fluctuation in the chirp signal is ∼ 10 − 3 radian at LISA frequency band (10 − 5 − 10 − 1 Hz). Measurements of these fluctuations will provide information about the matter power spectrum on the Fresnel scale ∼ 100 pc.

40|$|Background: Hypertension {{is common}} after liver transplantation. There are few {{published}} data on optimum treatment. Augmentation index (AIx) {{is a measure}} of arterial wave reflection determined by pulse wave analysis. Methods: Amlodipine was administered to 24 hypertensive liver transplant recipients. Thirteen patients intolerant of or unresponsive to amlodipine were randomized to a crossover study comparing bisoprolol with lisinopril. Results: With amlodipine, systolic blood pressure (SBP) fell from 154 +/- 2 mm Hg to 130 +/- 2 mm Hg, and AIx also fell. With bisoprolol, SBP fell from 154 +/- 2 mm Hg to 142 +/- 4 mm Hg, but AIx increased. With lisinopril, SBP fell from 154 +/- 2 mm Hg to 130 +/- 5 mm Hg, and AIx also fell (P < 0. 001 throughout). Conclusions: Amlodipine is an effective treatment for hypertension. The increased AIx with bisoprolol indicates increased wave reflection such that central aortic pressure <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> peripheral SBP. Lisinopril reduces AIx and reduces SBP more than bisoprolol and is the preferred drug...|$|E
40|$|PublishedJournal Article© 1983 - 2012 IEEE. The {{capacity}} of cognitive radio (CR) {{systems can be}} enhanced significantly by deploying relay nodes to exploit the spatial diversity. However, the inevitable imperfect sensing in CR has vital effects on the policy of relay selection, channel access, and power allocation that play pivotal roles in the system capacity. The increase in transmission power can improve the system capacity, but results in high energy consumption, which incurs the increase of carbon emission and network operational cost. Most of the existing schemes for CR systems have not jointly considered the imperfect sensing scenario and the tradeoff between the system capacity and energy consumption. To fill in this gap, this paper proposes an energy-aware centralized relay selection scheme {{that takes into account}} the relay selection, channel access, and power allocation jointly in CR with imperfect sensing. Specifically, the CR system is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to achieve the goal of balancing the system capacity and energy consumption as well as maximizing the system reward. The optimal policy for relay selection, channel access, and power allocation is then derived by virtue of a dynamic programming approach. A dimension reduction strategy is further applied to reduce its high computation complexity. Extensive simulation experiments and results are presented and analysed to demonstrate the significant performance improvement compared to the existing schemes. The performance results show that the received reward increases more than 50 % and the network lifetime increases more than 35 %, but the system capacity <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 6 % only.

40|$|In modern {{telecommunication}} systems, {{a constant}} group delay {{is necessary in}} order to avoid signal distortion. Unfortunately, a group delay variation is unavoidable. For example, a band-pass filter in microwave systems will create a group delay variation near the edge of pass band, i. e., in transition areas of the filter. According to simulations of ideal filter components (Q is infinite) in ADS, it shows a 5 th-order Elliptic band-pass filter with stopband rejection of 20 dB and pass-band frequency from 7. 5 GHz to 12. 5 GHz would introduce a maximum group delay variation of 3. 4 ns. System simulations in MATLAB show that it would cost extra power of 0. 8 dB and 1. 6 dB for 4 QAM and 16 QAM modulation respectively, to achieve the same performance (bit-error-rate) as the system without any group delay variation. Therefore, it is necessary to develop so-called group delay equalizers to compensate the variation of the group delay. Analog group delay equalizers are realized based on two methodologies: 1) allpass networks, which are used to generate a positive group delay with desired features; 2) a negative group delay circuit, which is used to compensate group delay variation originating from filters. Unfortunately, the existing negative group delay circuit suffers from a large attenuation in the frequency range where negative group delay occurs. In this thesis, a novel group delay equalizer circuit topology is proposed, to overcome the drawback of large attenuation. It is demonstrated that the proposed negative group delay circuit has a flat amplitude response with a variation less than 0. 6 dB, keeping a feature of negative group delay. As example, the proposed equalizer is used to compensate the group delay variation originating from a low-pass filter with the pass-band from DC to 15 GHz. The simulation result exhibits that the group delay variation of the filter is reduced from 0. 6 ns to 0. 2 ns while the amplitude response <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 53 dB due to losses of the equalizer. For band-pass filters, one more stage of the proposed equalizer is needed in order to compensate the group delay variation in both sides of filters...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that myopia percentages have enormously increased in children populations during last years, especially in East Asia countries. This increasing tendency, {{seem to be the}} result of a combination of several genetic and environmental factors. The main purposes of the certain research are: a) the evaluation of the prevalence of myopic refractive error in children who are regularly physically exercised b) the study of the correlation of ocular biometric parameters, such as the axial length and the mean corneal radius of curvature, with the myopic refraction per age c) the assessment of the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development and progress of myopia d) the correlation study between the visual acuity and sport’s performance and e) the study of the quality of vision at physically exercised children. For this reason a sample consisted of 237 male soccer athletes of the OFI Sport Academy was examined, with age ranging from 7 to 16 years old (Mean age = 10. 95 years, SD = 2. 00 years). The examination procedure included automated refraction (Huvitz HRK 7000), visual acuity measurement (modified ETDRS charts) and optical biometry of the eye (Zeiss IOL Master). Furthermore, several athletes’ personal data was recorded (e. g. training level, dominant eye / leg etc.) and three types of questionnaires were distributed to be fulfilled either by the children, their parents or their coaches. The percentage of myopia prevalence (SER 2 - 0. 75 and VA <: 0. 8) in our sample hardly reached 8. 4 %, significantly lower than the general student population (~ 38 %) (Plainis et al., 2008). A significant negative relationship was found between a) axial length and SER (r = - 0. 49), b) axial length to mean corneal radius of curvature ratio and SER (r = - 0. 70). It was also observed an increasing tense of the axial length in connection with the age (0. 11 mm per year), while mean corneal radius of curvature and visual acuity remained constant. Axial length to mean corneal radius of curvature ratio differed significantly per age group (p < 0. 001), on the other hand SER did not (p = 0. 13). In addition, the percentages of hyperopic athletes decreased significantly according to the age (p = 0. 003), whereas there was not a significant change in myopic percentages (p = 0. 19) even if an increasing tendency was presented. As far as the genetic and the environmental factors which are associated with the prevalence of myopia at athletes are concerned, it was found that parental myopia (p < 0. 001) and higher level of parents’ education (p = 0. 03) was positively correlated with the myopic refractive error of their children. An inverse relationship between the additional athletic activities and the myopic error (p = 0. 04) was also found, while there was no correlation between near work activities (studying, computer usage etc.) and myopia. Furthermore, we concluded that high ability athletes had better VA than low ability athletes (Mean difference: 0. 07 logMAR). Finally it was observed that approximately one out of three athletes: a) has not visited an eye-specialist for more than two years and b) although his visual acuity <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 8 / 10, does not use a refractive correction. The above findings bring out the importance of regular eye check during school age, due to the rapid change of refractive error. In conclusion we would state that the multi factorial character of myopia is confirmed for one more time in this research. The results of modern myopia studies’ are quite ambiguous, i. e. that there are certain points to be more methodically and extensively investigated. The study shows that sports and generally outdoor activities, may have a protective role on myopia prevalence during the school age, thus these issues should be deeper reevaluated and reinvestigated in future research...|$|E
