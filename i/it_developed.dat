5|$|The {{precursor}} {{system that}} would form Dean was a stationary front situated in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico {{in the last week}} of July. On July 27, <b>it</b> <b>developed</b> a weak upper-level circulation indicated by reports from buoys in the Gulf, its structure was disorganized but {{was in the process of}} organizing. The system continued to organize early on July 28, and that afternoon <b>it</b> <b>developed</b> a surface circulation. The tropical depression that spawned Dean was thought to have formed at around 1800 UTC, July 28. It was later declared Tropical Depression Four that same day with the center located about 345miles (555km) southeast of New Orleans.|$|E

It became disorganized on October29, never having intensified beyond winds of 50km/h (30mph). After moving to the southwest for much of its duration, Arilisy dissipated on October30.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean off {{the west coast}} of Africa during the last week of July. As it tracked across the Atlantic, it remained a well-defined system, but never organized into a tropical cyclone. On August8, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico, and by the following day, <b>it</b> <b>developed</b> a weak low-level circulation. The circulation became better defined later that day, and was confirmed by Reconnaissance aircraft that afternoon, when it was declared Tropical Depression Eight while east of Tamaulipas.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 21, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little development. On October 1 it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, and continuing westward <b>it</b> <b>developed</b> an area of persistent convection on October 5. Initially the system was disorganized, although gradual development was expected as conditions in the upper-levels of the atmosphere were expected to become more favorable. On October 7 <b>it</b> <b>developed</b> a broad low pressure area, and by the next day it was located in the eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather; the western portion of the system later developed into Tropical Storm Olivia. The eastern system developed organized convection near its center, and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at 0000UTC on October 9, about 765mi (1235km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on August 9. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and reached the Lesser Antilles on August 15. While passing through the islands, convection greatly increased, causing wind gusts of up to , though it remained disorganized. On August 22, convection organized while the system was over the western Bahamas, and <b>it</b> <b>developed</b> into Tropical Depression Eleven later that day. Conditions were only marginally favorable due to lack of outflow to its west, but the depression strengthened to reach tropical storm status on August 23.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on August13. With a large swirl of low clouds and little convection, the system tracked westward for two weeks across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, before crossing Central America on August22. On August29, the system became better organized, consisting of a broad low pressure area and thunderstorm activity. The convection persisted and organized further, and at 0000UTC on August30 <b>it</b> <b>developed</b> into Tropical Depression Twelve-E about 600mi (970km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.|$|E

Starting as {{a story of a}} historical figure, <b>it</b> <b>developed</b> into a discussion of the poet's own life and opinions. In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, Koło Sprawy Bożej (Circle of God's Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański. This group included, among others, Mickiewicz. Towiański's influence is credited with a new, mystical current in Słowacki's works, seen in works such as the poem Beniowski and the drama Ksiądz Marek (Father Mark). Słowacki left the Circle a year later, in 1843.|$|E

5|$|Blues is a {{combination}} of African work songs, field hollers, and shouts. <b>It</b> <b>developed</b> in the rural South {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century. The most important characteristics of the blues is its use of the blue scale, with a flatted or indeterminate third, as well as the typically lamenting lyrics; though both of these elements had existed in African American folk music prior to the 20th century, the codified form of modern blues (such as with the AAB structure) did not exist until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|By 26 March, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} located within the near-equatorial trough near Papua New Guinea. Initially located within an area of easterly wind shear, it tracked westward due {{to the presence of}} a ridge to its south, and on 27 March a low pressure area formed over Western New Guinea. Thunderstorm activity increased around a mid-level circulation as it crossed into the Arafura Sea, and its overall organisation continued to increase. On 29 March, a low-level circulation was visible, though significant tropical development was prevented due to wind shear and land interaction with islands in the Indonesian archipelago. <b>It</b> <b>developed</b> into a tropical low on 30 March, and after turning to the southwest, it crossed the island of Flores on 31 March; upon doing so its convection greatly increased due to increased upper-level divergence, which produced heavy rainfall on Flores and Timor. On 1 April, wind shear decreased as it crossed into the Savu Sea, and by early on 1 April <b>it</b> <b>developed</b> into a tropical cyclone to the northeast of Sumba.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Inigo {{was tied}} with Cyclone Gwenda for being the most intense {{recorded}} cyclone in the Australian region in terms of pressure. <b>It</b> <b>developed</b> from a tropical low that crossed eastern Indonesia in late March 2003. Becoming a named tropical cyclone on 1 April, Inigo rapidly intensified as it tracked southwestward, reaching a minimum central pressure of 900hPa on 4 April. An approaching trough weakened the cyclone and turned it to the southeast, and on 8 April Inigo dissipated after making landfall on Western Australia as a minimal tropical storm.|$|E
