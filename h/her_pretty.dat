500|$|Parwana is the {{stepmother}} of Abdullah and Pari. She {{grew up in}} Shadbagh {{with her}} brother, Nabi, and twin sister, Masooma. Parwana is ill-favored {{for most of her}} life as opposed to the strikingly beautiful Masooma. This eventually results in what Rafia Zakaria describes as a [...] "poignant tale of a plain twin whose single act of vengeance, of pushing <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> sister off a swing results in a lifelong moral burden". Masooma's accident leaves her paralyzed, leaving Parwana tortured by guilt and forced to care for her from then on. After several years, Masooma persuades Parwana to leave her in the desert to die and marry Saboor, Abdullah and Pari's father.|$|E
500|$|Rafia Zakaria, a {{director}} for Amnesty International USA, {{wrote that the}} themes of guilt and gratitude also feature prominently. She used the backstory of Parwana, Abdullah and Pari's stepmother, and her sister Masooma as an example: [...] "We find a poignant tale of a plain twin whose single act of vengeance, of pushing <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> sister off a swing results in a lifelong moral burden. The sister, who was {{to be married to}} a man both sisters love, becomes an invalid for life, and both serve the sentence, the healthy one tending to the other and wrecked within by the knowledge that she was the cause of their collective misfortune." [...] She stated the theme of dependence also extended to the story of Nabi, the brother of Parwana who arranges the selling of Pari and who is later left as the sole caretaker of his paralyzed employer.|$|E
500|$|On 17 February, Henry Sutherland Edwards {{wrote in}} the Musical World: [...] "In almost all conjunctions of music and words, there is a {{sacrifice}} of one to the other; but in Thespis... Sufficient opportunities have been given for music; and the music serves only to adorn the piece." [...] Similar reports continued to appear through early March, when Thespis closed. The final performance during the authors' lifetimes was given {{less than two months}} later, on 27 April, at a matinée for the benefit of Mlle. Clary, the original Sparkeion. On such an occasion, a performer would normally choose a piece likely to sell well, as the beneficiary was entitled to the income (after expenses), and tickets were generally offered at [...] "inflated prices". The actress was a Gaiety favourite, [...] "not only in respect of her voice but also her delicious French accent and, of course, her figure." [...] Others recalled [...] "the charm of Mlle. Clary, with <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> face and piquant broken English". She had been particularly successful as Sparkeion, and her song in Act II, [...] "Little Maid of Arcadee", was the only one chosen for publication.|$|E

500|$|By 1660, {{like her}} fellow Londoner Damaris Page, Mother Cresswell was {{regarded}} as one of the great figures of the London scene, with a talent for self-promotion. She declared she had [...] "Beauties of all Complexions, from the cole-black clyng-fast to the golden lock'd insatiate, from the sleepy ey'd Slug to the lewd Fricatrix". She had a network of agents across the country who found <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> young girls. Among her brothels, she owned one in Lincoln's Inn Fields by Whetstone Park where she sold [...] "strong waters and fresh-faced wenches to all who had guineas to buy them with." [...] Her headquarters were in a brothel on Back Alley off Moor Lane, near Cripplegate, where Moorgate station stands today. She also ran an office in Millbank to organise whores for local noblemen and owned both a mansion in Clerkenwell and a [...] "House of Assignation" [...] where women old and young could discreetly meet their lovers. She took on a cohort of Cavalier gentlewomen from formerly high circles of society who had supported the parliamentarian uprising, their standing destroyed by the civil war. This network of women worked the alleys close to the Gresham Royal Exchange in the city, and so were known as the [...] "Countesses of the Exchange" [...] or [...] "side-pillows".|$|E
500|$|Zeta-Jones {{returned}} to stage in 2009 with {{a revival of}} the musical A Little Night Music, which marked her Broadway debut. Set in Sweden during the early twentieth century, the musical follows the relationship between three people (Zeta-Jones, Angela Lansbury and Alexander Hanson) during the course of an evening. She played Desirée Armfeldt, an ageing actress, and was particularly drawn to the complexities of the play, saying, [...] "There's no jazzy hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings,... It's not one of those shows where you can dig about three inches and come out the other end. You can keep digging and digging and digging". She did not listen to past recordings of the songs in the play so she could bring her own interpretation to them. The critic Claire Prentice of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Zeta-Jones brought in a [...] "quiet, reflective poignancy" [...] in her rendition of the song [...] "Send in the Clowns", but Emma Brocks of The Guardian was more critical, remarking that [...] "with <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> voice, head wresting this way and that, [...] seems to be auditioning for stage school". For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.|$|E
500|$|From the start, Marie {{had trouble}} {{adjusting}} {{to life in}} Romania. Her personality and [...] "high spirits" [...] frequently created controversies at the Romanian court, and she disliked the austere atmosphere of her household. She wrote that she [...] "had not been brought down to Romania to be adored and spoilt and made much of; {{she had come to}} be part of the machinery King Carol had wound up. She had been imported to be trimmed, educated, cut down and trained according to the great man's conception of things." [...] When describing her early days in Romania, Marie wrote that [...] "for long hours [...] would mope, whilst [...] young husband did his military service, all alone in rooms [...] hated, heavy German rooms". Marie's paternal aunt, the Dowager German Empress, wrote to her daughter, the Crown Princess of Greece, that [...] "Missy of Roumania is more to be pitied than you. The King is a great tyrant in his family, & has crushed the independence in Ferdinand so that no one cares about him, & his beautiful & gifted little wife, I fear, gets into scrapes, & like a butterfly, instead of hovering over the flowers, burns <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> wings by going rather near the fire!" [...] Easily learning to speak the Romanian language, she followed her mother's advice to dress carefully and show respect for Orthodox rituals.|$|E

6000|$|She {{shook her}} head sadly--it was always <b>her</b> <b>prettiest</b> movement. [...] "I can promise nothing--oh, no, I can't promise! We must part now," [...] she added. [...] "You'll miss your train." ...|$|R

500|$|When Sinatra's {{mother was}} a child, <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> face earned her the {{nickname}} [...] "Dolly." [...] Energetic and driven, biographers {{believe that she was}} the dominant factor in the development of her son's personality traits and extraordinary self-confidence. Barbara Sinatra claims that Dolly was abusive to him as a child, and [...] "knocked him around a lot". Dolly became influential in Hoboken and in local Democratic Party circles. She worked as a midwife, earning $50 for each delivery, and according to Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelley, also ran an illegal abortion service that catered to Italian Catholic girls for which she was nicknamed [...] "Hatpin Dolly". She also had a gift for languages and served as a local interpreter. [...] Sinatra's illiterate father was a bantamweight boxer who fought under the name Marty O'Brien. He later worked for 24 years at the Hoboken Fire Department, working his way up to captain. Sinatra spent much time at his parents' tavern in Hoboken, [...] working on his homework and occasionally singing a song on top of the player piano for spare change. During the Great Depression, Dolly provided money to her son for outings with friends and to buy expensive clothes, resulting in neighbors describing him as the [...] "best-dressed kid in the neighborhood". Excessively thin and small as a child and young man, Sinatra's skinny frame later became a staple of jokes during stage shows.|$|E
2500|$|Champagne {{has long}} been {{associated}} with stars of rock and pop music. In the song [...] "Killer Queen" [...] by Queen, Freddie Mercury {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "She keeps Moet et Chandon in <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> cabinet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{praised the}} songwriting and the [...] "clean and uncluttered" [...] {{production}} on the project. He eventually commended on Aguilera's vocals, writing that [...] "she {{not only has}} charisma, she can actually sing, bringing conviction to these love and heartbreak songs." [...] Although calling it [...] "a frustratingly erratic album", Beth Johnson wrote that [...] "Christina still makes a credible bid to be the late-summer soundtrack to romantic rebound." [...] Sputnikmusic editor Amanda Murray wrote that Christina Aguilera [...] "is an album that is highly representative of the better aspects of the teen pop movement of the late 90s." [...] A reviewer writing for Q said the album [...] "shows off <b>her</b> <b>pretty,</b> but powerful vocals to surprisingly impressive effect." [...] Ann Powers on behalf of The New York Times agreed, writing [...] "Beyond its sleek design, this album hints at a real singer's emergence. She has striking vocal power and range, if not a clue about expressing individuality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the abdication of the Tsar, the Yussupovs {{returned}} to the Moika Palace before going to Crimea. They later {{returned to}} the Palace to retrieve jewellery and two paintings by Rembrandt, the sale proceeds of which helped sustain the family in exile. In Crimea, the family boarded a British warship, HMS Marlborough, which took them from Yalta to Malta. Felix enjoyed boasting about killing Rasputin {{while he was on}} the ship. One of the British officers noted that Irina [...] "appeared shy and retiring at first, but it was only necessary to take a little notice of <b>her</b> <b>pretty,</b> small daughter to break through her reserve and discover that she was also very charming and spoke fluent English". From there, they traveled to Italy and by train to Paris. In Italy, lacking a visa, Felix bribed the officials with diamonds. In Paris, they stayed a few days in Hôtel de Vendôme before they went on to London.|$|E
2500|$|Although her {{difficulties}} with the English language persisted, {{as time went}} on, the once rigidly formal Portuguese Infanta mellowed and began to enjoy {{some of the more}} innocent pleasures of the court. She loved to play cards and shocked devout Protestants by playing on Sundays. She enjoyed dancing and took great delight in organising masques. She had a great love for the countryside and picnics; fishing and archery were also favourite pastimes. In a far cry from her convent-days the newly liberated Catherine displayed a fondness for the recent trend of court ladies wearing men's clothing, which we are told, [...] "showed off <b>her</b> <b>pretty,</b> neat legs and ankles"; and she was even reported to have considered leading the way in wearing shorter dresses, which would show off her feet. In 1670, on a trip to Audley End with her ladies-in-waiting, the once chronically shy Catherine attended a country fair disguised as a village maiden, but was soon discovered and, due to the large crowds, forced to make a hasty retreat. And when in 1664 her favourite painter, Jacob Huysmans, a Flemish Catholic, painted her as St Catherine, it promptly set a trend among court ladies.|$|E
60|$|Then she had convulsive sobbings in her {{agitated}} throttle, Then {{she wiped}} <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> eyes and smelt <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> smelling-bottle.|$|E

6000|$|... "You'll make me wear it {{out before}} any one else sees it," [...] she said, laughing. But again she promised.

Why should she not be ready to see him? Why should she not have on <b>her</b> <b>prettiest</b> dress when he came? If he meant to say the word,--then <b>her</b> <b>prettiest</b> dress would all be too poor, and her readiest ears not quick enough to meet so great a joy. If he were not to say the other word,--then should she shun him by staying behind, or be afraid of the encounter? Should she be less gaily attired because it would be unnecessary to please his eye? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The rooms will suit me," [...] he said, [...] "and I have {{no doubt}} the price you ask for them is a just one;" [...] and he bowed with high-bred {{courtesy}} to Sylvia, who was now in attendance on him, and who stood with <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> hands in the pretty pockets of <b>her</b> <b>pretty</b> apron.|$|E
