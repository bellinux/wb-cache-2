5|$|Frogs are primary {{predators and}} an {{important}} part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many {{of their}} Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, {{possibly}} due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity {{of a large number}} of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork.|$|E
5|$|In 613 Laurence consecrated {{the monastery}} church built by Augustine in Canterbury, and {{dedicated}} it to saints Peter and Paul; {{it was later}} re-consecrated as St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. Laurence also wrote to the bishops in the lands held by the Scots and by the Britons, urging them to hold Easter {{on the day that}} the Roman church celebrated it, instead of their traditional date, part of the Easter controversy. The letter is also preserved in Bede's history. Laurence in 609 stated that Dagan, a native bishop, would not <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> Laurence or share a roof with the archbishop, due to {{the differences between the two}} Churches.|$|E

5|$|Mellitus {{attended}} a council of bishops held in Italy in February 610, convened by Pope Boniface IV. The historian N. J. Higham speculates {{that one reason}} for his attendance may have been to assert the English Church's independence from the Frankish Church. Boniface had Mellitus take two papal letters back to England, one to Æthelbert and his people, and another to Laurence, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also brought back the synod's decrees to England. No authentic letters or documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury. During his time as a bishop, Mellitus joined with Justus, the Bishop of Rochester, in signing a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the Celtic Church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionary bishops, such as Dagan, refused to <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> the Roman missionaries.|$|E
5|$|South east of {{the keep}} was the hall, built by Roger Clifford in the late 14th century as a {{replacement}} for an earlier hall. It provided space for the castle's garrison, swelled by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, and was a location for the lord to <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> his soldiers. The hall had large windows which may have detracted from the building's defensive capability, although it has been postulated that casements bore large wooden shutters. The kitchen, which served the entire castle, was set in the south-east corner of the fortification. Along the south wall were arranged more lodgings, a well, and a chapel, the latter another addition by Roger Clifford. In the south-west corner of the castle was the Tower of League, built around 1300 by Roger Clifford. It included further rooms for accommodation, but notably would also have allowed defenders to fire on an enemy emerging from the gatehouse. Four storeys tall and with a single room at each level, the presence of a garderobe and fireplace on each floor suggests that the tower was reserved for high-status visitors. The tower's square plan is typical of such structures built in northern England at this time, as seen at castles such as Warkworth and Egremont, although it contrasts with rounded towers preferred in the south.|$|E
5|$|The Hamsa mendicants are {{constantly}} on the move, staying in villages for just one night, in towns {{no more than five}} nights, and in sacred places for no more than seven nights. The ascetic practice of Hamsa monks includes daily consumption of the urine and dung of a cow. The Hamsa monks practice the Chandrayana cycle in their food eating habit, wherein they vary the amount of food they <b>eat</b> <b>with</b> the lunar cycle. They eat a single mouthful of food on the day after the dark new moon night, increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases, and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night. Thereafter, they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day until they reach the new moon night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day.|$|E
50|$|Akumaki has no taste. It is {{typically}} <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> blended sugar and toasted soybean flour (kinako), {{with a little}} salt or soaked in honey.

In the South Asian subcontinent, food is traditionally always <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> hands. Foods considered street foods are frequently, though not exclusively, finger foods.|$|R
5000|$|Nasi kerabu is a Malay rice dish, {{a type of}} nasi ulam, {{in which}} blue-coloured rice is <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> dried fish or fried chicken, crackers, pickles and other salads.

40|$|White {{and whole}} meal breads have been {{classified}} as high glycemic index (GI) foods {{which in turn}} produce the greatest rise in blood glucose. One of the commercial bread products in Malaysia known as Brown breads (BB) has been recently marketed as a healthy choice for diabetics due to its low GI value. This {{study was conducted to}} examine the effect of BB when <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> different fillings on blood glucose response among healthy individuals and to describe the influences of these fillings in reducing blood glucose response. Five test meals using BB (BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> baked beans, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> vegetable, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> apple, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> roast chicken and BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> seaweeds) had been prepared for this study. Postprandial blood glucose response was determined for each test meal and reference food (glucose) that contained 50 g carbohydrate respectively. A total of 21 healthy subjects were recruited by advertisement to participate. Only 20 subjects (15 males, 5 females, Mean + SD Age : 24. 4 + 3. 7 years; BMI 23. 4 + 3. 0 kgm- 2) completed this study. After an overnight fast, subjects consumed BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> fillings according to the assigned group given and three repeated tests of reference food (glucose). Fasting capillary blood glucose samples were taken at time 0 and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min respectively after the meal began. The blood glucose response was obtained by calculating the incremental area under the curve (AUC). Blood glucose response after consuming reference food (251. 8 + 12. 1 m m o l. m i n / L) w a s s i g n i f i c a n t l y h i g h e r t h a n a l l t h e t e s t m e a l s (p < 0. 05). Among the test meals, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> baked beans produced the highest rise in blood glucose (97. 0 + 16. 9 mmol. min/L) whereas BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> seaweeds demonstrated the lowest response in blood glucose (33. 3 + 6. 5 mmol. min/L) and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). The postprandial blood glucose response after ingestion of BB when <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> vegetable was 73. 3 + 19. 1 mmol. min/L followed by BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> apple (58. 9 Jurnal Sains Kesihatan Malaysia 6 (1) 2008 : 1 - 102 + 12. 2 mmol. min/L) and BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> roast chicken (56. 5 + 10. 1 mmol. min/ L). Generally, BB when <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> fillings produced a slow rise in blood glucose response than the reference food. Combining this BB with fillings had the effect of reducing the postprandial blood glucose further...|$|R

25|$|According to John Dominic Crossan, Jesus {{sent his}} disciples out to heal and to {{proclaim}} the Kingdom of God.

This implicit challenge to the social hierarchy was part of Jesus' program of radical egalitarianism. These themes of healing and eating are common in early Christian art.|$|E
