5000|$|The air escapes {{through the}} pump <b>discharge</b> <b>nozzle</b> whilst the fluid drops {{back down and}} is once more entrained by the impeller.

40|$|International audienceConsideration {{is given}} to the {{interaction}} of twin tandem jets with an oncoming uniform crossflow. A variable temperature is assumed for the emitted jets while the crossflow is maintained constant, equivalent to the ambient temperature. Both jet nozzles are elliptic, as initially inclined with an angle of 60 A degrees, placed three diameters apart in line with the crossflow and discharge a nonreactive fume. The handled configuration is numerically simulated in the present work, by means of the finite volume method together with a non uniform grid system. The model is first validated with reference to available experimental data, in the simple isothermal case of air jets in air crossflow. It is then upgraded by considering a nonreactive fume discharged at a variable temperature. The upgraded model turbulence is described by means of the Reynolds Stress Model second order turbulent closure model. The present work is to our knowledge pioneering in the introduction of this particular model is such a configuration and its introduction proved to be highly valuable since is described satisfyingly the turbulent behavior of the resulting flowfield.

The use of submerged jets produced by mixing pumps lowered into the supernatant/sludge interface to produce a homogeneous slurry is being studied at several DOE facilities. The homogeneous slurry can be pumped from the tanks to a treatment facility or alternative storage location. Most of the previous and current studies with this method are for flat-bottom tanks with vertical walls.

40|$|The horizontal, reverse taper, wiped film {{evaporator}} that was evaluated demonstrated {{a number of}} positive characteristics with respect to its applicability in the solidification of nuclear fuel recovery process wastes. Foremost among these {{is its ability to}} remove the bulk (80 to 90 percent) of the liquid associated with any of the purex-type high level, intermediate level, or mixed waste slurries. The major disadvantage of the evaporator is its current inability to discharge a product that is low enough in liquid content to avoid sticking to the evaporator <b>discharge</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Also, while the indirect indications of the torque required to turn the rotor and the power drawn by the drive motor are indicative of the liquid content of the discharged product, no reliable correlation has been found to cover all of the possible flow rates and feed stock compositions that the evaporator may be required to handle. In addition, no reliable means has been found to indicate {{the presence or absence of}} product flow through the <b>discharge</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The lack of a positive means of moving the product concentrate out of the evaporator and into a high temperature receiver is an undesirable feature of the evaporator.
