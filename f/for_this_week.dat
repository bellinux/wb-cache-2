500|$|On {{the first}} Finals Week, no contestants were {{eliminated}} due to disrupted telephone and mobile phone services {{in many areas}} of Luzon, caused by Typhoon Xangsane.

This was done because there were no official results to be announced. [...] According to sources from the network, the votes were not yet counted at the time. [...] ABC-5 Director for Creative and Entertainment Production Perci Intalan stated that the three finalists who were put in the [...] "Hot Spot" [...] (Marcelo, Armarie Cruz and Jelli Mateo) were not necessarily the Bottom Three. Intalan said, [...] "We were not allowed to announce who the Bottom Three were because the votes will be carried over next week and it might affect the voting if people knew who the Bottom Three were." [...] As a result, two contenders—Stef Lazaro and Drae Ybañez—were eliminated the following week. [...] Another non-elimination occurred on the fourth Finals Week due to reports of disrupted voting (among Sun Cellular and Smart subscribers). The votes amassed <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> were carried over to Week 5.
