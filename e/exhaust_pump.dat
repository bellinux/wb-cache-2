40|$|During patient {{studies with}} the Technegas {{equipment}} in our department, we regularly detected small to considerable contaminations of the operator {{and in the}} area surrounding the apparatus. These contaminations {{were found to be}} of different origin: residual activity in the tubing from the apparatus to the patient which diffuses after deconnection, residual activity and small particles of the destroyed carbon crucible in the apparatus which are dispersed during opening of the door of the gas preparation chamber, leakage at the patient site during studies in uncooperative patients and a dysfunctioning valve inside the apparatus. To reduce the contamination risks, we made some adaptations to the apparatus. In the first place, the dysfunctioning valve was replaced. In addition, a powerful air <b>exhaust</b> <b>pump</b> with an efficient filter was installed. It was connected with (1) a newly installed transparent box {{in front of the door}} of the gas preparation chamber, (2) a dome on a flexible arm which can be positioned above the patient's face during the examination and (3) a nipple on which the mouthpiece can be placed after the study. After these adaptations, a study showed the absence of measurable contamination on the clothing of the personnel handling the apparatus. Occasionally, considerable contamination was still measured on the gloves worn during filling of the carbon boat with generator eluate, but only small contaminations (up to 9. 25 kBq) were measured on the mouthmask worn by the operator during administration of the Technegas. This results in a maximum effective dose equivalent from activity deposited in the lungs of 0. 008 microSv per study.

With the ongoing push towards drastic heat loss {{reductions}} in the residential systems, it is put forward again by simple exhaust ventilation manufacturers as an alternative for the traditional heat recovery with an air to air heat exchanger that is common in mechanical ventilation systems. As with the latter form of heat recovery, the amount of effectively recovered energy is composed of different forms of energy, namely heat and power. The potential for <b>exhaust</b> air heat <b>pumps,</b> compared to air to air heat exhangers, is assessed by introducing the equivalent heat recovery effectiveness, combining both forms of energy into a single unit based on primary energy and consumer price.

40|$|Abstract: Development {{trend of}} modern HSDI diesel engine is now {{focusing}} on low fuel consumption and emission because of {{strong interest in}} global environmental protection. Two big branches of criteria for modern diesel engine development are down sizing and down speeding. Down sizing keeps engine operation condition to the direction of higher load and thus pursuing for better thermal efficiency. But this may cause degraded vehicle dynamic performance because of reduced back up torque. Down speeding keeps engine operation condition to the direction of slightly higher load and lower engine speed. Therefore reduction of back up torque can be limited within flat torque area. This study analyzed fuel economy effect of down speeding on a vehicle powered by HSDI diesel engine in aspect of engine friction work, intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>pumping</b> work, <b>exhaust</b> hat loss and thermal loss of fuel leakage of fuel injection system. Contribution factor of each engine and vehicle related parameters under basic and down speeding condition were compared and work balance of down speeding during NEDC was analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Statutory {{requirements}} to reduce CO 2 from tail pipes and {{strong interest in}} global environmental protection drove the main goal of modern HSDI diesel engines towards low fuel consumption. Two of the main strands of the criteria for low fuel consumption of modern diesel engine development are down-sizing and down-speeding. Down-sizing {{is well known for}} movement of the engine operation area in the direction of higher-loads, and thus better thermal efficiency is available. But this may cause degraded vehicle dynamic performance because of reduced back up torque as well as increased NOx. The down-speeding method aims to move engine operation area to higher load and lower engine speed. By this method degraded vehicle dynamic performance can be minimized with tangible fuel economy benefits. This study analyzed the characteristics of down-speeding relating to engine operation conditions and the fuel economy effect broken down by sector during the NEDC. Engine friction work, thermal loss through exhaust gas, thermal loss through fuel leakage and coolant, intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>pumping</b> loss were compared and analyzed through the vehicle test...|$|R
40|$|Using linear {{gas bearing}} guides {{in a high}} vacuum environment, the common method to keep the vacuum quality is to exhaust the gas emitted by the bearing pads before leaking into the vacuum chamber. Thereby the exhaust tubes between the guide and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pumps</b> should {{interfere}} with the guide {{as little as possible}} while maintaining a flexible connection and a highly effective exhaustion rate. A novel exhaust system that implements these requirements is described within this paper. The major achievement was the realization of two exhaust tubes slidable into one another combined with the known method of non-contact clearance seals, thus enabling an highly efficient and yet disturbance free exhaustion. This setup was developed and characterized at static and dynamic conditions. An analytical model for dimensioning the non-contact seal was worked out and experimentally verified. The number of seal stages and the clearance height were identified as the major impact factors on the leakage rate of the setup. It is concluded that the investigated approach is very suitable for vacuum compatible gas bearing guides since a vacuum level in the order of 10 - 4 Pa was maintained during the experiments...|$|R

40|$|Particle {{control is}} playing an {{increasingly}} important role in tokamak plasma performance. The present paper discusses particle control of hydrogen/deuterium by wall pumping on graphite or carbonized surfaces, {{as well as by}} external <b>exhaust</b> with <b>pumped</b> limiters and pumped divertors. Wall pumping is ultimately a transient effect and by itself not suitable for steady state particle exhaust. Therefore, external <b>exhaust</b> techniques with <b>pumped</b> divertors and limiters are being developed. How wall pumping phenomena interact and correlate with these inherently steady state, external exhaust techniques, is not well known to date. In the present paper, the processes involved in wall pumping and in external pumping are investigated in an attempt to evaluate the effect of external <b>exhaust</b> on wall <b>pumping.</b> Some of the key elements of this analysis are: (1) charge-exchange fluxes to the wall {{play a crucial role in}} the core-wall particle dynamics, (2) the recycling fluxes of thermal molecules have a high probability of ionization in the scrape-off layer, (3) thermal particles originating from the wall, which are ionized within the scrape-off layer, can be directly exhausted, thus providing a direct path between wall and exhaust which can be used to control the wall inventory. This way, the wall can be kept in a continuous pumping state in the sense that it continuously absorbs energetic particles and releases thermal molecules which are then removed by the external exhaust mechanism. While most of the ingredients of this analysis have been observed individually before, the present evaluation is an attempt to correlate effects of wall recycling and external exhaust...|$|R

Four different plasma scenarios have been selected, and for each of them a user-defined, iterative procedure between SOLPS and DSMC has been established, using the neutral flux as the key communication term between the two codes. The goal is to understand and quantify the mutual influence between the two regions in a self-consistent manner, that is to say, how the particle <b>exhaust</b> <b>pumping</b> system controls the upstream plasma conditions. Parametric studies of the flow conditions in the sub-divertor, including additional flow outlets and variations of the cryopump capture coefficient, have been performed as well, in order to understand their overall impact on the flow field.

40|$|The {{heat supply}} for Swedish multi-family {{residential}} buildings {{is becoming more}} complex, and today it is fairly common to combine district heating with a second heat source. The most common heat source to combine with district heating in Sweden is an <b>exhaust</b> air heat <b>pump.</b> On average, the <b>exhaust</b> air heat <b>pump</b> covers 31 % of the yearly heat load and is given full load priority. There is a missed potential in cost and CO 2 savings when one heat source is given full load priority, since marginal production costs and CO 2 emissions constantly vary in both the electrical grid and the district heating system. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate how buildings with several heat sources should be operated using hourly energy prices. Hourly heat and electricity prices for Gothenburg have been established for two years based on the marginal costs of heat and electricity generation. These prices have been used to evaluate the most common combinations of heat sources.

40|$|According to the European {{directive}} 2012 / 27 /EU of October 2012 {{on energy}} efficiency, buildings represented 40 % of the EU’s {{final energy consumption}} in 2011. The major part of this energy consumption {{is due to the}} residential sector for space heating and domestic hot water production. Moreover, buildings are crucial to achieve the EU objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 - 95 % by 2050 compared to 1990. In order to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions, retrofit measures regarding insulation and air-tightness have to be taken. However, such improvements of the building envelope lead to a relative increase in consumption related to ventilation. Indeed, according to Orme (2001), Roulet et al. (2001) and Fouih et al. (2012), the heating demand due to ventilation can reach more than 50 % of the total building heating demand for new and retrofitted buildings. To reduce the energy consumption due to ventilation, <b>exhaust</b> air heat <b>pumps</b> (EAHPs) can be used instead of the traditional heat recovery with an air-to-air heat exchanger. EAHPs recover heat from the exhaust air of the ventilation system to produce domestic hot water and space heating. According to Fehrm et al. (2002), this technology is already widely used in the northern countries such as Germany and Sweden. In fact, according to Fracastoro et al. (2010), efficiencies of EAHPs are higher than those obtained with outside air or geothermal heat pumps in certain conditions, whatever the climate location. Berg et al. (2010) have monitored three houses in Sweden equiped with <b>exhaust</b> air heat <b>pumps.</b> The seasonal performance factor (SPF) values were all within the range 1. 4 - 1. 7. This factor takes into account the energy consumption of the heat pumps and the auxiliary heating systems. A 17 kW <b>exhaust</b> air heat <b>pump</b> has also been tested by Mikola et al. (2014). The measured SPF for the heat pump only (without taking into account the auxiliary heating system) was about 2. 9 - 3. 4 in winter and 3 in the summer. <b>Exhaust</b> air heat <b>pumps</b> coupled with simple exhaust mechanical ventilation systems have many advantages compared to traditional balanced systems with heat recovery: •	Only one fan is necessary and the duct system is simpler. Consequently, EAHPs are suitable for retrofitted buildings. •	The heat pump can provide the whole part of the heating demand related to domestic hot water and 50 % of the heating demand related to space heating, according to Fracastoro et al. (2010). •	The heat pump can also provide active cooling by inversing the refrigerating cycle. •	The heat pump performance is high and remains constant with outdoor temperature changes since the temperature of the heat sink is constant (20 °C). As a result, the system is cost-effective. •	The system is compact, quiet and requires little maintenance. In the present paper, the energetic performances of an <b>exhaust</b> air heat <b>pump</b> are assessed through numerical and experimental studies. The thermal capacity of the machine is 1. 5 kW when the inside air temperature is 20 °C and the outside water temperature is 35 °C. The heat pump is therefore ideally suited for new or retrofitted buildings. The system including a mechanical exhaust ventilation system and an <b>exhaust</b> air heat <b>pump</b> is first presented. Secondly, the heat pump model used afterwards to determine the heat pump seasonal performance factor is described. Thirdly, the model is calibrated to fit the measurement data. Finally, the heat pump model is coupled to a building model to determine the annual performance of the system. The system is compared to a traditional balanced ventilation system with heat recovery in terms of primary energy consumption, for different heating and DHW production systems (electric heater, heat pump, gas condensing boiler).

Without any heat recovery, the total energy demand for ventilation and heating was 106, 3 kWh/(m 2 *year) in Trondheim and 180, 3 kWh/(m 2 *year) in Kautokeino. Heat recovery with 80 % efficiency and a minimum discharge air temperature of 5 oC reduced the energy demand to 56, 5 kWh/(m 2 *year) and 104, 6 kWh/(m 2 *year), in Trondheim and Kautokeino respectfully. Heat recovery reduces the delivered energy of 46, 8 % in Trondheim and 42, 0 % in Kautokeino. The most energy efficient system was the <b>exhaust</b> air heat <b>pump</b> unit Compact P Nordic from Nilan.

This dissertation discusses the design and development a multiplexed mass spec gas sampling system for real-time, in situ measurement of gas species concentrations in a spatially programmable chemical vapor deposition (SP-CVD) reactor prototype, where such chemical sensing is essential to achieve {{the benefits of a}} new paradigm for reactor design. The spatially programmable reactor, in which across-wafer distributions of reactant are programmable, enables (1) uniformity at any desired process design point, or (2) intentional nonuniformity to accelerate process optimization through combinatorial methods. The application of multiplexed mass spec sensing is well suited to our SP-CVD design, which is unique in effectively segmenting the showerhead gas flows by using <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>pumping</b> through the showerhead for each segment. In turn, mass spec sampling signals for each segmen...|$|R
