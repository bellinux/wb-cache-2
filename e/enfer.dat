25|$|Orton {{was born}} in East Dereham, Norfolk, but moved to Dalston, east London at age 14. Her father, a public {{relations}} consultant and journalist, left her mother when Beth was 11, and she lived with her mother, a journalist and political activist, and her two brothers, her father dying shortly afterwards. Her mother died from cancer in 1989, when Beth was aged 19, which led to her travelling to Thailand for a short period, residing with Buddhist nuns. Upon returning to London, Orton worked at jobs such as a waitress at Pizza Hut, and even briefly owned her own catering company. Orton was an actress before becoming a musician, initially enrolling at the Anna Scher Theatre School. She toured in an experimental stage adaptation of Une Saison en <b>Enfer</b> with a theatre company touring throughout the UK, Russia and Ukraine, playing Rimbaud's lover.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} the Expedition only served to {{discourage}} settling in Guiana. The colony earned the nickname <b>Enfer</b> Vert ("Green Hell"), which it {{is still trying to}} shake. No other project of mass colonisation was undertaken, and the population of Whites was always drastically lower than that of the slaves. The population of the colony, of all races, did not rise above 20,000 until the gold rush (starting in 1855), [...] the second abolition of slavery in 1848 and the founding of the prisons.|$|E
2500|$|While the Moselle valley {{was under}} German control during World War II the fort was used {{starting}} in 1943 by the German occupiers as an internment camp (S Sonderlager) {{for members of}} the French Resistance, including Joseph Derhan. The [...] fort was called the [...] "Hell of Queuleu" [...] (<b>Enfer</b> de Queuleu). It was not a concentration camp, but an interrogation center for captured or arrested members of the Resistance, commanded by Schutzstaffel Hauptscharführer Georg Friedrich Hempen (* 27.07.1905). Between 1500 and 1800 people were detained at Queuleu. [...] Prisoners were held in Casemate A of the fort. Thirty-six died there and four escaped through a ventilation shaft. Among the most notable prisoners were the Mario Group of resisters, led by Jean Burger. Almost all of the prisoners were transferred to concentration camps as American forces approached Metz in late 1944. The Germans evacuated the fort on 17 August 1944 and moved the majority of the detainees to Struthof, Schirmeck or Ravensbrück.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the arts}} and letters, two {{important}} approaches developed separately in France. The first was Impressionism, a school of painting that initially focused on work done, not in studios, but outdoors (en plein air). Impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners, and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored Paris Salon, the Impressionists organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them {{to coincide with the}} official Salon. A significant event of 1863 was the Salon des Refusés, created by Emperor NapoleonIII to display all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon. While most were in standard styles, but by inferior artists, the work of Manet attracted tremendous attention, and opened commercial doors to the movement. The second French school was Symbolism, which literary historians see beginning with Charles Baudelaire (1821–67), and including the later poets, Arthur Rimbaud (1854–91) Une Saison en <b>Enfer</b> (A Season in Hell, 1873), Paul Verlaine (1844–96), Stéphane Mallarmé (1842–98), and Paul Valéry (1871–1945). The symbolists [...] "stressed the priority of suggestion and evocation over direct description and explicit analogy," [...] and were especially interested in [...] "the musical properties of language." ...|$|E
60|$|On Wednesday morning last at 7.15 a.m. {{a charming}} little breakfast was {{served at the}} home of Mr. De Smythe. The dejeuner was given in honour of Mr. De Smythe and his two sons, Master Adolphus and Master Blinks De Smythe, who were about to leave for their daily travail at their {{wholesale}} Bureau de Flour et de Feed. All the gentlemen were very quietly dressed in their habits de work. Miss Melinda De Smythe poured out tea, the domestique having refuse to get up so early after the partie of the night before. The menu was very handsome, consisting of eggs and bacon, demi-froid, and ice-cream. The conversation was sustained and lively. Mr. De Smythe sustained it and made it lively for his daughter and his garcons. In the course of the talk Mr. De Smythe stated that the next time he allowed the young people to turn his maison topsy-turvy he would see them in <b>enfer.</b> He wished to know if they were aware that some ass of the evening before had broken a pane of coloured glass in the hall that would cost him four dollars. Did they think he was made of argent. If so, they never made a bigger mistake in their vie. The meal closed with general expressions of good-feeling. A little bird has whispered to us {{that there will be no}} more parties at the De Smythes' pour long-temps.|$|E
60|$|It was {{carnival}} time, and {{the rumor}} had pretty generally been carried abroad {{that he was}} to die on that morning. A friend, who accompanied me, came many miles, through the mud and dark, in order to be in at the death. We set out before light, floundering through the muddy Champs Elysées; where, besides, were many other persons floundering, and all bent upon the same errand. We passed by the Concert of Musard, then held in the Rue St. Honoré; and round this, in the wet, a number of coaches were collected. The ball was just up, and a crowd of people in hideous masquerade, drunk, tired, dirty, dressed in horrible old frippery, and daubed with filthy rouge, were trooping out of the place: tipsy women and men, shrieking, jabbering, gesticulating, as French will do; parties swaggering, staggering forwards, arm in arm, reeling to and fro across the street, and yelling songs in chorus: hundreds of these were bound for the show, and we thought ourselves lucky in finding a vehicle to the execution place, at the Barrière d'Enfer. As we crossed the river and entered the <b>Enfer</b> Street, crowds of students, black workmen, and more drunken devils from more carnival balls, were filling it; and on the grand place there were thousands of these assembled, looking out for Fiaschi and his cortège. We waited and waited; but alas! no fun for us that morning: no throat-cutting; no august spectacle of satisfied justice; and the eager spectators were obliged to return, disappointed of their expected breakfast of blood. It would have been a fine scene, that execution, could it but have taken place {{in the midst of the}} mad mountebanks and tipsy strumpets who had flocked so far to witness it, wishing to wind up the delights of their carnival by a bonnebouche of a murder.|$|E

50|$|The work of Apollinaire and Pias contributed {{largely to}} publicising the <b>Enfer</b> and the {{literature}} it contains. The {{stock of the}} <b>Enfer</b> was enlarged in the 20th century mainly through acquisitions from ordinary bookstores. In the 1980s, the renowned publishing firm Fayard published a seven-volume collection of out-of-copyright novels held in the <b>Enfer,</b> with contemporary photographs and explanatory introductions. Book historians {{are concerned with the}} material that is preserved in the <b>Enfer,</b> while new cultural historians study the pre-revolutionary pornography found in it. A prominent example is Robert Darnton, who points to the emancipatory potential of the texts in which social and religious criticism are often embedded in moral transgressions.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Enfer</b> ( [...] , literally, Inferno or Hell; [...] ) is {{a special}} {{department}} of the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. It {{is a special}} collection of books and manuscripts of an erotic or pornographic character which, because of their rarity and value, may be seen only with authorization. The <b>Enfer</b> was established 1836-1844 {{and is one of}} the most famous Private Case collections. In 2013, the <b>Enfer</b> contained about 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century to the present.|$|E

50|$|The Bibliothèque {{nationale}} {{closed the}} <b>Enfer</b> press mark in 1969, but opened {{it again in}} 1983, for practical reasons; for librarians and library users, {{it was easier to}} find all the erotic works under a single press mark. The acquisition policy of the Bibliothèque nationale is, however, no longer based only on genre. While efforts are made to continue collecting erotic material, the decisive factor now is rarity or bibliophilic quality. Besides older works that were missing from the <b>Enfer,</b> contemporary and foreign books are added to the <b>Enfer.</b> By 2013, the collection had grown to 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century. Since 1977, access to the <b>Enfer</b> is no longer stricter than {{for the rest of the}} Réserve collections.|$|E
