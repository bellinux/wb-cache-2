5|$|Although the MSS was {{the most}} useful {{instrument}} on Landsat 2, sometimes the data recorded was anomalous. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them.

Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in post processing.|$|E

5|$|In {{a report}} to the Holy Synod that year, Bishop Tikhon {{proposed}} dramatic changes in the operation of the diocese. Recognizing the needs of the growing multi-ethnic Orthodox community, he recommended reforming the missionary diocese into a self-supporting American diocese, composed of numerous ethnic auxiliary dioceses. His plan called for Russian (New York), Arab (Brooklyn), Serbian (Chicago), and Greek dioceses. Additionally, he called for the formation of a governing council, composed of clergy and laity, which would meet to discuss administrative and canonical <b>issues.</b> <b>On</b> March 5, 1907, the first All-American Sobor convened in Mayfield, Pennsylvania. Following Archbishop Tikhon's reassignment to Russia that year, however, few of his reforms were implemented.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1815, Bute had his Glamorgan estates fully surveyed, which {{highlighted}} that the estates had been neglected {{for many years}} and were now in a poor condition.

Despite this, Bute retained the final authority over even quite minor <b>issues</b> <b>on</b> the estates, including making decisions on the buttons to be used on local school uniforms or the reuse of a broken flag pole, for example, which could result in considerable delays as letters were sent between South Wales and Scotland. As the complexity of the Glamorgan estates grew, more officials were appointed to help manage the docks, farms and mineral interests, but these all reported separately to Bute, putting increasing pressure on the marquess.|$|E
