40|$|Background This paper {{examines}} knowledge exchange {{dynamics in}} a specialist integrated intellectual (learning) disability service, comprising specialist healthcare provision with social care commissioning and management, and considers their significance {{in terms of}} <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> delivery. Methods A qualitative study focusing on knowledge <b>exchange</b> and <b>integrated</b> <b>services.</b> Semi-structured interviews (n[*]=[*] 25) were conducted with members of an <b>integrated</b> intellectual disability <b>service</b> in England regarding their perceptions of knowledge <b>exchange</b> within the <b>service</b> {{and the way in}} which knowledge exchange impinges on the operation of the <b>integrated</b> <b>service.</b> Results <b>Exchange</b> of ‘explicit’ (codifiable) knowledge between health and care management components of the service is problematic because of a lack of integrated clinical governance and related factors such as IT and care record systems and office arrangements. Team meetings and workplace interactions allowed for informal exchange of explicit and ‘tacit’ (non-codifiable) knowledge, but presented challenges in terms of knowledge exchange completeness and sustainability. Conclusions Knowledge exchange processes play an important role in the functioning of <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> incorporating health and care management components. Managers need to ensure that knowledge exchange processes facilitate both explicit and tacit knowledge exchange and do not rely excessively on informal, ‘ad hoc’ interactions. Research on <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> should take account of micro-scale knowledge exchange dynamics and relationships between social dynamics and physical factors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} verifying <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> of home network systems which consist {{of one or more}} home appliances. Specifically, an approach is proposed that uses the SPIN model checker to verify <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> automatically and exhaustively. The proposed approach encompasses a method for automatically translating <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> descriptions into the Promela language, the input language of SPIN. Once a Promela code for a service description has been obtained, one can verify the <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> against the properties represented as LTL formulae. The usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a case study using an example of a practical <b>integrated</b> <b>service.</b> The findings and experiences obtained in this case study offer some clues to adequately representing properties of interest for <b>integrated</b> <b>services.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a framework to specify and verify <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> {{of a home}} network system (HNS). We first develop a modeling language to describe the HNS and the <b>integrated</b> <b>services.</b> Complementing our previous work, the language captures each appliance as an object consisting of properties and methods, encapsulating the underlying protocols and platforms. We then present a method that verifies the <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> with symbolic model checking, by translating the proposed language into the SMV (Symbolic Model Verifier) language. Thus, {{it is possible to}} validate if the <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> is specified as intended, automatically and exhaustively. Using the proposed framework, service developers can effectively detect design flaws in a single <b>integrated</b> <b>service,</b> as well as feature interactions among multiple services, in early stages of service development. 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{supplier}} performance impact of governance structures involving different modes of formal control (i. e., output and behaviour) and informal control, individually and in combination under varying conditions of <b>services</b> <b>exchanges</b> (i. e., mass or professional). Hypotheses are developed and tested on {{a sample of}} 132 buyer-supplier relationships. Analyzing the control modes individually, results indicate that when the buyer relies on high output control, supplier performance improves only in mass <b>services</b> <b>exchanges.</b> On the other hand, when the buyer relies on high informal control, supplier performance improves in both types of <b>services</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Studying the performance impact of the control modes in a combined form, results indicate that {{in a context of}} mass <b>services</b> <b>exchanges</b> and (already) high output control, there is no additional impact of behaviour control on supplier performance, nor of informal control. However, in a context of professional <b>services</b> <b>exchanges</b> and (already) high informal control, we find that behaviour control further improves supplier performance, while output control deteriorates supplier performance. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{of service}} {{development}} have mostly focused on isolated projects or processes. Little {{attention has been}} paid to the historical, political and business contexts, and, much emphasis has been put on the development of new services in relation to the re-bundling of existing services. The main purpose of this dissertation is therefore to describe and understand the development of an <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> including context factors. An <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> is built on two or more existing services. Two research questions are formulated: one focusing on what is being developed (i. e. the <b>integrated</b> <b>service)</b> and the other on how the <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> is being developed. The dissertation contributes to the theoretical field of service research in the area of service development. A suitable case in the business context of a public transport authority in Sweden was chosen for the purpose. An in-depth, longitudinal study was carried out, spanning ten years. A combination of deductive and inductive approaches was used in the analysis. The empirical results show that the service concept was designed by the owners within the economic and technical restrictions at hand. Some adjustments were made but in practice there was little focus on the customers’ needs and demands. The theoretical contributions are summed up in two models which describe an <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> (“what”) and the development process of an <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> (“how”). The model of an <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> is based on a service platform consisting of <b>integrated</b> resources and <b>service</b> processes corresponding to the customers’ primary needs. Different supporting services are developed, corresponding to the customers’ secondary needs. The supporting services strive for customisation and are designed in flexibility. The model of the development process illustrates that the development of an <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> can be described and understood as a process consisting of activities of breaking up and <b>integrating</b> <b>service</b> pre-requisites, the internal service infrastructure and factors related to a stakeholder network. The process of breaking up and integrating, propelled by stakeholders, is described and understood as change pressure...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} formal control on supplier performance in interfirm <b>service</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Whereas some research suggests that formal control can enhance supplier performance, {{there is also evidence}} showing that formal control can actually have no or even a negative effect on supplier performance. We propose that the actual effect of formal control depends on (1) the mode of formal control being used (output versus behavior), and its relationship with (2) service type (mass versus professional) and (3) informal control. Hypotheses are developed and tested on a sample of 253 buyer-supplier relationships. Results indicate that output control interacts with service type in determining supplier performance. Buyers’ reliance on high output control has a positive effect on supplier performance in mass <b>service</b> <b>exchanges,</b> whereas this effect becomes negative in professional <b>service</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The interaction effect of behavior control and service type, on the other hand, is dependent on the presence of informal control. Buyers’ reliance on high behavior control has a more positive effect on supplier performance in professional <b>service</b> <b>exchanges</b> than in mass <b>service</b> <b>exchanges,</b> but only in the presence of informal control. status: publishe...|$|R
