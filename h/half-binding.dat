6000|$|Much {{has been}} written of late about book-binding. In a later part of this manual we shall have {{something}} to say about historical examples of the art, and the performances of the great masters. At present one must begin by giving the practical rule, that a book should be bound in harmony with its character and its value. The bibliophile, if he could give the rein to his passions, would bind every book he cares to possess in a full coat of morocco, or (if it did not age so fast) of Russia leather. But to do this is beyond the power of most of us. Only works of great rarity or value should be full bound in morocco. If we have the luck to light on a Shakespeare quarto, on some masterpiece of Aldus Manutius, by all means let us entrust it to the most competent binder, and instruct him to do justice to the volume. Let old English books, as More's [...] "Utopia," [...] have a cover of stamped and blazoned calf. Let the binder clothe an early Rabelais or Marot in the style favoured by Grolier, in leather tooled with geometrical patterns. Let a Moliere or Corneille be bound in the graceful contemporary style of Le Gascon, where the lace-like pattern of the gilding resembles the Venetian point-lace, for which La Fontaine liked to ruin himself. Let a binding, a la fanfare, in the style of Thouvenin, denote a novelist of the last century, let panelled Russia leather array a folio of Shakespeare, and let English works of a hundred years ago be clothed in the sturdy fashion of Roger Payne. Again, the bibliophile may prefer to have the leather stamped with his arms and crest, like de Thou, Henri III., D'Hoym, Madame du Barry, and most of the collectors of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Yet there are books of great price which one would hesitate to bind in new covers. An Aldine or an Elzevir, in its old vellum or paper wrapper, with uncut leaves, should be left just as it came from the presses of the great printers. In this condition it is a far more interesting relic. But a morocco case may be made for the book, and lettered properly on the back, so that the volume, though really unbound, may take its place with the bound books on the shelves. A copy of any of Shelley's poems, in the original wrappers, should I venture to think be treated thus, and so should the original editions of Keats's and of Mr. Tennyson's works. A collector, who is also an author, will perhaps like to have copies of his own works in morocco, for their coats will give them a chance of surviving the storms of time. But most other books, not of the highest rarity and interest, will be sufficiently clothed in half-bindings, that is, with leather backs and corners, while the rest of the cover is of cloth or paper, or whatever other substance seems most appropriate. An Oxford tutor used to give <b>half-binding</b> as an example of what Aristotle calls [Greek text], or [...] "shabbiness," [...] and when we recommend such coverings for books it is as a counsel of expediency, not of perfection. But we cannot all be millionaires; and, let it be remembered, the really wise amateur will never be extravagant, nor let his taste lead him into [...] "the ignoble melancholy of pecuniary embarrassment." [...] Let the example of Charles Nodier be our warning; nay, let us remember that while Nodier could get out of debt by selling his collection, OURS will probably not fetch anything like what we gave for it. In half-bindings there is a good deal of room for the exercise of the collector's taste. M. Octave Uzanne, in a tract called [...] "Les Caprices d'un Bibliophile," [...] gives some hints on this topic, which may be taken or let alone. M. Uzanne has noticed the monotony, and the want of meaning and suggestion in ordinary half-bindings. The paper or cloth which covers the greater part of the surface of half-bound books is usually inartistic and even ugly. He proposes to use old scraps of brocade, embroidery, Venice velvet, or what not; and doubtless a covering made of some dead fair lady's train goes well with a romance by Crebillon, and engravings by Marillier. [...] "Voici un cartonnage Pompadour de notre invention," [...] says M. Uzanne, with pride; but he observes that it needs a strong will to make a bookbinder execute such orders. For another class of books, which our honest English shelves reject with disgust, M. Uzanne proposes a binding of the skin of the boa constrictor; undoubtedly appropriate and [...] "admonishing." [...] The leathers of China and Japan, with their strange tints and gilded devices may be used for books of fantasy, like [...] "Gaspard de la Nuit," [...] or the [...] "Opium Eater," [...] or Poe's poems, or the verses of Gerard de Nerval. Here, in short, is an almost unexplored field for the taste of the bibliophile, who, with some expenditure of time, and not much of money, may make <b>half-binding</b> an art, and give modern books a peculiar and appropriate raiment.|$|E

30|$|This study {{presents}} {{one of the}} few efforts where p 53 -related regulatory variants {{were investigated}} molecularly and genetically (Pietsch et al. 2006). In addition to the T/G polymorphism within the intronic promoter of MDM 2 (Bond et al. 2004), Mendendez et al. (2007) also identified a C/T polymorphism within the proximal promoter region of the flt- 1 gene, where the minor allele of T created a <b>half-binding</b> site for p 53 and brought the system under the control of p 53 network. A more recent effort by the same group has further demonstrated that the presence of this polymorphism also created a partial responsiveness to estrogen receptor upstream of the previously identified binding half-site for p 53. This results in synergistic simulation of transcription at this flt-promoter site through the combined action of p 53 and ER (Menendez et al. 2007). The importance of these p 53 -related regulatory variants in disease development, however, has not been demonstrated.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{structural}} {{studies on}} transcription factors from the POU family in complex with multiple cognate DNA enhancer elements {{have established a}} novel concept in DNA-mediated formation of distinct conformations of transcription regulator assemblies. Two crystal structures of the Oct- 1 transcription factor {{in the presence of}} two different DNA sites have demonstrated how its POU DNA-binding segment is capable in forming two unrelated dimer arrangements, which is DNA motif dependent. While one arrangement allows binding of the Oct- 1 speci®c coactivator OBF- 1, binding of this coactivator is blocked in the second arrangement because the binding site is involved in its own dimer assembly. Conversely, two crystal structures of another POU transcription factor, Pit- 1, have demonstrated how the same overall assembly is maintained in the presence of two different DNA response elements. However, since the distance of the two Pit- 1 <b>half-binding</b> sites on these elements differ by two base pairs, the overall dimensions of the two complexes vary, allowing binding of a speci®c represssor (N-CoR) in one conformation but not in the other. Thus, despite the occurrence of different DNA-mediated molecular mechanisms, the net result, conformation-dependent binding of further regulators, is equivalent. These data introduce a concept where the DNA motif not only serves as binding site for speci®c transcription factors but also regulates their function by mediating speci®c transcription factor assemblies, which determine binding to conformation-dependent coregulators...|$|E
40|$|VjbR is a LuxR-type quorum-sensing (QS) {{regulator}} {{that plays}} {{an essential role}} in the virulence of the intracellular facultative pathogen Brucella, the causative agent of brucellosis. It was previously described that VjbR regulates a diverse group of genes, including the virB operon. The latter codes for a type IV secretion system (T 4 SS) that is central for the pathogenesis of Brucella. Although the regulatory role of VjbR on the virB promoter (PvirB) was extensively studied by different groups, the VjbR-binding site had not been identified so far. Here, we identified the target DNA sequence of VjbR in PvirB by DNase I footprinting analyses. Surprisingly, we observed that VjbR specifically recognizes a sequence that is identical to a <b>half-binding</b> site of the QS-related regulator MrtR of Mesorhizobium tianshanense. As shown by DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, generation of a palindromic MrtR-like-binding site in PvirB increased both the affinity and the stability of the VjbR-DNA complex, which confirmed that the QS regulator of Brucella is highly related to that of M. tianshanense. The addition of N-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone dissociated VjbR from the promoter, which confirmed previous reports that indicated a negative effect of this signal on the VjbR-mediated activation of PvirB. Our results provide new molecular evidence for the structure of the virB promoter and reveal unusual features of the QS target DNA sequence of the main regulator of virulence in Brucella...|$|E
