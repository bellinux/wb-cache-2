5|$|Justinian {{achieved}} lasting fame {{through his}} judicial reforms, particularly through the complete revision of all Roman law, {{something that had}} not previously been attempted. The total of Justinian's legislature is known today as the Corpus juris civilis. It consists of the Codex Iustinianus, the <b>Digesta</b> or Pandectae, the Institutiones, and the Novellae.|$|E
5|$|Early in his reign, Justinian {{appointed}} the quaestor Tribonian to oversee this task. The {{first draft of}} the Codex Iustinianus, a codification of imperial constitutions from the 2nd century onward, was issued on 7 April 529. (The final version appeared in 534.) It {{was followed by the}} <b>Digesta</b> (or Pandectae), a compilation of older legal texts, in 533, and by the Institutiones, a textbook explaining the principles of law. The Novellae, a collection of new laws issued during Justinian's reign, supplements the Corpus. As opposed {{to the rest of the}} corpus, the Novellae appeared in Greek, the common language of the Eastern Empire.|$|E

25|$|Living {{habits are}} varied; the family {{includes}} both bottom-foraging and midwater species. Callichthyids inhabit {{a wide range}} of habitats, from small, swift, oxygen-rich creeks to big rivers and flooded areas. Their habitats may even include swampy and muddy habitats where oxygen may be virtually absent. Callichthyids survive in these conditions by breathing air; air is collected at the water surface and swallowed. The intestines are used to absorb oxygen, and the air is expelled from the anus. The anterior digestive intestine packages <b>digesta</b> into a string of slightly compressed boluses, creating an air channel in the digestive intestine, thus allowing air to pass unimpeded. The posterior intestine is modified for respiration into a thin-walled and highly vascularized structure by reduction of the thickness of the epithelium, submucosa, and muscle layers; though highly modified to absorb air, it is inefficient for digestive purposes. Air moving through the digestive tract facilitates the movement of <b>digesta</b> to the rectum. Unlike other catfish such as loricariids or trichomycterids that may breathe air only under hypoxic conditions, callichthyids breathe air under all water conditions. Some callichthyids are able to absorb air through their hind guts to move short distances on land. Air stored in their digestive tracts also accounts for 75% of the necessary air for neutral buoyancy.|$|E
25|$|Byzantium's great {{intellectual}} {{achievement was}} the Corpus Juris Civilis ("Body of Civil Law"), a massive compilation of Roman law made under Justinian (r. 528-65). The work includes a section called the <b>Digesta</b> which abstracts {{the principles of}} Roman law {{in such a way}} that they can be applied to any situation. The level of literacy was considerably higher in the Byzantine Empire than in the Latin West. Elementary education was much more widely available, sometimes even in the countryside. Secondary schools still taught the Iliad and other classics.|$|E

500|$|Justinian's Omnem {{constitution}} {{fixed the}} duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years. The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his Corpus Juris Civilis, namely the Institutiones (Institutes), <b>Digesta</b> (Digest) and Codex (Code). First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on {{the first part of the}} Digest; second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest, and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the leges singulares. There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest. Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous Dupondii (which means [...] "two pennies") to Iustiniani novi and dubbed fifth-year students Prolytae.|$|E

50|$|The {{scholars}} of the 11th and 12th century legal schools in Italy, France and Germany {{are identified as}} glossators in a specific sense.

40|$|Human milk is {{generally}} {{recognized as the}} gold stallion in neonatal nutrition. Structure, composition and physiological properties of Human milk are better mimicked in infant formulas that include milk lipids and milk fat membrane extracts although very few infant formulae use milk lipids more expensive than vegetable lipids. Two formulas based on i) vegetable fat (STD) or ii) a blend of vegetable fat and milk lipids stabilized by milk fat membrane extracts (EXP) were distributed with an automatic milk feeder to piglets from birth until 28 days. After euthanasia, Intestinal contents and tissues (proximal jejunum and ileum) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were collected. The residual immunoreactivity of β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) and caseins (Cns) present in the digestive compartments was determined by ELISA. The paracellular permeability (using FITC-dextran 4000) was evaluated using Ussing chambers. The EXP formula enhanced the resistance to proteolysis of β-lg and Cns. It modified microbiota {{with an increase in}} proteobacteria and a decrease in firmicutes. Ileal density (g/cm) was greater in EXP-fed piglets at 28 d. A decreased jejunal permeability was observed between d 7 and d 28 in EXP-fed piglets which was not observed with STD. There was an important effect of formula components on the secretory activity of MLN: a major immunosuppressor effect of the lipid fraction extracted from <b>digestas</b> of both formulas was evidenced. In conclusion, the lipid composition in infant formulas influenced the neonatal intestinal physiology through release of immunomodulatory lipids, modulation of proteolysis and modification of progressive colonisation of the infant digestive tract by bacteria...|$|R

60|$|The {{granting}} of this jurisdiction to the Pope gave several Bishops occasion {{to write to}} him for his resolutions upon doubtful cases, whereupon he answered by decretal Epistles; and henceforward he gave laws to the Western Churches by such Epistles. Himerius Bishop of Tarraco, the head city of a province in Spain, writing to Pope Damasus for his direction about certain Ecclesiastical matters, and the Letter not arriving at Rome till {{after the death of}} Damasus, A.C. 384; his successor Siricius answered the same with a legislative authority, telling him of one thing: Cum hoc fieri--missa ad Provincias à venerandæ memoriæ prædecessore meo Liberio generalia decreta, prohibeant. Of another: Noverint se ab omni ecclesiastico honore, quo indignè usi sunt, Apostolicæ Sedis auctoritate, dejectos. Of another: Scituri posthac omnium Provinciarum summi Antistites, quod si ultrò ad sacros ordines quenquam de talibus esse assumendum, & de suo & de aliorum statu, quos contra Canones & interdicta nostra provexerint, congruam ab Apostolica Sede promendam esse sententiam. And the Epistle he concludes thus: Explicuimus, ut arbitror, frater charissime, universa quæ <b>digesta</b> sunt in querelam; & ad singulas causas, de quibus ad Romanam Ecclesiam, utpote ad caput tui corporis, retulisti; sufficientia, quantum opinor, responsa reddidimus.

Dat. 3 Id. Febr. Arcadio & Bautone viris clarissimis Consulibus, A.C. 385. Pope Liberius in the reign of Jovian or Valentinian I. sent general Decrees to the Provinces, ordering that the Arians should not be rebaptized: and this he did in favour of the Council of Alexandria, that nothing more should be required of them than to renounce their opinions. Pope Damasus is said to have decreed in a Roman Council, that Tithes and Tenths should be paid upon pain of an Anathema; and that Glory be to the Father, &c. should be said or sung {{at the end of the}} Psalms. But the first decretal Epistle now extant is this of Siricius to Himerius; by which the Pope made Himerius his Vicar over all Spain for promulging his Decrees, and seeing them observed. The Bishop of Sevill was also the Pope's Vicar sometimes; for Simplicius wrote thus to Zeno Bishop of that place: Talibus idcirco gloriantes indiciis, congruum duximus vicariâ Sedis nostræ te auctoritate fulciri: cujus vigore munitus, Apostolicæ institutionis Decreta, vel sanctorum terminos Patrum, nullatenus transcendi permittas. And Pope Hormisda [3] made the Bishop of Sevill his Vicar over Boetica and Lusitania, and the Bishop of Tarraco his Vicar over all the rest of Spain, as appears by his Epistles to them.|$|E
