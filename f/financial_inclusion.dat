Sending cash is cheaper as {{it does not have}} the same transaction costs as shipping goods. Sending cash is also faster than shipping the goods. In 2009 for sub-Saharan Africa, food bought locally by the WFP cost 34 percent less and arrived 100 days faster than food sent from the United States, where buying food from the United States is required by law. Cash aid also helps local food producers, usually the poorest in their countries, while imported food may damage their livelihoods and risk continuing hunger in the future.|$|E

25|$|Credit unions offer many of {{the same}} {{financial}} services as banks, but often using a different terminology; common services include share accounts (savings accounts), share draft accounts (checking accounts), credit cards, share term certificates (certificates of deposit), and online banking. Normally, only a member of a credit union may deposit or borrow money. Surveys of customers at banks and credit unions have consistently shown a significantly higher customer satisfaction rate with the quality of service at credit unions. Credit unions have historically claimed to provide superior member service and to be committed to helping members improve their financial situation. In the context of <b>financial</b> <b>inclusion</b> credit unions claim to provide a broader range of loan and savings products at a much cheaper cost to their members than do most microfinance institutions.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} time {{microfinance}} has received increased attention among the researchers and financial service providers, {{as a good}} alternative in the rural credit market. Various studies revealed that microfinance is a powerful instrument for poverty alleviation, enabling the poor to accumulate the assets, boost their incomes, and reduce their economic vulnerability. There are various opinions about the micro credit demand in India. M-CRIL, a leading micro-credit rating agency provides a conservative estimate for the annual demand at Rs. 480 billion based on 60 - 70 million poor families with an average household credit demand of Rs. 8, 000 (less than $ 160). In the growing market, to meet this huge demand we require the systems and approaches with comprehensive financial inclusiveness. Within this context, the Self-Help Groups (SHGs) movement in India and particularly the SGSY, SHG-Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP) of the National Bank of Rural and Agriculture Development (NABARD), various MFIs and community based organizations present the rich experience. The present paper explores the role of and performance of various delivery models of microfinance in India. Further the paper explores some issues like outreach, impact, efficiency, sustainability and <b>financial</b> <b>inclusions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Digital human {{identity}} management, {{can now be}} seen as {{a social}} necessity, as it is essentially required in almost every public sector such as, <b>financial</b> <b>inclusions,</b> security, banking, social networking e. t. c. Hence, in today's rampantly emerging world with so many adversarial entities, relying on a single biometric trait is being too optimistic. In this paper, we have proposed a novel end-to-end, Unified Biometric ROI Segmentation Network (UBSegNet), for extracting region of interest from five different biometric traits viz. face, iris, palm, knuckle and 4 -slap fingerprint. The architecture of the proposed UBSegNet consists of two stages: (i) Trait classification and (ii) Trait localization. For these stages, we have used a state of the art region based convolutional neural network (RCNN), comprising of three major parts namely convolutional layers, region proposal network (RPN) along with classification and regression heads. The model has been evaluated over various huge publicly available biometric databases. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first unified architecture proposed, segmenting multiple biometric traits. It has been tested over around 5000 * 5 = 25, 000 images (5000 images per trait) and produces very good results. Our work on unified biometric segmentation, opens up the vast opportunities in the field of multiple biometric traits based authentication systems.

40|$|Using the ARDL Bounds {{approach}} to cointegration technique, we explore {{the role of}} financial services, information and communications technology, remittance inflows and export liberalisation in Nepal over the periods 1975 - 2010.

Consequently, we propose besides the need for stable macroeconomic and sound institutional structures, policies targeted towards greater <b>financial</b> viz. technology <b>inclusion,</b> investment in and integration of technology across sectors, encouraging greater remittance inflows through sound labour mobility schemes, export promotion strategies focussed towards not only addressing supply side constraints but also strengthening trade partnership at regional and international fronts as a crucial way forward to establishing a new economic order for a new Nepal. ...|$|R

40|$|The banking {{industry}} has shown tremendous growth in volume and complexity {{during the last}} few decades. However there have been concerns that banks {{have not been able to}} provide basic banking facilities to vast population, especially the rural population of India.

Efforts are being made as <b>financial</b> <b>inclusions</b> can truly lift the financial conditions of rural India.

The broader impacts of Transaction cost exposing the informal economy such as exploitation by unauthorised merchants who sees banking activity as a signal of wealth that can be tapped.
