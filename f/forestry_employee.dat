500|$|When the {{westbound}} {{troop train}} stopped at Red Pass Junction, Atherton gave the incorrect written order to train conductor John A. Mainprize. As the full order {{had been passed}} to the eastbound Continental, its crew expected to meet the troop train at Cedarside, [...] eastbound from Blue River; the crew aboard the troop train expected to meet the Continental and another train at Gosnell [...] westbound from Cedarside. With neither train crew aware of anything wrong, the troop train passed Cedarside and the Continental passed Gosnell. Both trains were travelling at moderate speeds, and attempted to negotiate a sharp curve from opposite ends. Thomas W. Tindall, a <b>forestry</b> <b>employee,</b> saw the two trains approaching each other from an embankment; he tried to signal the Continental crew, who responded to his frantic signals with a friendly wave. The two crews did not realise that a collision was imminent until the last moment, and the trains struck head-on at 10:35a.m.|$|E
40|$|<b>Forestry</b> <b>employees</b> are {{the most}} {{valuable}} asset to forest operations. An analysis was completed to determine employee training status, how safe employees feel within their roles and identify major reasons of dissatisfaction. Through the development of job descriptions and person specifications, {{it was possible to}} identify the job requirements along with the personal attributes and qualifications required by employers, to ensure employees were capable of undertaking their role. There is an identifiable gap within the level of formal education among employees. Over half (55 %) of the employees have lower qualifications than those required to have undertaken further forestry on-job training. A majority of employees’, particularly those in machine operator roles feel safe in their forestry operational roles. A small proportion of employees in breaker out, thin to waste and pruning roles feel unsafe. All employees surveyed except loader operators, felt only moderately safe in their role. The difficult environment associated with forestry was determined to be the major reason for dissatisfaction (52 %) among employees, along pay and length of day. Paradoxically, the environment was also a major reason for satisfaction among those surveyed. By identifying the major reasons of dissatisfaction among <b>forestry</b> <b>employees</b> it is possible to improve job satisfaction and <b>employee</b> retention. Training <b>forestry</b> <b>employees</b> needs to be from a more practical aspect. This will lead {{to increase the number of}} employees that are trained for the roles they are undertaking, by ensuring they are equipped with adequate knowledge, and have the skill to work safely and to a high quality standard...|$|R
50|$|Its {{distribution}} and population size are unknown, {{though it is}} believed to prefer moist woodland habitats. It was originally described {{on the basis of}} a single specimen collected in 1964. No confirmed sightings were reported again until 1998, when it was observed by <b>forestry</b> <b>employees.</b> It may be one of the most endangered lizards in the world, particularly given the destruction of local habitat caused by the Soufrière Hills volcano.|$|R
500|$|On September 20, 1967, two Bureau of <b>Forestry</b> <b>employees</b> {{attempted}} {{to remove a}} metal ladder from a [...] metal storage tank for jet fuel at the northern jet engine test cell. Both were killed in an explosion when the acetylene torch cut through the tank wall and ignited fumes inside it. A tract within the Elk State Forest at {{the northern edge of}} the wild area is known as Noble-Chambers Memorial Forest in their memory. Although Fergus reports entering a bunker in his 2002 book, and Young describes a bunker's slit windows in his 2008 book, as of 2010 the southern bunker was covered with earth, and the northern bunker is still completely intact and can be entered.|$|R

50|$|Forestry {{is a major}} {{industry}} in Canada, contributing over $23 billion to the economy in 2010. In the same year, over 190,000 people were directly employed by the forestry industry, contributing 1.3 percent of total employment and $8.8 billion in wages in 2009. The majority of <b>forestry</b> <b>employees</b> are found in Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario. As of 2011, Canada contributed 10 percent of the world's sawnwood, 10 percent of the pulp for paper, 9 percent of the industrial roundwood, 4 percent of the wood-based panels and 3 percent of the paper and paperboard. In 2010, Canada enjoyed a significant surplus in their balance of trade, mainly due to being the second-largest exporter of forestry products globally. Much of this is exported, with Canada exporting 20 percent of the world's sawnwood, 18 percent of the pulp for paper, 8 percent of the paper and paperboard, 5 percent of the industrial roundwood and 5 percent of the wood-based panels.|$|R

40|$|Norwegian {{forest policy}} has high-level, complex {{objectives}} for the products and {{benefits from the}} forest, including increased contribution to the climate, preservation of biodiversity, and creation of economic values. In Norway, it {{is first and foremost}} small-scale private forest owners who have to deliver on these expanded goals. The article reveals owners’ lack of forestry competence, and elaborates on the role of <b>forestry</b> <b>employees</b> (advisers) in owners’ decision-making processes, be it forestry- competent owners or not. There is, however, a decreased number of advisers in the private and public forest services, implying that forest owners are atomised in the meaning of being alone. This type of individualization and an increasing lack of forestry competence among forest owners are a contradiction. The mismatch is serious for the government and the forestry business because it probably hampers the fulfilment of the political objectives. The article presents six options for meeting the obstacles to goal fulfilment. The article is based on two research projects from the counties of Trøndelag and Hedmark. Data were collected between 2002 and 2007 and include survey, focus group interviews, in-depth interviews, fieldwork and document analysi...|$|R
25|$|However, {{there were}} various reports {{during the time}} of menacing groups prowling around {{mutilation}} sites. In September 1975, a <b>forestry</b> service <b>employee</b> in Blaine County, Idaho, reported seeing a group of people in black hooded robes. Several cattle were found mutilated in the area the following day. On October 9, 1975, a motorist on U.S Highway 95 in northern Idaho, in an area of frequent cattle mutilation, reported to police that some 15 masked individuals formed a roadblock with linked arms, forcing him to turn around.|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explored offenders’ work experiences outside of prison and in-prison, and then compared these experiences to their post-release work experiences and outcomes. The subjects’ criminal histories varied, {{but during the}} study’s initial interview all were incarcerated at lower security level facilities in a western state. Several different types of in-prison employment were compared; these differences included the type of task, the skill level, the work-site, and the beneficiary of the labor. Outcomes were classified according to work measures, and whether the subjects had been reincarcerated within six months of their release. The pre-prison findings suggested that the skill level of the work which the subjects’ held affected their commitment to their jobs. However, the data also showed that substance abuse derailed the subjects, regardless of their commitment to their jobs. The in-prison findings revealed important differences between work programs, showed {{that the quality of}} the job is affected by intrinsic rewards, and that different types of intrinsic rewards foster different perspectives. In one of the work programs the subjects worked with state <b>forestry</b> <b>employees,</b> performing land clearing, work on structures, prescribed burns, and wild-land firefighting. This program produced character-changing results, including increases in self-esteem, recognition of personal agency, increased sense of responsibility, and pride in their work. The subjects who participated in the forestry work program also were the least likely to have been reincarcerated within six months of their release. The subjects reported that they encountered many obstacles upon their release from prison; some of the obstacles were directly due to their ex-prisoner status, such as stigma and parole restrictions. However, subjects who had strengths, such as overcoming substance abuse, positive social connections, and positive attitudes, appeared to have overcome the obstacles. These strengthening factors closely resembled the perspectives which the forestry subjects had adopted. These findings suggest that certain types of in-prison work can be rehabilitative, and that prison can be an effective arena in which to implement character-changing work-based programs.

30|$|The APU’s {{socioeconomic}} stratification {{in terms}} of the uneven livestock distribution {{can be seen as a}} first indication of the social inequity within the organization and the respective community, though not a proof of it. It is also interesting to note that according to the district administration nearly 10, 900 livestock units officially existed within the municipality (RABK 2012). The difference of more than 6, 000 livestock units between this official number and the number that was registered within the PC’s pasture ticket system led initially to two conclusions: First, not all animals belonging to APU members were registered as grazing animals. It is officially accepted that not all dairy cows and calves are registered as animals visiting the pastures, since it is a common practice in the study region to keep cows within or close to the settlements during the lactation period for the purpose of daily milking. The second preliminary conclusion was that not all livestock owners were members of the pasture user association, and their animals therefore were not inventoried by the APU. The people interviewed confirmed both explanations, but only the second explanation is important for the topic discussed in this paper. In contrast to the already quoted shepherds using the summer pastures of Kerei and Kenkol, several interviewees, some of them APU members, assessed the APU and its PC as a complicated and ineffective management construct. Some even went a step further, describing them ‘unnecessary’ institutions, which can be easily avoided by making individual, less complicated, quick, and spontaneous arrangements with other pasture-owning organizations. Depending on the location and the legal status of the respective pasture, these organizations can be neighbouring local authorities and their APUs for communal or ‘national land reserve’ pastures or forest enterprises such as the leskhoz ‘Kyzyl Unkur’ for the grasslands of the ‘national forest fund’. Another accusation put forward against the APUs in the study area and their PCs was assumed misappropriations of funds. However, the proof of such a breach of trust was not provided. Nevertheless, according to the interviewed pasture users and <b>forestry</b> <b>employees,</b> many livestock owners regularly choose the unofficial way to purchase undocumented utilization rights informally (respondents AU 2013, DE 2013, EA 2013 / 2014, LO 2013, and MA 2013). On the one hand, this circumstance means that non-members are being excluded from decision-making processes within the APUs and cannot directly influence the management strategies of the PC and its members. On the other hand, however, it shows that not all pasture users see the APU as the legitimate organization to represent their pasture-related interests. It is also a sign that the APU, its PC, and the respective members are too weak to demand membership from all pasture users of the municipality. Consequently, in addition to the social sphere, a deviation from the ideal outcomes of CBNRM is also evident in the political sphere.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MPA (School of Public Management and Planning)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) has employeds about 18 000 {{officials}} {{in both the}} water and <b>forestry</b> domains. <b>Employees</b> in the same Forestry and Water sections perform differently. For example, some of these employees in the same sections complain {{that they have no}} work to do, while others in the same section complain that they have too much work. It is not clear how performance bonuses are allocated in the same Forestry and Water sections. The situation is affecting staff morale and eventually service delivery provided by DWAF. DWAF has a performance management system that is currently being implemented throughout the whole Department. As indicated, this system is not effective and it is not applied consistently with regard to all staff members in the same sections and also in different sections of the dDepartment. The study seeks to analyse the causes and circumstances why some that other employees have little work to do, while others have too much work to do. In short, it seeks to analyse as to why the current system is ineffective and inconsistently applied. The main methodology that informs this study is document and data analysis and thereafter, follow interviews with DWAF officials from different sections of DWAF. The recommendations based on conclusions and findings of this study are {{that it is important to}} align individual and organisational goals, that rewards and corrective measures should be part of the performance management system and that capacity building, training and support interventions are essential to ensure an effective and consistent performance management system...|$|R
