The prevalence of intra-ocular ACV-resistant (ACVR) HSV- 1 in herpetic uveitis is unknown and may have clinical consequences. In addition to its predictive value on ACV susceptibility, the polymorphic HSV- 1 thymidine kinase (TK) gene facilitates differentiation between HSV- 1 strains. ObjectivesThe objective {{of this study was}} to determine the genetic composition and ACV susceptibility of the causative virus in <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>fluid</b> samples (IOF) of HSV- 1 uveitis patients. Study designThe intra-ocular HSV- 1 pool from 11 HSV- 1 uveitis patients was determined by sequencing IOF-derived viral TK genes. The ACV susceptibility profile of the cloned intra-ocular TK variants was defined by mass spectrometry. In addition, the ganciclovir (GCV) susceptibility of the ACVR HSV- 1 TK variants was defined. ResultsIntra-ocular fluid samples of HSV- 1 uveitis patients contain HSV- 1 quasispecies, principally consisting of one major and multiple genetically related minor patient-specific TK variants. Four of 10 patients analyzed had an intra-ocular ACVR HSV- 1 of which 3 were cross-resistant to GCV. The ACVR profile of intra-ocular HSV- 1 did not correlate with symptomatic ACV treatment. ConclusionsAffected eyes of HSV- 1 uveitis patients are commonly infected with a patient-specific HSV- 1 quasispecies, including one major and multiple genetically related minor variants. A relatively high prevalence of intra-ocular ACVR HSV- 1, mainly ACV/GCV cross-resistant viruses, was detected in HSV- 1 uveitis patients...|$|E
