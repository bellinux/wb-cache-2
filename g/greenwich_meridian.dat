Frustrated, Haddock ponders turning back, but Tintin soon realizes the problem: If Sir Francis had used a French chart instead of an English chart to calculate the position, the coordinates would have been measured on the Paris Meridian rather than the <b>Greenwich</b> <b>Meridian.</b> As they have been using the <b>Greenwich</b> <b>Meridian,</b> they realise that they are too far west.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} in History, advances in time-keeping {{have resulted in}} various time scales.

[...] Morrell quotes various positions [...] during the voyage at southerly latitudes which later proved to be at least 100miles inside the then undiscovered Antarctic continental mainland. One possible explanation for this discrepancy, offered by the [...] writer W.J. Mills, is that since Morrell's account was written nine years after the voyage he may not have had access to the ship's log, and hence [...] "felt constrained to invent details that appeared plausible", in order to sustain his narrative.|$|E

It was placed on high ground along the line of the <b>Greenwich</b> <b>Meridian,</b> but when this was recalibrated later in the 19th century, the obelisk was deemed to have been erected [...] west of the revised meridian line.

2500|$|For {{an ocean}} {{in the shape}} of a {{circular}} basin enclosed by a coastline, the cotidal lines point radially inward and must eventually meet at a common point, the amphidromic point. The amphidromic point is at once cotidal with high and low waters, which is satisfied by zero tidal motion. (The rare exception occurs when the tide encircles an island, as it does around New Zealand, Iceland and Madagascar.) Tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts, so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant amplitude (half the distance between high and low water) which decrease to zero at the amphidromic point. For a semi-diurnal tide the amphidromic point can be thought of roughly like the center of a clock face, with the hour hand pointing in the direction of the high water cotidal line, which is directly opposite the low water cotidal line. High water rotates about the amphidromic point once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines, and away from ebbing cotidal lines. This rotation is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and is caused by the Coriolis effect. The difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the epoch. The reference tide is the hypothetical constituent [...] "equilibrium tide" [...] on a landless Earth measured at 0° longitude, the <b>Greenwich</b> <b>meridian.</b>|$|E
