40|$|In general, {{the goal}} of test {{automation}} is to reduce test time, to decrease the amount of manual labor and to increase the test coverage. In a time-to-market environment, like ASML, {{the primary goal of}} test automation is to minimize the total <b>test</b> <b>duration.</b> The total <b>test</b> <b>duration</b> is the time between test start and the moment that the system is fault free, so including diagnosing and fixing faults. Therefore, the total <b>test</b> <b>duration</b> is not only depending on the <b>test</b> case <b>duration,</b> also the diagnosis and fix duration (the fix-loop) influences the total <b>test</b> <b>duration.</b> Time to market can also be reduced by using a parallel test and fix strategy.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of an intervertebral disc is time dependent. In literature different constitutive equations {{have been used}} to describe creep. It is unsure whether these different approaches yield valid predictions. In this study, we compared the validity of different equations for the prediction of creep behaviour. To this end, human thoracic discs were preloaded at 0. 1. MPa for 12. h, compressed (0. 8. MPa) for 24. h and finally unloaded (0. 1. MPa) for 24. h. A Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) model and a Double-Voight (DV) model were fitted to the creep data. Model parameters were calculated for <b>test</b> <b>durations</b> of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. h. Both models described the measured data well, but parameters were highly sensitive to <b>test</b> <b>duration.</b> The estimated time constant varied with <b>test</b> <b>duration</b> from 3. 6 to 17. h. When extrapolating beyond <b>test</b> <b>duration,</b> the DV model under-estimated and the KWW model over-estimated creep. The 24. h experiment was still too short for an accurate determination of the parameters. Therefore, parameters obtained in this paper can be used to describe normal behaviour, but are not suitable for extrapolation beyond the <b>test</b> <b>duration.</b> © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

However, the study clearly showed that shorter <b>testing</b> <b>durations</b> generally increased clogging and reduced the surface infiltration rates of the models when artificial silica sediment was used.

As the cost of a test increases with increasing <b>test</b> <b>duration,</b> there is a desire to have a prior estimate of the minimum <b>test</b> <b>duration</b> that yields valid results. Many authors proposed a recommended minimum duration, based on practical field experience (Gehlin 1998; Austin 1998). Other authors developed a method to estimate the minimum <b>test</b> <b>duration</b> based on the borehole and soil properties (Beier and Smith 2003). The probabilistic criterion proposed consists of finding a consistent value based on a forward regression (FR) procedure: when the slope value does not show a meaningful change by an increment of the test time, it can be assumed that the heat transfer in the underground follows the predicted evaluation model, and the evaluation time is large enough to provide for the statistical precision desired.|$|R
40|$|Two {{approaches}} to assess auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) are compared under similar test conditions: a monaural single-frequency technique with a detection method based on phase coherence (AUDERA), and a binaural multiple-frequency technique using the F-test (MASTER).

The test-retest reliability {{and the influence}} of prolonging the <b>test</b> <b>duration</b> are assessed.

About 55 % of the estimates are within 5 dB of the behavioral hearing threshold, and 94 % within 15 dB.

This study was performed at Feiz hospital in Isfahan, Iran from September to December of 2004 to evaluate the effects of phacoemulsification surgery on tear drainage in eyes with senile cataract. METHODS: This cohort study was performed on 110 patients with senile cataract who had phacoemulsification and posterior chamber lens (PCL) implantation surgery under topical anesthesia in one eye. Included patients had fluorescein disappearance and taste <b>test</b> <b>duration</b> of xxx; 5. 5 minutes in both eyes before operation. Tear <b>drainage</b> function <b>tests</b> were repeated for one week and one month after surgery in both eyes and obtained data were compared. RESULTS: The incidence of lacrimal drainage impairment in eyes treated for senile cataract was 35 % at one week and 20 % at one month after phacoemulsification surgery. The mean taste <b>test</b> <b>duration</b> time was 3. 84 &plusmn; 0. 77 minutes before surgery, 7. 30 &plusmn; 4. 80 minutes at one week and 6. 31 &plusmn; 4. 42 minutes at one month after surgery (P &lt; 0. 001 and P &lt; 0. 001 respectively).
