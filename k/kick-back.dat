50|$|The Australian Wheat Board was a {{statutory}} authority established in 1939. AWB Limited was {{the company that}} resulted from its privatisation in 1999. The <b>kick-backs</b> scandal engulfed both bodies. The Australian Wheat Board and AWB Limited enjoyed a monopoly over the sale of Australian wheat exports. It achieved this {{through the use of}} a monopsony (single buyer) regime within Australia, where wheat growers were only able to sell on their wheat to a single desk. This was intended to prevent farmers under-cutting each other on price, and thus assure the highest price for Australian wheat. The AWB had sold wheat to Iraq since 1948, and was the single largest supplier of humanitarian goods to the nation during the Oil-for-Food Program.|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of trade and business, {{there have always been}} alternative—and often {{unethical}}—ways of closing sales in the form of extra <b>kick-backs</b> and luxurious goods. In modern times these unethical incentives are referred to as bribes. More recently, the practice of bribery has been linked to high-profile corruption and fraud cases in the United States, rocking the international marketplace for companies such as Pfizer, Avon, Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Johnson, and Daimler AG. However, many international companies actually welcome bribery as a way to compete with other companies in the global marketplace. When looking at bribery and its effect on the global market, it is important to discuss the ways in which businesses actually practice bribery, the ethical issues behind it, how it is used in the global market, the effects of United States’ laws enacted to prevent it, as well as the controversy behind the practice of bribery in general...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{firms in}} Kenya {{spend an average}} of 7. 5 % of their annual sales on bribery, and as much as 14 % of the value of {{government}} contracts on <b>kick-backs.</b> These averages mask significant sector, location and size differences in the exposure to corruption. Networking with public servants somewhat shields firms against corruption but that with politicians deepens exposure. Corruption does not fast-track access to public services and does not, therefore, play any greasing function. Rather, corruption significantly dampens firm growth and the propensity to export, implicitly reducing returns to investment and employment. It also adds to the cost of doing business, reducing Kenya's competitiveness and critically undermining the country's development prospects. These findings uphold others that have demonstrated the deleterious consequences of corruption, and provide further reason for intensifying the fight against the vice. In the circumstance, there is value in exploring ways of dismantling bureaucratic discretion and control rights on which corruption thrives. Furthermore, sustaining the program of privatisation of state corporations and utility companies would create space for expanding services, ameliorate capacity restrictions, obviate service-stretching, inject competition in the provision of services and reduce rents that are the objects of corruption...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{draws from}} {{research}} {{that sought to}} explore the structure of corruption in Kenya and its implications {{on the performance of}} firms. Design/methodology/approach – The research takes the form of descriptive and econometrics analyses of Investment Climate Assessment data sets. Findings – Kenyan manufacturers spent significant proportions of their annual sales on unofficial payments including <b>kick-backs</b> on government contracts. There is also evidence of co-movement between such unofficial payments and red-tape, suggesting that corruption does not play any greasing function. Not only does corruption undermine firm growth but also reduces the propensity to export. The findings uphold others that demonstrate the deleterious consequences of corruption. Research limitations/implications – Further work is needed in tidying up the methods of collecting corruption data. Although a battery of strategies was used to reduce potential response biases common in corruption data, the information leans towards perceptions so that the findings remain tentative. Practical implications – The results should be of interest to policy makers and researchers and should put the fight against corruption on a firmer footing. Originality/value – The paper establishes that corruption undermines the performance of firms. Business performance, Corruption, Kenya...|$|R
40|$|Husqvarna {{is a world}} leading {{producer}} of chainsaws with a well-established brand name. Husqvarna now {{has an interest in}} investigating the possibiltiy to expand their production of chains and guide bars to include cutting equipment for timber-harvesters. This project is a technical study which aims to answer questions about cutting equipment for timber-harvesters that have been decided in cooperation with Husqvarna. The questions have mainly been focused on forces, cutting speeds, service and maintenance -as well as general questions regarding the size of the Swedish market. Two methods have been applied to answer the questions. Interviews with retailers of harvesters, producers of harvester heads and harvester drivers. The main findings in this project show that there is a relatively small selection of harvester chains on the Swedish market. In contrast to the selection of harvester chains the selection of guide bars is quite large. Ranging from solid bars to bars with a replaceable sprocket nose with a special alloy to bars with special easy to fit attachments. In total: timber-harvesters on the Swedish market demand for a number of harvester chains that is between 600 000 – 1 000 000 and between 85 700 – 167 700 for guide bars. There are big differences between chains and harvester chains when it comes to cutting speeds, chain forces and depth gauge settings. In general significantly higher standard of requirement is set on the harvester chain. When it comes to <b>kick-backs</b> and vibrations however, standards are higher for handheld chained machine...|$|R
