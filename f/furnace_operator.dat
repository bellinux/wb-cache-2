The corporation was for several decades one of the few major heavy industries based in the largely agricultural Southern United States, by a wide margin the largest blast <b>furnace</b> <b>operator</b> in the South and at one time the second largest steel producer on the continent. Its 1900 asset sheet listed 17 blast furnaces, 3256 beehive coke ovens, 120 Solvay coke ovens, 15 red ore mines, as well an extensive network of railroads, although following the panic of 1893 the company shifted its primary interests from railroads to steel. TCI's largest industrial plant was located in Ensley, a company town founded in 1886 on the outskirts of Birmingham, Alabama, by company president Enoch Ensley. Ensley (...) was served by the sizable Birmingham Southern Railroad, one of TCI's early acquisitions, and from 1899 contained four 200-ton blast furnaces. In 1906 two more furnaces were constructed, and 40,000 tonnes of steel were produced that year, feeding Ensley's integrated rail, wire and plate mills. The company was fiercely competitive with the larger Pittsburgh steel businesses to the north, owing to the remarkable fact that all the natural resources required to produce steel were located in abundance within a relatively small radius of the Birmingham mills.|$|E

The chemical reaction is generated by titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) reacting with saturated carbon in hot metal. The following calculations are done by using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package, FLUENT (version 6. 2), with a segregated model.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of a hybrid SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system for the air suspension 'flash' alumina calciner at Aluminium de Grece St. Nicholas plant. The system includes two additional modules, an 'expert system' based on 10 years of commissioning and operating experience and a dynamic model continuously predicting the quality of the product. It is implemented on an industrial PC under an industrial control software environment and interfaces to the furnace through a programmable logic controller (PLC) system. The system guides the <b>furnace</b> <b>operator</b> to reduce sensible heat losses by operating with a marginal excess air flow rate, to take advantage of the higher energy efficiency at higher production rates and, at the same time, to avoid potentially dangerous operating conditions leading to loss of production and consequential energy losses. It also performs the traditional SCADA functions (data acquisition, maintaining history files for important parameters and display of important operating parameters in both a mimic process diagram and a series of graphs.) In addition to these tasks a simplified dynamic model gives the operator a prediction of the current value of the main product quality parameter, which can only be measured with laboratory equipment. Preliminary results have shown that reduction of secondary air flow rate and reduced downtime achieved by the operator under the guidance of the system can reduce energy consumption by as much as 10 %. A similar, or even greater, improvement in energy efficiency can be expected by implementing a similar system to cement calcination kilns based on the same technology. © European Communities 1997.

Regarding the occupations, the workers developed activities as a welder, electrician, <b>furnace</b> <b>operator,</b> truck driver and baker. Content analysis of the interviews allowed the identification of three categories: "Safe conditions in work environment," "Defying permanent risks in the workplace" and "Situations of risk {{at the time of the}} accident. " In the first category, the subjects revealed several situations considered safe in performing work activities, for example, training to perform work activities, use of PPEs appropriate to the risks, adhesion to routines and safety standards, interpersonal care and the presence of worker health professionals in the workplace - situations that emerge as important elements in the quest for protection of the worker system. In the second category, it was identified, through the participants' testimonies, the permanent presence of risks in the workplace. The risks were related to lack of training of some subjects, informal employment link, absence or ineffectiveness of the use of protection equipment, characteristics of work environments, handling high temperatures, presence of old and / or restored gear, long work hours and the development of activities in constant stress. These may have contributed to the imbalance of the system of workers' protection and the occurrence of accidents.

Different separate effects on the flow structure of the glass melt are simulated, but only the glass melt is considered. The net heat flux distribution is imposed at the combustion space/glass melt interface, and its effects on the flow and thermal structures of the glass melt are analyzed in a systematic manner by changing the heat flux distribution while keeping the total heat input to the glass bath constant. The main purpose of the work is to evaluate the capability of the <b>furnace</b> <b>operators</b> to control the glass flow and temperature fields by adjusting the firing in the combustion space. The physical phenomena affecting the flow structure in the glass melt are analyzed and discussed in detail.
