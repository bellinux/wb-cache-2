Using a monetary <b>deflator</b> in 2010 United States dollars, the damage from Diane would be about $7.4billion, which would have been the 17th highest in the United States.

Since 2007, however, with the improvement in banking sector and domestic consumption, national economic growth has accelerated to over 6% annually and this helped Indonesia weather the 2008–2009 Great Recession. The Indonesian economy performed strongly during the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and in 2012, its GDP grew by over 6%.

From the national accounts indexes of output per person employed and output per hour worked are derived, giving the basic measures of labour productivity.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIn COPD patients, {{hyperinflation}} impairs cardiac function. We examined whether lung deflation improves oxygen pulse, {{a surrogate}} marker of stroke volume. MethodsIn 129 NETT patients with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and arterial blood gases (ABG substudy), hyperinflation was assessed with residual volume to total lung capacity ratio (RV/TLC), and cardiac function with oxygen pulse (O 2 pulse=VO 2 /HR) at baseline and 6 months. Medical and surgical patients were divided into “deflators” and “non-deflators” based on change in RV/TLC from baseline (∆RV/TLC). We defined deflation as the ∆RV/TLC experienced by 75 % of surgical patients. We examined changes in O 2 pulse at peak and similar (iso-work) exercise. Findings were validated in 718 patients who underwent CPET without ABGs. ResultsIn the ABG substudy, surgical and medical <b>deflators</b> improved their RV/TLC and peak O 2 pulse (median ∆RV/TLC − 18. 0 % vs. − 9. 3 %, p= 0. 0003; median ∆O 2 pulse 13. 6 % vs. 1. 8 %, p= 0. 12). Surgical <b>deflators</b> also improved iso-work O 2 pulse (0. 53 mL/beat, p= 0. 04 at 20 W). In the validation cohort, surgical <b>deflators</b> experienced a greater improvement in peak O 2 pulse than medical <b>deflators</b> (mean 18. 9 % vs. 1. 1 %). In surgical <b>deflators</b> improvements in O 2 pulse at rest and during unloaded pedaling (0. 32 mL/beat, p< 0. 0001 and 0. 47 mL/beat, p< 0. 0001, respectively) corresponded with significant reductions in HR and improvements in VO 2. On multivariate analysis, <b>deflators</b> were 88 % more likely than non-deflators to have an improvement in O 2 pulse (OR 1. 88, 95 % CI 1. 30 – 2. 72, p= 0. 0008).

5000|$|Unlike some price indices (like the CPI), the GDP <b>deflator</b> is {{not based}} on a fixed basket of goods and services. The basket is allowed to change with people's {{consumption}} and investment patterns. [...] Specifically, for the GDP <b>deflator,</b> the [...] "basket" [...] in each year is the set of all goods that were produced domestically, weighted by the market value of the total consumption of each good. Therefore, new expenditure patterns are allowed to show up in the <b>deflator</b> as people respond to changing prices. The theory behind this approach is that the GDP <b>deflator</b> reflects up to date expenditure patterns. For instance, if the price of chicken increases relative to the price of beef, it is claimed that people will likely spend more money on beef as a substitute for chicken.|$|E

40|$|Tracking {{poverty is}} {{predicated}} {{on the availability of}} comparable consumption data and reliable price <b>deflators.</b> However, regular series of strictly comparable data are only rarely available. Price <b>deflators</b> are also often missing or disputed. In response, poverty prediction methods that track consumption correlates as opposed to consumption itself have been developed. These methods typically assume that the estimated relation between consumption and its predictors is stable over time [...] an assumption that cannot usually be tested directly. This study analyzes the performance of poverty prediction models based on small area estimation techniques. Predicted poverty estimates are compared with directly observed levels in two country settings where data comparability over time is not a problem. Prediction models that employ either non-staple food or non-food expenditures or a full set of assets as predictors are found to yield poverty estimates that match observed poverty well. This offers some support to the use of such methods to approximate the evolution of poverty. Two further country examples illustrate how an application of the method employing models based on household assets can help to adjudicate between alternative price <b>deflators.</b> Rural Poverty Reduction,Regional Economic Development,Debt Markets,Achieving Shared Growth...|$|R
