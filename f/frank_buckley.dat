5|$|Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 July 1894– 19 October 1972) was a Welsh {{professional}} footballer. He {{began his}} football career at his hometown club Cardiff City after impressing the club's coaching staff {{in a trial}} match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, led by Major <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley,</b> which became known as the Football Battalion. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant.|$|E
5|$|Bradford's defence of the FA Cup was {{ended in}} the fourth round by Barnsley, {{who went on to}} succeed Bradford as the holders. The 3–2 defeat, played at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, {{following}} two draws, brought an end to 11consecutiveclean sheets in the FA Cup—a competition record. The sequence also included a 12thclean sheet in the second replay against Barnsley which was abandoned because of crowd trouble. The cup run had included the first Bradford derby between City and cross-city rivals Bradford (Park Avenue). In the league, City finished 11th, the first of four consecutive mid-table finishes before league football was suspended because of the First World War. City's FA Cup hero Speirs, who had joined Leeds City, was one of many footballers to lose his life during the war. Bradford City players who died included Bob Torrance, another FA Cup winner, and Evelyn Lintott, as well as several reserve team players. <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley</b> and Jock Ewart were seriously wounded, and Dicky Bond was taken prisoner-of-war. In 1921, Bond laid a commemorative wreath on the Cenotaph in memory of his fallen colleagues prior to a league game at Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{resumed his}} {{football}} career {{back at home}} with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, {{who were at the}} time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley</b> took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years {{at a time when the}} club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.|$|E
50|$|The defender made twenty-eight league {{appearances}} for Stanley, scoring one goal, {{before joining}} <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley's</b> Blackpool in 1926.|$|R

He scored one goal in four Third Division North appearances for the [...] "Tigers", before departing Boothferry Park {{at the end of the}} 1946-47 season.|$|R
25|$|Edwards {{proved to}} be a poor manager, and the 1947–48 season was a {{struggle}} against relegation to the Third Division. After just a year in charge, Edwards was moved back to the post of assistant manager, and the Leeds board appointed Major <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley.</b>|$|E
25|$|For the 1923–24 season, Major <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley,</b> {{previously}} {{manager at}} Norwich City, was installed as Norman's successor.

25|$|There {{was also}} a new manager. Sydney Beaumont, a former Preston North End player, {{replaced}} Major <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley,</b> who left for Wolves. Beaumont only lasted a season, however, in which Blackpool finished nineteenth, avoiding relegation by a single point. A milestone occurred on Christmas Eve 1927, when Blackpool played their 1,000th Football League game, at Fulham.|$|E
50|$|Thorpe {{signed for}} <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley's</b> Blackpool {{prior to the}} start of the 1924-25 season after leaving non-league Sutton Town.

25|$|The most {{successful}} {{of these is}} Stan Cullis, whose 16-year reign brought {{all three of the}} club's league championships as well as two FA Cup triumphs. Two other managers have also been inducted into the Club Hall of Fame: Major <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley</b> and Graham Turner, while Bill McGarry and John Barnwell have both won major trophies in the post-war period. In recent times, both Dave Jones and Mick McCarthy have led the club to the Premier League. Wolves have also been served by two former England national team managers, in Graham Taylor and Glenn Hoddle.|$|E
25|$|Wolves {{lifted the}} FA Cup {{for the first}} time in 1893 when they beat Everton 1–0, and added a second triumph in 1908, two years after having dropped into the Second Division. After {{struggling}} for many years to regain their place in the top division, the club suffered a further relegation in 1923, entering the Third Division (North), which they won at the first attempt. Eight years later Wolves regained their top-flight status after winning the Second Division title under Major <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley.</b> With Buckley at the helm the team became established as one of the leading club sides in England in the years leading up to the Second World War, as they finished runners-up in the league twice in succession, as well as reaching the last pre-war FA Cup Final, in which they suffered a shock defeat to Portsmouth.|$|E
25|$|Buckley {{was born}} November 24, 1925, in New York City, {{the son of}} Aloise Josephine Antonia (Steiner) and William <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley,</b> Sr., a Texas-born lawyer and oil developer. His mother, from New Orleans, was of Swiss-German, German, and Irish descent, while his {{paternal}} grandparents, from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, were of Irish ancestry. The sixth of ten children, Buckley moved as a boy {{with his family to}} Mexico, and then to Sharon, Connecticut, before beginning his formal schooling in Paris, where he attended first grade. By age seven, he received his first formal training in English at a day school in London; his first and second languages were Spanish and French. As a boy, Buckley developed a love for music, sailing, horses, hunting, and skiing. All of these interests would be reflected in his later writings. Just before World War II, at age 12–13, he attended the Catholic preparatory school St. John's Beaumont School in England.|$|E
50|$|Thompson {{played for}} Bathgate, Oldham Athletic, Manchester City, Stalybridge Celtic and Ashton National Gas, before joining Port Vale in January 1923. He scored his first {{goal for the}} club on 3 February, in a 2-0 win over Blackpool at The Old Recreation Ground. He also claimed goals against Derby County and Southampton to take his tally for the club to three goals in eight Second Division games.

25|$|Growing up {{in a poor}} {{family in}} the Cwmbwrla {{district}} of Swansea alongside elder brother John and three other siblings, John and Mel Charles seemed destined to begin their careers at local club Swansea Town. However manager Billy McCandless was unwilling to test youngsters in the unforgiving waters of the Third Division South, so the boys were not signed up to the club. This proved costly to Swansea, {{and the result was}} that John signed with Leeds United, and fourteen-year-old Mel also followed him to Elland Road {{to become one of the}} ground staff. Despite fitting in well at the club, he was unable to settle in Leeds; due to his poor background he was unable to afford trips back to Wales to visit his family and he was also illiterate so could not write home. After a young apprentice, also from Swansea, failed to impress at Leeds, manager Major <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley</b> asked Charles to accompany him on the trip back to his hometown. However, due to his homesickness, Charles never returned to Yorkshire once he made it back to Swansea. Instead Swansea Town scout Joe Sykes persuaded Charles to join the club's ground staff.|$|E
500|$|However, the war soon {{turned sour}} for the {{battalion}} {{as they began}} suffering casualties from the fighting, including <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley</b> who suffered severe shrapnel injuries. Having returned to the front, the regiment {{was involved in the}} Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest battles in history, in particularly the Battle of Delville Wood. Keenor later described the scene during what he called a [...] "hellish battle", stating: ...|$|E
500|$|Keenor {{joined the}} 17th Middlesex Battalion, which {{became known as}} the Football Battalion due to the large number of footballers that made up the core of the unit, led by <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley.</b> Stationed in London with the regiment, Keenor would travel by train every weekend to the site of each Cardiff fixture in order to keep playing for the team and would be listed in the matchday {{programme}} as [...] "Private Keenor" [...] {{for the remainder of the}} season as Cardiff finished third in the First Division of the Southern Football League. He made 21 appearances in the league during the season, scoring two goals. With the war escalating, the Football Association officially suspended all of its competitions at the end of the 1914–15 season.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Johnson began his {{recording}} career, {{he was a}} well-known evangelist with a [...] "remarkable technique and {{a wide range of}} songs", as noted by the blues historian Paul Oliver. On December 3, 1927, Johnson was assembled along with Billiken Johnson and Coley Jones at a temporary studio that talent scout <b>Frank</b> <b>Buckley</b> Walker had set up in the Deep Ellum neighborhood in Dallas to record for Columbia Records.

2500|$|Michigan {{was unable}} to {{capitalize}} on Ward's long return, as a field goal attempt by Everhardus went wide. [...] In the fourth quarter, Michigan's second touchdown {{was set up by}} Chuck Bernard. [...] Bernard intercepted a pass at midfield and returned it to the 23-yard line. [...] Michigan drove to the two-yard line, and Everhardus scored on a two-yard off-tackle run. [...] Carl Savage kicked the extra point to extend the lead to 13–0.

5000|$|The {{philosophy}} of [...] "fusionism" [...] was developed at National Review magazine during the 1950s under the editorship of William F. Buckley, Jr. and is most identified with his associate editor <b>Frank</b> Meyer. As <b>Buckley</b> recounted the founding he [...] "brokered" [...] between [...] "an extraordinary mix" [...] of libertarians, traditional conservatives, anti-communists {{and even an}} anarchist to produce the ideas and writings that produced modern conservatism. He identified Meyer's synthesis as the most likely best solution of defining conservatism.|$|R
50|$|Australia {{submitted}} {{an unsuccessful}} {{bid for the}} 2022 FIFA World Cup. On 2 December 2010 FIFA announced that the event would be held in Qatar. Australia also lodged a bid for the 2018 World Cup, but withdrew the bid on 10 June 2010. The 2018 and 2022 World Cups will be the 21st and 22nd editions of the FIFA World Cup. The bidding procedure to host both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest. The bid was presented by <b>Frank</b> Lowy, Ben <b>Buckley,</b> Quentin Bryce and Elle Macpherson. However, due to controversies of Qatar hosting, Australia's bid is possible if FIFA decides to strip Qatar's 2022 hosting rights.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the filming}} of the second season, the band became tired of scripts which they deemed {{monotonous}} and stale. They had already succeeded in eliminating the laugh track (a then-standard on American sitcoms), with the bulk of Season 2 episodes airing minus the canned chuckles. They proposed switching {{the format of the}} series to become more like a variety show, with musical guests and live performances. This desire was partially fulfilled within some second-season episodes, with guest stars like musicians <b>Frank</b> Zappa, Tim <b>Buckley</b> and Charlie Smalls (composer of The Wiz) performing on the show. However, NBC was not interested in eliminating the existing format, and the group (except for Peter) had little desire to continue for a third season. Tork said in DVD commentary that everyone had developed such difficult personalities that the big-name stars invited as guests on the show would invariably leave the experience [...] "hating everybody".|$|R
