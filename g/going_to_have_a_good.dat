That door has stayed open and that whole kind of wacky, zany Troi thing has continued into the next movie, which is great for me because I like to do things that are different." [...] Sirtis stated of her role in Star Trek: Nemesis, [...] "I sort of had an inkling that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> part in this film because John Logan was such a big fan of the character. So I knew that he would do her some justice." ...|$|E

You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time. But it ain't for that, but for what your duty tells you. You that haven't a bit or a sup but what comes from him, and you to stand shilly-shallying! I can't abide the idea!" ...|$|E

I went to a painter I know-by-the-way, he was guilty of {{suggesting}} you for this thing, but I told him I was ahead of him--and I got him to submit my idea to one of his class, and that's the result. Well, now, there ain't anything in this world that sells a book like a pretty cover, and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretty cover for 'Every Other Week' every time. We've cut loose from the old traditional quarto literary newspaper size, and we've cut loose from the old two-column big page magazine size; we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> duodecimo page, clear black print, and paper that 'll make your mouth water; and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fresh illustration for the cover of each number, and we ain't agoing to give the public any rest at all. Sometimes we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> delicate little landscape like this, and sometimes we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> indelicate little figure, or as much so as the law will allow." ...|$|R

6000|$|When Blacky cries [...] "Caw, caw, caw, caw!" [...] As if he'd {{dislocate}} his jaw, His relatives all hasten where He waits {{them with}} a crafty air.

6000|$|There {{is always}} a wind in Holland; it comes from over the sea. There is nothing to stay its progress. It leaps the low dykes and sweeps with a shriek across the sad, soft dunes, and thinks it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time and play havoc in the land. But the Dutchman laughs behind his great pipe as it comes to him {{shouting}} and roaring. [...] "Welcome, my hearty, welcome," [...] he chuckles, [...] "come blustering and bragging; the bigger you are the better I like you." [...] And when it is once in the land, behind the long, straight dykes, behind the waving line of sandy dunes, he seizes hold of it, and will not let it go till it has done its tale of work.|$|E
6000|$|He {{went through}} the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly, muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> night of it. The clerk in Terry Kelly's said A crown! but the {{consignor}} held out for six shillings; {{and in the end}} the six shillings was allowed him literally. He came out of the pawn-office joyfully, making a little cylinder, of the coins between his thumb and fingers. In Westmoreland Street the footpaths were crowded with young men and women returning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out the names of the evening editions. The man passed through the crowd, looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring masterfully at the office-girls. His head was full of the noises of tram-gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the curling fumes of punch. As he walked on he preconsidered the terms in which he would narrate the incident to the boys: ...|$|E
