50|$|Most CNC milling {{machines}} (also called machining centers) are computer controlled vertical mills {{with the ability}} to move the spindle vertically along the Z-axis. This extra degree of freedom permits their use in <b>diesinking,</b> engraving applications, and 2.5D surfaces such as relief sculptures. When combined with the use of conical tools or a ball nose cutter, it also significantly improves milling precision without impacting speed, providing a cost-efficient alternative to most flat-surface hand-engraving work.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{numerical}} control, horizontal {{milling machines}} evolved first, because they evolved by putting milling tables under lathe-like headstocks. Vertical mills appeared in subsequent decades, and accessories {{in the form}} of add-on heads to change horizontal mills to vertical mills (and later vice versa) have been commonly used. Even in the CNC era, a heavy workpiece needing machining on multiple sides lends itself to a horizontal machining center, while <b>diesinking</b> lends itself to a vertical one.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice between}} {{vertical}} and horizontal spindle orientation in milling machine design usually hinges on the shape and size of a workpiece {{and the number of}} sides of the workpiece that require machining. Work in which the spindle's axial movement is normal to one plane, with an endmill as the cutter, lends itself to a vertical mill, where the operator can stand before the machine and have easy access to the cutting action by looking down upon it. Thus vertical mills are most favored for <b>diesinking</b> work (machining a mould into a block of metal). Heavier and longer workpieces lend themselves to placement on the table of a horizontal mill.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the end of}} World War I, {{machine tool}} control {{advanced}} in various ways that {{laid the groundwork for}} later CNC technology. The jig borer popularized the ideas of coordinate dimensioning (dimensioning of all locations on the part from a single reference point); working routinely in [...] "tenths" [...] (ten-thousandths of an inch, 0.0001") as an everyday machine capability; and using the control to go straight from drawing to part, circumventing jig-making. In 1920 the new tracer design of J.C. Shaw was applied to Keller tracer milling machines for die-sinking via the three-dimensional copying of a template. This made <b>diesinking</b> faster and easier just as dies were in higher demand than ever before, and was very helpful for large steel dies such as those used to stamp sheets in automobile manufacturing. Such machines translated the tracer movements to input for servos that worked the machine leadscrews or hydraulics. They also spurred the development of antibacklash leadscrew nuts. All of the above concepts were new in the 1920s but became routine in the NC/CNC era. By the 1930s, incredibly large and advanced milling machines existed, such as the Cincinnati Hydro-Tel, that presaged today's CNC mills in every respect except for CNC control itself.|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{study of}} {{electrode}} wear ratio (EWR) on the <b>diesinking</b> electrical discharge machining (EDM) of Ti- 6 AL- 4 V titanium alloy with copper-tungsten (Cu-W) electrode has been carried out. Pulse on time (ON), pulse of time (OFF), peak current (V) and servo voltage (SV) were seen as the machining parameters. The experiments were run according {{to the design of}} experiments (DOE), which is two levels of full factorial with added centre points. The experimental results reveal that pulse on time and peak current are statistically significant parameters for affecting EWR with the p-value of 0. 0013 and 0. 0012 respectively. Moreover, based on ANOVA, we recognized peak current as the most significant parameters which contribute 31. 75 %, followed by pulse on time, servo voltage and pulse on time which contribute 30. 99 %, 8. 68 % and 0. 72 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic lapping is classified, {{according}} to DIN (GS), as cutting with a geometrically undefined cutting edge. Both simple bore-holes and complex contours {{can be produced}} using this <b>diesinking</b> process. Analysis of the cutting mechanisms has demonstrated that {{the width of the}} gap between tool and workpiece influences both the material removal rate and the wear characteristics of the tool. The gap width is determined by the lapping pressure exerted on the tool and by the amplitude of vibration. When there is an optimum combination of these two parameters, the removal rate increases and wear distribution becomes more even. The machining result is also affected by the oscillation characteristics of the sonotrodes. The oscillation quality has been improved and both the material removal quantity and machining accuracy have been increased by the application of the Finite Element Method. It has also emerged that the use of PCD-tipped tools can greatly reduce tool wear. The deployment of a pr ocess monitoring system increases the reproducibility in ultrasonic machining operations, which is also beneficial to the level of quality which can be reached...|$|E
