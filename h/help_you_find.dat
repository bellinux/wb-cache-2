2500|$|Introduced in February 2017, Google Cloud Search {{enables a}} [...] "unified search experience" [...] in G Suite. Cloud Search lets users search for {{information}} {{across the entire}} G Suite product lineup. Users can also search for contacts, with results including the person's contact details, as well as events and files in common. The Cloud Search mobile app features [...] "assist cards", described by Google as [...] "a new way to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> the right information at the right time. Using Google's machine intelligence technology, these cards can help you prepare for an upcoming meeting or even suggest files that need your attention". Google states that Cloud Search respects file-sharing permissions, meaning that users will only see results for files they have access to. The initial global rollout of Cloud Search introduced the functionality for G Suite Business and Enterprise customers, with Google stating that more functionality will be added over time, including support for third-party applications.|$|E
