The proximal {{part of each}} scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves up and then steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence, the <b>interference</b> <b>effect</b> favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the curved part of the scale.|$|E

That is, under the appropriate conditions, electrons and other matter would show properties of either particles or waves. The corpuscular properties of a particle are demonstrated when it is shown to have a localized position in space along its trajectory at any given moment. The wave-like nature of light is displayed, for example, when a beam of light is passed through parallel slits thereby creating interference patterns. In 1927 George Paget Thomson, discovered the <b>interference</b> <b>effect</b> was produced when a beam of electrons was passed through thin metal foils and by American physicists Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer by the reflection of electrons from a crystal of nickel.|$|E

2500|$|Practical anti-reflection coatings, however, rely on an {{intermediate}} layer {{not only for}} its direct reduction of reflection coefficient, but also use the <b>interference</b> <b>effect</b> of a thin layer. Assume the layer's thickness is controlled precisely, such that it is exactly one quarter of the wavelength of light in the layer ( [...] , where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength). The layer is then called a quarter-wave coating. For this type of coating a normally incident beam I, when reflected from the second interface, will travel exactly half its own wavelength further than the beam reflected from the first surface, leading to destructive interference. This is also true for thicker coating layers (3λ/4, 5λ/4, etc.), however the anti-reflective performance is worse in this case due to the stronger dependence of the reflectance on wavelength and the angle of incidence.|$|E
2500|$|Using dogs, Martin Seligman and {{his colleagues}} pioneered the study of {{depression}} in the animal model of learned helplessness at the University of Pennsylvania. Dogs were separated into three groups, the control group, group A had control over when they were being shocked and group B {{had no control over}} when they were being shocked. After the shocking condition the dogs were tested in a shuttle box where they could escape shock by jumping over a partition. To eliminate an <b>interference</b> <b>effect</b> – that the dogs did not learn responses while being shocked that would interfere with their normal escape behavior – the dogs were immobilized using curare, a paralyzing drug while they were being shocked. Both the control group and group A tended to jump over the partition to escape shock while group B dogs did not jump and would passively take the shock. The dogs in group B perceived that the outcome was not related to their efforts. [...] Consequently, a theory emerged that attributed the behavior of the animals to the effects of the shock as a stressor so extreme that it depleted a neurochemical needed by the animals for movement. [...] After the dogs study the effects of helplessness have been tested in species from fish to cats. [...] Most recently learned helplessness has been studied in rhesus macaques using inescapable shock, evoked through stress situations like forced swimming, behavioral despair tasks, tails suspension and pinch induced catalepsy; situations that render the monkey incapable of controlling the environment.|$|E

Against {{the problem}} of the {{aerodynamic}} <b>interference</b> <b>effects</b> on aerostatic coefficients between parallel continuous rigid frame bridges with high-pier and long-span, the aerodynamic <b>interference</b> <b>effects</b> on aerostatic coefficients of main beam in the parallel long-span continuous rigid frame bridges were investigated in details by means of wind tunnel test. The space between the two main beams and wind attack angles were changed during the wind tunnel test to study the <b>effects</b> on aerodynamic <b>interferences</b> of aerostatic coefficients of main beam. The test got aerostatic coefficients of 10 conditions. The research results have shown that the aerodynamic <b>interference</b> <b>effects</b> on aerostatic coefficients of main beam in parallel bridges can not be ignored. The aerodynamic <b>interference</b> <b>effects</b> on parallel bridge main beam is shown mainly as follows: The drag coefficient of main beam downstream dropped and the drag coefficient of main beam upstream changed but not change significantly. There are also the aerodynamic <b>interference</b> <b>effects</b> of lateral force coefficient and torque coefficient between the main beams upstream and downstream.
