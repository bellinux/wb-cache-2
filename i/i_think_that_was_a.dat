5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E
25|$|I can {{probably}} understand it coming from Channel Nine. I think they're {{about to go}} into negotiations for the TV rights. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pretty tactical move to try to talk down one-day cricket and what the Australian team's putting out. But it's still called the Australian cricket team.|$|E
500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E
5000|$|Howard Schmidt, an American {{cybersecurity}} expert, {{argued in}} March 2010 <b>that</b> [...] "there <b>is</b> no cyberwar... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a terrible metaphor and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a terrible concept.

500|$|Despite stating he was [...] "100 percent" [...] healthy {{after the}} groin injury {{suffered}} two games prior, it appeared the injury was still lingering; after throwing a pass {{during the third}} quarter, Cutler fell down and grabbed his groin, before standing back up. [...] Regarding the injuries, Cutler stated, [...] "It held up OK. It's {{all on the same}} leg so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> problem. But the groin, you take the ankle out of the equation and I would have been fine, I think." [...] Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 69.8 passer rating. Despite x-rays on his ankle being negative, Cutler was ruled out of the next week's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain. During the second quarter, Charles Tillman was also injured, suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle, and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return, allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after; as a result, Tillman missed the entire regular season.|$|E
500|$|Meeting the Detroit Red Wings for {{the second}} {{straight}} year in the Finals, Crosby won his first Stanley Cup with the Penguins in seven games. At 21 years, 10 months, and 5 days, Crosby became the youngest NHL captain to win a Stanley Cup championship since 1895. (The youngest captain to lead his team to the Stanley Cup {{in the history of the}} trophy is Mike Grant of the 1895 Montreal Victorias, who was 21 years and 2 months at the time.) In the deciding game seven, Crosby was forced to watch all but 32 seconds of the third period from the bench after suffering a knee injury less than halfway through the second period due to a hit from Johan Franzén. Following the game, Crosby was criticized by Detroit forward Kris Draper for neglecting to shake hands with some of Detroit's players, most notably captain Nicklas Lidström. An irate Draper was quoted as saying [...] "Nick was waiting and waiting, and Crosby didn't come over to shake his hand. That's ridiculous, especially as their captain." [...] Crosby replied afterward, saying, [...] "I just won the Stanley Cup. I think I have the right to celebrate with my teammates. I know it's not easy waiting around...I understand if they don't feel like waiting around. But you know what? It's the easiest thing to do in the world, to shake hands after you win. I had no intentions of trying to skip guys and not shake their hands. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pretty unreasonable comment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seymour {{later told}} Tracee Hutchison [...] "I {{remember}} having {{a discussion with}} [...] and [...] in a beergarden at the Standard Hotel in Fitzroy, and I said 'Look, you know, we should try and make a commercial record {{if we want to}} take things seriously in the long term.' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> year before we even started thinking about recording this record". He recalled for 100 Best Australian Albums (October 2010) that all the tracks are [...] "connected to the relationship that [...] and I had".|$|E

"I {{understand}} you," [...] {{answered the}} Zulu, in a perfectly composed voice, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good name which we gave you this morning, though, Black Heart, {{there is some}} justice in your words and more wisdom.

6000|$|... "Dear, dear, dear!" [...] {{said the}} duke. [...] "And the {{diamonds}} never turned up after all. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pity, because I knew the late man's father very well. We {{used to be}} together a good deal at one time. He had a fine property, {{and we used to}} live--but I can't just tell you how we used to live. He, he, he!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is unquestionably}} true," [...] rejoined his friend; [...] "but such men as {{you refer to}} have not {{been brought to the}} {{condition}} of renouncing self, and trusting only in our Saviour. They want to have some credit in the matter of their own salvation--hence they fail. Ivor, I have good reason to believe, has been brought to that condition--a condition which insures success--hence my great hopes of him. I became aware of his state of mind, partly from having had a long talk with him the other day, and partly from the report of his good old mother. She told me yesterday that Ivor had come to her, laid his hand on her shoulder, and said, `Mither, I've lost all hope o' mysel' noo,' to which the old woman answered, `That's the best news I've heard for mony a day, my son, for noo the Lord wull let ye see what He can do for ye.' Ivor's reply to that was, `I believe ye're richt, mither.' Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great deal to come from two such undemonstrative Celts." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{as to the}} Butterfly's Ball itself? Imagination had {{depicted}} a splendid realization of the verses, and it was flat to find it merely a children's fancy ball, no acting at all, only dancing, {{and most of the}} children not attempting any characteristic dress, only with some insect attached to head or shoulder; nothing approaching to the fun of the rehearsal at Silverton, as indeed Fly had predicted. The only attempt at representation had cost Mysie more trouble than pleasure, for the training to dance together had been a difficult and wearisome business. Two of the grass-hoppers had been greatly displeased about it, and called it a beastly shame, words much shocking gentle Mysie from aristocratic lips. One of them had been as sulky, angry, and impracticable as possible, just like a log, and the other had consoled himself with all manner of tricks, especially upon the teacher and on Ivinghoe. He would skip like a real grasshopper, he made faces that set all laughing, he tripped Ivinghoe up, he uttered saucy speeches that Mysie considered too shocking to repeat, but which convulsed every one with laughter, Fly most especially, and her governess had punished her for it. 'She would not punish me,' said Mysie, 'though I know I was just as bad, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> shame!' At last the practising had to be carried on without the boys, and yet, {{when it came to the}} point, both the recusants behaved as well and danced as suitably as if they had submitted to the training like their sisters! And oh! the dressing, that was worse.|$|E

6000|$|MRS. COADE (undoubtedly hopeful). We mustn't be too sure, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> it. (Primly.) What <b>is</b> {{it exactly}} <b>that</b> you want, Mr. Coade? ...|$|R

60|$|These {{were the}} words. They were all {{employed}} over the frivolous mercantile concerns of Belgium during the day; {{but in the}} evening they found some hours for the serious concerns of life. I may have a wrong idea of wisdom, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very wise remark. People connected with literature and philosophy are busy all their days in getting rid of second-hand notions and false standards. It is their profession, in the sweat of their brows, by dogged thinking, to recover their old fresh view of life, and distinguish what they really and originally like, from what they have only learned to tolerate perforce. And these Royal Nautical Sportsmen had the distinction still quite legible in their hearts. They had still those clean perceptions of what is nice and nasty, what is interesting and what is dull, which envious old gentlemen refer to as illusions. The nightmare illusion of middle age, the bear's hug of custom gradually squeezing {{the life out of}} a man's soul, had not yet begun for these happy-starred young Belgians. They still knew that the interest they took in their business was a trifling affair compared to their spontaneous, long-suffering affection for nautical sports. To know what you prefer, instead of humbly saying Amen to what the world tells you you ought to prefer, is to have kept your soul alive. Such a man may be generous; he may be honest in something more than the commercial sense; he may love his friends with an elective, personal sympathy, and not accept them as an adjunct of the station to which he has been called. He may be a man, in short, acting on his own instincts, keeping in his own shape that God made him in; and not a mere crank in the social engine-house, welded on principles that he does not understand, and for purposes that he does not care for.|$|E

5000|$|Patti Higgins, the Chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, {{wrote to}} a PUMA supporter: [...] "Having Senator Clinton’s name on a roll call without having the votes would just embarrass her, waste time, and make people agonize over nothing. I find it {{difficult}} to believe that this organization was not an undercover McCain operation." [...] On August 14, 2008, Clinton and Obama issued a joint news release stating that Clinton's name would be put into nomination and a roll-call vote held at the convention, in response to calls from Clinton supporters. Clinton previously stated at a fundraiser: [...] "I believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very big part of how we actually come out unified." ...|$|E

5000|$|Albert Mudrian, {{editor-in-chief}} of the monthly metal magazine Decibel and author of Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore, claims that [...] "They're one of the watershed artists" [...] for heavy music genres, explaining that [...] "they're definitely important to all forms of extreme music. A band like Hatebreed wouldn't sound like they did without Integrity opening up that door for them." [...] Artist Derek Hess, whose art has appeared on albums and promotional materials for numerous metal, hardcore, and crossover artists ranging from Unearth to Converge, as well as MTV's Headbangers Ball compilations, claims that [...] "They were ahead of the curve. Integrity started incorporating art and illustrations, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> real right-on thing that {{broke away from the}} pack. When you say the name Dwid throughout the industry, they know who you're talking about. He's infamous. It's not just a local thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{script for}} the film was written by Laura Lau, {{and based on the}} Uruguayan film La casa muda (2010). According to Lau, she saw the {{original}} film twice and wrote the script for the remake based on the viewings rather than adapting it from paper. The script ultimately came out to only fifty-five pages, which left the filmmakers concerned {{as to whether or not}} the timing would translate during filming: [...] "We wondered whether it would time out properly, because there are no cuts," [...] said Lau. [...] "There’s no way to fix anything in post, it has to pace perfectly when you shoot it. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huge challenge in terms of writing the script." [...] Upon acquiring the house used for filming, Lau re-wrote the script in order for it to be compatible with the restrictions and characteristics of the house.|$|E
