However, <b>global</b> <b>negotiations</b> to reduce tariffs did not make any progress, as member countries of the World Trade Organization {{did not succeed in}} finding agreements to stretch the extent of free trade.

40|$|On {{the eve of}} APEC's tenth anniversary, {{global trade}} {{liberalization}} is at a standstill. The financial crisis of 1998 has sapped the energies of developing countries and diverted the attention of global policy makers to financial issues. International institutions, including APEC, are under attack for their lackluster response to the crisis. Meanwhile, the United States is experiencing huge trade deficits, has failed to pass fast-track trade-negotiating authority, and is beginning to yield to political pressures for protection. And the EU has confirmed WTO rulings over issues of considerable symbolic, if not economic, importance. Yet recent economic trends and the global financial crisis have, if anything, increased the payoff to integration into the world economy (at least on the current account). While reluctant to enter new <b>global</b> <b>negotiations,</b> developing countries are continuing to liberalize, of course partly under EMT pressure. They are also increasingly concerned about access to developed-country markets, which {{they would like to}} see insured through <b>global</b> <b>negotiations.</b> And the extraordinary boom of the "new" economy in the United States is persuading many developed countries, including Japan, that economic integration is the key to competitiveness. Globalization is intensifying and attracting public attention, leading to demands for international disciplines in new areas. For all these reasons, there is now cautiou...|$|E
