Also, the quantification and separation of effects from climate variability and <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> is investigated. First, the Fu formula based on Budyko hypothesis was applied to explore the integrated underlying surface characteristics in the whole basin, and then the SIMHYD model was calibrated and validated using the data from 1986 to 1990 (pre-treatment period). The calibrated model was then used to simulate streamflow in the period 1991 to 1998 (testing period) and obtain quantitative assessment on the impacts of climate variability and <b>human</b> <b>activities.</b> The difference of observed streamflows between the pre-treatment period and the testing period reflects the combined influence of climate variability and <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> in the basin, while the difference between simulated and observed streamflow during the testing period reflects the impact of <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> in the catchment. The {{results show that the}} contribution rate of climate to the streamflow change in the basin is 37. 5 and 62. 5 % for <b>human</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>Human</b> <b>activities</b> exerted a dominant influence upon streamflow change in the Bai River basin...|$|R
40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>activities</b> {{and climate}} change are {{important}} factors that affect grassland ecosystems. A new optimization approach, the approach of conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) related to initial and parameter perturbations, is employed to explore the nonlinearly combined impacts of <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> {{and climate change}} on a grassland ecosystem using a theoretical grassland model. In our study, {{it is assumed that}} the initial perturbations and parameter perturbations are regarded as <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and climate change, respectively. Numerical results indicate that the climate changes causing the maximum effect in the grassland ecosystem are different under disparate intensities of <b>human</b> <b>activities.</b> This implies the pattern of climate change is very critical to the maintenance or degradation of grassland ecosystem in light of high intensity of <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and that the grassland ecosystem should be rationally managed when the moisture index decreases. The grassland ecosystem influenced by the nonlinear combination of <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and climate change undergoes abrupt change, while the grassland ecosystem affected by other types of <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and climate change fails to show the abrupt change under a certain range of perturbations with the theoretical model. The further numerical analyses also indicate that the growth of living biomass and the evaporation from soil surface shaded by the wilted biomass may be crucial factors contributing to the abrupt change of the grassland equilibrium state within the theoretical model...|$|R

30|$|There {{is a close}} {{relationship}} between <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and carrying capacity in coastline. <b>Human</b> <b>activities</b> are carrying object of coastline, such as fishing, reclamation, port construction, etc. It is increased with economic development. Carrying capacity refers to natural space of coastline capacity for exploitation. It is limited in specific time and region. When the <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> scale out limited carrying capacity, the coastline is overload. Otherwise, the coastline is loaded. In Zhejiang province, the carrying capacity that the coastline provided shows regional big difference and varies with marine function zonation. And the intensity of <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> increased and varied in 25 sections in the last 50  years. The aim of coastline management is to prevent increased <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> from exceeding the carrying capacity. We hope to control <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> through remote sensing images monitoring and carrying capacity assessment before it was overloaded. Moreover, we can view carrying capacity as goal states and aim to achieve them through active monitoring and management. Generally, the higher coastline artificialization, the bigger carrying capacity index in limited coastline carrying capacity. In the future, we recommend that this model should {{be applied to the}} practice of coastline management in China.|$|R

40|$|For {{understanding}} {{to what extent}} the relationship between climatic factors and surface runoff been distorted by <b>human</b> <b>activities,</b> this study investigated the relationships between climatic factors, <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and natural and measured runoff in the Weihe River drainage basin. The results show that the average annual natural runoff of the river during 1988 - 2008 decreased by 45 % from that during 1956 1987, of which 33. 0 %, 15. 9 % and 51. 1 % were contributed by precipitation, temperature and <b>human</b> <b>activities,</b> respectively. <b>Human</b> <b>activities</b> played a more important role in this change. Nevertheless, the climatic factors can explain about 80 % of deviation of measured runoff, which means the variation of measure runoff is highly consistent with climate change. The main {{reason for this is that}} the impact mechanisms of <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and climatic factors on local runoff are different. <b>Human</b> <b>activities,</b> mainly water diversion, change the runoff by consuming the annual water resource in quantity. Although this may represent 50 % or higher of the annual natural runoff, it can hardly change the long-term runoff trend, because water diversion itself is also partly controlled by climate. Climatic factors not only affect annual runoff quantity, but also control the long-term runoff variation, even if a large amount of natural runoff was consumed by humans. Therefore, the regression relationship between runoff and climatic factors can hardly be affected by <b>human</b> <b>activities.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R
