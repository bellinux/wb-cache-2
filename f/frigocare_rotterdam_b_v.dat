40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to to assess with {{accurate}} and objective methods the function and fixation of total knee prostheses with special emphasis on mobile bearing total knee designs. The mobile bearing of a rotating platform design showed limited motion or no motion during a step-up task thereby nullifying the theoretical advantages of a mobile bearing prosthesis. Apatite coated implants show excellent mid-term Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis (RSA) results and offer some clinical advantages above cemented total knee arthroplasty. A prospective RSA study also revealed that the studied mobile bearing design is more predictable and forgiving with respect to micromotion of the tibial component than a posterior stabilised prosthesis. However, mobile bearing prostheses showed to be more demanding for the soft tissue structures surrounding the knee joint. The techniques used in gait analysis and fluoroscopy are sensitive for measurement errors. This restricts the applicability and interpretation of the results acquired when using these methods. In general one needs {{to be aware of}} the limitations of measurement tools since one needs accurate and objective methods to assess evidence about the clinical performance of (new) total knee prostheses.

Part 1 addresses the influence of genetic variation in genes involved in the different processes {{that lead to the}} occurrence of adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention, mainly restenosis after bare metal stent placement, but also late acquired stent malapposition after implantation of a drug-eluting stent. Part 2 discusses the role of a relatively new area of research, which we refer to as 'epigenetic epidemiology', in restenosis and other aspects of coronary heart disease. In this part we show that polymorphisms in genes encoding lysine acetyltransferases, which are able to modify chromatin structure to allow gene transcription, can influence restenosis and mortality from coronary heart disease in several large prospective follow-up studies.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} different risk factors, {{in relation}} to restenosis after Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), with its main focus on genetic markers. Restenosis is {{the main drawback of}} PCI. Genetic variance poses an opportunity to enhance stratification of individuals who will be more prone to develop restenosis. Restenosis is a multifactorial process, therefore only limited part of the number of candidate genes that are potentially involved in restenosis can be described. Since the inflammatory reaction is known to be highly important in restenosis, our study has its main focus on inflammatory markers. To examine various candidate genes and their polymorphisms we made use of the GENetic DEterminants of Restenosis (GENDER) study, a multicenter follow-up study, including 3, 104 consecutive patients, who were successfully treated with PCI. In the different chapters we describe the study population and the clinical and genetic factors investigated. Furthermore, we made use of a mouse model to improve our understanding of restenosis. Our results have contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the restenotic process, they could provide novel therapeutic targets as well as contribute to development of improved risk stratification of patients who are scheduled for elective PCI, thereby creating the opportunity to individualize treatment in the future.

We performed cross sectional and intervention studies to investigate the contribution of obesity, dietary conditions, metabolic environment and exogenous disruptors (chemotherapy) to cardiovascular end-organ damage and the reversibility of this damage with a low caloric diet. The effects of interventions, dietary as well as non-dietary, were explored using imaging technology. As ethnicity is an important aspect of the pathophysiology in diabetes mellitus, we also examined the influence of ethnic factors on diabetes mellitus and its complications. The second part of this thesis focuses on safety, feasibility and implementation of innovative MR techniques at higher field strengths for assessment of cardiovascular disease. Promotores: J. W. A.

40|$|A {{frequent}} {{manifestation of}} Crohn's disease (CD) is {{the formation of}} perianal fistulas which can greatly affect patient’s quality of life due to continuous pain, abscess formation and malodourous discharge from the fistula causing skin irritation. Nowadays, {{a wide range of}} medical and surgical therapies for perianal fistulizing CD is available. However, achieving complete fistula healing is often a long process preceded by multiple relapses during the treatment. Currently, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have gained much interest as a potential therapeutic option for inflammatory disorders, including fistulizing CD, because they possess immunosuppressive and tissue regenerative properties. We performed a clinical trial evaluating MSCs as a treatment for perianal fistulas. Local administration of MSCs additional to a standardized surgical treatment was safe and feasible and resulted in a higher percentage of healed fistulas compared to placebo. In addition, several experimental studies were performed to unravel the mechanism of action of MSCs. The role of the time of MSC administration, disease severity, prestimulation of MSCs with inflammatory cytokines, migration of MSCs and the formation of spheroid-like structures are described in this thesis.

In patients with H. pylori-induced gastritis, significantly increased mucosal MMP- 9 levels were found. By successful H. pylori eradication, active and chronic inflammation decreased, accompanied by a significant decrease of mucosal MMP- 9. MMP- 2, MMP- 7, MMP- 8 and MMP- 9, lipocalin- 2, MMP- 9 /lipocalin- 2 and TIMP- 1 were significantly increased in tumour tissue of gastric cancer patients compared to normal gastric mucosa whereas only enhanced levels of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 /lipocalin- 2 complexes were independently related to worse prognosis. Subsequently the genotype distribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MMPs and TIMPs in gastric cancer was studied. The genotype distribution of MMP- 7 - 181 A>G was associated with H. pylori status and tumour-related survival of the patients. Single-nucleotide polymorphism TIMP- 2 - 303 C>T correlated significantly with tumour-related survival. First-order dendrogram cluster analysis combined with Cox analysis identified the MMP- 7 - 181 A>G and TIMP- 2 - 303 C>T polymorphism combination {{to have a major}} impact on patients survival outcome.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the electronic structure of the (111) surfaces of CoSi 2 and NiSi 2 and their interfaces with Si {{has been carried out}} with particular attention paid to the existence of localized states. A Green function method has been used within the empirical tight-binding approximation to calculate the bulk, surface and interface densities of states of these samples. The (111) surface electronic structures of bot the Si-terminated disilicides are qualitatively similar, each possessing a pair of localized states. One of these states is associated with the dangling bond at the surface (Si) layer and the other with that at the first subsurface (Co or Ni) layer. Formation of an interface with Si(111) gives rise to two localized resonance states below the Fermi level in both Si/CoSi 2 and Si/NiSi 2, even though their origins are quite different because of the different atomic geometries at the interfaces.

We sequenced the genome of <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> strains of 65 asymptomatic, recently infected Dutch blood donors, to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> strains, in the years 2003 – 2009. The sequences were compared to <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> sequences from Dutch patients with fifth disease, and to global <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> sequences as available from GenBank. All Dutch <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> strains belonged to genotype 1 a. Phylogenetic analysis of the strains from Dutch blood donors showed that two groups of genotype 1 a co-exist. A clear-cut division into the two groups was also found among the <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> strains from Dutch patients, and among the <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> sequences in GenBank. The two groups of genotype 1 a co-exist {{around the world and}} do not appear to differ in their ability to cause disease. Strikingly, the two groups of <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> predominantly differ in synonymous mutations, distributed throughout the entire genome of <b>B</b> 19 <b>V.</b> W...|$|R

40|$|Parvovirus B 19 (<b>B</b> 19 <b>V)</b> {{infection}} may differently {{manifest in}} various age groups. Erythema infectiosum ('fifth disease') {{is the most}} common <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> manifestations in children. Arthralgias and arthritis, with or without rash, are common manifestations of <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> infection in adults. Pruritus is usually present in adults and children. However, other cutaneous manifestations and atypical exanthems have been occasionally reported during <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> infection. To investigate the putative role of <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> infection in atypical exanthems, a total of 390 consecutive patients with atypical exanthems were analysed for <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> infection by determining <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> IgG and IgM antibodies titres in acute and convalescent phase as well as <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> DNA detection in serum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Atypical exanthems resulted related to <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> infection in 6 of the 120 pediatric (5 %) and 14 of the 270 adult patients (5. 2 %). In conclusion this study reveals that atypical exanthems related to <b>B</b> 19 <b>V</b> infection are possible both in children and in adults, with a similar prevalence...|$|R
