5|$|As {{he waited}} for the Emperor's {{confirmation}} of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son of the former conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> conductor. Subsequently, the two were rarely in agreement, but kept their divisions private.|$|E
5|$|King's College London {{was founded}} in 1828. The Strand Campus, based next to the church of St Mary-le-Strand, was {{designed}} by Robert Smirke and constructed in 1829–31. King's College Hospital opened as {{a branch of the}} college in 1840, and became a constituent part of the University of London in 1908. The current campus building was constructed in 1966. In 2015, the college acquired Strand House, Bush House and other buildings in the Aldwych Quarter. The Royal Courts of Justice, at the eastern end of the Strand, was designed in the mid-1860s by G.E. Street as a replacement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> courts at Westminster Hall, though construction was so delayed that he died shortly before Queen Victoria opened the courts in 1882. The West Green extension to the courts opened in 1911, while the Queen's Building opened in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that was basically a switch that shorted across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> model.|$|E

5|$|Fliegerführer Afrika {{received}} orders on 4 August 1941 {{to downsize}} the 7. Staffel in Africa to four aircraft. The remaining aircraft and aircrews were {{to relocate to}} France back to Jagdgeschwader 26. Before Müncheberg arrived in France, he stopped in Rome where he received the Gold Medal of Military Valour from Mussolini. He then travelled to the Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in Rastenburg, present-day Kętrzyn in Poland, for the Oak Leaves presentation. Following the presentation Müncheberg went on two weeks of vacation. Following their return from North Africa to France the pilots of 7. Staffel were given newer Bf109F-4 aircraft in replacement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Bf109E-7 type. Müncheberg claimed his first victory here on 28 August over a Spitfire and another one, his 50th overall, on 29 August. He claimed two Spitfires on 4 September and one more from No. 71 Squadron three days later.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 2005, Gilberto {{played in}} Brazil's 1–1 draw against Japan, in his only {{game of the}} 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. His absence as a first team regular could be {{explained}} by his lack of games, and thus match fitness, for Arsenal during the season leading up to the tournament. Gilberto's appearance in the tournament gained him a winners medal, as Brazil {{went on to win the}} competition. On the back of his good Champions League form, Gilberto was selected for the Brazil national football team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Gilberto was substituted on in two games, and started twice due to another injury to Emerson. Brazil were beaten 1–0 by France in the quarter final. Following Brazil's World Cup disappointment, midfielder Juninho called <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> members of the Brazil squad (including Gilberto) to retire from international football. On the back of Gilberto's childhood idol Dunga being appointed Brazil coach, Gilberto did not take Juninho's advice, and subsequently continued his international career.|$|E

40|$|Growing old is {{a natural}} and {{irreversible}} process {{which is part of}} everybody?s life. Human being is practically getting <b>old</b> from <b>the</b> birth and this process continuous the entire life. The stage of life where growing old is heading to, is called <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> Age. All stages of life are very important but the stage of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> age is <b>the</b> completion of life and also the last stage of life.

It is important to notice all the changes through life and prepare appropriately <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> age. Not to underestimate it, if we want to live high-quality life. Man should be preparing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> age alone all their life. In some aspects a social worker can even help thanks to their work experience in practical parts. The topic of the thesis is <b>the</b> preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> age from a social worker?s the point of view. The aim of the thesis is to map social workers opinions about preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> age. <b>The</b> strategy of a quantitative research which was used a questionnaire method by a technique of a half standard interview. <b>The</b> main question <b>for</b> this research focused on which factors are emphasized by social workers in preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> age. <b>The</b> questionnaire of the research was made into three main parts and focused on a question when social workers think is <b>the</b> perfect timing <b>for</b> preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> age.

25|$|Diamond {{has been}} imitated by {{artificial}} materials {{for hundreds of}} years; advances in technology have seen the development of increasingly better simulants with properties ever nearer those of diamond. Although most of these simulants were characteristic of a certain time period, their large production volumes ensured that all continue to be encountered with varying frequency in jewelry of the present. Nearly all were first conceived for intended use in high technology, such as active laser mediums, varistors, and bubble memory.

Between 1954 and 1957 a total of 66 diesel-electric locomotives were purchased, including 25 Fairbanks-Morse H-24-66 Train Masters, and 40 H-16-44 smaller road switchers, two with steam generators to haul passenger trains.

25|$|The mainshock was {{recorded}} by few seismometers in the region.

The amplitude of the waveforms shown on the 1948 seismograms were 20–30% larger than those of the later shock. Like the 1986 event, the 1948 event was presumed to have occurred near the northwest-striking (and steeply-dipping) Banning Fault, which was relatively unknown at the time.|$|E
