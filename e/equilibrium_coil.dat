40|$|As an {{integral}} {{effort in the}} Argonne Experimental Power Reactor design studies, a scoping-study was made on the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>coil</b> system. Various design options were investigated. The reference design is a superconducting equilibrium field coil system located outside the toroidal field coils for reasons of ease of coil assembly, disassembly, coil support, remote maintenance and the least interference with the assembly and disassembly of the first wall and the blanket and shield. It was also found {{that there is a}} large I$sup 2 $R loss if the coils were made of water-cooled copper. The superconducting <b>equilibrium</b> <b>coil</b> design was developed in considerable detail with the 60, 000 A ac superconducting low loss cable design, ac pulsing loss evaluation and the full stabilization examination. The proposed superconductor is NbTi with copper and cupro-nickel as two-component matrix. Finally, the equilibrium field requirements are also discussed. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Following {{development}} of a filament-stretching extensional rheometer at Monash University, similar rheometers have been designed and built in other laboratories. To help validate the basic technique, a collaborative program was undertaken to compare results from several instruments. First, three test fluids prepared at the University of California at Berkeley were characterized in steady and transient shear flows there and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ~M. I. T. !, and then tested in extensional rheometers at M. I. T., Monash and the University of Toronto. Each fluid is a constant-viscosity solution of narrow-molecular-weight-distribution polystyrene dissolved in oligomeric polystyrene. The solute molecular weights are 2. 0, 6. 5, and 20 million g/mol, and the polymer concentration in each fluid is 0. 05 wt. %. From linear viscoelastic measurements, the Zimm relaxation times of the fluids {{are found to be}} 3. 7, 31, and 150 s, respectively. The scaling of relaxation times with molecular weight indicates better-than-theta solvent quality, a finding consistent with independent intrinsic viscometry measurements of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>coil</b> size. Each fluid was tested in the three filament stretching rheometers at similar Deborah numbers. Despite variations in instrument design and the general difficulty of the technique, transient Trouton ratios measured in the three instruments are shown to agree quantitatively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Understanding the transport, orientation, and {{deformation}} ofbiological macromolecules by ¯ow {{is important}} in designing micro¯uidic devices. In this study, epi-¯uorescence microscopy was used to characterize the behavior ofmacromolecules in ¯ow in a micro¯uidic device, particularly how the ¯ow affects the conformation ofthe molecules. The micro¯uidic ¯ow path consists ofa large, inlet reservoir connected to a long, rectangular channel followed by a large downstream reservoir. The ¯ow contains both regions of high elongation (along the centerline as the ¯uid converges from the upstream reservoir into the channel) and shear (in the channel near the walls). Solutions of k-DNA labeled with a ¯uorescent probe were ®rst characterized rheologically to determine ¯uid relaxation times, then introduced into the micro¯uidic device. Images ofthe DNA conformation in the device were captured through an epi-¯uorescent microscope. The conformation of DNA molecules under ¯ow showed tremendous heterogeneity, as observed by Chu [7, 12] and co-workers in pure shear and pure elongational ¯ows. Histograms ofthe distribution ofconformations were measured along the channel centerline {{as a function of}} axial position and revealed dramatic stretching ofthe molecules due to the converging ¯ow followed by an eventual return to <b>equilibrium</b> <b>coil</b> size far downstream ofthe channel entry. The importance ofshear was probed via a series ofmeasurements near the channel centerline and near the channel wall. High shear rates near the channel wall also resulted in dramatic stretching ofthe molecules, and may result in chain scission ofthe macromolecules...|$|E

40|$|The coil-stretch {{transition}} in extensional flows of viscoelastic dilute polymer solutions {{is known to}} be associated with a strong hysteresis in molecular conformations and rheo-optical properties. At infinite dilution, hysteresis is caused by the large difference in frictional drag coefficient between undeformed isotropic polymer coils and highly stretched conformations. At the low extension rates in the hysteresis regime, stretched molecules pervade larger volumes than <b>equilibrium</b> <b>coils</b> since the flow is too weak to suppress transverse fluctuations. The onset of intermolecular overlap occurs for such stretched conformations at polymer concentrations much smaller than c*, the conventional critical overlap concentration for <b>equilibrium</b> <b>coils.</b> Therefore, for a range of concentrations c < c*, intramolecular hydrodynamic interactions may be significantly screened in stretched conformations. Scaling arguments based on "blob" concepts are used here to argue that the stretched state drag coefficient can grow strongly with concentration in the dilute regime. A dumbbell model with conformation-dependent drag model is used to predict a concomitant strong enhancement of coil-stretch hysteresis with increasing concentration in the dilute regime. This extensional flow induced self-concentration leads to a maximum in hysteretic effects around c*, which progressively diminish in the semi-dilute regime where screening in isotropic coils reduces the difference in drag coefficient between stretched and coiled states. It is shown that the concentration dependence observed by Clasen et al. (2006) of capillary-thinning dynamics in liquid bridges of polymer solutions provides direct evidence of coil-stretch hysteresis enhancement by self-concentration. Comment: 52 pages, 19 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{progress}} on the numerical computation of 2 D full-wave field solutions has motivated advances in the nonlinear theory of rf-induced plasma flows for the control of turbulence. Here, an accounting of how momentum is injected into the system by the antenna, {{and how it can}} be transferred from waves to plasma flows and to the <b>equilibrium</b> magnetic field <b>coils</b> and walls is given. Equations for both the plasma momentum and the wave momentum are developed. The former is a recapitulation of results from nonlinear flow drive theory. The latter equation yields a generalized form of the Maxwell stress tensor, including plasma dielectric effects. It is shown that momentum is conserved by the plasma-wave-antenna-wall system for poloidal and toroidal flux-surface-averaged flows. In general, however, momentum exchange with the <b>equilibrium</b> magnetic field <b>coils</b> is possible...|$|R
40|$|During 1998, the General Atomics (GA) ARIES-Spherical Torus (ST) team {{examined}} several {{critical issues}} related to the physics performance of the ARIES-ST design, and a number of suggestions were made concerning possible improvements in performance. These included specification of a reference plasma equilibrium, optimization about the reference equilibrium to achieve higher beta limits, examination of three possible schemes for plasma initiation, development of a detailed scenario for ramp-up of the plasma current and pressure to its full, final operating values, an assessment of the requirement for electron confinement, and several suggestions for divertor heat flux reduction. The reference equilibrium was generated using the TOQ code, with the specification of a 100 %, self-consistent bootstrap current. The equilibrium has {beta} = 51 %, 10 % below the stability limit (a margin specified by the ARIES-ST study). In addition, a series of intermediate equilibria were defined, corresponding to the ramp-up scenario discussed. A study of the influence of shaping on ARIES-ST performance indicates that significant improvement in both kink and ballooning stability can be obtained by modest changes in the squareness of the plasma. In test equilibria the ballooning beta limit is increased from 58 % to 67 %. Also the maximum allowable plasma-wall separation for kink stability can be increased by 30 %. Three schemes were examined for noninductive plasma initiation. These are helicity injection (HICD), electron cyclotron heating (ECH) -assisted startup, and inductive startup using only the external <b>equilibrium</b> <b>coils.</b> HICD startup experiments have been done on the HIT and CDX devices. ECH-assisted startup has been demonstrated on CDX-U and DIII-D. External coil initiation is based on calculations for a proposed DIII-D experiment.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{temporal}} distribution of dynamic processes in driven polymer transport inherent to flexible chains due to stochastic tension propagation. The stochasticity originates from the disordered initial configuration of an <b>equilibrium</b> polymer <b>coil,</b> {{which results in}} random paths for tension propagation. We consider the process time for when translocation occurs across a fixed pore and when stretching occurs by pulling the chain end. A scaling argument for the {{mean and standard deviation}} of the process time is provided using the two-phase picture for stochastic propagation. The two cases are found to differ remarkably. The process time distribution of the translocation exhibits substantial spreading even in the long-chain limit, unlike that found for the dynamics of polymer stretching. In addition, the process time distribution in the driven translocation is shown to have a characteristic asymmetric shape. Comment: 8 page, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports the}} {{solution}} conformation of a peptide (P 196 - 267) {{derived from the}} calmodulin-binding domain of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase. P 196 - 267 corresponding to the protein fragment situated between amino acid residues 196 - 267 was overproduced by a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. Its affinity for calmodulin is only one order of magnitude lower (Kd = 2. 4 nM) {{than that of the}} whole bacterial enzyme (Kd = 0. 2 nM). The proton resonances of the NMR spectra of P 196 - 267 were assigned using homonuclear two-dimensional techniques (double-quantum-filtered J-correlated spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy) and a standard assignment procedure. Analysis of the nuclear Overhauser effect connectivities and the secondary shift distribution of C alpha protons along the sequence allowed us to identify the elements of regular secondary structure. The peptide is flexible in solution, being in <b>equilibrium</b> between random <b>coil</b> and helical structures. Two segments of 11 amino acids (situated between V 215 and A 225) and 15 amino acids (situated between L 233 and A 247) populate in a significant proportion the helix conformational state. The two helices can be considerably stabilized in a mixed solvent, trifluoroethanol/water (30 / 70), suggesting that the corresponding fragment in the intact protein assumes a similar secondary conformation. No elements of tertiary structure organization were detected by the present experiments.

40|$|Thermally-induced protein {{unfolding}} {{is commonly}} described with the two-state model. This model assumes only {{two types of}} protein molecules in solution, the native (N) and the denatured, unfolded (U) protein. In reality, protein unfolding is a multistep process, even if intermediate states are only sparsely populated. As an alternative approach we explore the Zimm–Bragg theory, originally developed for the α-helix-to-random coil transition of synthetic polypeptides. The theory includes intermediate structures with concentrations determined by the cooperativity of the unfolding reaction. We illustrate {{the differences between the}} two-state model and the Zimm–Bragg theory with measurements of apolipoprotein A- 1 and lysozyme by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and CD spectroscopy. Nine further protein examples are taken from the literature. The Zimm–Bragg theory provides a perfect fit of the calorimetric unfolding transitions for all proteins investigated. In contrast, the transition curves and enthalpies predicted by the two-state model differ considerably from the experimental results. Apolipoprotein A- 1 is ~ 50 % α-helical at ambient temperature and its unfolding follows the classical α-helix-to-random <b>coil</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The unfolding of proteins with little α-helix content, such as lysozyme, can also be analyzed with the Zimm–Bragg theory by introducing the concept of ‘folded’ and ‘unfolded’ peptide units assuming an average unfolding enthalpy per peptide unit. DSC is the method of choice to measure the unfolding enthalpy,, but CD spectroscopy in combination with the two-state model is often used to deduce the unfolding enthalpy. This can lead to erroneous result. Not only are different enthalpies required to describe the CD and DSC transition curves but these values deviate distinctly from the experimental result. In contrast, the Zimm–Bragg theory predicts the DSC and CD unfolding transitions with the same set of parameters...|$|R

Neither human nor porcine galanin stimulated Ca 2 + mobilization in cultured human small cell lung carcinoma cells. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of human galanin showed that it was strictly monomeric in aqueous solution, indicating that the peptide interacts with its receptor(s) as a monomer. The monomeric nature of the peptide makes it especially suitable for structural studies using NMR. Nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments performed on galanin dissolved in aqueous solution (150 mM KCl, pH 4) at both 33 and 3 degrees C indicate that certain regions of the peptide are capable of adopting detectable levels of short-range structure in rapid <b>equilibrium</b> with random <b>coil.</b> At 33 degrees C, the short-range structures include a nascent helix spanning residues 3 - 11 which incorporates a hydrophobic core from residues 6 - 11. Residues 14 - 18 and 22 - 30 display sequential NH-NH and (CH) -H-beta-NH connectivities, indicating that these regions of the peptide adopt nonrandom conformations by significantly populating the ct-region of conformational space. However, no medium-range dipolar connectivities indicative of nascent helix or turn conformations were observed. At 3 degrees C, almost all residues significantly populate the cr-region of conformational space, and the nascent helix between residues 3 and 11, with its hydrophobic core, is retained. As expected, circular dichroism (CD) was insensitive to the presence of short-range structure, and therefore the CD spectrum of human galanin in aqueous solution indicated a completely random coil peptide.

40|$|During most of {{the twentieth}} century, direct study of {{individual}} polymer molecules was impossible due to their small size. Therefore, polymers were typically studied in bulk solutions, and their behavior and interactions had to be understood through average bulk property measurements. Because the scale of most industrial applications greatly exceeded the size of these molecules, this level of analysis was satisfactory. In the last twenty years, however, the appearance of microfluidic devices, whose smallest length scales are comparable {{to the size of}} a polymer molecule, has offered ways to visually study the behavior of individual polymer molecules and made possible new and exciting applications that exploit the precise control afforded by the small size of these devices. One such application is gene mapping, which extracts, at a. coarse level, the information embedded in the base pair sequence of genomic DNA. This technology relies on the ability to manipulate single DNA molecules in order to perform such tasks as separating DNA based on length and stretching DNA away from its entropically <b>coiled</b> <b>equilibrium</b> state. Recently, many novel methods have been proposed to accomplish these tasks using microfabricated devices, and munch experimental work has been focused on identifying and characterizing the underlying physics governing these devices. Current understanding, however, is greatly hampered by the fact that experiments can only provide limited information about the behavior of DNA molecules (e. g., they are unable to resolve details on small time and length scales). Therefore, simulations are an invaluable tool in the study of DNA behavior in microfiuidic devices by complementing and guiding experimental investigations. In this thesis, we present Brownian Dynamics simulations of the single molecule behavior of DNA in microfluidic devices related to gene mapping. In particular, we have considered the use of a post array to "precondition" the configuration of molecules for subsequent stretching in a contraction and compared our results to previous experiments. We found good qualitative agreement between experiments and simulations for DNA behavior in the post array, but our simulations consistently overpredicted the final stretch of molecules at the end of the contraction, which we attributed to nonlinear electrokinetic effects. We also investigate the electrophoretic collision of a DNA molecule with a. large, ideally conducting post. Field-induced compression was shown to play a critical role in the escape process of a molecule trapped on the post surface, and an extensive theoretical analysis is performed, describing both the local field-induced compression and the larger collision problem. Finally, we study the relaxation process of an initially stretched molecule in slit-like confinement. We present the first simulation results that exhibit two distinct relaxation times in the linear force regime, as previously reported in recent experiments. Our analysis is focused on the experimentally inaccessible dynamics in the transverse directions, particularly at short times and on small length scales. Comparisons to the predictions of a recent mechanistic model of confined relaxation were found to be satisfactory. by Daniel Warner Trahan. Thesis (Ph. D.)
