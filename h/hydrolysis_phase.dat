During the <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>phase</b> (Stage I), bio-polymers are degraded into monomers or oligomers which are fermented into volatile organic acids, alcohols, CO 2, and H 2 in the acidogenesis phase (Stage II).

25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{efficient}} hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates to soluble sugars for {{biofuel production}} necessitates the interplay and synergistic interaction of multiple enzymes. An optimized enzyme mixture {{is crucial for}} reduced cost of the enzymatic hydrolysis step in a bioethanol production process and its composition {{will depend on the}} substrate and type of pretreatment used. In the present study, an experimental design was used to determine the optimal composition of a Trichoderma reesei enzyme mixture, comprising the main cellulase and hemicellulase activities, for the hydrolysis of steam-exploded wheat straw. Methods Six enzymes, CBH 1 (Cel 7 a), CBH 2 (Cel 6 a), EG 1 (Cel 7 b), EG 2 (Cel 5 a), as well as the xyloglucanase Cel 74 a and the xylanase XYN 1 (Xyl 11 a) were purified from a T. reesei culture under lactose/xylose-induced conditions. Sugar release was followed in milliliter-scale hydrolysis assays for 48 hours and the influence of the mixture on initial conversion rates and final yields is assessed. Results The developed model could show that both responses were strongly correlated. Model predictions suggest that optimal hydrolysis yields can be obtained over a wide range of CBH 1 to CBH 2 ratios, but necessitates a high proportion of EG 1 (13 % to 25 %) which cannot be replaced by EG 2. Whereas 5 % to 10 % of the latter enzyme and a xylanase content above 6 % are required for highest yields, these enzymes are predicted to be less important in the initial stage of hydrolysis. Conclusions The developed model could reliably predict hydrolysis yields of enzyme mixtures in the studied domain and highlighted the importance of the respective enzyme components in both the initial and the final <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>phase</b> of steam-exploded wheat straw. </p...|$|E

Awareness of detoxification, {{nowadays}} {{known as}} biotransformation, {{has become an}} integral part of our daily lives. It is a modern buzz word that is used to promote anything from health food to enhancement of performance in sports. Another lesser known application for detoxification is as a therapy for alleviating symptoms of inborn errors of metabolism. Detoxification is the process where endogenous and xenobiotic metabolites are transformed to less harmful products, in the liver and kidneys, in two phases. Phase 1 detoxification includes oxidation, hydroxylation, dehydrogenation metabolic reduction and <b>hydrolysis.</b> <b>Phase</b> 2 detoxification uses conjugation reactions to increase hydrophillicty of metabolites for excretion in bile and urine. Glycine N-acyltransferse (GLYAT; EC 2. 3. 1. 13) is one of the amino acid conjugation enzymes. There are two variants of human GLYAT. I focused on the full-length mRNA human GLYAT isoform a, with a long term view of using it as a viable therapeutic enzyme for enhanced detoxification of harmful metabolites. I investigated if it is possible to clone and express a biologically active GLYAT. To achieve this goal I used three expression systems: traditional bacterial expression using the pET system; second generation cold shock bacterial expression using the pCOLDTF expression vector to improve solubility of the recombinant protein; and baculovirus expression in insect cells since therein some form of post translation glycosylation of the recombinant protein can occur which might improve solubility and ensure biological activity. The recombinant GLYAT expressed well in all three expression systems but was aggregated and no enzyme activity could be detected. A denature and renature system was also used to collect aggregated recombinant GLYAT and used to try to refold the recombinant protein in appropriate refolding buffers to improve solubility and obtain biological activity. The solubility of the recombinant GLYAT was improved but it remained biologically inactive. Master...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between meal {{structure and composition}} can modulate gastrointestinal processing and the resulting sense of satiety. This applies also to the fat component of meals and particularly to the surface area available for digestion. The main hypothesis underpinning this thesis work was that fat emulsion droplet size has {{a profound effect on}} fat digestion and, in turn, on the gastrointestinal and satiety responses. To test this hypothesis two fat emulsion meal systems were used. They had exactly the same composition but a small (termed the Fine emulsion, with a droplet size of 400 nm) or a large (termed the Coarse emulsion, with a droplet size of 8 μm) emulsified fat droplet size. The two fat emulsion systems were manufactured and characterised using a range of bench techniques, in vitro digestion models and MRI techniques in vitro. The difference in microstructure caused different temporal creaming characteristics for the emulsions and different percentage hydrolysis profiles in a gastric digestion model in vitro. The Fine emulsion showed initial rapid hydrolysis whilst the Coarse emulsion showed an initial slow <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>phase</b> with the hydrolysis rate increasing at later stages. This indicated that there was indeed a droplet size effect on fat hydrolysis whereby the smaller droplet size with a larger surface area hydrolysed faster than a larger droplet size. The emulsions’ performance was finally tested in vivo in healthy volunteers using MRI in a series of pilot studies leading to a main physiological study. Creaming differences in the gastric lumen were addressed by redesigning the meals using a locust bean gum (LBG) thickener that made them stable throughout the gastric emptying process. A main three-way physiological and satiety study in healthy volunteers showed that a highly emulsified, intragastrically stable emulsion delayed gastric emptying, increased small bowel water content and reduced consumption of food {{at the end of the}} study day. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging, relaxometry and spectroscopy were further evaluated to assess fat emulsion parameters in vitro and in vivo in the gastric lumen. Main static magnetic field and droplet size effects on T 2 relaxation times of the Fine and the Coarse emulsions were observed. There was reasonable correlation between m-DIXON and spectroscopy methods to quantify fat fraction both in vitro and in vivo. Differences in T 2 relaxation times for different droplet sizes of 20 % fat emulsions were detected in vitro. These changes were however difficult to separate from creaming effects in vivo with a view of drawing meaningful inferences on droplet sizes. The main conclusion from this work was that manipulating food microstructure especially intragastric stability and fat emulsion droplet size can influence human gastrointestinal physiology and satiety responses and that MRI and MRS provide unique non invasive insights into these processes. This improved knowledge could help designing foods with desired health-promoting characteristics which could help to fight the rising tide of obesity...|$|E

Thermal decomposition of the salts involves complex mechanisms such as dehydration, <b>hydrolysis,</b> evaporation, <b>phase</b> transitions that are possible {{to be accompanied by}} thermal analysis. Understanding the mechanisms involved and their temperatures are important to distinguish the structures of inorganic salts widely used as precursors of oxides and coordination compounds. Thermogravimetric curves indicate different thermal behavior, involving loss of initial mass (H 2 O, endothermic process) for both. Differences in thermal behavior are observed in relation to ligands chloride and nitrate, as they do not coordinate with the same type of interaction with the central atom (ion Fe 3 +) to form the crystalline structure. Thus implying, in characteristic temperatures of decomposition, the output of chloride (207 oC) and nitrate (149 oC), with respective process deshidroxilação at 437 oC and 166 oC. Analyzing images of scanning electron microscopy with chemical analysis of residues of TG, we found that the final product has the same morphology and composition, estimating as possible formation of Fe 2 O 3 in the form of hematite, due to not show magnetic property...|$|R
40|$|The {{contemporary}} flux of micrometeorites with sizes {{greater than}} 50 microns reaching the Earth's surface each year (about 20, 000 tons/a) {{is much greater}} than the value of approximately 100 tons/a reported for conventional meteorites up to masses of approximately 10, 000 tons. Moreover, on the average, Antarctic micrometeorites contain at least as much carbon as does Orgueil, the most C-rich meteorite. Micrometeorites are thus responsible for most of the carbon accreted by the Earth. In this paper we report SEM observations of a new C-rich 'dirty magnetite' phase observed as tiny inclusions in both melted and unmelted micrometeorites. This phase, which is enriched in C, O, P, S, Fe, frequently shows Ni contents in excess of 0. 2 percent, strongly suggestive of an 'extraterrestrial' origin. We also discovered this 'COPS' phase in the fusion crust of Murchison. It appears likely that COPS is a product of meteoroid reprocessing during frictional heating in the Earth's atmosphere and/or its fast 'weathering' in the upper atmosphere. Upon 'catalyzed' <b>hydrolysis</b> this <b>phase</b> might have facilitated the functioning of micrometeorites as 'micro-chondritic-reactors' for the synthesis of prebiotic molecules on the early Earth...|$|R
40|$|The {{nanocomposite}} – {{nanoporous silica}} (SBA- 16) containing ZnO quantum dots – was fabricated by the sublimation method. This novel route of synthesizing ZnO nanoparticles implies physical sorption of zinc acetylacetonate precursor into the matrix pores from the gaseous <b>phase,</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of the precursor, and thermal decomposition {{of the product}} with formation of ZnO nanoclusters directly inside the pores. The nanocomposite was characterized by XRD, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and photoluminescence spectroscopy methods. We observed the blue shift of the ultraviolet luminescence of nanocomposite {{as compared to the}} luminescence of ZnO nanopowder as well as the decrease of the linewidth of the ultraviolet luminescence line, which points to the encapsulation of ZnO nanoparticles in the silica pores and narrowing of their size distribution...|$|R
