5|$|By 221 Elagabalus' eccentricities, {{particularly}} {{his relationship with}} Hierocles, increasingly provoked the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard. When Elagabalus' grandmother Julia Maesa perceived that popular support for the emperor was waning, she decided that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> who had encouraged his religious practices, had to be replaced. As alternatives, {{she turned to her}} other daughter, Julia Avita Mamaea, and her daughter's son, the thirteen-year-old Severus Alexander.|$|E

Despite spending {{the rest of the}} summer with Crewe, the club decided not to offer Johnson a full-time contract, because coach Steve Holland felt he was not better than the club's other forwards.|$|E
5|$|It was {{probably}} Amenhotep I {{who founded the}} artisans village at Deir el-Medina, whose inhabitants were responsible {{for much of the}} art which filled the tombs in the Theban Necropolis for the following generations of New Kingdom rulers and nobles. The earliest name found there is that of Thutmose I, however Amenhotep was clearly an important figure to the city's workmen since <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> were both its patron deities.|$|E

5|$|Amenhotep I {{was the son}} of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. His elder brothers, {{the crown}} prince Ahmose Sapair and Ahmose-ankh, died before him, thus {{clearing}} the way for his ascension to the throne. Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young himself, and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, appears to have been regent for him for at least a short time. The evidence for this regency is that both <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir el-Medina. Amenhotep took his sister Ahmose-Meritamon as his Great Royal Wife. Another wife's name, Sitkamose, is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Fanta, he {{can recall}} his father, but {{chooses not to}} tell Fanta of their father to protect her. It is {{revealed}} that Fanta's memories were erased once she arrived in Avalon, but Oran ensured that she and Pain would not. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> do not get along and merely tolerate one another, though Oran admits to Fanta that she favors Pain over Fanta because her happiest memories in the human world were before Fanta was born, when Pain was growing up. While Pain strongly dislikes his mother-he refuses to call her 'mother', and it is he who gathered up evidence against Oran's crimes- he has some warm emotions towards her in truth. When Sangjae asks Pain to permit killing of Oran to save the faery world, Pain refuses.|$|E

Sadly for Sundjata, this did not occur before his father died. Despite the faama of Niani's wishes to respect the prophecy and put Sundiata on the throne, the son from his first wife Sassouma Bérété was crowned instead. As soon as Sassouma's son Dankaran Touman took the throne, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> forced the increasingly popular Sundjata into exile along with his mother and two sisters. Before Dankaran Touman and his mother could enjoy their unimpeded power, King Soumaoro set his sights on Niani forcing Dankaran to flee to Kissidougou.|$|E
