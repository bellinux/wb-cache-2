2500|$|However, Darwin {{appears to}} have had doubts as a month later {{in a letter to}} the French {{zoologist}} Armand de Quatrefages he wrote: [...] "I wish the translator had known more of Natural History; she must be a clever, but singular lady; but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> her, till she proposed to translate my book." [...] He was unhappy with Royer's footnotes and {{in a letter to the}} botanist Joseph Hooker he wrote: [...] "Almost everywhere in Origin, when I express great doubt, she appends a note explaining the difficulty or saying that there is none whatever!! It is really curious to know what conceited people there are in the world,..." ...|$|E
2500|$|After McQueary was {{identified}} as the graduate assistant who reported the 2002 incident, he was criticized for not intervening to protect the boy from Sandusky (an accusation McQueary has since disputed), {{as well as for}} not reporting the incident to police himself. On November 7, Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said that though some may have fulfilled their legal obligation to report suspected abuse, [...] "somebody has to question about what I would consider the moral requirements for a human being that knows of sexual things that are taking place with a child." [...] Noonan added that anyone who knows about suspected abuse, [...] "whether you're a football coach or a university president or the guy sweeping the building," [...] has [...] "a moral responsibility to call us." [...] Paterno said McQueary informed him that [...] "he had witnessed an incident in the shower ... but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the Grand Jury report." [...] Paterno was uncertain if being more graphic would have made a difference. [...] "And to be frank with you I don't know that it would have done any good, because <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of,</b> of, rape and a man," [...] said Paterno.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the time}} that she was hired as Carte's secretary, Helen was {{intensely}} involved in his business affairs and had a grasp of detail and organisational and diplomacy skills that surpassed even Carte's. She became the business manager of the company and was also responsible for the Savoy Hotel, into which she introduced the new hydraulic passenger lifts. [...] One of Helen's early tasks was to produce the British copyright performance of The Pirates of Penzance in Paignton. [...] She made fifteen visits to America to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] She also assisted in arranging American lecture tours for Oscar Wilde, Matthew Arnold and others. [...] Helen, more than anyone else, was able to smooth out the differences between W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, in the 1880s, to ensure that the two produced more operas together. [...] She also tactfully and sympathetically dealt with the personal and professional problems of the actors in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company casts. [...] The editor of The Era wrote in her obituary, [...] "She never took advantage of anybody; but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> her letting anybody take advantage of her." ...|$|E
