Marshall uses Barney's teacup pig (in a cute blanket) to train Lily to resist Scooter. Eventually, it works, and the two head down to the cafeteria, but even though Lily is able to tell Scooter it will never happen, Marshall himself can't resist Scooter's charm, telling him to wait until Marshall is dead.|$|E

She <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be friends with her {{assistant}}." [...] A former assistant said, [...] "You definitely did not ride the elevator with her." [...] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she [...] "did absolutely the right thing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Three Words" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, calling it [...] "extremely well-performed by all concerned." [...] Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode {{was similar to the}} earlier [...] "Per Manum" [...] and was somewhat formulaic; however, they noted that this was a necessary and positive step towards redefining the series after the changes made in its last two seasons explaining [...] "the point of all this is only to emphasise how different The X-Files universe now feels, the familiarity of the ingredients only making us more aware that the mix <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be the same again". Writing for Television Without Pity, Jessica Morgan rated the episode a [...] "B", although she felt that by this stage the series' mythology was moving [...] "in concentric circles of pain and confusion".|$|E
500|$|... "Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] {{was written}} by Mexican {{songwriter}} Roberto Belester for Bronco's album Salvaje y Tierno (1991). Belester composed songs for several well-known Mexican bands such as Los Yonic's and Los Bukis. The song tells of a protagonist who is leaving his lover and tells her that he <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to forget her. In 1993, Mexican singer-songwriter Cristian Castro covered the song on his second studio album, Un Segundo en el Tiempo, which was produced by Alex Zepeda and released as the lead single from the album. According to Castro, he bought Salvaje y Tierno after hearing [...] "Que No Quede Huella" [...] {{on the radio and}} wanted to cover [...] "Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] when he listened to it on the CD. [...] The music video for Castro's cover was produced by Jorge Guerrero Fox Garza and filmed in Cuernavaca which features shots of Castro alone in an old country house near the fireplace and outside on the field remembering a woman he loved.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] is a {{complimentary}} love song that contains [...] "curse" [...] words and a repetitive chorus. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{wrote that the}} song has a simple message evident in the lyrics, [...] "At {{the end of the}} day you are who you are and I love you that way." [...] Maz Halima of Flavour Magazine described the track as a [...] "serene song". [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] contains the line [...] "And you my lover / But I love you like a brother" [...] which, according to Popdust's Exton, is reminiscent of actress Angelina Jolie and her brother James Haven at the Oscars. Exton further explained that the song is full with vague descriptions of Rihanna's feelings, which result as [...] "hollow" [...] declaration that she <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> away. While singing the lines [...] "Middle of the Day / Give Me What I want / It feels so special / It feels so good" [...] she admits [...] "liking afternoon delights".|$|E
500|$|... "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] is a comical Halloween episode {{which was}} filmed in Auckland, New Zealand. [...] After {{shooting}} for two days, director T.J. Scott went to producer Robert Tapert and asked permission {{to alter the}} episode's artistic style to stylised rock video horror. [...] Scott said, [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay guys, here we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and cranked up the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two takes that were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and we did a third take where Lucy really let loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to make it to the screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!" [...] Ultimately, Scott felt that [...] "if you pull it too far out of context and try to take it seriously, it's a bit too rock video at times." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first quatrain of the sonnet {{lets the}} reader know the poet has been [...] "infected", in a sense, by his mistress. Though {{the idea of}} being [...] "love-sick" [...] has been often {{idealized}} and romanticized in modern culture, the way the poet describes his lustfulness and want leads to a more dark reading, almost as if he is a host to some sort of sickly desired parasite feeding on his sense and reason. The poet begins the sonnet by linking and treating love and disease as parallel and intricately linked concepts. The poet's mistress has planted a sickly fever within the poet, being a type of bodily love and desire, which is causing an illness within him. His love/lust and wantonness is weakening him to the point where his lust has perhaps taken on its own sort of force and being, much as a fever does, and is now occupying a space in his body. There also appears a never ending cycle, within the first two lines. Carl Atkins points out that , [...] "In this author longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease' is not idle wordplay, but suggests the patient's sense that this condition <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to end". It is also {{important to note that the}} idea that the poet would [...] "feed" [...] his fever would have been quite contrary in Elizabethan England, as the going knowledge at the time was to never feed a fever, based on the Four Humours medical belief. The common idiom and medical belief of the times was to [...] "feed a cold, starve a fever".|$|E

2500|$|Puciato later {{commented on}} the act saying; “It was {{early in the day}} and as most people, you kind of get that out of the way early in the day but I never did. I made a point to hold onto it. And you know the turtle, the {{malicious}} turtle, was pretty easy to fire that fucker right out of the hole. There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like.

[...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E
60|$|There is no use pretending about it. It {{may sound}} an awful thing to say, {{but the women}} are going to be married. That is, and always has been, their career; and, what is more, they know it; and even at college, while they are {{studying}} algebra and political economy, they have their eye on it sideways all the time. The plain fact is that, after a girl has spent four years of her time {{and a great deal of}} her parents' money in equipping herself for a career that she <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to have, the wretched creature goes and gets married, and in a few years she has forgotten which is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, and she doesn't care.

But the point is this: Does the higher education that fits a man to be a lawyer also fit a person to be a wife and mother? Or, in other words, is a lawyer a wife and mother? I say he is not. Granted that a girl is to spend four years in time and four thousand dollars in money in going to college, why train her for a career that she <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to adopt?
