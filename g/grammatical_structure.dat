5|$|The chief {{device of}} ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, {{including}} {{many of the}} psalms, was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in <b>grammatical</b> <b>structure,</b> sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to {{the point that they}} could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a rhythm. In Chinese poetry, tones as well as stresses create rhythm. Classical Chinese poetics identifies four tones: the level tone, rising tone, departing tone, and entering tone.|$|E
5|$|Although writing first {{appeared}} during the very late 4th millennium BC, it was only used to convey short names and labels; connected strings of text did not appear until about 2600 BC, {{at the beginning of}} the Old Kingdom. This development marked the beginning of the first known phase of the Egyptian language: Old Egyptian. Old Egyptian remained a spoken language until about 2100 BC, when, during the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, it evolved into Middle Egyptian. While Middle Egyptian was closely related to Old Egyptian, Late Egyptian was significantly different in <b>grammatical</b> <b>structure.</b> Late Egyptian possibly appeared as a vernacular language as early as 1600 BC, but was not used as a written language until c. 1300 BC during the Amarna Period of the New Kingdom. Late Egyptian evolved into Demotic by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a spoken language until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by Coptic beginning in the 1st century AD.|$|E
5|$|As a part {{of their}} missionary efforts, members of various {{religious}} orders (principally Franciscan and Dominican friars and Jesuits) introduced the Latin alphabet to the Nahuas. Within the first twenty years after the Spanish arrival, texts were being prepared in the Nahuatl language written in Latin characters. Simultaneously, schools were founded, such as the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco in 1536, which taught both indigenous and classical European languages to both Native Americans and priests. Missionary grammarians undertook the writing of grammars, also called artes, of indigenous languages for use by priests. The first Nahuatl grammar, written by Andrés de Olmos, was published in 1547—three years before the first French grammar. By 1645 four more had been published, authored respectively by Alonso de Molina (1571), Antonio del Rincón (1595), Diego de Galdo Guzmán (1642), and Horacio Carochi (1645). Carochi's is today considered the most important of the colonial era grammars of Nahuatl. Carochi has been particularly important for scholars working in the New Philology, such that there is a 2001 English translation of Carochi's 1645 grammar by James Lockhart. Through contact with Spanish the Nahuatl language adopted many loan words, and as bilingualism intensified, even began changing the <b>grammatical</b> <b>structure</b> under influence by Spanish.|$|E

40|$|Teaching grammar {{has been}} a complex issue for centuries. The {{effectiveness}} of deductive and inductive approaches, aiming at maximizing the students' opportunity to practice thinking skills, has been investigated in empirical studies. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate whether various rule explication techniques should precede or follow a focus on the use of grammatical forms. The researcher framed this study around the following research questions: 1) Which instructional approach, deductive or guided inductive, will be more effective for EFL learners’ on short-term learning of <b>grammatical</b> <b>structures?</b> 2) Which instructional approach, deductive or guided inductive, will be more effective for EFL learners’ on long-term learning of <b>grammatical</b> <b>structures?</b> In order to investigate the afore-mentioned questions, the sample populations were 40 students. The grammar pretest was administered to participants at the beginning of the semester, prior to the treatment phase, in order to assess the comparability of grammar knowledge between the six sections. The grammar posttest was identical to the grammar pretest. At the end of the semester, 6 weeks after the pretest, the grammar posttest was administered to the participants to measure the long-term learning of the <b>grammatical</b> <b>structures</b> as well as the effectiveness of each presentational approach. To analyze the obtained data, a t-test computation was applied, in which the scores obtained for multiple-choice questions were the dependent measure, the data showed that: 1. deductive approach is more effective for EFL learners’ on short-term learning of <b>grammatical</b> <b>structures.</b> 2. deductive and guided inductive approach are similar for EFL learners’ on long-term learning of <b>grammatical</b> <b>structures.</b> 3. deductive and guided inductive approach are similar for EFL learners’ on short-term learning of <b>grammatical</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{in this paper}} so called simple bracketed languages having special limita-tions. They are sometimes used for the definitions of some <b>grammatical</b> <b>structures</b> of programming languages. Generally speaking, these languages are context-free, but not deterministic context-free, i. e., they cannot be defined by deterministic push-down automata. For the simple bracketed languages having special limitations, the equivalence problem is decidable. We obtain the sufficient conditions for the representation some language by special sequences of simple bracketed languages. We also consider the examples of <b>grammatical</b> <b>structures</b> as the simple bracketed languages. Therefore, we can decide equivalence problem for some <b>grammatical</b> <b>structures</b> of programming languages, and such structures define neither regular, nor deterministic context-free languages. Key words: context-free languages, bracket languages, equivalence problem. 1...|$|R

25|$|The change-of-state {{property}} of Verb Phrases (VP) {{is a significant}} observation for the syntax of lexical semantics because it provides evidence that subunits are embedded in the VP structure, and that {{the meaning of the}} entire VP is influenced by this internal <b>grammatical</b> <b>structure.</b> (For example, the VP the vase broke carries a change-of-state meaning of the vase becoming broken, and thus has a silent BECOME subunit within its underlying structure.)

25|$|Evidence from {{a series}} of four {{experiments}} conducted by Gomez and Gerken suggests that children are able to generalize grammatical structures with less than two minutes of exposure to an artificial grammar. In the first experiment, 11-12 month-old infants were trained on an artificial grammar composed of nonsense words with a set <b>grammatical</b> <b>structure.</b> At test, infants heard both novel grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Infants oriented longer towards the grammatical sentences, in line with previous research that suggests that infants generally orient for a longer amount of time to natural instances of language rather than altered instances of language e.g.,. (This familiarity preference differs from the novelty preference generally found in word-learning studies, due to the differences between lexical acquisition and syntactical acquisition.) This finding indicates that young children are sensitive to the <b>grammatical</b> <b>structure</b> of language even after minimal exposure. Gomez and Gerken also found that this sensitivity is evident when ungrammatical transitions are located {{in the middle of the}} sentence (unlike in the first experiment, in which all the errors occurred at the beginning and end of the sentences), that the results could not be due to an innate preference for the grammatical sentences caused by something other than grammar, and that children are able to generalize the grammatical rules to new vocabulary.|$|E
25|$|The {{high point}} of Arabic word use in Spanish was in late medieval times and has {{declined}} since then, but hundreds are still used in normal conversation.

There are also one preposition: hasta ("until"), and one adverb he. There has been little influence on the basic <b>grammatical</b> <b>structure</b> of the language.|$|E

This PLD is the input, or stimuli, from the environment, necessary for the development of an individual's grammar – language – via input into UG. This limited environmental stimulus is referred to as poverty of the stimulus. Specifically, the stimuli to which children are exposed during the critical period do not encompass every lawful example of <b>grammatical</b> <b>structure</b> relevant to the particular language.|$|E

500|$|Yet another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances.

25|$|In {{the most}} basic systems, one {{character}} is converted at a time. This makes a very time consuming input process.

In addition, since the input method only supports one character at a time, it likely requires the user to type out the full pinyin spelling to narrow down the selection. This system still exists in embedded applications such as cell phones.|$|E
25|$|Friedrich Delitzsch {{published}} a learned Sumerian dictionary and grammar {{in the form}} of his Sumerisches Glossar and Grundzüge der sumerischen Grammatik, both appearing in 1914. Delitzsch's student, Arno Poebel, {{published a}} grammar with the same title, Grundzüge der sumerischen Grammatik, in 1923, and for 50 years it would be the standard for students studying Sumerian. Poebel's grammar was finally superseded in 1984 on the publication of The Sumerian Language, An Introduction to its History and <b>Grammatical</b> <b>Structure,</b> by Marie-Louise Thomsen. While much of Thomsen's understanding of Sumerian grammar would now be rejected by most or all Sumerologists, Thomsen's grammar (often with express mention of the critiques put forward by Pascal Attinger in his 1993 Eléments de linguistique sumérienne: La construction de du11/e/di «dire») is the starting point of most recent academic discussions of Sumerian grammar.|$|E
25|$|A related finding {{indicates}} that slightly older infants can acquire both lexical and grammatical regularities {{from a single}} set of input, suggesting {{that they are able}} to use outputs of one type of statistical learning (cues that lead to the discovery of word boundaries) as input to a second type (cues that lead to the discovery of syntactical regularities. At test, 12-month-olds preferred to listen to sentences that had the same <b>grammatical</b> <b>structure</b> as the artificial language they had been tested on rather than sentences that had a different (ungrammatical) structure. Because learning grammatical regularities requires infants to be able to determine boundaries between individual words, this {{indicates that}} infants who are still quite young are able to acquire multiple levels of language knowledge (both lexical and syntactical) simultaneously, indicating that statistical learning is a powerful mechanism at play in language learning.|$|E
