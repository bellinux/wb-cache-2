In addition, the first results identified with the aid of these methods are also shown here. Furthermore, the aim of this sub-project throughout the course of the project will be to develop new technological approaches via the synthesis of different technologies.

Hence discrete event simulation is used to estimate the expected value of the production rate. Then simulation model coupled with genetic algorithms is used to find optimal buffer configuration for maximum production rate.

Motivated by the study of viruses, this thesis consists of the development of a model of a virus capsid for educational and illustrative purposes. This thesis begins with a study of the virus and its capsid structure. It studies the icosahedral structure and the theory of quasi-equivalence, which were favored by viruses throughout their evolution. We then look into the manufacturing of the model capsid which was composed of three major components; developing the protein subunits that create the capsid, giving the subunits an appropriate mating angle, and joining the subunits to form the virus model. The subunits were created by two different approaches, through the use delrin, and through injection molding. The angling of the subunits was approached through a fixture designed for this application and a wedge. Finally, the <b>joining</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> was achieved by using glue. The results had limited success, but it served as an initial prototype and a learning process and established some bases and groundwork for further developments. by Luis F. Morales. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Full text: With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the aerospace industry, manufacturing technologies have to continuously develop and adjust themselves to ever-growing demands coming from more complex component designs {{and the use of}} highly engineered materials. Today there is an increased number of manufacturers contributing to the realization of final products, i. e. avionics, so it is easy to perceive the truly globalized dimension of the aerospace manufacturing business. With this comes the demand for further engineering developments on which the academic/industrial research institutes need to deliver solutions to real aerospace manufacturing problems. This is a challenging task since aerospace manufacturing technologies have to cover a wide range of materials (from composites to advanced Ni/Ti alloys), processes (from forging to non-traditional machining and assembly), and parts’ dimensions/batch sizes (from airframes to turbine blades). In this wide context, this Special Issue includes high quality theoretical and experimental scientific contributions on the following topics related to the aerospace manufacturing technology: (a) machining of advance aerospace alloys; (b) abrasive processes applied to aerospace components; (c) surface treatments to enhance fatigue performance of aerospace components; (d) <b>joining</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> of aerospace components; (e) laser machining of aerospace alloys; (f) automated/supervised manufacture of aerospace components; (g) quality supervision of aerospace manufacturing routes.

We hope that this issue will act as a catalyst for the development of further research, academic and industrial interactions, and publications related to aerospace manufacturing technologies {{for the benefit of the}} academic and industrial research communities...|$|E

40|$|Dimensional {{variation}} {{is one of}} the most critical issues in the design of assembled products.

This paper discusses the effect of geometric covariance in the calculation of assembly variation of compliant parts. A new method is proposed for predicting compliant assembly variation using the component geometric covariance. It combines the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and finite element analysis in estimating the effect of part/component variation on assembly variation. PCA is used to extract deformation patterns from production data, decomposing the component covariance into the individual contributions of these deformation patterns. Finite element analysis is used to determine the effect of each deformation pattern over the assembly variation. The proposed methodology can significantly reduce the computational effort required in variation analysis of compliant assemblies. A case study is presented to illustrate the methodology...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{flexible}} production systems for laser joining of micro parts require high dynamics and precision, {{as well as}} increased flexibility regarding the working space. The combination of miniaturized scanner-based laser <b>joining</b> systems <b>and</b> high-performance <b>assembly</b> systems is a new approach for a high accuracy compact micro assembly system with an increased flexibility. Using highly dynamic oscillation techniques leads to a stabilization of the welding process of difficult-to-weld materials, e. g. of zinc-containing alloys on the one hand, and to an increased process velocity and reduction of the joining geometry, e. g. for the welding of plastic materials on the other. Hence, a miniaturized laser processing optics is being developed featuring an integrated beam deflection for laser beam micro welding of metal as well as plastic materials. The requirements on this laser processing optics, {{the choice of a}} suitable beam deflection system and the design and simulation of the miniaturized optics are presented and discussed.

40|$|Machining of Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC), {{particularly}} drilling {{is frequently}} employed in many industries especially {{when dealing with}} <b>joining,</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>and</b> structural repair of the parts. This paper summarizes {{the properties of the}} CFC as well as the appropriate material and geometry of the cutting tool that should be used when drilling of the CFC in order to optimize the drilling performance. In addition, this work also presents the literature review on the relationship between cutting speed, feed rate, tool wear, thrust force and damage of the drilled CFC. The nature and heterogeneous structure of CFC often resulted in difficulty during their machining in terms of rapid tool wear and high thrust force. As a result, this always results in the damage of the drilled parts. Furthermore, higher cutting speed and lower feed rate are also recognized as significant factors which contribute to rapid wear of the cutting tool. Therefore, the use of tungsten carbide cutting tools, cutting fluids and cryogenic machining is seen to be a practical technique in optimizing the drilling performance involving CFC. In general, this work intends to provide a basic guideline and understanding regarding drilling of the CFC. ...|$|R

The construction of a large structure is long and expensive due to the number of processes and resources required, the complexity of the processes and the dependencies between tasks. Two methods have been identified for increasing construction efficiency: Design for <b>Assembly</b> (DFA) <b>and</b> schedule optimization. To improve assembly efficiency of smaller products, DFA methodologies have been widely developed and applied. The basis of these methods is {{to reduce the number of}} parts in the <b>assembly</b> <b>and</b> to provide a quantitative measure of the assembly efficiency. To achieve similar advantages to those DFA has provided for smaller assemblies, design for large assembly guidelines have been developed. The guidelines are the result of identifying relevant paradigms and the considerations which affect assembly efficiency. The paradigms which have been identified are concurrent engineering, simplicity and modularity. The considerations which must be addressed to improve assembly are <b>joining,</b> handling, 'positioning <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> planning. To aid designers, the paradigms and considerations have been formulated as guidelines and organized to correspond with the design process. Resource constrained project scheduling is an active area of research focused on reducing project duration and cost.

A new algorithm for resource constrained schedule project optimization has been developed which combines genetic algorithms and constraint satisfaction.
