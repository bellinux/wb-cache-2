The tornado affected the cities of Daulatpur and Saturia the most, moving east through Daulatpur and eventually northeast and into Saturia. Previously, the area that the tornado hit had been in a state of drought for six months, possibly generating tornadic conditions.|$|E

50|$|At Augsburg in 1573, a German {{military}} engineer by {{the name}} of Samuel Zimmermann invented an extremely effective mine known as the Fladdermine. It consisted of a fougasse (or later, sometimes a shell fougasse, that is, a fougasse loaded not with stones but with early black powder mortar shells, similar to large black powder hand grenades) activated by a snaphance or flintlock mechanism connected to a tripwire on the surface. Combining the effects of a tripwire activated bounding fragmentation mine with a cluster bomb, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>devastating</b> to massed attackers but required high maintenance due to the susceptibility of black powder to dampness. Consequently, it was mainly employed in the defenses of major fortifications, in which role it continued to be used until the 1870s.|$|E

5000|$|Particular {{criticism}} {{has been directed}} at the film's accuracy in portraying President Ronald Reagan. While Alan Rickman's performance generated positive reviews, the director and screenwriters of the film {{have been criticized for}} depicting Reagan as indifferent to civil rights and his reluctance to associate with the White House's black employees during his presidency. According to Michael Reagan, the former president's son, [...] "The real story of the White House butler doesn't imply racism at all. It's simply Hollywood liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there." [...] Paul Kengor, one of President Reagan's biographers, also attacked the film, saying, [...] "I've talked to many White House staff, cooks, housekeepers, doctors, and Secret Service over the years. They are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan." [...] In regard to the president's initial opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa, Kengor said, “Ronald Reagan was appalled by apartheid, but also wanted to ensure that if the apartheid regime collapsed in South Africa that it wasn't replaced by a Marxist-totalitarian regime allied with Moscow and Cuba that would take the South African people down the same road as Ethiopia, Mozambique, and, yes, Cuba. In the immediate years before Reagan became president, 11 countries from the Third World, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, went Communist. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>devastating.</b> If the film refuses to deal with this issue with the necessary balance, it shouldn't deal with it at all." ...|$|E

The concrete manifestations of the misfortunes that have befallen pastoralists include massive displacements, removal of large tracts of prime grazing land for irrigation, game reserves, large closure for conservation projects and hosting new resettlement programmes (Getachew 2004; Yohannes 2003; Ayalew 2001).|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} {{and meaning of}} tooth loss and replacement has varied historically and culturally but has received relatively little attention from social scientists. Our study set out to understand these experiences {{in the context of}} the arrival of newer, dental implant treatments. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were carried out with 39 men and women who had experienced tooth loss and replacement. A thematic analysis was sensitised by previous sociological work on chronic illness, particularly Bury's notion of biographical disruption. We found that while for some individuals the loss of a tooth was relatively insignificant, for others <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>devastating</b> and disruptive. In seeking to understand this difference, the concept of biographical disruption was a helpful analytical tool. Our analysis identified two forms of disruption. The first related to the meanings of tooth loss (the neglected mouth) and denture wearing (a marker of old age). The second, embodied, disruption concerned the relationship between the self and mouth in those wearing dentures (the invaded, unreliable mouth) and could occur even where tooth loss and denture wearing had been biographically anticipated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background An {{earthquake}} measuring 6. 3 on the Richter scale {{struck the}} city of Bam in Iran on the 26 th of December 2003 at 5. 26 A. M. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>devastating,</b> and left over 40, 000 dead and around 30, 000 injured. The profound tragedy of thousands killed has caused emotional and psychological trauma {{for tens of thousands}} of people who have survived. A study was carried out to assess psychological distress among Bam earthquake survivors and factors associated with severe mental health in those who survived the tragedy. Methods This was a population-based study measuring psychological distress among the survivors of Bam earthquake in Iran. Using a multi-stage stratified sampling method a random sample of individuals aged 15 years and over living in Bam were interviewed. Psychological distress was measured using the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12). Results In all 916 survivors were interviewed. The mean age of the respondents was 32. 9 years (SD = 12. 4), mostly were males (53 %), married (66 %) and had secondary school education (50 %). Forty-one percent reported they lost 3 to 5 members of their family in the earthquake. In addition the findings showed that 58 % of the respondents suffered from severe mental health as measured by the GHQ- 12 and this was three times higher than reported psychological distress among the general population. There were significant differences between sub-groups of the study sample with regard to their psychological distress. The results of the logistic regression analysis also indicated that female gender; lower education, unemployment, and loss of family members were associated with severe psychological distress among earthquake victims. Conclusion The study findings indicated that the amount of psychological distress among earthquake survivors was high and there is an urgent need to deliver mental health care to disaster victims in local medical settings and to reduce negative health impacts of the earthquake adequate psychological counseling is needed for those who survived the tragedy. </p...|$|E
