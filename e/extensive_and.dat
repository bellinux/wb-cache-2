5|$|The Mysida {{belong to}} the {{superorder}} Peracarida, which means “near to shrimps”. Although in many respects mysids appear similar to some shrimps, the main characteristic separating them from the superorder Eucarida is their lack of free-swimming larvae. The order Mysida is <b>extensive</b> <b>and</b> currently includes approximately 160 genera, containing more than 1000 species.|$|E
5|$|The Pitfour Estate beside Mintlaw in the Buchan area of {{north-east}} Scotland {{became one}} of the country's most <b>extensive</b> <b>and</b> lavish estates during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Pitfour estate is shown on old maps as Petfouir or Petfour.|$|E
5|$|The grape {{originated}} in France, {{in the regions}} of Bordeaux and the Loire Valley.

5|$|As with written records, {{the archaeological}} {{evidence}} for this period is not <b>extensive,</b> <b>and</b> knowledge of {{the daily lives of}} the population is lacking. It is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly owing to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis, Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E

5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{associated}} convective activity was east {{of the center of}} circulation, Louisiana and Mississippi received minimal damage. However, on Dauphin Island, Alabama, the storm caused coastal flooding which closed roads and forced the evacuation of residents. Florida received high wind gusts, heavy rainfall, and strong surf that resulted in the deaths of three swimmers. 20,000homes in the state lost electricity. The heavy rainfall progressed into Georgia, where significant flooding occurred. Crop damage was <b>extensive,</b> <b>and</b> about 335 structures were damaged by the flooding. The storm caused a total of about $20million (2002USD; $23.96million 2008USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|Before {{independence}} of India, monsoon or groundwater {{were the main}} sources of irrigation. The main source of water now is Balsamand branch of Western Yamuna Canal. Municipal Corporation of Hisar supplies potable water to the city. The city first got electricity in 1936. Power is distributed by Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) provides landline and broadband services. Cell phone coverage is <b>extensive,</b> <b>and</b> the main service providers are Vodafone Essar, Airtel, MTNL, Reliance Communications, Idea Cellular and Tata Indicom.

5|$|Chinese media {{coverage}} of the Ürümqi riots was <b>extensive,</b> <b>and</b> was compared favourably to that of the unrest in Tibet in 2008. When the riots began, communications were immediately cut off. In the weeks that followed, official sources reported that over 1,000 Uyghurs were arrested and detained; Uyghur-run mosques were temporarily closed. The communication limitations and armed police presence remained in place as of January 2010. By November2009, over 400 individuals faced criminal charges for their actions during the riots. Nine were executed in November 2009, and by February 2010, at least 26 had received death sentences.|$|E

5|$|During Roman times, {{the land}} {{surrounding}} the rivers Ouse and Foss was marshy, making the site easy to defend. The city {{is prone to}} flooding from the River Ouse, and has an <b>extensive</b> (<b>and</b> until 2015 mostly effective) network of flood defences with walls along the river, and a liftable barrier across the River Foss where it joins the Ouse at the 'Blue Bridge'. In October and November 2000 York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years with more than 300 homes flooded. In December 2015 the flooding was more <b>extensive</b> <b>and</b> caused major disruption. The extreme impact led to a personal visit by Prime Minister David Cameron. Much land {{in and around the}} city is on flood plains too flood-prone for development other than agriculture. The ings are flood meadows along the Ouse, while the strays are open common grassland in various locations around the city.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{failures}} of the hastily planned commando operations undertaken in June and July 1940, there was a period of inactivity in which the concept was refined and detailed planning was undertaken while individual units carried out <b>extensive</b> <b>and</b> specialised training. In early 1941 a number of raids were undertaken but No. 6 Commando did not conduct its first operation until later in the year.|$|E

His centre of operations was his riverside fortress at Ticamaya. Sicumba headed an indigenous campaign that successfully limited Spanish activities in western Honduras for a decade.|$|E

He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both <b>extensive</b> <b>and</b> demanding, requiring on several occasions {{to be heard over the}} choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E
5|$|Local tradition, first {{written down}} by John Leland in 1542, holds that Cadbury Castle was King Arthur's Camelot.

In some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in toothed forms, the beak is small and restricted to the jaw tips and does not involve the teeth.
