5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and over again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must {{be kept in mind}} when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E
5|$|The {{indeterminate}} specimen TMP2002.76.1 is {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation and, if it belongs to Achelousaurus, the genus would be the stratigraphically oldest known pachyrhinosaurine taxon. Achelousaurus would then also be the only Campanian ceratopsid known <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> formation. Both animals occur right below the marine shales of the Bearpaw Formation, but due to longitudinal differences, TMP2002.76.1 is about 500,000years older than the Achelousaurus fossils from the Two Medicine Formation.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> species into chimeric contigs.|$|E

5|$|Major {{political}} parties in Sarawak {{can be divided into}} three categories: native non-Muslim, native Muslim, and non-native; parties, however, may also include members <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> group. The first political party, the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), was established in 1959, followed by the Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS) in 1960 and the Sarawak National Party (SNAP) in 1961. Other major {{political parties}} such as Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA) appeared by 1962. These parties later joined the national coalition of the Alliance Party. The Alliance Party (later regrouped into Barisan Nasional) has ruled Sarawak since the formation of Malaysia. The opposition in Sarawak has consistently alleged that the ruling coalition uses various types of vote-buying tactics in order to win elections. Stephen Kalong Ningkan was the first Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1963 to 1966 following his landslide victory in local council elections. However, he was ousted in 1966 by Tawi Sli {{with the help of the}} Malaysian federal government, causing the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is written}} {{for a large}} cast—thirty roles {{including}} small choruses of heavenly beings, sirens and Phaecians—but these parts can be organised among fourteen singers (three sopranos, two mezzo-sopranos, one alto, six tenors and two basses) by appropriate doubling of roles. This approximates to the normal forces employed in Venetian opera. In the score, the role of Eumete changes midway through Act II from tenor to soprano castrato, suggesting that the surviving manuscript may have been created <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> source. In modern performances {{the latter part of}} Eumete's role is usually transposed to a lower range, to accommodate the tenor voice throughout.|$|E
5|$|Invitations {{to enter}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, a {{football}} tournament set up to promote industrial trade fairs, were extended to the city hosting the trade fair rather than to clubs. Some cities entered a select team including players <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> club, but Aston Villa, the other major club based {{in the city of}} Birmingham, rejected the opportunity to field a combined team. Thus Birmingham City became the first English club side to play in European competition when they played their first match in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup on 15 May 1956. They were also the first English club side to reach a European final, the 1960 Fairs Cup final, in which they met Barcelona. The home leg, a goalless draw, was played on 29 March 1960 and the away leg, which Barcelona won 4–1, some six weeks later. In the semifinal of the 1961 Fairs Cup Birmingham beat Internazionale home and away; no other English club beat them in a competitive match in the San Siro until Arsenal did so in the Champions League over 40 years later.|$|E

50|$|A {{voice font}} is a computer-generated voice {{that can be}} {{controlled}} by specifying parameters such as speed and pitch and made to pronounce text input.

Despite these major differences, their ancestry <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> naturalised racial group means that they are coloured in the South African context.
