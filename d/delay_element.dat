5000|$|A common {{strategy}} is to realize a higher-order (greater than 2) digital filter as a cascaded series of second-order [...] "biquadratric" [...] (or [...] "biquad") sections (see digital biquad filter). The advantage of this strategy is that the coefficient range is limited. Cascading direct form II sections results in N <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> for filters of order N. Cascading direct form I sections results in N + 2 <b>delay</b> <b>elements,</b> since the <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> of the input of any section (except the first section) are redundant with the <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> of {{the output of the}} preceding section.|$|R
30|$|Fine delay control {{according}} to current ratio relationship of Eq. (3) {{can also be}} attained with digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> <b>elements.</b> However, this might be achieved but {{at the cost of}} linearity degradation as the complex parasitic capacitance of the digitally-controlled transistors changes when the transistors are turned ON and OFF (Maymandi-Nejad and Sachdev 2005). Furthermore, the jitter performance of the digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> is not as fine as that of the analog-tunable <b>delay</b> <b>elements.</b> This is because that for a high-resolution digital delay line, if the controller always switches the control code of the delay line, the jitter performance will not be good. Alternatively, digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> have wider range as well as simpler control of delay regulation, simpler and more robust design, lower power consumption, and better process portability than analog-tunable <b>delay</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|R

Digitally programmable <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> (DPDEs) are more flexible, less susceptible to noise and exhibit more robustness than their analog counterparts. In this paper, a partially programmable and a fully programmable <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> are proposed. Together with a switched current mirror, a gate decoupling technique {{is applied to the}} former while a Schmitt type inverter is used in the later structure to achieve more significantly reduced static and short-circuit current. The <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> are implemented in a 0. 18 um technology and simulation results with a 1 V power supply show a more than 40 % power saving while operating at a speed of 450 MHz in both structures...|$|R

50|$|The user then {{throws the}} grenade at the {{intended}} target, taking care that the grenade does not strike an obstacle that could deflect the grenade, bounce it {{back towards the}} thrower or allow it to roll towards the thrower or an unintended place. When the grenade is thrown, the safety lever will fly free (under pressure from the striker spring) and the striker will hit the cap, igniting the pyrotechnic <b>delay</b> <b>element.</b> When the <b>delay</b> <b>element</b> has burned approximately 4 to 5 seconds it will initiate the grenade's explosive filler, causing {{a large number of}} metal fragments to be projected at high velocities.

This will be done for a "realization with PFM circuits," which is a particular pulse-input fundamental-mode realization of a sequential machine. It will be shown that the existence of assignments which reduce the number of <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> in machines realized with PFM circuits is closely related to the existence of a "NNP pair" of partitions, that is, a partition with nonnegation property with respect to a partition with substitution property (Hartrnanis). A general method will be given which selects the assignments which minimize the number of <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> in realizations with PFM circuits, but it will be outlined that this method can also be used for reclucing the number of <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> which are present in the feedback paths of synchronous machines...|$|R

30|$|Although analog-tunable <b>delay</b> <b>elements</b> with {{high-resolution}} <b>delay</b> steps may not {{be shown}} clearly in Table  1, they {{have the upper hand}} in terms of achieving higher-resolution delay steps {{because of the fact that}} the delay is being controlled precisely by the current ratio relationship according to Eq. (3).

50|$|The ring {{oscillator}} is a distributed {{version of the}} delay oscillator.

Rather than having a single <b>delay</b> <b>element,</b> each inverter contributes to the delay of the signal around the ring of inverters, hence the name ring oscillator. Adding pairs of inverters to the ring increases the total delay and thereby decreases the oscillator frequency. Changing the supply voltage changes the delay through each inverter, with higher voltages typically decreasing the delay and increasing the oscillator frequency.
