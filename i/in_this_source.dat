5|$|The {{aforesaid}} {{kings of}} Bǫglunga sǫgur most likely refer to Rǫgnvaldr and his son, Guðrøðr (died 1231), {{although it is}} not impossible that the king 'Rǫgnvaldr' <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>source</b> may instead refer to Ragnall, and that the king 'Guðrøðr' in it may actually refer to Rǫgnvaldr himself, since the latter's father was named Guðrøðr. Whatever the case, the events depicted in Bǫglunga sǫgur appear to show that, in the wake of destructive Norwegian activity in the Isles, which may have been some sort of officially sanctioned punishment from Scandinavia, Rǫgnvaldr and his son (or instead perhaps Ragnall and Rǫgnvaldr) travelled to Norway where they rendered homage to the Norwegian king, and made compensation for unpaid taxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{year and}} {{circumstances}} of Ragnall's death are uncertain, as surviving contemporary sources failed to mark his demise. According to clan tradition {{preserved in the}} Book of Clanranald, Ragnall may have died in 1207. However, no corroborating evidence supports this date, and {{there is reason to}} believe that dates <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>source</b> are unreliable. In fact, this source misplaces Somairle's death by sixteen years, which may indicate that Ragnall himself died some sixteen years earlier (in 1191). If this date is correct then Ragnall's death may be related to his defeat suffered at the hands of his brother. However, the Chronicle of Mann, which records the 1192 conflict between Ragnall and Áengus, gives no hint of Ragnall's demise in its account. Another possibility is that Ragnall may have been slain sometime around 1209 and 1210, during yet more internal conflict amongst the meic Somairle.|$|E

2500|$|In scholarship, a {{secondary}} source is a document or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a primary source, {{which is an}} original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. However, as discussed in detail in the section below on classification, how to classify a source is not always an obvious decision. A secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. These sources contain second hand information that has already appeared in primary documents. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>source,</b> the original information is selected, modified and arranged [...] in a suitable format {{for the purpose of}} easy location by the users.|$|E
2500|$|One {{source that}} may {{possibly}} cast light on Fergus' familial origins is Roman de Fergus, a mediaeval Arthurian romance, mainly set in southern Scotland, which tells {{the tale of}} a knight who may represent Fergus himself. The name of the knight's father <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>source</b> is a form of the name borne by Fergus' neighbouring contemporary Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll (died 1164), and could be evidence that Fergus' father bore the same name. Conversely, the name of the knight's father could suggest that this character represents the historical Somairle himself, rather than the father of Fergus. Whatever the case, there is reason to suspect that the romance is a literary pastiche or parody of the compositions of Chrétien de Troyes [...] (fl. c.1160c.1181); and besides the coincidence of names, the tale has little to commend it as an authoritative source for the historical Fergus.|$|E
