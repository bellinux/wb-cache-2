This program optimizes steam production among four cogen units and three boilers, compressor turbine extraction/condensing, spared pump (turbine/motor) operation, as well as the monitoring of the entire steam system. The program is also facilitates the costing of gaseous and liquid products through the use of offline case studies which can be used to optimize production of these products on our industrial gas pipelines.

The proposed SDC technique can provide a stable and regulated output for edge-lit light-emitting diode backlight systems. This converter was used in a 0. 25 -μm CMOS process.

ECV controls the air conditioning compressor for automobile {{on the basis of}} the input signal of the pulse width modulation (PWM) that supplied from the external controller.

40|$|As {{the size}} of as {{photovoltaic}} (PV) power plants have been gradually increasing {{in the last few}} decades, interests in multiphase converters for PV application has been escalated. Due to current sharing by the adding phase, the multiphase converters are suitable for PV system to reduce conduction losses and increase system efficiency. However, the adding phase can be disadvantage for the converters at light load condition. Especially for PV applications which rely on changeable irradiation or temperature condition, low efficiency at light load condition is a critical problem on the PV system. This thesis demonstrates the improvement and advantages of interleaved boost converter compared with conventional boost converter. Moreover, a new phase shedding control method of an interleaved boost converter as PV pre-regulator is proposed as a way to improve the efficiency of the converter at light load condition. The efficiency improvement of the interleaved boost converter and the minimization of current overshoot are obtained using a hysteresis control with proposed incremental <b>duty</b> <b>control</b> (IDC) method.

Greater control over specific job duties is hypothesized to increase motivation to do those job duties.

40|$|The pulse-based {{charging}} {{method for}} battery cells {{has been recognized}} as a fast and efficient way to overcome the shortcoming of a slow charging time in distributed battery cells, which {{is regarded as a}} connection of cells such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The pulse frequency for controlling the battery charge duration is dynamically controlled within a certain range in order to inject the maximum charge current into the battery cells. The optimal frequency is determined in order to minimize battery impedance. The adaptation of the proposed pulse duty and frequency decreases the concentration of the polarization by sensing the runtime characteristics of battery cells so that it guarantees a certain level of safety in charging the distributed battery cells within the operating temperature range of 5 – 45 °C. The sensed terminal voltage and temperature of battery cells are dynamically monitored while the battery is charging so as to adjust the frequency and duty of the proposed charging pulse method, thereby preventing battery degradation. The evaluation results show that a newly designed charging algorithm for the implemented charger system is about 18. 6 % faster than the conventional constant-current (CC) charging method with the temperature rise within a reasonable range.

40|$|Abstract:- Novel {{frequency}} doubler circuits and dividers for clock signal generation are presented. In combination with two edge detectors and two <b>duty</b> cycle <b>control</b> buffers a low cost {{frequency doubler}} circuit is achieved {{as compared to}} Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) design. An input clock signal with an unpredictable duty cycle is inputted to a rising (or falling) edge detector. The edge detector converts the positive (or negative) transitions to a one shot pulse train whose frequency {{is the same as}} that of the input clock. However, the one shot pulse train has its duty cycle far less than 50 %. By a first 50 % <b>duty</b> cycle <b>control</b> buffer the output waveform of the resulted clock signal is symmetrical. The output of the first-stage duty cycle buffer is then edge detected by a rising and falling edge detector, so that the resulted one shot pulse train has twice the frequency of the incoming 50 % duty cycle signal. Finally, the second one shot signals are duty cycle adjusted in the second-stage <b>duty</b> cycle <b>control</b> buffer, to restore its 50 % duty cycle. Therefore, two times frequency multiplication is achieved with low cost as compared to Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) design. Furthermore, a novel design approach for frequency dividers using <b>duty</b> cycle <b>control</b> circuit is also demonstrated. Simulation results for both frequency multiplication and division confirm the validity of the proposed design approach...|$|R
