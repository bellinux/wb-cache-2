40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research were to investigate the effect of emotional honesty, interpersonal skills, task structure and directive behaviour on leadership effectiveness. This research was conducted at Vocational Schools (Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan: SMK) in Medan in 2010 by using survey with 132 principals as population and the sample of 60 principals as respondents who were selected by applying proportional random sampling technique. The hypotheses were tested by using path analysis. This research findings were as follows: (1) There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> significant positive effect of emotional honesty on interpersonal skills; (2) There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> significant positive effect of emotional honesty on task structure; (3) There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> significant positive effect of emotional honesty on directive behaviour; (4) There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> significant positive effect of interpersonal skills on directive behaviour; (5) There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> significant positive effect of task structure on directive behaviour; (6) There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> significant positive effect of interpersonal skills leadership effectiveness; (7) There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> significant positive effect of directive behaviour on leadership effectiveness...|$|R

5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in the fossil record <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E
