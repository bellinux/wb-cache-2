5|$|A {{few months}} later Luis is elected Chair of the ship's ruling council, and helps bring about a {{settlement}} wherein the people on board can choose {{whether or not to}} stay on the ship, and also choose whether the ship stays in orbit around Hsin Ti Chiu. Hsing has a child by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's <b>educational</b> <b>curriculum</b> is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live on a planet again. The ship leaves, not intending to return.|$|E
5|$|In the General Government, the {{remaining}} schools were subjugated to the German educational system, {{and the number}} and competence of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes {{in the final two}} years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was no money for heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The <b>educational</b> <b>curriculum</b> was censored; subjects such as literature, history and geography were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students and teachers, and the use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.|$|E

25|$|According to Anne-Marie Brady, an Associate Professor at the University of Canterbury's School of Political Science and Communication, CCP {{propaganda}} and thought work (sīxiǎng gōngzuò 思想工作) traditionally {{had a much}} broader notion of the public sphere than is usually defined by media specialists. Chinese propagandists used every possible means of communication available in China after 1949, including electronic media such as film and television, <b>educational</b> <b>curriculum</b> and research, print media such as newspapers and posters, cultural arts such as plays and music, oral media such as memorizing Mao quotes, as well as thought reform and political study classes.|$|E

25|$|Grove {{was born}} in Clapham, the eighth of the eleven {{children}} of Thomas Grove (1774–1852), fishmonger and venison dealer, and his wife, Mary (1784–1856), née Blades. He went to a preparatory school, on Clapham Common, where one of his schoolfellows was George Granville Bradley, later Dean of Westminster, whose sister Grove subsequently married. He next entered Stockwell (later known as Clapham) Grammar School, run by Charles Pritchard, the astronomer, who {{was inspired by the}} progressive principles of King's College, London. The <b>educational</b> <b>curriculum</b> was based on classics, divinity, mathematics and natural philosophy, and rigorously tested by annual examination. Pritchard also encouraged his pupils to develop interests in literature and music. Grove was a regular worshipper at Holy Trinity church, Clapham, where he heard the music of Bach and Handel. By the age of sixteen, he was competent in classics and mathematics; he left the school in 1836 and was apprenticed to Alexander Gordon, a well-known civil engineer in Westminster. In his free time, he immersed himself in music, attending concerts and studying scores.|$|E

The show's goals included both cognitive and affective objectives. Initially, the cognitive skills of its young viewers were stressed over affective skills, which were addressed indirectly because the producers, writers, and researchers believed that focusing on cognitive skills would increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency. Eventually, after the show's first season, its critics forced its staff to address affective goals more overtly, which occurred after [...] "extensive research and planning".|$|E

500|$|As author Malcolm Gladwell has stated, [...] "Sesame Street {{was built}} around a single, {{breakthrough}} insight: {{that if you can}} hold the attention of children, you can educate them". Gerald S. Lesser, the CTW's first advisory board chair, went even further, saying that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention. Sesame Street was the first children's show to structure each episode, and the segments within them, to capture children's attention, and to make, as Gladwell put it, [...] "small but critical adjustments" [...] to keep it. According to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch, Sesame Street {{was one of the few}} children's television programs to utilize a detailed and comprehensive <b>educational</b> <b>curriculum,</b> garnered from formative and summative research.|$|E
500|$|Mayo and Minnesota, {{supported}} by amicus briefs {{from a number}} of residency programs and medical organizations, argued that a residency is primarily educational in nature. They asserted that a residency is generally chosen based on academic criteria and that a residency must be completed in order for a physician to be licensed to practice medicine. They also argued that residency training involves not only supervised work, but also an <b>educational</b> <b>curriculum,</b> conferences, and lectures, much like clinical years of medical school. Mayo's attorney, former Bush Administration Solicitor General Theodore Olson, also argued that the rule was [...] "arbitrary", as the tax would apply to a resident working 40 hours per week but not to a resident working only 39 hours per week. The medical schools proposed that the IRS should base their determination on the primary purpose of a program—providing an education versus providing a livelihood.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street {{was one of}} the few children's {{television}} programs that utilized a detailed and comprehensive <b>educational</b> <b>curriculum,</b> with specific educational goals, in its content. [...] The show's goals were garnered from in-house formative research which informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations conducted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons that measured the program's educational effectiveness. [...] The first curriculum was created in a series of five seminars, led by Lesser and attended by Sesame Street's new creative staff and by educational and child development specialists, in 1968. The participants generated long lists of goals, which the Workshop organized into five categories. [...] Eventually, these categories were whittled down to four: symbolic representation, cognitive processes, the physical environment, and the social environment. [...] The show's curriculum was eventually restated to identify the writers' goals instead of the child's.|$|E
