5|$|With {{the opening}} of the Dovre Line, Spisevognselskapet {{established}} <b>dining-car</b> service on 25 June 1921. In 1921 a train ride from Kristiania to Trondheim lasted approximately 15 hours, and the average waiting time at each station was between 10 and 15 minutes. On 1 July 1925 dining service was introduced on the Valdres Line, from 1 July 1926 on the Brevik Line, from May 1934 on the Nordland Line and from 15 May 1936 on the Røros Line. In 1948 210,000 meals were served on board, in addition to sandwiches and drinks. The company also offered a light breakfast on night trains on the Kongsvinger, Østfold and Dovre lines. During the Second World War, <b>dining-car</b> service was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November 1951, {{locomotive}} 60100 Spearmint {{ran away}} on the 1 in 44 Cowlairs incline approaching Glasgow Queen Street Station. A defective repair on a vacuum pipe had left engine without brakes. The engine, which was scheduled to work the afternoon departure to Leeds, collided with the stock for the same train which was being shunted across the station, the <b>dining-car</b> crew were injured in the collision.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, the {{executive}} board of the state railways wanted to centralise the operation of restaurant carriages {{and the most important}} station restaurants in Norway under one management. The board stated that they wanted to minimise the conflict of interest between the railway company and the <b>dining-car</b> operator. They also saw centralising operations as a way to allocate a larger share of the revenue to the railway company, and to ensure a high quality of service on new lines. At that time the Sørland Line and Dovre Line were in the planning stages, and the NSB intended to introduce dining services on these when they opened. Oslo East Station and its restaurant were operated by the private Norwegian Trunk Railway. In an agreement signed on 18 September 1918 both railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator would be controlled by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, but this company had to abide by the NSB's decision of how many restaurant carriages to operate on any line.|$|E
6000|$|Then Attwater laughed softly. [...] "These are the diversions of {{a lonely}} man," [...] he resumed, [...] "and {{possibly}} {{not in good}} taste. One tells oneself these little fairy tales for company. If there should happen to be anything in folk-lore, Mr. Hay? But here comes the claret. One does not offer you Lafitte, captain, because I believe it is all sold to the railroad <b>dining-cars</b> in your great country; but this Brâne-Mouton is of a good year, and Mr. Whish will give me news of it." ...|$|R
50|$|Rolling {{stock on}} InterRegional trains has {{recently}} been the object of CFR's modernisation plan. Various classes of cars have been refurbished, and fitted with air-conditioning, ecological toilets, etc. However, a small and rapidly declining number of Rapid rolling stock, mainly on lesser-used routes, remains fairly aged and outdated. As of 2004, Siemens Desiro DMUs have been introduced on medium-distance Rapid routes. Most Rapid rolling stock is painted in red, usually with a white horizontal stripe. All cars are compartmented and first class is usually air-conditioned, with 6 seats per compartment both in second class and first class. Sleepers, couchettes and <b>dining-cars</b> are available on most long routes.|$|R
6000|$|No, no; {{the privacy}} of a French sleeping-car is all very well, but for decency give our friend a good, old-fashioned Pullman sleeper at a third the money, with its {{curtains}} swaying with {{the motion of the}} car and muting the long-drawn, loud-drawn breathing of the serried sleepers behind them. To be sure, in the morning, when stooping backs begin to round the curtains out, and half-shod feet to thrust into the narrow gangway between them, the effect is of a familiarity, an intimacy; but so much trust, so much brotherly kindness goes with it all that you could not call it indecency, though certainly you could not claim it privacy. It only proves, as that friend of ours was saying, that money cannot buy everything, and that, if you expect the Pullman parlor-cars to be an improvement on the German first-class cars, you will be disappointed, probably. First-class cars vary much all over Europe; even second-class cars do. In Austria they are not nearly so good as in Germany, and in Italy--poor, dear Italy!--they are worse still. That is because, the enemies of socialism say, the roads are state roads, or because, the friends of socialism say, the expropriated companies have dumped their worn-out rolling-stock on the commonwealth, which must bear the shame of it with the stranger. Between these clashing claims we will not put our blade. All we say is that Italian railroad travel is as bad as heart could wish--the heart that loves Italy and holds dear the memory of the days when there were few railroads, if any, there, and one still went by diligence or vettura. The only absolutely good railroad travel is in England, where the corridor car imagined from the Pullman has realized the most exacting ideal of the traveller of any class. In the matter of <b>dining-cars</b> we have stood still (having attained perfection at a bound), while the English diner has shot ahead in simplicity and quality of refection. With us a dollar buys more dinner than you wish or like; with them three shillings pay for an elegant sufficiency, and a tip of sixpence purchases an explicit gratitude from the waiter which a quarter is often helpless to win from his dark antitype with us. The lunch served on the steamer train from London to Liverpool leaves the swollen, mistimed dinner on the Boston express-- ...|$|R
500|$|Olga left Gatchina for {{the first}} time in the early fall of 1888 when the {{imperial}} family visited the Caucasus. On 29 October, their return train approached the small town of Borki at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the <b>dining-car</b> when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, and held it up with [...] "a Herculean effort" [...] so that the others could escape. There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes. An official investigation found that the crash was an accident, but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.|$|E
2500|$|Injured: 47 passengers, 1 Pullman porter, 2 <b>dining-car</b> {{employee}}s, 1 other employee ...|$|E
2500|$|Edwin Kachel was a steward {{for more}} than twenty-five years in the <b>Dining-Car</b> Department of the Great Northern Railway. He said that [...] "on a dining car, three {{elements}} can be considered -- the equipment, the employee, then passenger." [...] In other words, [...] "the whole is constituted by two-thirds of human parts." [...] As cross-country train travel became more commonplace, passengers began to expect high-quality food to be served at the meals on board. The level of meal service on trains in the 1920s and 1930s rivaled that of high-end restaurants and clubs.|$|E
60|$|That {{night we}} had to hurry from the hotel to catch a train for Worcester and we had dinner in the <b>dining-car.</b> Several of my players' wives had come over from Worcester to meet us, and were in the <b>dining-car</b> when I entered. I {{observed}} a pretty girl sitting {{at one of the}} tables with my new pitcher, Henderson.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{the faintest}} idea. He {{told us to}} ask the {{conductor}} {{or one of the}} porters. No, sir, I'll never forget that journey through to Vienna,--nine mortal hours! Nothing to eat, not a bite, except just {{in the middle of the}} day when they managed to hitch on a <b>dining-car</b> for a while. And they warned everybody that the <b>dining-car</b> was only on for an hour and a half. Commandeered, I guess after that," [...] added Parkins, puffing his cigarette.|$|E
60|$|They had all had dinner, {{so nobody}} was hungry until about six o'clock, when a waiter from the <b>dining-car</b> came through {{in his white}} apron.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Price {{went to the}} <b>dining-car</b> {{and also}} the smoker. He {{returned}} about nine o'clock in the evening, just as I was falling into a light doze.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will just}} catch a fast train to London," [...] he said, more cheerfully. [...] "You will change at Mechester, {{and you will}} find a <b>dining-car</b> there. Have you plenty of money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come and see," [...] {{answered}} Dave, {{and led the}} way to the <b>dining-car.</b> When the old sailor saw the tables, and {{saw some}} folks eating as if at home, he stared in amazement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Lord Marshmoreton." [...] Miss Faraday {{turned to}} Lady Caroline. [...] "I {{have been looking}} up the trains, Lady Caroline. The best is the twelve-fifteen. It has a <b>dining-car,</b> and stops at Belpher if signalled." ...|$|E
60|$|On and on sped the train, making but few stops. There was a <b>dining-car</b> {{attached}} but I was travelling on a cheap scale, {{and made}} my dinner and supper from the generous lunch the widow had provided.|$|E
60|$|Reaching Gallup at noon, I {{spent the}} {{afternoon}} sitting in the sun, waiting for the train. At six o'clock it came, and soon I was washed and shaved and eating dinner on the <b>dining-car</b> of the Continental Limited.|$|E
60|$|The priest, who {{had come}} through from the <b>dining-car,</b> held between his fingers an unlit cigar. His fat, good-humoured face was a little flushed. He had the {{appearance}} {{of a man who has}} found his dinner a satisfactory meal.|$|E
60|$|They {{had to wait}} {{a little}} before they could get seats {{together}} in the <b>dining-car</b> and they amused themselves by gazing at the settlements through which they were passing. Here and there were numerous cabins, with hordes of colored children playing about.|$|E
60|$|It {{took some}} {{little time to}} settle down on the train. They had left Crumville at half-past ten and almost before the young folks knew it, {{it was time for}} lunch. Quite {{naturally}} Dave escorted Jessie to the <b>dining-car,</b> while Roger took Laura, and Mr. Dunston Porter looked after Mrs. Wadsworth.|$|E
60|$|I {{have made}} Billy a counter-proposition that we strike through the Adirondacks (in the train) to New York, from there portage to Atlantic City, then to Washington, {{carrying}} our own grub (in the <b>dining-car),</b> camp {{there a few}} days (at the Willard), and then back, I to return by train and Billy on foot with the outfit.|$|E
60|$|On {{the journey}} to San Antonio they had an {{opportunity}} to speak to William Jarvey a number of times, and once they sat at the same table with him in the <b>dining-car.</b> When asked where he came from, he replied rather evasively that he had lived for a great number of years in the Northwest, but that he had left that section of the country to try his fortunes in Mexico.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{that puts}} me {{in mind of}} a story!" [...] burst out Shadow. [...] "A fellow named William took his best girl for a trip by train to another town, {{and on the way}} they went into the <b>dining-car</b> for lunch. He said {{afterwards}} that it was the longest lunch he had ever eaten, and as the girl had ordered nearly everything on the bill of fare it was also the longest bill he had ever paid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just for to-night, put {{yourself}} in my care," [...] he said. [...] "I'm ashamed to have annoyed you {{to such an extent}} and to have interfered with your plans; but I could not help it. You have succeeded in balking the DETECTIVE, but the MAN admires you for it. I noticed, the last time you took out your purse in the <b>dining-car,</b> that your money is nearly gone. If you will permit me to lend you enough for your hotel expenses--" ...|$|E
60|$|On and on {{went the}} train, {{stopping}} at several towns of {{more or less}} importance. The girls and boys amused themselves studying the time-table and in gazing out of the window, and Dunston Porter told them {{of some of his}} experiences while roving in various portions of the globe, for, as my old readers are aware, he was a great traveler. At noon they went into the <b>dining-car</b> for lunch, and Dave and Roger sat at one table with Laura and Jessie opposite to them.|$|E
60|$|Answer: Ha! ha! This is a {{thing we}} know--something that we do know. You put your foot in it when you asked us that. We have lived {{this sort of thing}} too long ever to make any error. The widow of a marquis, whom you should by rights call a marchioness dowager (but we {{overlook}} it--you meant no harm) is entitled (in any hotel that we know or frequent) to go in to dinner whenever, and as often, as she likes. On a <b>dining-car</b> the rule is the other way.|$|E
60|$|Leaving the {{vicinity}} of the metropolis, the train began its long journey up the beautiful Hudson. But the journey northward did not last long. Soon the train branched to the westward and plunged into the hills and rolling lands of the Mohawk Valley. City after city were left behind with a whir and a rush that almost took Randy's breath from him. At noon a stop was made for lunch, then on they went again. Supper was served in a <b>dining-car,</b> and both boys voted it about the best meal they had ever tasted.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the train}} {{rolled into the}} station the crowd got aboard and the porters showed the {{tourists}} to their seats. All of the [...] "Porter tribe," [...] as Phil dubbed them, were together. Mrs. Wadsworth and another lady had a stateroom, and next to this Laura and Jessie had a section, with Dave and Roger opposite. Then came the other boys, and Mr. and Mrs. Basswood and Dunston Porter. The Crumville contingent filled two cars, and there were three more cars from neighboring towns. To the front were a baggage and a <b>dining-car</b> and to the rear an observation car.|$|E
6000|$|I {{went into}} the dining--car the next morning for breakfast. Ordinarily I only care for coffee and rolls, but this {{particular}} morning I espied an important-looking man {{on the other side}} of the car eating broiled chicken. I asked for broiled chicken, and I was told by the waiter and later by the <b>dining-car</b> conductor that there was no broiled chicken. There must have been an argument, for the Pullman conductor came in and remarked: [...] "If he wants broiled chicken, give it to him. If you haven't got it on the train, stop somewhere. It will be better for all concerned!" [...] I got the chicken.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys did}} not recover from that shock {{until late in}} the afternoon. As it was a {{physical}} impossibility for Nan to rest her head all day upon her husband's broad shoulder, the boys toward dinner time came out of their jealous trance. I heard them plotting something. When dinner was called, about half of my party, including the bride and groom, went at once into the <b>dining-car.</b> Time there flew by swiftly. And later, when we were once more in our Pullman, and I had gotten interested in a game of cards with Milly and Stringer and his wife, the Rube came marching up to me with a very red face.|$|E
60|$|He {{explained}} that during his absence in the <b>dining-car</b> someone had entered his stateroom and stolen his grip and Nan's. I hastened {{at once to}} aid the Rube in his search. The boys swore by everything under and beyond the sun they {{had not seen the}} grips; they appeared very much grieved at the loss and pretended to help in searching the Pullman. At last, with the assistance of a porter, we discovered the missing grips in an upper berth. The Rube carried them off to his stateroom and we knew soon from his uncomplimentary remarks that the contents of the suitcases had been mixed and manhandled. But he did not hunt for the jokers.|$|E
60|$|After lunch {{our guide}} lapsed again to our {{conductor}} and reappeared with his motor-bus and {{took us to}} the station, where he overcame the scruples of the lady in the ticket-office concerning our wish to return to Madrid by the Sud-Express instead of the ordinary train. The trouble was about the supplementary fare which we easily paid on board; in fact, there is never any difficulty in paying a supplementary fare in Spain; the authorities meet you quite half-way. But we were nervous because we had already suffered from the delays of people at the last hotel where our motor-bus stopped to take up passengers; they lingered so long over lunch that we were sure we should miss the Sud-Express, and we did not see how we could live in Escorial till the way-train started; yet for all their delays we reached the station in time and more. The train seemed strangely reduced in the number of its cars, but we confidently started with others to board the nearest of them; there we were waved violently away, and bidden get into the <b>dining-car</b> {{at the rear of the}} train. In some dudgeon we obeyed, but we were glad to get away from Escorial on any terms, and the <b>dining-car</b> was not bad, though it had a somewhat disheveled air. We could only suppose that all the places in the two other cars were taken, and we resigned ourselves to choosing the least coffee-stained of the coffee-stained tables and ordered more coffee at it. The waiter brought it as promptly as the conductor collected our supplementary fare; he even made a feint of removing the stains from our table-cloth with a flourish of his napkin, and then he left us to our conjectures and reflections till he came for his pay and his fee just before we ran into Madrid.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not till}} the <b>dining-car</b> was {{attached}} to their train that they were both able to escape for an hour into the care-free mood of their earlier travels, when they were so easily taken out of themselves. The time had been when they could have found enough in the conjectural fortunes and characters of their fellow-passengers to occupy them. This phase of their youth had lasted long, and the world was still full of novelty and interest for them; but it required all the charm of the <b>dining-car</b> now to lay the anxieties that beset them. It was so potent for the moment, however, that they could take an objective view at their sitting cozily down there together, {{as if they had}} only themselves in the world. They wondered what the children were doing, the children who possessed them so intensely when present, and now, by a fantastic operation of absence, seemed almost non-existents. They tried to be homesick for them, but failed; they recognized with comfortable self-abhorrence that this was terrible, but owned a fascination in being alone; at the same time, they could not imagine how people felt who never had any children. They contrasted the luxury of dining that way, with every advantage except a band of music, and the old way of rushing out to snatch a fearful joy at the lunch-counters of the Worcesier and Springfield and New Haven stations. They had not gone often to New York since their wedding journey, but they had gone often enough to have noted the change from the lunch-counter to the lunch-basket brought in the train, from which you could subsist with more ease and dignity, but seemed destined to a superabundance of pickles, whatever you ordered.|$|E
60|$|Jake {{sat down}} on a rug, {{with his back to the}} wall and a plate on his knee, and Jim's {{thoughts}} wandered. He had got the habit of remembering things when he was ill, and the little shabby room, with the cheap rug on the rough, stained floor, seemed to melt like a dissolving view. He saw black pines, with the moon shining between their stiff branches, wood smoke drifting past, and a red fire snapping in the snow. Jake wore ragged furs and his eyes twinkled, as they twinkled now. Jake was a humorous philosopher and if his humor was sometimes thin his philosophy was sound. He was white; one could trust him. Then Jim came back to the room above the store. He liked the way Jake waited on Carrie, although Jake owned he had not been a success when he made a trip in the Mount Stephen <b>dining-car.</b>|$|E
60|$|From hearsay and {{reasonable}} surmise {{we learned that}} we had not come from Escorial in the Sud-Express at all, but in the Queen's special train bringing her and her children from their autumn sojourn at La Granja, and {{that we had been}} for an hour a notable feature of the royal party without knowing it, and of course without getting the least good of it. We had indeed ignorantly enjoyed no less of the honor than two other Americans, who came in the <b>dining-car</b> with us, but whether the nice-looking Spanish couple who sat in the corner next us were equally ignorant of their advantage I shall never know. It was but too highly probable that the messed condition of the car was due to royal luncheon in it just before we came aboard; but why we were suffered to come aboard, or why a supplementary fare should have been collected from us remains one of those mysteries which I should once have liked to keep all Spain.|$|E
