[...] <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> both systems influenced each other, but that writing could obscure language. He argued that writing obscures how pronunciation forms because of its influence on pronunciation. Saussure drew a distinction between phonetic languages and languages such as Chinese in which a single character represents a word. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> only phonetic languages cause problems for linguists.|$|R

25|$|The French {{writer and}} {{traveler}} Alexis de Tocqueville, in Democracy in America (1835), expressed opposition to slavery while observing {{its effects on}} American society.
