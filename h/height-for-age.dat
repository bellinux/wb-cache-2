Aims: To develop <b>height-for-age</b> charts for contemporary South Asian children aged 0 – 20 years living in the Netherlands, to evaluate secular trends, and to compare the charts with current Asian Indian, Dutch and WHO references. Subjects and methods: A population-based study measured 3315 South Asian children aged 0 – 20 years between 2007 – 2010. Among this cohort, 6876 measurements were taken. Another 7388 measurements were taken of a historical cohort of 1078 children born between 1974 – 1976 (aged 0 – 18 years).

We evaluated the association between malnutrition and response to antimalarial therapy in Ugandan children treated with ACTs for repeated episodes of malaria. Children aged 4 to 12 months diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria were randomized to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and followed for up to 2 years. All HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (TS). The primary exposure variables included <b>height-for-age</b> and weight-for-age z scores. Outcomes included parasite clearance at days 2 and 3 and risk of recurrent parasitemia after 42 days of follow-up. Two hundred ninety-two children were randomized to DP or AL, resulting in 2, 013 malaria treatments. Fewer than 1 % of patients had a positive blood smear by day 3 (DP, 0. 2 %; AL, 0. 6 % [P = 0. 18]). There was no significant association between <b>height-for-age</b> or weight-for-age z scores and a positive blood smear 2 days following treatment.

However, {{many of the}} {{studies have been conducted}} in urban areas with older pediatric populations. This study was undertaken to evaluate growth patterns after ART initiation in a young pediatric population in rural Zambia with a high prevalence of undernutrition. Methods Between 2007 and 2009, 193 HIV-infected children were enrolled in a cohort study in Macha, Zambia. Children were evaluated every 3 months, at which time a questionnaire was administered, height and weight were measured, and blood specimens were collected. Weight- and <b>height-for-age</b> z-scores were constructed from WHO growth standards. All children receiving ART at enrollment or initiating ART during the study were included in this analysis. Linear mixed effects models were used to model trajectories of weight and <b>height-for-age</b> z-scores. Results A high proportion of study children were underweight (59 %) and stunted (72 %) at treatment initiation. Improvements in both weight- and <b>height-for-age</b> z-scores were observed, with weight-for-age z-scores increasing during the first 6 months of treatment and then stabilizing, and <b>height-for-age</b> z-scores increasing consistently over time. Trajectories of weight-for-age z-scores differed by underweight status at treatment initiation, with children who were underweight experiencing greater increases in z-scores in the first 6 months of treatment. Trajectories of <b>height-for-age</b> z-scores differed by age, with children older than 5 years of age experiencing smaller increases over time. Conclusions Some of the effects of HIV on growth were reversed with ART initiation, although a high proportion of children remained underweight and stunted after two years of treatment. Partnerships between treatment and nutrition programs should be explored so that HIV-infected children can receive optimal nutritional support. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} nutritional recovery {{patterns in}} 106 undernourished children assisted by the Center of Nutritional Recovery and Education (CREN, in Portuguese) between January 1995 and December 1999. Design: CREN assists undernourished children aged 0 to 72 months {{living in the}} southern regions of Sao Paulo, in an outpatient setting. Nutritional status was assessed by Z-scores of weight-for-age, <b>height-for-age</b> and weight-for-height. Nutritional recovery evaluation considered Z-score gains in weight-for-age and <b>height-for-age,</b> grouping into four categories (Z-score increment of 0. 50 between groups). Children with birth weight less than 2500 g were classified as low birth weight (LBW), while those born at term and with LBW were classified as small for gestational age. Setting: CREN (Center of Nutritional Recovery and Education in Portuguese), Sao Paulo, Brazil. Subjects: One hundred and six children from CREN. Results: Among the 106 evaluated children, ninety-eight (92. 5 %) recovered their weight or height and seventy-two (67. 9 %) recovered both. Nearly half of studied children presented a nutritional recovery (increase in Z-score) of more than 0. 50 in <b>height-for-age</b> (46. 2 %) and about 40 % in weight-for-age (38. 7 %). Multivariate analysis showed that treatment duration and initial weight-for-age contributed to weight-for-age Z-score increment, explaining 25 % of the variation; and treatment duration, initial <b>height-for-age</b> and weight-for-age Z-score increment contributed to <b>height-for-age</b> Z-score increment, explaining 62 % of the variation. Conclusions: Our findings show that nutritional recovery among children who attended CREN was influenced primarily by the degree of nutritional deficit at admission.

This study aimed to assess the association between women’s empowerment and gender inequalities in adolescent nutritional status. Data were from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) covering the period 1997 to 2015, and consisted of 16, 683 observations from 13, 396 adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 years born in 6781 families. Three indicators of women’s empowerment were used: mother’s education, mother’s bargaining power and mother’s working status. Multivariate linear regression with robust standard errors was used to examine whether and how these indicators of women’s empowerment influenced adolescent nutritional status. Interaction terms were added to analyse how the association between women’s empowerment and adolescent nutritional status differed by gender. The results showed that mother’s education and mother’s working status were significantly associated with adolescent nutritional status, particularly with <b>height-for-age.</b> Adolescents of well-educated mothers had a higher <b>height-for-age</b> while those who were raised by mothers with a blue-collar job had a lower <b>height-for-age.</b> Although no gender differences were found for <b>height-for-age,</b> gender differences for BMI-for-age were obvious, with boys having a lower BMI-for-age than girls.

40|$|Background: Prolonged {{breast-feeding}} {{is frequently}} associated with malnutrition in less-developed countries, even after adjust-ment for socioeconomic confounders. However, in rural Senegal, breast-feeding is prolonged {{when the child}} is stunted. Objective: We aimed to test whether the lower <b>height-for-age</b> of children weaned late is explained by their height before wean-ing or whether prolonged breast-feeding is associated with impaired growth. Design: A cohort of 443 Senegalese children recruited from dis-pensaries at 2 mo of age were visited in their homes at 6 -mo intervals when they were 1. 5 to 3 y of age. Weight, length, arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness were meas-ured. Six-month increments were analyzed in relation to breast-feeding (breast-fed compared with weaned children or breast-feeding duration), season, and maternal housing with use of multiple linear regression. Results: The mean duration of breast-feeding was 24. 1 mo (quartiles 1 and 3 : 21. 9 and 26. 4). <b>Height-for-age</b> {{at the age of}} 3 y was negatively associated with age at weaning (P < 0. 01), but this association disappeared after adjustment for <b>height-for-age</b> in infancy. Length increments were significantly greater in both the second and third years of life in children breast-fed for longer durations (P < 0. 05) and tended to be greater in breast-fed than in weaned children in the second year of life (P = 0. 05).

40|$|Background Indoor air {{pollution}} due {{to use of}} biomass fuels (BMF) for household cooking and heating is a known risk factor {{of morbidity and mortality}} in {{children under the age of}} five years. A recent study in India suggested an association between biomass fuel smoke exposure anaemia and stunting among children under the age of five. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between BMF use, stunting and anaemia in children aged 12 - 59 months who participated in the 2006 - 2007 Swaziland Demographic and Health Survey (SDHS), whilst adjusting for potential confounders. Methods The study was cross-sectional and based on secondary data analysis of data collected through the household and women’s questionnaires in the 2006 - 2007 SDHS, which employed a multistage random sampling. Anthropometric measurements taken in the SDHS and the World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 Multi-Centre Child growth reference standards were used to ascertain children’s health status and the stunting outcome variable. A child, whose <b>height-for-age</b> ratio was below three standard deviations (SD) from the median of the WHO reference population in terms of <b>height-for-age,</b> was severely stunted or short for his/her age. A child, whose <b>height-for-age</b> ratio was between three and two SD below the median of the WHO reference population in terms of <b>height-for-age,</b> was mildly stunted. The exposure to BMF smoke variable was ascertained indirectly by type of fuel used for cooking. The exposure was a three category variable of cleaner fuel, outdoor BMF and indoor BMF use. All statistical analysis was done in STATA version 10. The relationship between BMF use and stunting or anaemia was determined using multinomial logistic regression analyses, whilst adjusting for potential confounding factors, identified in previous research.

40|$|Background : Prolonged {{breast-feeding}} {{is frequently}} associated with malnutrition in less-developed countries, even after adjustment for socioeconomic confounders. However, in rural Senegal, breast-feeding is prolonged {{when the child}} is stunted. Objective : We aimed to test whether the lower <b>height-for-age</b> of children weaned late is explained by their height before weaning or whether prolonged breast-feeding is associated with impaired growth. Design : A cohort of 443 Senegalese children recruited from dispensaries at 2 mo of age were visited in their homes at 6 -mo intervals when they were approximately 1. 5 to 3 y of age. Weight, length, arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness were measured. Six-month increments were analyzed in relation to breast-feeding (breast-fed compared with weaned children or breast-feeding duration), season, and maternal housing with use of multiple linear regression. Results : The mean duration of breast-feeding was 243. 1 mo (quartiles 1 and 3 : 21. 9 and 26. 4). <b>Height-for-age</b> {{at the age of}} 3 y was negatively associated with age at weaning (P is less than 0. 01), but this association disappeared after adjustment for <b>height-for-age</b> in infancy. Length increments were significantly greater in both the second and third years of life in children breast-fed for longer durations (P is less than 0. 05) and tended to be greater in breast-fed than in weaned children in the second year of life (P = 0. 05). In the third year of life, breast-fed children had greater length increments than did weaned children in the subgroup with poor housing (P for interaction is less than 0. 05). Growth in weight did not differ significantly according to breast-feeding. Conclusion : Prolonged breast-feeding improved linear growth, and the negative relation between <b>height-for-age</b> and duration of breast-feeding was due to reverse causality.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of prenatal care for improving birth and subsequent child outcomes in low-income countries remains controversial, {{with much of}} the evidence to date coming from high-income countries and focused on early-life outcomes. We examined associations between prenatal care visits and birth weight, <b>height-for-age</b> at 24 months and attained schooling in four low- and middle-income countries. We pooled data from prospective birth-cohort studies from Brazil, Guatemala, Philippines and South Africa. We created a prenatal care utilization index based on the number and timing of prenatal visits. Associations were examined between this index and birth weight, <b>height-for-age</b> at 24 months, and highest attained schooling grade until adulthood. Among 7203 individuals in the analysis, 68. 9 % (Philippines) to 96. 7 % (South Africa) had at least one prenatal care visit, with most having at least four visits. Over 40 % of Brazilians and Guatemalans had their first prenatal visit in the first trimester, but fewer Filipinos (13. 9 %) and South Africans (19. 8 %) did so. Prenatal care utilization was not significantly associated with birth weight (p> 0. 05 in pooled data). Each unit increase in the prenatal care utilization index was associated with 0. 09 (95 % CI 0. 04 to 0. 15) higher <b>height-for-age</b> z-score at 24 months and with 0. 26 (95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 35) higher schooling grades attained. Although there was some heterogeneity and greater imprecision across sites, the results were qualitatively similar among the four different populations. While not related to birth weight, prenatal care utilization was associated with important outcomes later in life, specifically higher <b>height-for-age</b> at 24 months and higher attained school grades. These results suggest the relevance of prenatal care visits for human capital outcomes important over the lifecycle...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Malnutrition {{is known}} to be {{responsible}} for mortality especially in hospitalized children. Since there is a controversy regarding the criteria used to define malnutrition worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended using z-scores and has reported that the WHO child growth standards have worldwide validity. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalized pediatric patients and compare the Neyzi growth standards used in Turkey with the WHO standards. Patients and Methods: Weight-for-age, weight-for-height, and <b>height-for-age</b> were calculated separately in patients under five years old using the national Neyzi standards and the WHO 2006 standards. The weight-for-age- and <b>height-for-age</b> z-scores were also calculated, and malnutrition was defined as <- 2 SD. Results: Among the 100 patients included in the study, 62 were male, and the mean age was 15. 9 ± 16. 2 months. Twelve percent of the patients were classified as acute malnutrition, 13 % were classified as chronic malnutrition, and 11 % were underweight. The calculated mean weight-for-age and <b>height-for-age</b> z-scores were significantly different between the two growth standards (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Although WHO has reported that the new WHO growth standards are applicable in all countries, there was a discrepancy between the WHO- and country-specific growth charts, and this presents a major problem for the evaluation of malnutrition.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that energy-protein malnutrition {{is associated with}} impaired growth and development of facial bones. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the association between nutritional status and reduced space for dental eruption (crowding) in permanent dentition. A cross-sectional study with probabilistic sampling design was used. We evaluated 2, 060 students aged 12 to 15 years enrolled in schools in the northeast of Brazil. Crowding was defined according to World Health Organization (WHO) as misalignment of teeth due to lack of space for them to erupt in the correct position. Nutritional status was evaluated by means of body mass index and <b>height-for-age,</b> using the WHO’s reference curves. Parents and adolescents responded to a questionnaire about demographic, socioeconomic, biological and behavioral characteristics. The associations were estimated by odds ratio (OR) in multivariate logistic regression analysis (alpha = 0. 05). Confounding and effect-modification were taken into account. An association between low <b>height-for-age</b> (z-score < – 1 SD) and crowding was only observed in adolescents with a prolonged history of mouth breathing (OR = 3. 1). No association was observed between underweight and crowding. Malnutrition is related to crowding in permanent dentition among mouth-breathing adolescents. Policy actions aimed at reducing low <b>height-for-age</b> and unhealthy oral habits are strongly recommended. However, further studies are needed to increase the consistency of these findings and improve understanding of the subject...|$|E
40|$|The author {{investigates the}} extent and {{determinants}} of poor child health and nutrition in rural Guatemala, as reflected in attained height. Exploiting a rich data set on relevant social, economic, ethnic, and geographic characteristics, he estimates {{the role played by}} exogeneous individual, household, and community covariates in shaping differentials in children's height. Then he addresses empirical questions ignored in previous anthropometric research, such as the distribution of child stunting across communities and the magnitude of intra-family correlation of <b>height-for-age</b> outcomes, before and after controlling for observed covariates. The author estimates are guided by the economic model of the family and the proximate determinants framework. The author fits multilevel models to hierarchically clustered data to control for family and community heterogeneity. His results confirm findings from previous research, suggesting that poor child growth outcomes in Guatemala are the result of widespread poverty. He finds that <b>height-for-age</b> differentials between children of latino mothers and children of indigenous mothers who do not speak Spanish are larger among children living in communities with better health care facilities. Estimates derived from multilevel models reveal much clustering of child <b>height-for-age</b> outcomes within families and communities. The models account for most of the community-level variation in child growth patterns, but explain only half of the overall intra-family correlation.
