50|$|Solidago gigantea is a North American {{plant species}} in the {{sunflower}} family. Its common names include tall goldenrod and <b>giant</b> <b>goldenrod,</b> in reference to its height of up to 2 m tall, rather large for the genus, smooth goldenrod and late goldenrod. It is a widespread species known from most of non-arctic North America east of the Rocky Mountains.

5000|$|Since {{its debut}} in 1995, Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold's paper, [...] "Evolution of {{increased}} competitive ability in invasive nonindigenous plants: a hypothesis" [...] has been met {{with varying degrees of}} enthusiasm. The paper has been cited in over 368 articles in scientific journals, including review articles, tests of the hypothesis using different model species, and expansions and reformulations of the hypothesis. Among the model species on which the hypothesis has been evaluated most recently (in its original form) are Solidago gigantea (<b>giant</b> <b>goldenrod),</b> Sapium sebiferum (Chinese Tallow), and Lepidium draba (whitetop). Of these three model species, the success and behavior of Sapium sebifurum agreed most closely with the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, according to the researches conducting the study. In its study, the success and behavior of Solidago gigantea was only partially explained by the EICA hypothesis, according to its researchers. Lepidium draba did not seem to follow any of the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, as the researchers of the study understood them.|$|E

40|$|The Bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{invasive}} plant species. Following invasive plant species were mapped in the South Bohemian region of Třeboň: Canadian goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), <b>Giant</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago gigantea), Bohemian knotweed (Reynoutria x bohemica), Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), Sakhalin knotweed (Reynoutria sachalinensis) and Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera). The goal of this thesis was to map the above-mentioned species in one part of Stropnice Site of Community Importance and its surroundings. Furthermore, the thesis also aimed to record the most frequently colonized biotopes according to the invaded locations. The results show that Canadian goldenrod colonized seventeen locations and therefore {{it is one of the}} most invasive species. Next, Himalayan balsam was found in seven locations and Japanese knotweed in five locations. Last, Bohemian knotweed and <b>giant</b> <b>goldenrod</b> each colonized only one location. In this area, such species most often invade biotopes affected by people and locations near water resources. The plants also grow mostly in wet localities...|$|E
40|$|Vegetation {{management}} {{often involves}} shredding {{to dispose of}} cut plant material or to destroy the vegetation itself. In the case of invasive plants, this can represent an environmental risk if the shredded material exhibits vegetative regeneration capacities. We tested the effect of shredding on aboveground and below-ground vegetative material of five ornamental widespread invaders in Western Europe {{that are likely to}} be managed by cutting and shredding techniques: Buddleja davidii (butterfly bush, Scrophulariaceae), Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed, Polygonaceae), Spiraea x billardii He´rincq (Billard’s bridewort, Rosaceae), Solidago gigantea (<b>giant</b> <b>goldenrod,</b> Asteraceae), and Rhus typhina L. (staghorn sumac, Anacardiaceae). We looked at signs of vegetative regeneration and biomass production, and analyzed the data with respect to the season of plant cutting (spring vs summer), the type of plant material (aboveground vs below-ground), and the shredding treatment (shredded vs control). All species were capable of vegetative regeneration, especially the belowground material. We found differences among species, but the regeneration potential was generally still present after shredding despite a reduction of growth rates. Although it should not be excluded in all cases (e. g., destruction of <b>giant</b> <b>goldenrod</b> and staghorn sumac aboveground material), the use of a shredder to destroy woody alien plant material cannot be considered as a general management option without significant environmental risk.

40|$|International audienceSuccessful {{invasive}} plant eradication is rare, {{because the}} methods used target the adult stage, not {{taking into account the}} development capacity of a large seedbank. Heating by microwave was considered, because it offers a means to quickly reach the temperature required for loss of seed viability and inhibition of germination. Previous results were not encouraging, because homogeneous and deep-wave penetration was not achieved, and the various parameters that can affect treatment effectiveness were incompletely addressed. This study aimed to determine, under experimental conditions, the best microwave treatment to inhibit invasive species seed germination in terms of power (2, 4, 6 kW) and duration (2, 4, 8 min) of treatments and depending on soil moisture (10 %, 13 %, 20 %, 30 %) and seed burial depth (2, 12 cm). Three invasive species were tested: Bohemian knotweed, <b>giant</b> <b>goldenrod,</b> and jimsonweed. The most effective treatments required relatively high power and duration (2 kW 8 min, 4 kW 4 min, 6 kW 2 min, and 6 kW 4 min; 4 kW 8 min and 6 kW 8 min were not tested for technical reasons), and their effectiveness diminished with increasing soil moisture with germination percentage between 0 % and 2 % for the lowest soil moisture, 0 % and 56 % for intermediate soil moisture, and 27 % and 68 % in control treatments. For the highest soil moisture, only 2 kW 8 min and 4 kW 4 min reduced germination percentage between 2 % and 19 %. Occasionally, germination of seeds located at the 12 -cm depth was more strongly affected. <b>Giant</b> <b>goldenrod</b> seeds were the most sensitive, probably due to their small size. Results are promising and justify further experiments before developing a field microwave device to treat large volumes of soil infested by invasive seed efficiently and with reasonable energy requirements. Other types of soil, in terms of texture and organic matter content, should be tested in future experiments, because these factors influence soil water content and, consequently, microwave heating...|$|E
40|$|The {{invasion}} {{of plants and}} animals species are considered as one of the main danger for diversity of natural ecosystems worldwide.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the issue of {{invasive}} plant species around the Stropnice Special Area of Conservation located in the region of Třeboň. The aim of this thesis was to map following invasive plant species: Canadian goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), <b>Giant</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago gigantea), Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), Sakhalin knotweed (Reynoutria sachalinensis), Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) and Giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum). The locations of the above-mentioned species were mapped using GPS. The data were then digitized and map outputs were created using the ArcGIS 10. 2. 2 program. These outputs identified the expansion of the invasive plant species. The results showed that giant hogweed is not located in the mapped area, but the other mapped invasive plant species were found there. These species most often invaded the biotope of mesic Arrhenatherum meadows (T 1. 1), followed by tall-sedge beds (M 1. 7) and anthropogenic areas with sporadic vegetation outside human settlements (X 6). The problem of invasive plant species can be solved by their removal and by educating the general public about the risks these plants pose...|$|E
40|$|In {{the region}} of Dietikon-Spreitenbach-Heitersberg (Limmat Valley), {{invasive}} neophytes were analyzed and measures for dealing were proposed. For this purpose populations of invasive neophytes and phe- nomenologically defined habitats were mapped at a scale 1 : 10 000 in 2007. The map shows a strong concentration of invasive neophytes {{in the areas of}} settlement. 12 species that occur in the study area are from the Black List, 3 from the Watch List. The following plant species are the most widely spread in the study area and appear dominant in one third of the habitats: Butterfly Bush, <b>Giant</b> <b>Goldenrod</b> and Himalayan Blackberry. Typical spreading sources of inva- sive plant species are residential areas. The spreading itself occurs mainly along rivers or traffic ways. The comparison between the Limmat Valley and the Upper Rhine/Domleschg Valley shows that there occur nearly the same species. But their occurrence is smaller in the Grisons Alps. The sources of expansions and the ways of proliferation are the same. Areas with prior need for action are proposed because of evaluations, additional collecting of vegetation data that show the impact of Japanese Knotweed on biodiversity and a priority list...|$|E
40|$|In this Master's thesis {{we studied}} whether the {{extracts}} {{of the three}} goldenrod (Solidago) species have antifungal activity. Since the common goldenrod (S. virgaurea) is indigenous, {{and the other two}} – Canadian goldenrod (S. canadensis) and <b>giant</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (S. gigantea) are invasive alien species, we tested the differences in antifungal activity according to their origin and used plant material (leafs, inflorescence) and way of preparing extracts (aqueous, organic – 96 % ethanol). Fungi used in the study were: Alternaria alternata, Alternaria infectoria, Aspergillus flavus, Aureobasidium pullulans, Botrytis cynerea, Epicoccum nigrum, Fusarium poae and Penicillium palitans. We selected these species because of their negative effects on plants grown for food. After one week we measured the area of fungal mycelium and calculated the growth percentage according to the control. We found out that inhibition of fungal growth was similar when aqueous and organic extracts were applied. Also leaf extract caused similar effects as inflorescence extracts. According to the sensitivity to the extracts, the fungi followed the order: F. poae being the most sensitive, than E. nigurm, A. alternata, C. botrytis, A. pullulans, A. infectoria and P. palitans as the least sensitive. The differences in efficiency of the extracts of the leaf and inflorescence extracts of three goldenrod species were not significant...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{performs}} numerous functions, {{which allow}} us to produce food and feed and provide us with clean freshwater. These functions rely on the high diversity of organisms residing in soils. Within the high complexity of the soil food web, nematodes, worm-shaped animals belonging to the phylum Nematoda, are an informative group for assessing {{the status of a}} soil-dwelling community due to their ubiquity, abundance and trophic diversity. Although nematodes also possess several other assets favourable for a biological indicator of soil ecosystems (e. g. easy extractability, differential sensitivities to disturbances, ecological interpretability), their microscopic identification demands a considerable amount of expertise and time because of their relatively conserved morphology. Hence, the use of a molecular method for the identification and quantification of nematode assemblages has the potential to lift practical limitations and allows for more intensive sampling schemes. The aim of the research described in this thesis was to assess the suitability of molecular taxon-specific assays, developed {{on the basis of a}} phylum-wide molecular framework of 2, 400 full-length small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences, for the monitoring of nematode assemblages in field experiments. The method was applied to monitor the impact of different types of disturbances on the soil food web, i. e. agricultural practices, invasive plant species and the effects of genetically modified crop (potato). The second chapter of this thesis presents the background of the molecular method and the results of its first field application. It demonstrates the suitability of this method for use in extensive field experiments and the results of this study reveal distinct seasonal fluctuations between nematode genera classified to belong to the same feeding type group. A distinct response of nematode genera within trophic groups – taxonomically diverse groups of nematodes having the nature of their main food source as a common denominator – was also observed in the study described in Chapter 3. In this chapter, a study was conducted to investigate the impact of an invasive plant species called <b>Giant</b> <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago gigantea, native to North America) on the plant community as well as on different trophic levels of the soil food web. In addition to monitoring the nematode community, pH and fungal biomass were measured in plots invaded or uninvaded by <b>Giant</b> <b>goldenrod</b> in two contrasting habitats. The results revealed that, in addition to outcompeting native plant species, this invader also reduced pH and increased fungal biomass in the soil of both habitats. Based on the results concerning the nematode community, the impact on the soil food web seemed to be selective since the local increase of fungal biomass appeared to benefit only one fungivorous nematode lineage of the three present in the field. This suggests that invasion by <b>Giant</b> <b>goldenrod</b> only stimulates one part of the fungal community. Contrary to the preceding chapters, the effects of different disturbances on the nematode community were studied in an arable setting in chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 4 describes a field experiment in which the impact of biofumigation, a pest control measure, on the nematode community was assessed. Biofumigation is considered as an alternative for the use of synthetic fumigants and entails the incorporation of mulched brassicaceous plant material, which, upon de-compartmentalisation, releases general biocides called isothiocyanates. In our experiment, these compounds as well as their precursors could not be related to the effects observed for the nematode community. Therefore, changes in nematode assemblages are more likely to be related to the intense mechanical disturbance and green manure – the addition of a large quantity of fresh plant material to the topsoil – rather than the release of isothiocyanates from the plant material Chapter 5 presents a field experiment in which the possible belowground side effects of a waxy starch GM potato, a genetically modified plant blocked in its amylose biosynthesis, were investigated. The nematode community was monitored during the growing season of this GM variety, its parental line and four other conventional potato cultivars in two experimental fields. Although we observed clear effects of location and time, no GM-related effects were observed on the nematode community. Our results, in line with previous studies concerning the microbial community, indicate there are no observable, non-transient effects related to this particular GM trait on the soil food web during the growing season. Overall, the results presented in this thesis demonstrate that, first of all, the developed molecular approach is suitable as a tool for the quantitative monitoring of nematode assemblages in field experiments, and, secondly, how a molecular monitoring method based on nematode taxon-specific DNA motifs can be exploited to get new insights into the ecology of terrestrial nematodes and – more in general – into the ecological functioning of this obscure, highly biodiverse and poorly understood habitat below our feet...|$|E
40|$|Apart from {{relatively}} well-studied aboveground effects, invasive {{plant species}} will also impact the soil food web. So far, most {{research has been}} focusing on primary decomposers, while studies on effects at higher trophic levels are relatively scarce. <b>Giant</b> <b>goldenrod</b> Solidago gigantea, native to North America, is a widespread and common invasive species in most European countries. We investigated its impact on plant communities and on multiple trophic levels of the soil food web in two contrasting habitats: riparian zones and semi-natural grasslands. In 30 pairs of invaded and uninvaded plots, floristic composition, pH, fungal biomass and the densities of 11 nematode taxa were determined by using a quantitative PCR-based method. In the two habitats, the invader outcompeted both rare and dominant plant species. Belowground, S. gigantea invasion reduced pH, increased overall fungal biomass {{as well as the}} density of a single lineage of fungivorous nematodes, the family Aphelenchoididae. The densities of two other, phylogenetically distinct lineages of fungivorous nematodes, Aphelenchidae and Diphtherophoridae, were unaffected by the local increase in fungal biomass. Apparently this plant species induces a local asymmetric boost of the fungal community, and only Aphelenchoididae were able to benefit from this invader-induced change. The alternative explanation - the results are explained by a subtle, S. gigantea - induced 0. 1 - 0. 2 units decrease of pH - seems unlikely, as pH optima for nematode taxa are relatively broad. Thus, apart from readily observable aboveground effects, the invasive plant species S. gigantea affects fungal biomass as well as a specific part of the fungivorous nematode community in a soil type-independent manner.
