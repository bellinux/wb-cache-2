40|$|Thirty pilots flew three {{simulated}} landing approaches {{under conditions}} of low, medium, and high workload. Workload conditions were created by varying time pressure and external communications requirements. Our interest was in how the pilots strategically managed or adapted to the <b>increasing</b> <b>workload.</b> We independently assessed the pilot's ranking of the priority of different discrete tasks during the approach and landing. Pilots were found to sacrifice some aspects of primary flight control as <b>workload</b> <b>increased.</b> For discrete tasks, <b>increasing</b> <b>workload</b> <b>increased</b> {{the amount of time}} in performing the high priority tasks, decreased the time in performing those of lowest priority, and did not affect duration of performance episodes or optimality of scheduling of tasks of any priority level. Individual differences analysis revealed that high-performing subjects scheduled discrete tasks earlier in the flight and shifted more often between different activities...|$|R
5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an <b>increased</b> <b>workload</b> as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
5|$|Polyakov {{underwent}} medical assessments before, during, {{and after}} the flight. He also underwent two follow-up examinations six months after returning to Earth. When researchers compared {{the results of these}} medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no impairments of cognitive functions, Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of <b>increased</b> <b>workload</b> during the first few weeks of spaceflight and return to Earth. However, Polyakov's mood stabilized to pre-flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth. In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as manned missions to Mars.|$|E

25|$|Expectancy {{theory has}} been shown to have useful {{applications}} in designing a reward system. If policies are consistently, clearly and fairly implemented, then the instrumentality would be high. If the rewards are substantial enough to be meaningful to an employee, then the valence would be also considered high. A precursor to motivation is that the employee finds the reward(s) attractive. In some instances, the reward or outcome might inadvertently be unattractive, such as <b>increased</b> <b>workload</b> or demanding travel that may come with a promotion. In such an instance, the valence might be lower for individuals who feel work–life balance is important, for example.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to changing regulations, {{changes in the}} industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and OCC. Offices have been closed, supervisory regions have been merged, staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut. The remaining regulators face an increased burden with <b>increased</b> <b>workload</b> and more banks per regulator. While banks struggle {{to keep up with}} the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators, less time spent with each institution, and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks, potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States.|$|E
25|$|Regina Ip {{stated that}} the {{government}} would have to allocate more resources to deal with the <b>increased</b> <b>workload</b> resulting from right of abode applications by FDHs. Since Lam's earlier ruling in favour of Vallejos in late September, there had been a definite {{rise in the number of}} FDHs applying for permanent residence, from just one or two such cases per month in the past, to an average of sixteen in August and September 2011, and over 20 applications on 25 October alone. In total, the Immigration Department stated that it had received 148 permanent residence applications from FDHs in October. A total of roughly 900 foreign domestic helpers made applications for permanent residence from October 2011 to late March 2012 when the Court of Appeal overturned Lam's ruling.|$|E

500|$|Amelia Bullmore, {{who plays}} Gill Murray, wrote three episodes; Wainwright {{had wanted to}} get other writers {{involved}} in the process. For her first episode as writer, [...] "Bullmore was given a brief– that everything must be from Scott and Bailey's point of view– and she was given a murder". Though {{she had been a}} professional writer for almost two decades, Scott and Bailey marked the first instance of Bullmore writing and starring in the same production. Due to Wainwright's <b>increased</b> <b>workload</b> on her other drama series' Last Tango in Halifax and Happy Valley, Bullmore was chosen to be the head writer for Scott and Baileys fourth series in 2014. She was joined on the writing team by Lee Warburton, who wrote two episodes of the fourth series. and returned to write Scott & Bailey's fifth series in 2015.|$|E

2500|$|The NTSB further {{determined}} that the pilot's faulty mental model of the airplane's automation logic led to his inadvertent deactivation of automatic airspeed control. In addition, Asiana's automation policy emphasized the full use of all automation and did not encourage manual flight during line operations. The flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's vertical profile during the initial approach led to a period of <b>increased</b> <b>workload</b> that reduced the pilot monitoring's awareness of the pilot flying's actions {{around the time of}} the unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control. Insufficient flight crew monitoring of airspeed indications during the approach likely resulted from expectancy, <b>increased</b> <b>workload,</b> fatigue, and automation reliance. [...] Lack of compliance with standard operating procedures and crew resource management were cited as additional factors.|$|E

40|$|Home care in The Netherlands {{is facing}} a trend towards <b>increasing</b> <b>workloads,</b> giving it {{the image of an}} unattractive sector to work in. To deal with <b>increasing</b> <b>workloads</b> and their effects, many {{solutions}} have been developed, including the concept of team or group work. This paper will address the possibilities, conditions and effects involved in the implementation of group work in home care as a means of improving the quality of working life (QWL) in this sector. To this end I have studied QWL in three jobs in two organizations for home care, one of which implemented group work. This comparison concludes that jobs in the team-based organization are more complete and challenging, bringing more job decision latitude, but also higher work pressure...|$|R

2500|$|Recognising the {{difficulties}} in bringing LGBT films to market, Finch created the first market for distributors, sales agents, and independent LBGT film producers. Although the plans were disrupted by his death, the market first appeared at the festival in 1995 {{through the efforts of}} his co-director Jenni Olson, who had joined him to help manage the <b>increased</b> <b>workload</b> in 1993. The growth demanded an organizational step change but this increased expenses out of proportion with revenue: the festival and Frameline were soon in financial difficulties. Tess Martin was brought in as Executive Director in October 1994 and promptly reduced the payroll {{and the size of the}} forthcoming festival. [...] Finch had found the financial strictures in the face of continuing growth both frustrating and depressing. This external confirmation of his concerns exacerbated his mood.|$|E

2500|$|Complicating the {{situation}} was the <b>increased</b> <b>workload</b> on the captain. Normally, one pilot flies the airplane while another crew member handles radio communications. On PLF 101, the responsibility for communication usually rests with the navigator. At Smolensk however {{the situation}} was different. As the airport is not usually open for international flights and is not ICAO certified, the air traffic controllers {{were not required to}} be fluent in English, the ICAO standard language for ATC communication. As such, all communication between Smolensk ATC and PLF 101 was carried out in Russian. Russian law requires international flights landing at military airports to have a Russian [...] "Leaderman" [...] (navigator; Russian lidirovshik) on board the flight, who is then responsible for all ATC communication, which is done in Russian. In the middle of March, as part of their request for permission to conduct the flight, Poland asked for [...] "Leaderman" [...] services and the latest airport data for Smolensk. At the end of March, after apparently receiving no reply to their first request, Poland tendered a second request for permission to fly, but did not request [...] "Leaderman" [...] services. As lieutenant colonel, spokesman for the Air Force Command said: [...] "The Russian side has not confirmed readiness to secure the flight leader". According to the Final Report, Russia did offer [...] "Leaderman" [...] services, but Poland refused, stating their crew had satisfactory knowledge of Russian and could conduct the flight without the Leaderman. In reality, the captain was {{the only member of the}} crew who could speak adequate Russian. Therefore, upon being handed off (transferred) to Smolensk ATC, the captain took over communication duties from the navigator. In a normal situation, this would dictate that the first officer be the pilot actually flying the airplane, but as the weather was bad the captain, as the most experienced member of the crew, elected to fly the airplane as well. Therefore, the captain was performing two tasks simultaneously which are usually split up, increasing his workload and requiring him to divide his attention.|$|E
