5|$|As {{luck would}} <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> the local king {{arrived on the}} scene, and proved to be Olaf's alleged {{grandfather}} Myrkjartan. Olaf remained with Myrkjartan for a time, and the king, according to Laxdaela Saga, even offered to make Olaf his heir. Olaf, however, ultimately returned to Norway, afraid of provoking Myrkjartan's sons. Olaf returned {{to the court of}} King Harald, where he was greatly honored by both the king and his mother Gunnhild.|$|E
5|$|During the war the {{chancellery}} was destroyed, {{except for}} the exterior walls, by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin in 1945. It was eventually dismantled by the Soviets and rumors <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> that the remains {{have been used for}} other building projects like the Humboldt University, Mohrenstraße metro station or Soviet war memorials in Berlin, but none of these are true.|$|E

5|$|For team matches, bots {{are used}} to fill {{the roles of the}} player's teammates. The player can choose the bots' skill level or <b>have</b> <b>it</b> {{automatically}} adjust to the player's performance. Bots can be further customized by changing attributes such as names, appearance, and weapon preferences. In team matches, players can give orders to bots on their team. The PC version supports multiplayer mode over the internet or a local area network (the original Unreal was mainly a single-player game).|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really <b>have</b> <b>it</b> like they probably think I <b>have</b> <b>it.</b> I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him <b>have</b> <b>it.</b> Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, the Naval Academy {{received}} accreditation as {{an approved}} technological institution.

5|$|In 1985, the Smithsonian Institution {{commissioned}} {{aeronautical engineer}} Paul MacCready {{to build a}} half-scale working model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi. The replica was launched with a ground-based winch. It flew several times in 1986 and was filmed {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's IMAX film On the Wing. However, the model was not anatomically correct and embodied vertical and horizontal tail stabilizers that pterosaurs did not <b>have.</b> <b>It</b> also had a longer tail, changing the weight distribution.|$|E
50|$|Aristotelian Essentialism is {{concerned}} with properties which Marcus defines {{in the context of}} a modal framework. One proposal is that a property is essential if something <b>has</b> <b>it,</b> not everything <b>has</b> <b>it,</b> if something <b>has</b> <b>it</b> then <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> necessarily, and it is not wholly individuating e.g. a natural kind property. It is otherwise claimed by Quine and others that modal logic or semantics is committed to essentialist truths. Marcus argues informally that there are interpretations of some modal systems in which all essentialist claims are false. Terence Parsons later formally proved this result.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Burns learns of the school's oil and {{immediately}} decides {{that he must}} <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> even as Smithers voices his disapproval.
