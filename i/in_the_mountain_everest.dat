"Certainly, my dear Mrs. Drewett," [...] {{the dear}} girl said, {{as she stood}} {{supporting}} the old lady, who leaned on her arm, gazing at the glorious sunset, [...] "the Highlands have nothing to equal this!

60|$|The {{court had}} been in {{mourning}} for Don Alonso of Portugal, the husband of the Princess Royal of Castile, who had died a bridegroom; but on this joyous occasion the trappings of woe were cast aside, and all appeared in their gayest and most magnificent apparel. At an hour that was still early, the Grand Cardinal moved forward, ascending {{what is called the}} Hill of Martyrs, {{at the head of a}} strong body of troops, with a view to take possession. While making the ascent, a party of Moorish cavaliers was met; and at their head rode one <b>in</b> whom, by <b>the</b> dignity of his mien and the anguish of his countenance, it was easy to recognize the mental suffering of Boabdil, or Abdallah, the deposed monarch. The cardinal pointed out the position occupied by Ferdinand, who, with that admixture of piety and worldly policy which were so closely interwoven in his character, had refused to enter within the walls of the conquered city, until the symbol of Christ had superseded the banners of Mahomet; and who had taken his station at some distance from the gates, with a purpose and display of humility that were suited to the particular fanaticism of the period. As the interview that occurred has often been related, and twice quite recently by distinguished writers of our own country, it is unnecessary to dwell on it here. Abdallah next sought the presence of the purer-minded and gentle Isabella, where his reception, with less affection of the character, had more of the real charity and compassion of the Christian; when he went his way toward that pass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> that has <b>ever</b> since been celebrated as the point where he took his last view of the palaces and towers of his fathers, from which it has obtained the poetical and touching name of El Ultimo Suspiro Del Moro.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> highest <b>mountain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park {{is called}} the Xiema Peak (literally [...] "Tying Horse Mountain"), {{dates back to the}} era of the Tang dynasty.

On <b>the</b> Chilcoot and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Delta we slew, {{from the}} passes to the sea, {{wherever}} {{the white men}} camped or broke their trails. It be true, they died, but it was without worth. Ever did they come over <b>the</b> <b>mountains,</b> <b>ever</b> did they grow and grow, while we, being old, became less and less. I remember, by the Caribou Crossing, the camp of a white man. He was a very little white man, {{and three of the}} old men came upon him in his sleep. And the next day I came upon the four of them. The white man alone still breathed, and there was breath in him to curse me once and well before he died.|$|R
50|$|In 1936 Nanda Devi became <b>the</b> highest <b>mountain</b> <b>ever</b> to {{have been}} climbed when a jointly-led American expedition, which {{eventually}} passed the leadership to Bill Tilman, reached its 7816 m summit by climbing the southeast ridge. Tilman had chosen Charlie Houston and Noel Odell for the summit attempt but mischance led to Tilman rather than Houston partnering Odell to the top.|$|R

6000|$|It was a {{complete}} victory. We are inclined {{to think that the}} Mountain-men called it a [...] "glorious" [...] victory.

Dana's sketch of Mount Shasta was engraved in 1849 for publication <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American Journal of Science and Arts (which Silliman had founded in 1818), along with a lengthy article based on Dana's 1841 geological notes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> article he described <b>in</b> scientific terms <b>the</b> rocks, minerals, and geology of the Shasta region.

500|$|In winter, North Carolina is {{somewhat}} protected by <b>the</b> Appalachian <b>Mountains</b> to <b>the</b> west. Cold fronts from Canada are typically reduced <b>in</b> intensity by <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> However, occasionally cold air can {{move from the}} north or northeast, east of <b>the</b> Appalachian <b>Mountains,</b> from Arctic high pressure systems that settle over the Northeastern or New England states. Other polar and Arctic outbreaks can cross <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and force temperatures to drop to about [...] in central North Carolina. Still, temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit are extremely rare outside of <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> <b>The</b> coldest <b>ever</b> recorded temperature in North Carolina was [...] on January 21, 1985, at Mount Mitchell. The winter temperatures on the coast are milder due to the warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream. The average ocean temperature in Southport in January is still {{higher than the average}} ocean temperature in Maine during July. Snow is common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains,</b> although many ski resorts use snowmaking equipment to make sure there is always snow on their land.
