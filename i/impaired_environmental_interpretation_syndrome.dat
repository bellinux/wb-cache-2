Qualitative, exploratory and descriptive research, with 30 institutionalized senior citizens from Rio Grande, RS, Brazil. During data collection five instruments were applied from March to July 2009. One presents the elderly’s profile; aspects that favored the falls; nursing diagnoses; proposals for institutional actions to prevent falls. The nursing diagnoses were identified: impaired physical mobility, decreased ability to transfer, shower self-care deficit, dressing self-care deficit, <b>impaired</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>syndrome,</b> chronic confusion, impaired memory; syndrome of stress due to changes; risk of falls, risk of trauma. Through the identification of nursing diagnoses it was possible to make a proposal for institutional actions aimed at preventing falls in the elderly who reside in long-stay institutions. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> is {{the bridge}} and link between tourists, {{environmental}} resources and resources management agency. Personal interpretation or non-personal interpretation can encourage tourists' understanding of natural ecology and cultural resources can {{improve the quality of}} recreation and inspire tourists set up eco-environmental protection beliefs and actions, which play a decisive {{role in the development of}} scenic spots and the conservation of eco-environment. The paper, researching the connotation of environmental interpretation,reviews and presents the literature on <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> of internal and external, finds that the <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> should have characteristics of recreation,education, message. The benefits of interpretation can be summarized into four categories; recreation, spomotion, economic and management objective, Evaluation of the effectiveness of environment interpretation focuses on the knowledge, attitude and the actual behaviors of visitors, the behavioral change and measurement. Studies on tourists' behavior of using <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> are the weak points as well as the key issue which is to be addressed. Based on the analysis and summary of the study results both at home and abroad, the paper provides some enlightenment for the management of scenic region,which should improve the <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> system...|$|R

50|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> is a {{particular}} format for the communication of relevant information. It “involves translating the technical language of a natural science or related field into terms and ideas that people who aren’t scientists can readily understand. And it involves {{doing it in a}} way that’s entertaining and interesting to these people” (Ham 3). <b>Environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> is pleasurable (to engage an audience in the topic and inspire them to learn more about it), relevant (meaningful and personal to the audience so that they have an intrinsic reason {{to learn more about the}} topic), organized (easy to follow and structured so that main points are likely to be remembered) and thematic (the information is related to a specific, repetitious message) (Ham 8-28). While environmental journalism is not derived from <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation,</b> it can employ interpretive techniques to explain difficult concepts to its audience.|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in visitor demand creates {{more and more}} pressures on visitor management, especially in protected areas like national parks. <b>Environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> is regarded as an effective soft management strategy that aims to educate visitors in national parks. However, no study about visitor satisfaction with <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> using Importance-Performance analysis has been undertaken in national parks in general and national parks of Vietnam in particular. This study attempts {{to fill in the}} research gaps in the literature by examining visitor satisfaction with services for <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> in Cat Tien National Park of Vietnam using Importance-Performance Analysis. The research aims are: (1) To identify current interpretive services in Cat Tien National Park; (2) To explore visitor use of these services for environmental interpretation; (3) To investigate visitor satisfaction with these services using Importance-Performance Analysis and (4) To analyze similarities and differences in visitor satisfaction with services according to motivation-based segments and market-based segments. Secondary research, a site visit and three semi-structured interviews were first implemented to provide information background for the study. Next, the main survey for both international and domestic visitors was conducted at the entry point of Cat Tien National Park. Data from 237 pre-visit and post-visit questionnaires collected in four weeks was then analyzed with relevant statistical analyses. Market-based segmentation and motivation-based segmentation were also implemented to analyze the data. The findings show that site interpreters were the most important service provider for <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> in Cat Tien National Park. Site interpreters, interpretive signs and staff at the museum are very important and very satisfying services for <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Displays at the museum need to be redesigned to meet visitor satisfaction. Moreover, videos at the rescue centre need to improve the performance to ensure domestic visitor satisfaction. With regard to twelve roles of site interpreters, the role for a comfortable pace of the trip, the role for a good group organisation, the communicative roles and the roles of an environmental interpreter are important and satisfying roles according to visitors. The performance of the instrumental role for visitor safety and the social role for a positive group environment need to be enhanced to meet visitor satisfaction. Also, two roles of a motivator of responsible behaviour need to be enhanced to meet the satisfaction of “Passive visitors” and “Active learners”, as well as international visitors. The study highlights the need for continuing research on visitor satisfaction with <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> using importance performance analysis and visitor segmentation. Some management implications were given for future development of services for <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> in Cat Tien National Park...|$|R
40|$|Wildlife {{ecotourism}} {{is becoming}} a well-established industry due to its ability to contribute to local economies and the growing tourist demand for opportunities to observe endangered or rare species. Wildlife ecotourism is also recognized {{for its ability to}} provide free choice-learning settings for visitors, through the use of <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> programs. The process of <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> is a communication phenomenon thought to hold the potential to contribute to conservation by educating and raising awareness amongst tourists about environmental issues. Using a qualitative phenomenological research design, this research examined the <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> programs of great white shark ecotourism operators in Gansbaai, South Africa, from the perspective of tourists. Findings indicated that while tourists did not primarily choose to embark on shark tourism excursions {{to learn more about the}} species, many participants became slightly more informed about great whites and the surrounding environment after their experience. It was also found that most participants did not experience nervousness or fear when in the water with great whites, but instead felt an emotional connection and appreciation for the animal, causing a shift towards pro-conservation attitudes...|$|R

40|$|This work endorses {{the need}} for <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> and {{education}} because of {{the threat to the}} natural environment {{as a result of the}} lack of understanding and knowledge of environmental issues. The writer's personal perspective on the environment is described. There is a strong advocacy for the use of the fine arts in interpretative programmes as a way of reaching audiences, and particularly those individuals who learn through an abstract/symbolic modality. The use of drama is explored as one of the fine arts media through which all visitors to natural sites can gain information, experience personal growth, and develop an understanding of their relationship to the natural world. A study was conducted in which a questionnaire, which posed 36 questions related to common practices and experiences, and the use of drama as a medium in <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> and education, was used in interviewing representatives of 18 organisations, 9 in Canada and 9 in Australia, involved in environmental education. The responses to the questionnaire are summarised and discussed. Of those interviewed, most of the Australian and Canadian respondents were aware of the need to use a variety of techniques when developing programmes, had used drama in their programmes, had all attended programmes where drama was used as the interpretative medium, and were positive about their experiences. More than two thirds of the respondents from Australia and Canada indicated that drama should be given a high priority in <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> and education in the future. Information on two children's eco-drama programmes and two workshops for adults on the use of drama in <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> and education is also included...|$|R

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> {{is widely}} assumed to {{influence}} visitor behaviour and reduce impacts on a natural site. Assumptions {{of cause and}} effect are difficult to attribute and relatively few studies evaluate the effects of interpretation on visitor behaviours. We reviewed a sample of the interpretation evaluation literature available through online databases. We looked at the internal validity of evaluative studies and compared different interpretive approaches in terms of outcomes. Findings indicate an evaluative emphasis on quantifying knowledge gain and attitude change with few studies extending to measurement of behavioural change. The large number of possible variables and small number of completed studies prevent substantive conclusions on the role of interpretation in promoting more sustainable visitor behaviour. Further research is needed in terms of robust evaluative studies to facilitate development of a clear understanding of interpretive programs' influence on visitor behaviour. It is problematic to assess <b>environmental</b> <b>interpretation</b> as a visitor management tool until further such evaluative studies are performed...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{or not it}} pays to be {{green or}} under what {{circumstances}} is an important ongoing debate among economic researchers.
