50|$|Component {{costs that}} are {{affected}} by blade count are primarily for materials and manufacturing of the turbine rotor and drive train. Generally, the lower the number of blades, the lower the material and manufacturing costs will be. In addition, the lower the number of blades, the higher the rotational speed can be. This is because blade stiffness requirements to avoid interference with the tower limit how thin the blades can be manufactured, but only for upwind machines; deflection of blades in a <b>downwind</b> <b>machine</b> results in increased tower clearance. Fewer blades with higher rotational speeds reduce peak torques in the drive train, resulting in lower gearbox and generator costs.|$|E
40|$|The NWTC (National Wind Technology Center) Variable-Speed Test Bed turbine is a three-bladed, 10 -meter, <b>downwind</b> <b>machine</b> {{that can}} be run in either fixed-speed or variable-speed mode. In the variable-speed mode, the {{generator}} torque is regulated, using a discrete-stepped load bank to maximize the turbine`s power coefficient. At rated power, a second control loop that uses blade pitch to maintain rotor speed essentially as before, i. e., using the load bank to maintain either generator power or (optionally) generator torque. In this paper, the authors will use this turbine to study the effect of variable-speed operation on blade damage. Using time-series data obtained from blade flap and edge strain gauges, the load spectrum for the turbine is developed using rainflow counting techniques. Miner`s rule is then {{used to determine the}} damage rates for variable-speed and fixed-speed operation. The results illustrate that the controller algorithm used with this turbine introduces relatively large load cycles into the blade that significantly reduce its service lifetime, while power production is only marginally increased...|$|E
25|$|Any solid object {{produces}} a wake behind it, leading to fatigue failures, so the turbine is usually positioned upwind of its supporting tower. <b>Downwind</b> <b>machines</b> have been built, because they don't need an additional mechanism for keeping them {{in line with}} the wind. In high winds, the blades can also be allowed to bend which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance. In upwind designs, turbine blades must be made stiff to prevent the blades from being pushed into the tower by high winds. Additionally, the blades are placed a considerable distance in front of the tower and are sometimes tilted forward into the wind a small amount.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of special-purpose airfoils for horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs) began in 1984 as {{a joint effort}} between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), formerly the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI), and Airfoils, Incorporated. Since that time nine airfoil families have been designed for various size rotors using the Eppler Airfoil Design and Analysis Code. A general performance requirement of the new airfoil families is that they exhibit a maximum lift coefficient (cl,max) which is relatively insensitive to roughness effects. The airfoil families {{address the needs of}} stall-regulated, variable-pitch, and variable-rpm wind turbines. For stall-regulated rotors, better peak-power control is achieved through the design of outboard airfoils that restrain the maximum lift coefficient. Restrained maximum lift coefficient allows the use of more swept disc area for a given generator size. Also, for stall-regulated rotors, thicker tip airfoils help accommodate overspeed control devices. For variable-pitch and variable-rpm rotors, outboard airfoils having a high maximum lift coefficient lend themselves to lower blade solidity. Airfoils having greater thickness result in greater blade stiffness and tower clearance. Airfoils of low thickness result in less drag and are better suited for <b>downwind</b> <b>machines.</b> Annual energy improvements from the NREL airfoil families are projected to be 23 % to 35 % for stall- regulate...|$|R
40|$|With the {{remarkable}} rise in interest in variable-speed operation of larger wind turbines, {{it has become}} important for the National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) {{to have access to}} a variable-speed test bed that can be specially instrumented for research. Accordingly, a three-bladed, 10 -meter, <b>downwind,</b> Grumman Windstream <b>machine</b> has been equipped with a set of composite blades and a direct-coupled, permanent-magnet, 20 kilowatt generator. This machine and its associated control system and data collection system are discussed. Several variations of a maximum power control algorithm have been installed on the control computer. To provide a baseline for comparison, several constant speed algorithms have also been installed. The present major effort is devoted to daytime, semi-autonomous data collection...|$|R
40|$|Six {{types of}} aerosol {{samplers}} were evaluated experimentally {{in a test}} chamber with polydisperse fly ash. The Andersen sampler overestimates the mass of small particles due to particle bounce between stages and therefore provides a conservative estimate of respirable particulate mass and thoracic particulate mass. The TSP sampler provides an unbiased estimate of total particulate mass. TSP/CCM provides no information below ESD 2 ????m and therefore underestimates respirable particulate mass. The PM 10 sampler provides a reasonable estimate of the thoracic particulate fraction. The RespiCon sampler provides an unbiased estimate of respirable, thoracic, and inhalable fractions. DustTrak and SidePak monitors provide relative particle concentrations instead of absolute concentrations because {{it could not be}} calibrated for absolute particle concentrations with varying particle shape, composition, and density. Six sampler technologies were used to evaluate airborne dust concentrations released from oilfield pipe rattling operations. The task sampled was the removal of scale deposited on the inner wall of the pipe before it was removed from service in a producing well. The measured mass concentrations of the aerosol samplers show that a Gaussian plume model is applicable to the data of pipe rattling operations for finding an attainment area. It is estimated that workers who remain within 1 m of the machine centerline and directly downwind have an 8 -hour TWA exposure opportunity of (13. 3 ???? 9. 7) mg/m 3 for the Mud Lake pipe scale and (11. 4 ???? 9. 7) mg/m 3 for the Lake Sand pipe scale at 95 % confidence. At distances more than 4 m <b>downwind</b> from the <b>machine</b> centerline, dust concentrations are below the TWA-TLV of 10 mg/m 3 for the worker in both scales. At positions crosswind or upwind from the machine centerline there is no measurable exposure. Available data suggest that the attainment area for the public starts at about 9 m <b>downwind</b> from the <b>machine</b> centerline in both scales, as 24 hour average concentrations at these distances are smaller than the 0. 15 mg/m 3, the NAAQS for unrestricted public access. The PSD of the suspended plume is dominated by particles smaller than ESD 50 ????m...|$|R
