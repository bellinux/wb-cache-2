5|$|I King Æthelstan, {{declare that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> {{that the public}} peace has not been kept to the extent, either of my wishes, or of the {{provisions}} laid down at Grately, and my councillors say that I have suffered this too long.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> {{that many}} of the Greeks believe Pythagoras said all things are {{generated}} from number. The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But he did not say that all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number – on the grounds that order in the primary sense is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to things which are counted.|$|E
25|$|If Xerxes {{chose not}} to rush into a naval encounter, but instead kept his ships close to the shore and either stayed there or moved them towards the Peloponnese, victory would be his. The Greeks can't hold out against him for very long. They will leave for their cities, because they don't have food in store on this island, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned,</b> and when our army will march against the Peloponnese they who have come from there will become worried {{and they will not}} stay here to fight to defend Athens.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{lost two}} hours and a half; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> a fact worth four.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> to call thee Father, Through thy Spirit from on high, ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned,</b> {{whenever}} he praised Ernest in such fashion, to expect disaster.|$|R
500|$|His {{application}} of conventional military ideas to real-world situations enabled his military triumphs, such as {{creative use of}} artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry. He stated later in life: [...] "I have fought sixty battles and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> nothing which I did not know at the beginning. Look at Caesar; he fought the first like the last".|$|E
500|$|Farsari {{expressed}} {{his view of}} photography {{in a letter to}} his sister, writing, [...] "taking pictures is just a mechanical thing." [...] In describing his development as a photographer, he wrote, [...] "I have had no real teachers, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> everything from books. I bought all the necessary equipment and with no help from anyone, I printed, took photographs and so on. Then I taught others." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{see that}} he [...] is clever and {{handsome}} and I, an old man, wish to have him as my adopted son... He need change neither his name nor his surname. I only want him to call me father temporarily so that I can faithfully transmit all the skills <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> {{in my life to}} a single person. Later, when I die, {{all he has to do}} is to bury my old bones in the earth and not allow them to be exposed, and that is all".|$|E
60|$|That was wisdom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taught them; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> {{it myself}} {{years ago from}} my Uncle Podger.|$|R
6000|$|In {{a moment}} it <b>had</b> gone and <b>I</b> was telling them of what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned.</b> They listened till <b>I</b> <b>had</b> finished. Then Anscombe said slowly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The engine screamed. Did {{that mean}} {{she was running}} through? Oh, how <b>I</b> wished <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> the {{interpretation}} of the signals! ...|$|R
500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know I have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E
500|$|In late March, viewers started {{noticing that}} Jennings' voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and {{unhealthy}} during evening newscasts. On April 1, 2005, he anchored World News Tonight {{for the last}} time; his failing health also prevented him from covering the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on World News Tonight {{that he had been}} diagnosed with lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. [...] "As some of you now know, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> {{in the last couple of}} days that I have lung cancer," [...] he said. [...] "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit." [...] Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.|$|E
500|$|Hooper {{made his}} debut as {{a feature film}} {{director}} with the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission drama Red Dust (2004), which stars Hilary Swank, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jamie Bartlett. The film was not widely seen, which Hooper attributed to media coverage of torture during the Iraq War: [...] "When I started making it you could watch the movie with a wonderful sense of 'we'd never do it in our own country…they're the horrible people but it's not us.' By the time the film came out (there were) these revelations that the Americans were torturing, the British were torturing. The film became a lot more uncomfortable for the very audiences {{it was designed to}} target. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> that sadly the theatrical audience does not run to see films that are openly issue led." [...] The premiere of the film in the United Kingdom came on BBC Two in 2005, making it eligible for the BAFTA Television Awards; it was nominated in the Best Single Drama category at the 2006 ceremony.|$|E
60|$|As soon as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> {{to speak}} the {{language}} a little, I became greatly interested in {{the people and the}} system of government.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was given}} me long ago," [...] replied he, with a scornful {{expression}} in his eye, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> to despise all things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, doctor," [...] I {{answered}} politely, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{a better}} way to make my living." [...] In three years <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> a little to control my temper.|$|R
500|$|Žigić played {{regularly}} {{through the}} 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign under {{the management of}} Radomir Antić, contributing three goals and partnering former Red Star teammate Marko Pantelić as Serbia qualified for a major tournament {{for the first time}} as an independent nation. Ahead of the tournament proper, he spoke in positive terms of his development since 2006: [...] "I went to Germany as player with no reputation or real experience to speak of. Tactically, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> a lot and I'm in much better condition, both physically and psychologically. This is my World Cup, I think I can play a lead role and I want to show I'm a player that can do it in big games." [...] After losing to Ghana in the opening group match, Serbia went on to face Germany. Within two minutes of Miroslav Klose's first-half dismissal, Žigić headed a cross down to Milan Jovanović who scored what proved to be the only goal of the game; Lukas Podolski's second-half penalty was saved, and Antić dedicated the victory to the Serbian people. In a game of missed chances against Australia, Serbia lost 2–1 and finished bottom of the group.|$|E
500|$|McEwen faced {{questions}} about the bounced checks he had written on the House bank. Buchert ran campaign commercials citing McEwen's checks, the expenses of his Congressional office, and his campaign finance disclosures, while noting Portman was [...] "the handpicked choice of the downtown money crowd" [...] and was [...] "a registered foreign agent for the biggest Democrat lobbying firm in Washington," [...] labeling Portman and McEwen [...] "Prince Rob and Bouncing Bob." [...] McEwen, who had taken a hard-line on his checks in 1992, relented in the campaign. Martin Gottlieb wrote, [...] "McEwen says now that his problem {{was a form of}} excessive pride. He says he used to 'demand perfection' of himself." [...] McEwen also said, [...] "I felt I could never admit a mistake.... I am very, very sorry. I should have watched it more carefully.... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> a great deal." [...] Les Spaeth, chairman of the Warren County Republican Party and former Warren County Auditor, said, [...] "People very much disliked the check overdraft thing, but I think they don't see it as happening again. I think it's past. He made a mistake and he got caught. But that's overridden by the service he's given, particularly to our county." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1960 Amazing {{began to}} carry Sam Moskowitz's series of author profiles, which {{had begun in}} Fantastic, the sister magazine. The {{following}} month the cover and logo were redesigned. In April 1961, the 35th anniversary of the first issue, Goldsmith ran several reprints, including stories by Ray Bradbury and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Goldsmith had little previous experience with science fiction, and bought what she liked, {{rather than trying to}} conform to a notion of what science fiction should be. The result was the debut of more significant writers in her magazines than anywhere else at that time. She published the first stories of Ursula K. Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, Piers Anthony and Thomas M. Disch, among many others. Award-winning stories published during Goldsmith's editorship include Zelazny's [...] "He Who Shapes", a story about the use of dream therapy to cure phobias. It was serialized in the January and February 1965 issues, and won a Nebula Award, an annual award voted on by science fiction writers. Goldsmith often wrote long, helpful letters to her authors: Zelazny commented in a letter to her that [...] "Most of anything <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> was stimulated by those first sales, and then I learned, and possibly even learned more, from some of the later rejections". Disch and Le Guin have also acknowledged the influence Goldsmith had on their early careers.|$|E
60|$|A {{few moments}} later the cone was jammed {{together}} and thrown upon the floor--a movement, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> to know, that announced that the sitting was ended.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{begin to}} wish that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> in Grey Dick's school," [...] said Hugh. But {{whatever}} she thought, Eve set {{her lips and}} said nothing.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> from Kantos Kan {{the secret}} of opening these gates, and in another moment my twenty great {{fighting}} men stood within the doomed city of Zodanga.|$|R
500|$|Throughout the episode, {{numerous}} {{references are}} made to the jukebox musical Mamma Mia!, in which Jack tells Liz about his possible three fathers, Jack agreeing {{to meet with the}} three men, and Liz saying [...] "And all I'm promising is a madcap musical romp, dot dot dot, fun, dot dot dot, good.... That was on the [...] poster", and finally Jack revealing his kinship to Milton. Liz tells Jack that he should find out who his real father is, explaining [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> anything from my Sims family: When a child doesn't see his father enough he starts to jump up and down, then his mood level will drop until he pees himself." [...] The Sims is a video game in which players create virtual people called [...] "Sims" [...] and places them in houses and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Liz and Pete learn from James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) that Tracy's favorite television show is NCIS, a CBS police drama series revolving around special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), who conduct criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. Later, Liz and Pete sing the song [...] "It Takes Two" [...] by hip-hop duo Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock to see if Tracy is familiar with the song as they have doubts about the age Tracy claims to be.|$|E
500|$|According to Rod Roddewig, a {{contemporary}} of Wilt's, Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer. Every time Chamberlain {{went to bed}} with a different woman, he put a check in his Day-Timer. Over a 10-day period, there were 23 checks in the book, {{which would be a}} rate of 2.3 women per day. Chamberlain divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence. In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity, Chamberlain later emphasized that [...] "the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That's the reason why I was single." [...] In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate {{at the time of his}} escapades, and warned other men who admired him for it, closing with the words: [...] "With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> in my life I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying." [...] Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children. However, in 2015 a man named Aaron Levi came forward claiming to be Chamberlain's son based on non-identifying papers from his adoption and information from his biological mother. Chamberlain's sister refused to provide DNA evidence for testing, so Levi's claim is not conclusive.|$|E
2500|$|... "Versailles, October 12"(...) <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> that we {{have lost}} Montréal and {{consequently}} all of Canada. If you relied on us for this winter's furs, I advise {{you that it is}} with the English that you must deal." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{books and}} {{travelers}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> {{something of the}} little-known land of Kaol, which lies along the equator almost halfway round the planet {{to the east of}} Helium.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood up}} and rushed away in the gray light, {{shouting}} commands as he ran. (<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> by now my surname. I was Jesse Fancher. My father was Captain Fancher).|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] I answered, [...] "but, son, {{there is}} still work {{to do if you}} want to save your wife----" [...] and I told him what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, British {{author and}} {{historian}} Paul Johnson, in endorsing Conquest and Cultures: An International History, said of Sowell: [...] "Thomas Sowell is, in my opinion, the most original and interesting philosopher {{at work in}} America. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> {{a great deal from}} him..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heinlein {{credited}} him {{for being}} his main influence: [...] "I have learned from many writers—from Verne and Wells and Campbell and Sinclair Lewis, et al.—but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> more from you than {{from any of the}} others and perhaps more than for all the others put together …" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{announcement}} of your eminent husband’s death comes a great shock to me. In common {{with all of}} his countrymen, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> to revere him {{as one of the great}} benefactors.... and among the foremost Americans of all generations. He will be mourned and honored by human kind everywhere as one who served it greatly, untiringly and usefully"; ...|$|E
50|$|I'd show them, {{the young}} rascals.... These unlicked cubs {{who thought they}} could out-drink me! Faugh! It was steam beer. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> more {{expensive}} brews. Not for years <b>had</b> <b>I</b> drunk steam beer...|$|R
5000|$|Jimmy Carl Black on Frank Zappa: <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> {{told him}} that I {{appreciated}} his friendship through the years and that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> a lot from him. I really loved Frank like you do a brother.|$|R
60|$|Now I hadn't said {{anything}} about the United States, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> there was no use in wasting breath telling English people <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come from America, so I wasn't surprised at his question, but I couldn't answer it.|$|R
