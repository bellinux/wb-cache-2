5|$|In {{the same}} year that Brønsted and Lowry {{published}} their theory, G. N. Lewis proposed an alternative theory of acid–base reactions. The Lewis theory is based on electronic structure. A Lewis base is defined as a compound that can donate an <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> to a Lewis acid, a compound that can accept an <b>electron</b> <b>pair.</b> Lewis's proposal gives an explanation to the Brønsted–Lowry classification in terms of electronic structure.|$|E
5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Transport of <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> in super-conducting {{junction}} with spatial-temporal {{noise is}} investigated. We {{show that the}} spatial-temporal noise can produce the current of the <b>electron</b> <b>pairs,</b> which stems from a symmetry breaking of the system induced by the correlation of the spatial-temporal noise with the phase difference. It is found {{that there is a}} positive current for the <b>electron</b> <b>pairs,</b> exhibiting a peak with increasing the values of some parameters of the noises. The results provide a theoretical foundation for the further investigation of the super-conducting junction.

50|$|The <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> (or groups if {{multiple}} {{bonds are}} present) {{are assumed to}} lie {{on the surface of}} a sphere centered on the central atom and tend to occupy positions that minimize their mutual repulsions by maximizing the distance between them. The number of <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> (or groups), therefore, determines the overall geometry that they will adopt. For example, when there are two <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> surrounding the central atom, their mutual repulsion is minimal when they lie at opposite poles of the sphere. Therefore, the central atom is predicted to adopt a linear geometry. If there are 3 <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> surrounding the central atom, their repulsion is minimized by placing them at the vertices of an equilateral triangle centered on the atom. Therefore, the predicted geometry is trigonal. Likewise, for 4 <b>electron</b> <b>pairs,</b> the optimal arrangement is tetrahedral.|$|R
50|$|A {{covalent}} bond is a chemical bond {{that involves the}} sharing of <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> between atoms. These <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> are termed shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed {{covalent bond}}ing.|$|R
5|$|From the hydride <b>{{electron}}</b> <b>pair,</b> one electron {{is transferred}} to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The midpoint potential of the NAD/NADH redox pair is −0.32volts, which makes NADH a strong reducing agent. The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD. This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD and NADH forms without being consumed.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{electron}} configuration of darmstadtium is calculated to be 6d87s2, which obeys the Aufbau principle {{and does not}} follow platinum's outer {{electron configuration}} of 5d96s1. This {{is due to the}} relativistic stabilization of the 7s2 <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> over the whole seventh period, so that none of the elements from 104 to 112 are expected to have electron configurations violating the Aufbau principle. The atomic radius of darmstadtium is expected to be around 132pm.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} {{requirement of}} Arrhenius and Brønsted–Lowry was removed by the Lewis definition of acid–base reactions, devised by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1923, {{in the same}} year as Brønsted–Lowry, but it was not elaborated by him until 1938. Instead of defining acid–base reactions in terms of protons or other bonded substances, the Lewis definition defines a base (referred to as a Lewis base) to be a compound that can donate an <b>electron</b> <b>pair,</b> and an acid (a Lewis acid) to be a compound that can receive this <b>electron</b> <b>pair.</b>|$|E

40|$|Within the fermion-spin theory, the {{physical}} {{properties of the}} <b>electron</b> <b>pairing</b> state in the copper oxide materials are discussed. According to the common form of the <b>electron</b> Cooper <b>pair,</b> it is shown {{that there is a}} coexistence of the <b>electron</b> Cooper <b>pair</b> and magnetic short-range correlation, and hence the antiferromagnetic short-range correlation can persist into the superconducting state. Moreover, the mean-field results indicate that the <b>electron</b> <b>pairing</b> state originating from the pure magnetic interaction in the two-dimensional t-J model is the local state, and then does not reveal the true superconducting ground-state.

40|$|We study {{transient}} {{effects in}} a setup, where the quantum dot (QD) is abruptly sandwiched between the metallic and superconducting leads. Focusing on the proximity-induced <b>electron</b> <b>pairing,</b> manifested by the in-gap bound states, we determine characteristic time-scale needed for these quasiparticles to develop. In particular, we derive analytic expressions for (i) charge occupancy of the QD, (ii) amplitude of the induced <b>electron</b> <b>pairing,</b> and (iii) the transient currents under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. We also investigate the correlation effects within the Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov approximation, revealing a {{competition between the}} Coulomb interactions and <b>electron</b> <b>pairing.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of the hydrogen atoms in the molecule is an equilateral triangle. The molecule has a resonance structure which represents a three-centre, two-electron bond. The strength of the bond has been calculated to be around 4.5eV (104kcal/mol). This molecule {{is a good example}} which illustrates the importance of <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> delocalization which contributes to the stability of molecules.|$|E
25|$|As {{predicted}} by the VSEPR model of <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> repulsion, the molecular geometry of alkenes includes bond angles about each carbon in a double bond of about 120°. The angle may vary because of steric strain introduced by nonbonded interactions between functional groups attached to the carbons of the double bond. For example, the C–C–C bond angle in propylene is 123.9°.|$|E
25|$|Although the cubical {{model of}} the atom was soon {{abandoned}} {{in favor of the}} quantum mechanical model based on the Schrödinger equation, and is therefore now principally of historical interest, it represented an important step towards the understanding of the chemical bond. The 1916 article by Lewis also introduced the concept of the <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> in the covalent bond, the octet rule, and the now-called Lewis structure.|$|E
50|$|VSEPR {{theory is}} used to predict the {{arrangement}} of <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> around non-hydrogen atoms in molecules, especially simple and symmetric molecules, where these key, central atoms participate in bonding to two or more other atoms; the geometry of these key atoms and their non-bonding <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> in turn determine the geometry of the larger whole.|$|R

40|$|It can {{be shown}} that the bosonic degree of freedom of the tightly bound on-site <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> could be {{separated}} as Schwinger bosons. This is implemented by projecting the whole Hilbert space into the Hilbert subspace spanned by states of two kinds of Schwinger bosons (to be called binon and vacanon) subject to a constraint that these two kinds of bosonic quasiparticles cannot occupy the same site. We argue that a binon is actually a kind of quantum fluctuations of <b>electron</b> <b>pairs,</b> and a vacanon corresponds to a vacant state. These two bosonic quasiparticles {{may be responsible for}} the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of the system associated with <b>electron</b> <b>pairs.</b> These concepts are also applied to the attractive Hubbard model with strong coupling, showing that it is quite useful. The relevance of the present arguments to the existing theories associated with the BEC of <b>electron</b> <b>pairs</b> is briefly commented. Comment: Revtex, one figur...|$|R
25|$|When one {{reactant}} contains hydrogen atoms, {{a reaction}} {{can take place}} by exchanging protons in acid-base chemistry. In a more general definition, any chemical species capable of binding to electron pairs is called a Lewis acid; conversely any molecule that tends to donate an <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> {{is referred to as}} a Lewis base. As a refinement of acid-base interactions, the HSAB theory takes into account polarizability and size of ions.|$|E
25|$|The ions or {{molecules}} {{surrounding the}} central atom are called ligands. Ligands are generally {{bound to the}} central atom by a coordinate covalent bond (donating electrons from a lone <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> into an empty metal orbital), and {{are said to be}} coordinated to the atom. There are also organic ligands such as alkenes whose pi bonds can coordinate to empty metal orbitals. An example is ethene in the complex known as Zeise's salt, K+−.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} bond {{can be a}} covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen bond or just because of Van der Waals force. Each {{of these kinds of}} bonds is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. In many simple compounds, valence bond theory, the Valence Shell <b>Electron</b> <b>Pair</b> Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.|$|E
40|$|This work {{argues that}} the off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO) is not {{necessary}} for showing superconductivity while the <b>electron</b> <b>pairing</b> around Fermi surface is sufficient for superconductivity.

40|$|We examine {{superconductivity}} in LaAlO$_ 3 $/SrTiO$_ 3 $ {{channels in}} which the channel width transitions from the 1 D to 2 D regime. The superconducting critical current is independent of the channel width and increases approximately linearly {{with the number of}} parallel channels. Signatures of <b>electron</b> <b>pairing</b> outside of the superconducting phase are also independent of channel width. Collectively, these results indicate that <b>electron</b> <b>pairing</b> and superconductivity exist at the boundary of these channels and are absent within the interior region of the channels. The intrinsic 1 D nature of superconductivity at the LaAlO$_ 3 $/SrTiO$_ 3 $ interface imposes strong physical constraints on possible <b>electron</b> <b>pairing</b> mechanisms.

25|$|The ammonia {{molecule}} has a trigonal pyramidal {{shape as}} {{predicted by the}} valence shell <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7°. The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one {{lone pair of electrons}}. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5°, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7°. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a lone <b>electron</b> <b>pair,</b> which makes ammonia a base, a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a dipole moment and makes it polar. The molecule's polarity and, especially, its ability to form hydrogen bonds, makes ammonia highly miscible with water. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are protonated. Temperature and salinity also affect the proportion of NH4+. The latter has the shape of a regular tetrahedron and is isoelectronic with methane.|$|E
25|$|The bond angles in {{aziridine}} {{are approximately}} 60°, {{considerably less than}} the normal hydrocarbon bond angle of 109.5°, which results in angle strain as in the comparable cyclopropane and ethylene oxide molecules. A banana bond model explains bonding in such compounds. Aziridine is less basic than acyclic aliphatic amines, with a pKa of 7.9 for the conjugate acid, due to increased s character of the nitrogen free <b>electron</b> <b>pair.</b> Angle strain in aziridine also increases the barrier to nitrogen inversion. This barrier height permits the isolation of separate invertomers, for example the cis and trans invertomers of N-chloro-2-methylaziridine.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{structures}} for covalent substances, including individual molecules, molecular structures, macromolecular structures and giant covalent structures. Individual molecules have strong bonds that hold the atoms together, but there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules. Such covalent substances are usually gases, for example, HCl, SO2, CO2, and CH4. In molecular structures, there are weak forces of attraction. Such covalent substances are low-boiling-temperature liquids (such as ethanol), and low-melting-temperature solids (such as iodine and solid CO2). Macromolecular structures have large numbers of atoms linked by covalent bonds in chains, including synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and nylon, and biopolymers such as proteins and starch. Network covalent structures (or giant covalent structures) contain large numbers of atoms linked in sheets (such as graphite), or 3-dimensional structures (such as diamond and quartz). These substances have high melting and boiling points, are frequently brittle, and tend to have high electrical resistivity. Elements that have high electronegativity, {{and the ability to}} form three or four <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> bonds, often form such large macromolecular structures.|$|E

Focusing on exclusively that latter, we picture their parent state in form of a quantum vacuum representing an electronic magma in which bound diamagnetic spin-singlet pairs pop {{in and out of}} existence in a Fermi sea of itinerant electrons. The mechanism behind that resides in the structural incompatibility of two stereo-chemical configurations Cu^ IIO_ 4 and Cu^ IIIO_ 4 which compose the CuO_ 2 planes. It leads to spontaneously fluctuating Cu - O - Cu valence bonds which establish a local Feshbach resonance exchange coupling between bound and unbound <b>electron</b> <b>pairs.</b> The coupling, being the only free parameter in this scenario, the hole doping of the parent state is monitored by varying the total number of unpaired and <b>paired</b> <b>electrons,</b> in chemical equilibrium with each other.
