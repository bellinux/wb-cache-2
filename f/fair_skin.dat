5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with <b>fair</b> <b>skin</b> have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|In 1841, Beauregard married Marie Antoinette Laure Villeré (March 22, 1823 – March 21, 1850), the {{daughter}} of Jules Villeré, a sugar cane planter in Plaquemines Parish {{and a member of}} one of the most prominent French Creole families in southern Louisiana. Marie's paternal grandfather was Jacques Villeré, the second governor of Louisiana. She was described as having blue eyes and <b>fair</b> <b>skin.</b> The couple had three children: Judge René Toutant (1843–1910), Henri Toutant (1845–1915), and Laure (1850–1884). Marie died in March 1850, while giving birth to Laure.|$|E
5|$|Pitman was a hapa-haole, of part Hawaiian {{and part}} Caucasian descent. His father {{was white and}} his {{native-born}} mother was also part Caucasian from her own mother, who {{was the daughter of}} Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to colored regiments, but Pitman's <b>fair</b> <b>skin</b> color meant he was able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared. Historians Bob Dye, James L. Haley and others claimed Pitman was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race, but regiment records indicate otherwise.|$|E

25|$|The {{characteristic}} of <b>fair</b> <b>skin,</b> red hair, and freckling {{is associated with}} high amount of pheomelanin, little amounts of eumelanin. This phenotype {{is caused by a}} loss-of-function mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. However, variations in the MC1R gene sequence only have considerable influence on pigmentation in populations where red hair and extremely <b>fair</b> <b>skin</b> is prevalent. The gene variation’s primary effect is to promote eumelanin synthesis at the expense of pheomelanin synthesis, although this contributes to very little variation in skin reflectance between different ethnic groups. Melanocytes from light skin cells cocultured with keratinocytes give rise to a distribution pattern {{characteristic of}} light skin.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, some ladies wear long gloves {{all day in}} summer, {{to protect}} the ideal , or <b>fair</b> <b>skin,</b> which {{represents}} beauty, grace, and high social status (as well as purity and divinity in local religions), thus Japanese ladies avoid any form of tanning.|$|E
25|$|A {{study on}} {{unrelated}} British and Irish individuals demonstrated that over 80% {{of people with}} red hair and/or <b>fair</b> <b>skin</b> that tan poorly have a dysfunctional variant of the MC1R gene. This is compared to less than 20% in people with brown or black hair, and less than 4% in people showing a good tanning response.|$|E

Kaunians face suspicion and prejudice, a separate and vaguely detested minority in many nations. Kaunian names (including those in Valmiera and Jelgava) are drawn from the Baltic languages.|$|E
25|$|The ethnic {{origins of}} the Cumanians are uncertain. The Cumans were {{reported}} to have had blond hair, <b>fair</b> <b>skin</b> and blue eyes (which set them apart from other groups and later puzzled historians), although their anthropological characteristics suggest that their geographical origin might be in Inner-Asia, South-Siberia, or (as Istvan Vassary postulates) east of the large bend of the Yellow River in China. Robert Wolff states that it is conjectured that ethnically the Cumans may not originally have been Turkic.|$|E
25|$|Women's outdoor {{clothing}} styles were {{tailored to}} protect against sun exposure, with full-length sleeves, and sunbonnets and other large hats, headscarves, and parasols shielding the head. Women even {{went as far as}} to put lead-based cosmetics on their skin to artificially whiten their skin tone. However, when not strictly monitored, these cosmetics caused lead poisoning. Light-skinned appearance was achieved in other ways, including the use of arsenic to whiten skin, and lightening powders.

25|$|In India, {{pale skin}} is {{considered}} more attractive, while dark skin {{is associated with}} a lower class status, creating a massive market for skin whitening creams. Fairer skin tones also correlate to higher caste status in the Hindu social order – although the system is not based on skin tone. Actors and actresses in Indian cinema tend to have light skin tones, and Indian cinematographers have used graphics and intense lighting to achieve more desirable skin tones. <b>Fair</b> <b>skin</b> tones are claimed to be an asset in Indian marketing.|$|E

As his fame grew, so did his access to the finer things in life usually denied to African-Americans, even famous ones. It was a power and privilege that he enjoyed, although he was {{very careful not to}} flaunt it with fellow performers of color, and privately, he shared what access that he could with friends and fellow musicians.|$|E

She also attended the Australian Theatre for Young People. Here she took up drama, mime and performing in her teens, finding acting to be a refuge. Owing to her <b>fair</b> <b>skin</b> and naturally red hair, the Australian sun forced the young Kidman to rehearse in halls of the theatre. A regular at the Phillip Street Theatre, she received both encouragement and praise to pursue acting full-time.|$|E

25|$|Criswell's decomposing {{body was}} {{located on the}} side of Interstate 10 on November 25, 1987 in Marana, Pima County, Arizona by a {{homeless}} man. She was estimated to have been between seventeen and twenty-one, at a height of around five feet, three inches and a weight of 138 pounds. It was believed that the victim was white or possibly a Hispanic or Native American female with <b>fair</b> <b>skin.</b> The victim's brown hair was determined to be short and curly. Her eye color could not be determined, as she had begun to decompose after exposure to the hot environment for several days or weeks.|$|E
25|$|During the Mexican Revolution, Álvaro Obregón {{invited a}} group of Canadian German-speaking Mennonites to resettle in Mexico. By the late 1920s, some 7,000 had immigrated to Chihuahua State and Durango State, almost all from Canada, only a few from the U.S. and Russia. Today, Mexico {{accounts}} for about 42% of all Mennonites in Latin America. Mennonites in the country stand out because of their <b>fair</b> <b>skin,</b> hair, and eyes. They are a largely insular community that speaks a form of German and wear traditional clothing. They own their own businesses in various communities in Chihuahua, and account for {{about half of the}} state's farm economy, excelling in cheese production.|$|E
25|$|The MATP gene {{is highly}} conserved, {{especially}} among mammals. The human MATP gene is 82% {{identical to the}} mouse MATP gene, 79% identical to the rat MATP gene, 35% to the zebrafish version, and 30% identical to the fruitfly MATP gene. The gene is best known in humans as being {{the location of a}} mutation that results in human type IV oculocutaneous albinism (OCA4). Type IV oculocutaneous albinism, like other types of human albinism, results in hypopigmentation of the skin and eyes, with increased rates of skin cancer and reduced visual acuity. None of these effects are associated with the equine cream gene. Other human MATP polymorphisms result in normal pigment variations, specifically <b>fair</b> <b>skin,</b> light eyes, and light hair in Caucasian populations.|$|E
