He stated that he believed climate change is occurring, but {{that he did not}} know <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> could be linked to human activity. He was a proponent of increased domestic oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), building more nuclear power plants, and reducing the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. He believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020.|$|E
25|$|Channing {{continued}} {{her return to}} the stage by teaming up again with playwright John Guare. She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is on film, or <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.|$|E

In favour of the former, Andrew Wareham has suggested that in naming his third and most 'throneworthy' son (b. after c. 964) Æthelred, after his great-great-uncle and thus after Ælfgifu's and Æthelweard's ancestor (see genealogy ↑), Edgar may have intended to make a sympathetic gesture by which he stressed their kinship.|$|E

Seeing a beautiful display of a couple thousand dollars’ worth of perfectly good food pulled from dumpsters near them does the trick, though".|$|E
25|$|How much of {{the blame}} for the fall from power in Egypt of the Brotherhood and its allied Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) can be placed on the Brotherhood, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> can be placed on its enemies in the Egyptian bureaucracy, media and {{security}} establishment is disputed. The Mubarak government’s state media portrayed the Brotherhood as secretive and illegal, and numerous TV channels such as OnTv spent much on air time vilifying the organization. But the Brotherhood took a number of controversial steps and also acquiesced to or supported crackdowns by the military during Morsi’s presidency. Before the revolution, the Muslim Brotherhood’s supporters appeared at a protest at Al-Azhar University wearing military-style fatigues, after which the Mubarak government accused the organization of starting an underground militia. When it came to power, the Muslim Brotherhood indeed tried to establish armed groups of supporters and it sought official permission for its members to be armed.|$|E

500|$|The loss {{of much of}} Handel's {{early work}} was first noted by his {{earliest}} biographer, Mainwaring (1760), who refers to [...] "a great quantity of music" [...] from Hamburg and Italy, adding {{that it was not}} known [...] <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> still existed. On departing from Hamburg, Handel spent a further three years in Italy before settling in London, where he remained the dominant composer of Italianate opera for the following thirty years. After his Hamburg initiation, Handel composed more than forty operas, beginning with Rodrigo [...] in 1707, and ending in 1740 with Deidamia. These works were quickly forgotten after Handel's death; modern revivals did not begin until the 1920s. Dean and Knapp believe that, despite the years of relative neglect, Handel's achievements as a composer of opera entitle him to rank alongside Monteverdi, Mozart, Verdi, and Richard Wagner as one of the supreme masters of the genre.|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Particular praise {{was given to}} the album's lyrical content and production quality. Ashleigh Kittle of Allmusic gave it 3 out of 5 stars, comparing the album's overall sound to that of Chapman, Caedmon's Call, and Phillips, Craig & Dean. Andy Argyrakis of CCM Magazine gave the album a B grade, praising the album as a [...] "promising freshman effort" [...] but critiquing its [...] "tendency to occasionally reflect its primary muse a bit too liberally". Belinda S. Ayers of Christian Broadcasting Network praised the album's lyrics and sound. Steve Best of Cross Rhythms gave Casting Crowns ten out of ten squares, saying, [...] "The passion of lead vocalist and youth pastor Hall jumps out of each set of lyrics, while Chapman's distinctive production touch...makes this a must listen album". While praising the album's overall production and lyrical content, Breimeier said the album [...] "too readily recalls the work of its producers, leaving us to wonder <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is really Casting Crowns" [...] – he gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars. The album received positive reviews from Brian Mansfield of USA Today, Robin Parrish of CMCentral.com, and Michael Herman of Christianity Today.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breakaway" [...] {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers, which was shot in two days from July 10 to July 11, 2004. In the video, the younger version of Clarkson was played by Lindsey Krueger. According to Meyers, working with Clarkson was a pleasant experience because he felt she was good and honest, although he had initial doubts in the beginning. He explained, [...] "I was a little worried, her coming off 'American Idol,' it inherently feels manufactured and I didn't know <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was true artistry. But when I met her, she really does have a good, solid vibe. It was an honor to bring some of that out of her." [...] Since the song is autobiographical, Clarkson decided to act {{out most of the}} lyrics in the video. Meyers also realized that the song was featured in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and he struggled {{to find a way to}} address the film-footage in the music video, saying [...] "Since it's a movie tie-in, the idea stems from trying to figure out a new way of addressing the film-footage requirement they put on you, so we came up with the idea of her attending the premiere, which is very much something she will do in real life." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Apollo, Apollo" [...] was generally, {{though not}} universally, well {{received}} among critics. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{wrote that the}} episode was [...] "easily the best 30 Rock of the season, {{and one of the}} series' best episodes to date". He complimented Robert Carlock for [...] " [...] in on the narcissistic worldview" [...] of the Dennis character as it [...] "cranked those qualities up to appropriately absurd 30 Rock proportions." [...] In addition, Sepinwall wrote that all of the elements featured in the episode [...] "all came together". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was similarly laudatory, writing that it was [...] "one of the most explosively hysterical and imaginative half hours of TV this season, and one of this show's best episodes ever". Time contributor James Poniewozik was favorable to the episode, observing that it was [...] "asily the funniest 30 Rock in months, and probably the whole season." [...] Poniewozik said it [...] "nailed it, from the too-many-good-jokes... to the sweet heart at the center of each character." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Adam West's cameo, but noted that Tracy's plot [...] "felt awfully shticky and sitcommy to me." [...] He opined that [...] "Apollo, Apollo" [...] was [...] "pretty great" [...] for Jane Krakowski's Jenna, and in conclusion, Rabin said [...] "I had initially pegged this episode as good but not great and essentially minor {{in the grand scheme of}} things but while writing this post I came to realize just <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> I loved. 30 Rock is pretty great even when it's not that great." [...] Rick Porter, a contributor for Zap2it, said he [...] "loved" [...] the episode, writing that it made [...] "perfect sense" [...] for Kenneth to see everyone around him as muppets, and noted that Liz's commercial was a [...] "strong ending" [...] to the episode.|$|E
