5|$|Whitman also {{influenced}} Bram Stoker, author of Dracula, {{and was the}} model for the character of Dracula. Stoker said in his notes that Dracula represented the quintessential male which, to Stoker, was Whitman, with whom he corresponded until Whitman's death. Other admirers included the Eagle Street College, an <b>informal</b> <b>group</b> established in 1885 at the home of James William Wallace in Eagle Street, Bolton, to read and discuss the poetry of Whitman. The group subsequently became known as the Bolton Whitman Fellowship or Whitmanites. Its members held an annual 'Whitman Day' celebration around the poet's birthday.|$|E

40|$|Formal groups play an {{important}} role in the law. <b>Informal</b> <b>groups</b> largely lie outside it. Should the law be more attentive to <b>informal</b> <b>groups?</b> I argue that this and related questions are appearing more frequently in legal scholarship as a number of computer technologies, which I collect under the heading “social software,” increase the salience of groups. In turn, that salience raises important questions about both the significance and the benefits of <b>informal</b> <b>groups.</b> In this Essay, I argue that there may be important social benefits associated with <b>informal</b> <b>groups,</b> and that the law should move towards a framework for encouraging and recognizing them. I suggest that such a framework be organized along three dimensions, which crudely track dimensions by which groups arise and sustain themselves: regulation of places, of things, and of stories...|$|R
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of space scientist Duncan Steel. The <b>informal</b> <b>group</b> of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon {{became known as the}} Independent Group (IG) and has worked to analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location of Flight 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered by a lack of data publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; the IG also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly available information, to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members have worked on analysing specific elements of Flight 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Verbascum has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, {{with the exception}} of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used <b>informal</b> <b>group</b> in organizing the genus for the florae of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, V.thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. Verbascum subsect. Verbascum depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as Verbascum nigrum (black or dark mullein), Verbascum lychnitis (white mullein) and Verbascum sinuatum (wavy-leaved mullein).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the demand}} for {{constitutional}} liberties was becoming widespread, as was discontent with King Otto's Bavarian administration. The situation escalated in the 3 September 1843 Revolution {{that led to the}} granting of the first Constitution. Makriyannis was one of the three leaders of the movement. He played a crucial part in paving the way for this, having started as early as 1840. After its granting, he also played an important part in the forming of the new cabinet. He was elected as a representative of Athens to the National (Constitutional) Assembly, and headed an <b>informal</b> <b>group</b> of 63 representatives loyal to him. He personally proposed various recommendations {{during the course of the}} proceedings. Soon after the conclusion of the Assembly's work, however, he retired from politics. For his leading role in the creation of the first Greek Constitution, Makriyannis was depicted on the reverse of the Greek 50 drachmas commemorative coin issued in 1994 for the 150th anniversary of this historic document. There are three versions of the coin, each featuring one of the three leaders of the 3 September movement: one features Makriyannis, one colonel Dimitrios Kallergis, and one minister (and later prime minister) Andreas Metaxas.|$|E

40|$|MBA) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2006 The {{existence}} of <b>informal</b> <b>groups</b> in organisations is a reality. People in organisations compete for scarce resources, positions and influence, {{and as a}} result, depend on each other or groups to achieve their objectives. The purpose of each study was to establish the perception organisational members have on <b>informal</b> <b>groups</b> and the influence these groups have on the management of organisations. The problem is whether management or leadership in organisations can effectively perform without being affected and influenced by these informal structures. the main objective s {{of the study was}} to investigate and establish whether <b>informal</b> <b>groups</b> or cabals had a particular influence on the performance of management and how that influence impacted on the managing or leadership of organisations. A case study of four organisations, namely Mafikeng and Naledi municipality, the Quality Assurance Directorate in the Department of Education and the ANC Vryburg branch was conducted. members of these organisations were randomly sampled in line with the purposive sampling strategy for the interview purpose. The empirical investigation revealed that <b>informal</b> <b>groups</b> exist in organisations and they serve their own interest. members of the <b>informal</b> <b>groups</b> are well known and influential people who have a tendency to disregard organisational processes and procedures. The study also showed that <b>informal</b> <b>groups</b> are described as destructive and detrimental to the welfare and operations of the organisation, in that they have the capacity to influence, intimidate and affect management and leadership in the performance of duties. The groups can also dominate and dictate terms to others and are a potential for conflict in the organisation. The researcher recommends that management or leadership in organisations should be proactive by pre-emptying and identifying possible <b>informal</b> <b>groups</b> and deal with them by formulating and creating structures and systems to regulate, manage, control, monitor and evaluate personnel, resources and activities. In addition, management should be transparent, involve all members fairly and channel the energies of <b>informal</b> <b>groups</b> in a positive direction, for continuous capacity building. Management should further on a continuous basis remind members on the latest developments regarding various procedures, code of conduct, the necessity and consequences of non-compliance to organisational policies, principles and procedures.

Later, as the group increased in size, they temporarily called themselves the Golden Gate Banjo Band.

25|$|The club {{began its}} {{existence}} in 1899 as a loose, <b>informal</b> <b>group</b> of football enthusiasts within the Hamburg-St.Pauli Turn-Verein 1862. This {{group did not}} play its first match until 1907, when they faced a similar side assembled from the local Aegir swimming club. Officially established on 15 May 1910, the club played as St. Pauli TV in the Kreisliga Groß-Hamburg (Alsterkreis) until 1924, when a separate football side called St. Pauli was formed. The team played as an undistinguished lower-to-mid table side until making their first appearance in 1934 in the top-flight Gauliga Nordmark, 1 of 16 premier level divisions created in the re-organization of German football that took place under the Third Reich. They were immediately relegated, but returned to the top flight in 1936.
