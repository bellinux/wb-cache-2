In many cases students are able to complete a task within a group before they are able to complete it on their own. He notes that the teacher’s job is to move the child’s mind forward step-by-step (after all, teachers can’t teach complex chemical equations to first-graders). At the same time, teachers can’t teach all children equally; they must determine which students are ready for which lessons. An example is the often-used accelerated reading program in schools. Students are assessed and given a reading level and a range. Books rated below their level are easy to read, while books above their level will challenge the student. Sometimes students are not even allowed to check out books from the school library that are outside of their range. Vygotsky argued that a major shortcoming of standardized tests is that they only measure what students are capable of on their own, not in a group setting where their minds are being pushed by other students.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} {{diagnostic}} tests, questionnaires and interviews to investigate explore teachers’ subject content knowledge (SCK) and pedagogical subject knowledge (PCK). It also explored teachers’ and learners’ misconceptions within {{the topic of}} graphicacy and how teachers’ SCK and PCK possibly affect learner achievement. A small sample of teachers were drawn from the Keiskammahoek region; a deep rural area of the Eastern Cape. These teachers {{were part of the}} Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) Amathole Cluster Schools Project who were registered for a three-year BEd (FET) in-service programme in mathematics education. As part of the programme they studied mathematics 1 and 2 at university level and received quarterly non-formal workshops on teaching mathematics at FET level. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} teachers with insufficient SCK will probably have limited PCK, although the two are not entirely dependent on each other. In cases where teachers’ displayed low levels of SCK and PCK, their learners were more likely to perform poorly and their results often indicated similar misconceptions as displayed by their teachers.

40|$|Abstract OnlyTransition of {{fish farming}} from {{subsistence}} to sustainable semi commercial activity in Uganda Fish farming in Uganda {{has not been}} taken to semi commercial levels by small scale famers due to many challenges. They range from lack of fish seed, quality fish feeds, lack of market, poor infrastructure, unavailability of trained and experienced staff, poor extension methods and poor project planning and implementation. Many interventions have been done to rectify the situation but the gap still exists. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> farmers have, where they are in terms of development, what they can afford, their understanding level, their culture, their environment which will enable you to understand their needs. Dictating to farmers is wrong, instead you have to involve them through their experience, understanding level as they grab new ideas which will determine how they will adapt and develop them within their local setting. Paying particular attention to detail will develop industry by ensuring that intended goals are achieved. Sustainable development and transition of the industry will need appropriate technology which the farmers can afford economically. Sharing of information in a group {{is also a great}} pillar in building sustainable institution as they can improve their operations, brings bargaining power in product marketing as well as sharing costs.

40|$|Carl Friedrich Gauss ’ {{explosion}} {{onto the}} stage of history in 1801 shocked the world. His emergence causes one to ask the old question, where do geniuses come from? Can genius be taught, or must they be born that way? Since {{the mission of the}} LaRouche Youth Movement is to create a society which will produce an increasing density of geniuses, these are important questions. Part of the challenge with Gauss, though, is that he wouldn’t release a scientific work unless it was scrubbed free of evidence of how he made the breakthrough. We have two keys with which to unlock the mind of Gauss, though: Abraham Kästner (1719 - 1800) and Johannes Kepler (1571 - 1630). What follows is a look at the scientific environment at the time Gauss made his famous determination of the orbit of the asteroid Ceres. Of course, that means we’ll have to take an excursion into the murky underworld of the British Royal Society, and how they created their golem, Sir Isaac Newton.

40|$|Language, {{according}} to Wardhaugh (1998 : 1), {{is what the}} members of a particular society speak. The most common thing occurring in society is the varieties of language use. Lim Kiat Boey (1975 : 115) says that register is varieties of a language distinguished by their uses. Everyone can speak different registers in relation to use in various situations. Goshgarian (1992 : 166) states that advertising language is a special language that combines words cleverly and methodically for one purpose: separating people from their money. Thus, the register of advertisements is variation of language use in order to cause the consumers to buy products or services. The study under report analyzed the register of the Indonesian advertisements as displayed in Gadis magazine. The writer would like to find out what lexical features and syntactic features are used as the characteristics of the register of the Indonesian advertisements, specifically facial wash product ads as being advertised in the Indonesian teenage magazine Gadis issued from the 23 April up to the 02 May 2002. The writer analyzed the data, which were Cussons Sweet Seventeen, Biore Anti Acne, and Pond's Anti Bacterial Facial Scrub, under the theories of language and language variation, register, and advertising. The research method used in this study was a qualitative study, which used content analysis method to describe the features of the register of the Indonesian advertisements as displayed in magazine. To collect the data, the writer first chose Gadis, Indonesian teenage magazine, as the source of the data to be analyzed. Then, she chose the ads of facial wash products as the data to be analyzed and noted the three ads on a paper as the data collection. To analyze the lexical features of the advertisements, the writer used William Lutz theory in "With These Words I Can Sell You Anything" as staled in Goshgarian book. And, to analyze the syntactic features of. the advertisements, she used Janet Holmes' Sociolinguistics theory in "An Introduction to Sociolinguistics. " The findings show that the lexical features used in the register of the advertisements are weasel words, unfinished claims, and scientific doublespeaks. These lexical features appear in the ads to be making a claim just what the consumers want, even when they are making no claim at all. Lutz in Goshgarian (1992 : 166) says that to sell products, ad writer will take simple words and twist the words so that they appear to promise just what the consumers want. The syntactic features used are syntactic reduction, syntactic inversion, and heavy noun modification. Using syntactic reduction, that is, subject omission may help the advertisers to invite the consumers to identify themselves wnh the image the advertisers provide. And, using syntactic inversion may help the advertisers to focus on the symbol given to the consumers before introducing the product, while using head noun modification may help the advertisers to heavily modify the focal interest of the product being advertised. These lexical features and syntactic features used as the characteristics of the register of the Indonesian advertisements show that advertising uses a special language that combines words cleverly and methodically. Since advertising language is a special language that combines words cleverly and methodically in order to make people to buy products or services, the writer would like to suggest that consumers should be very careful with advertising language. The consumers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> words really mean, and not what the advertiser wants the consumers to think what the words mean. And for other researchers, the writer would like to suggest that they may analyze the registers in real life or everyday situations, such as register of teachers at classroom, of family or personal relationship, and of neighborly chat...|$|E
40|$|Water {{rights in}} the Sahara Desert? CUE: What {{does it mean to}} have the right to water? Can a {{statement}} on water rights in a constitution achieve anything? And is it meaningful to tell people living in a dry area that they have a right to, for example, 20 litres of water per day, when that water may simply not exist? Virginia Roaf works for WaterAid, an international NGO that aims to improve the access of poor people to water and sanitation. Mike Davison went to the WaterAid office in London, and started by asking how useful she thought it was to give someone a right to water. IN: 		?The question of the right? OUT:		?coming from the local communities? DUR?N	 5 ? 08 BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Virginia Roaf of WaterAid describing some of the key issues raised by the right to water. Transcript Roaf	The question of the right to water is actually not as simple as it sounds. Everyone would agree that the right to water is a good right, it should be in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But you also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> is meant by the right to water, how much water, for whom, how clean is that water going to be? One of the problems of introducing a right to water is setting the standards that go with that. For example they might decide that everyone has a right to 20 litres per person per day. Now that?s obviously not going to be accessible to those people living in villages in rural areas, in the middle of the Sahara Desert for example, because that water is just not accessible; there isn?t that water in the ground. So setting a right to water which has unrealistic standards, you may actually find that the right to water works against the needs of the poorest. Maybe I can explain this best by looking at the right to housing. In South Africa the right to housing is enshrined in the constitution but along with that right to housing is also a long list of standards that are required to be met by that housing. For example they are to do with what the walls are to be made of, what the roof is to be made of. Now that?s obviously unaffordable to the poor who are presently living in shacks and in over crowded conditions. So while it?s a very good thing for the right to housing to be enshrined in the constitution it?s actually not accessible. Davison	So having that right to housing you would say is meaningless? Roaf	I think often it can be meaningless unless you?ve got a government that?s committed to creating the framework or the policies that will actually be able to deliver that housing. Davison	And if we were to carry that on to the example of the village in the Sahara Desert having a right to water, would you regard it in the same way? Roaf	Yes, I would say that rather than setting the standards for the right to water here in Britain or through the UN, I think it?s important to include local communities from poor areas, from developing countries, to ensure that the standards are not inaccessible. Davison	Do you think that if a country adds a statement on the right to water to its constitution, that is likely to help the poorer people who currently don?t have access to water? Roaf	I think that in some cases that will strengthen the poor community?s hand. I think it depends on whether the poor community is well organised and whether they know that they have the right to water. I think however that generally these rights that stand in the constitution become just words on a piece of paper and that they are actually more likely to protect the rights of the middle income people or the people in power than they are to protect the rights of the poor. Davison	Can you explain what you mean by that? Roaf	In Dhaka in Bangladesh a vast proportion of the population live in illegal settlements which they don?t have the rights to. It could be because it?s along the river bank or it?s on pavements or it?s on land which is ear-marked for other purposes, and the government is not willing to give land rights. There?s a community in an area called Tejganj where the people are living on a pavement adjacent to the factory where they are working. And they?ve been living there for maybe 25 or 30 years without access to adequate water and sanitation and the reason for that is the government is not prepared to provide water and sanitation to that community because they lack land title. So what WaterAid has done is actually to work with the community and they have negotiated with the local council, for the local council to give the community a 5 year, a short term lease, which will then allow the municipal supplier to actually provide water and sanitation. Interestingly this has caused a problem with the middle income community which lives opposite. The middle class community has decided that this is a threat to them and persuaded the local municipality to evict the community. Within a week the community were back living in that area because they had nowhere else to go. So they are actually now living in that area again and they are still obviously working in the factory. Davison	So that suggests that often when you get water rights you may well have a situation of conflict between two different groups? Roaf	There?s always going to be conflict over resources which are limited. The water supply in Dhaka probably reaches maybe 25 % of the population but obviously that?s going to be going to the richer parts of that community. And so if the middle class community see that the water is now being accessed by poorer communities obviously there?s going to be less water to go around. Davison	To me water rights would seem to be quite a western concept. To what extent do you think that the communities that WaterAid is working with feel that they have a right to water? Roaf	I think that the people living in Dhaka in Bangladesh through the work that they?ve been doing in accessing their right to land has actually introduced ideas of rights of water to those communities. Davison	So the increasing awareness of water rights has come through increasing awareness and interest in land rights? Roaf	I would say that there is more interest now in water rights, yes, because there?s been interest in land rights and the demand is coming from the local communities. End of tape.
