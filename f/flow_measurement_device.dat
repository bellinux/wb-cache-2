40|$|It is {{a natural}} desire and has been past {{practice}} to evaluate a meter’s accuracy by reviewing its output – a measured rate of flow (Q). Most users test a meter’s Q reading merely by comparing it to the Q from other meters or primary devices, {{much the same way}} drivers compare speedometers by driving next to each other and comparing outputs. The readings in such comparisons will never agree exactly, just as two watches will not. Experience shows that a traditional Q-to-Q comparison seldom results in a clear understanding of source of any meter inaccuracy. The technique presented in this paper offers an easy process for evaluation of meter accuracy without a second <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>device.</b> The first step in evaluating accuracy of any instrument is to evaluate its measurable components, not its output. For a speedometer, measurable components are distance and time; for an open channel flow meter, they are depth and velocity.

40|$|Assessment of {{coronary}} flow reserve (CFR) with a commercially available pressure-sensor-tipped guide wire using {{the principle of}} thermal anemometry could provide major clinical benefits both in determining and in distinguishing between epicardial and microvascular coronary artery disease. In constant-temperature thermal anemometry, the electrical power required to maintain an element at a constant temperature is a measure for the local shear rate. Here, the feasibility of applying this thermoconvection method to a pressure-sensing guide wire is investigated using an in vitro model. A theoretical relation between electrical power and steady shear rate based on boundary layer theory was tested in an experimental set-up. In steady flow, a reproducible relation between electrical power and shear rate was obtained with an overheat temperature of 20 K, which was in good agreement with theory. The relation between shear rate and flow, however, depends on geometry of the artery and position of the guide wire inside the vessel. Although this means that this thermoconvection method is less useful for absolute flow measurements, CFR could be assessed even for unsteady flow using the steady calibration curve with a mean relative difference of (3 ± 5) % compared to CFR derived from the golden standard using an ultrasonic <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E
5000|$|Coriolis {{flowmeters}} {{have been}} around for more than 30 years and are preferred in process industries such as chemical and food and beverage. Coriolis technology offers accuracy and reliability in measuring material flow, and is often hailed as among the best <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> technologies due to direct mass flow, fluid density, temperature, and precise calculated volume flow rates. Coriolis meters do not have any moving parts and provide long term stability, repeatability, and reliability. Because they are direct mass <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>devices,</b> Coriolis meters can handle the widest range of fluids from gases to heavy liquids and are not impacted by viscosity or density changes that often effect velocity based technologies (PD, Turbine, Ultrasonic). With the widest flow range capability of any flow technology, Coriolis can be sized for low pressure drop. This combined with {{the fact that they are}} not flow profile dependent helps eliminate the need for straight runs and flow conditioning which enables custody transfer systems to be designed with minimal pressure drop.|$|R

The paper reviews a number of olfactometers used {{in the last ten}} years both in Australia and overseas.

The paper discusses the instrumental performance of the newly developed olfactometer. DynaScent is a fourth generation olfactometer which uses no <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>device</b> (flowmeter or mass flow controller). The dilution ratios of the DynaScent were calibrated using CO gas and auto calibration feature. The effects of the CO sampling point locations (within the system and above the sniffing cup) could have significant impacts on the dilution ratio.

Furthermore, it was found that the accuracy and instability results were sensitive to the selection of the CO gas range. It is concluded that the calibration of a dynamic olfactometer should be carried out more frequently than once a year.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. The project of engine intake systems involves optimization of parameters such as the pipe length and diameter, junctions, and opening and closing times of the intake and exhaust valves. The correct sizing leads to an increase of the air mass admitted to the cylinders at the desired engine operational conditions. A suitable design of the intake valves in internal combustion engines {{is one of the}} factors that maximize the amount of intake air mass to the cylinder. The parameter that determines the maximization of the mass flow through the valves is called discharge coefficient. The mass flow through the valve is usually described by the compressible flow equation through a restriction, based on a dimensional analysis of an isentropic flow. In the present work, pressure variations caused by the valve movement were investigated experimentally considering an intake system. The objective was to study and compare the dynamic response of the flow through the intake valve. For this purpose, curves of mass flow rate and the dynamic pressure in several locations of the intake system were obtained. The experimental data were obtained from the intake system connected to a cylinder head. The cylinder head was installed in an air supply system consisted by a blower, a <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>device,</b> and a reservoir chamber.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The standard orifice plate is used extensively by the natural gas industry for the metering of fuel. Because of the costs associated with errors in flow measurement inherent {{with the use of a}} standard orifice plate, any improvements upon the existing standard orifice plate design would be desirable. Consequently, a new type of orifice plate has been designed. It is termed the "slotted orifice plate". In the slotted orifice plate, the familiar round hole found in the center of standard orifice plates is replaced with a circular array of radially aligned slots. The objective of this project was to compare the performance of the slotted orifice plate to that of the standard orifice plate in order to determine the extent, if any, to which the slotted orifice plate is superior to the standard orifice plate in flow measurement. This was done by investigating pipe-wall pressure distributions and velocity profiles associated with flow through both the standard plate and the slotted plate for a variety of test cases. By using the pressure distribution and velocity profile data, coefficients of discharge were plotted against the second order radial moments of axial momentum.

40|$|The Utah Water Research Laboratory, in {{conjunction}} with the State of Utah, initiated a study to determine the accuracy {{of a wide variety of}} flow measurement devices in Utah. The project selected 70 sites with flow measurement devices throughout the state. During the assessment each device had its physical condition and flow measurement accuracy documented. Although a wide variety of flow measurement devices were tested, the majority were Parshall flumes. Many of the assessed Parshall flumes were not measuring flow to the specified ± 5 percent design accuracy. Problems in flow measurement were due to issues with the staff gauge location and incorrect entrance geometry. Laboratory tests were conducted at the Utah Water Research Laboratory in an attempt to provide accurate flow measurement from flumes with these issues. The tests simulated incorrect locations for measuring upstream head with different entrance geometries on a 2 -ft-wide Parshall flume. The flume was tested with three different entrance wingwall configurations, eighteen stilling wells, and two point gauges, allowing water surface profiles to be collected throughout the flume. Corrections for incorrect head measurement locations and entrance geometries were created. The objective of this thesis is to provide water users and regulators with the information necessary to help improve open-channel flow measurement accuracies.

Although the meter gate {{is one of}} the most widely used flow measurement devices in California, little investigation has been conducted into the accuracy, limitations, and uncertainties of the rating tables developed over 60 years ago. A meter gate testing facility was constructed at the Cal Poly Irrigation Training and Research Center’s Water Resources Facility capable of testing gates up to 0. 76 m (30 in.). The facility was constructed with gates oriented perpendicular to the supply channel flow to match actual field conditions. Three commonly used gate sizes of 0. 30 m (12 in.), 0. 46 m (18 in.), and 0. 61 m (24 in.) were examined under a variety of upstream head, head loss, and gate opening conditions. Based on the limitations, guidelines are included to assist users and lower the uncertainty of these devices. It was found that meter gates can be an accurate <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>device</b> if installed and operated correctly according to guidelines provided. Limitations were found: upstream head above the top of the turnout pipe must be maintained equivalent to at least half the pipe diameter, and gate openings less than 25 % open can lead to large uncertainties. Using the new rating tables for the three gates examined, the relative uncertainty is less than ± 5 to ± 7 %at the 95 % confidence level with the new rating tables, as compared with less than ± 10 %at a 95 % confidence level using common published tables.

Previous works examined gate discharge ratings under low supply-channel flow velocity perpendicular to the gate discharge pipeline. Here, additional testing was conducted to test the hypothesis that higher velocities in the supply channel would show decreased meter gate flow compared to the low-velocity ratings, but that the published gate calibration method would still yield accurate flow-rate calculations. All testing was conducted in a test facility with the gate discharge pipe set perpendicular to the supply channel, as is common in field installations. Velocities up to 0. 94 m=s (3. 1 ft=s) were tested with the smaller gate and 0. 66 m=s (2. 2 ft=s) for all other gates. These velocities are on the upper end of velocities found in common earthen irrigation canals (and in many lined channels at the farm delivery level) in California. Interestingly, results indicate that the Froude number of the supply-channel flow did not have a statistically significant (at an α-level of 0. 01) influence on gate discharge coefficients. Discharge percent error and uncertainty were examined to compare the discharge coefficients presented in the literature to the discharge measured during the testing at different supply-channel velocities. Under recommended operating conditions, the uncertainty was within ± 5 % without adjustments for supply-channel velocity.

In order to accurately model the priming process in multioutlet siphonic roof drainage systems, a method of estimating the instantaneous flows through the partially-filled individual pipes needs to be developed. This paper describes an experimental method of determining flows in partially-filled pipes using a propeller-type current meter to measure flow velocity and a pressure transducer to measure water depth and {{a modified version of the}} continuity equation.

The DEM analysis underestimates the flow energy measured experimentally, although the agreement is improved when sliding friction is increased. The shear stress of the powder in front of the blade is shown to be roughly constant along the radial direction and increasing as the impeller penetrates the bed, suggesting that a characteristic shear stress can be determined for a powder under a given test condition in the FT 4.

The first system, the Integrated Test Loop (ITL), a near-full-scale plant including the actual equipment to be installed at the Fernald Site, was designed to demonstrate the sluicing operation and confirm the selection of a slurry pump, the optimal sluicing nozzle operation, and the preliminary design material balance. The second system, the Component Test Loop (CTL), was designed to evaluate many of the key individual components of the waste retrieval system over an extended run. The major results of the initial testing performed during July and August 2002 confirmed that the AWR approach to sluicing was feasible. The ITL testing confirmed the following: (1) The selected slurry pump (Hazleton 3 - 20 type SHW) performed well and is suitable for AWR application. However, the pump's motor should be upgraded to a 200 -hp model and be driven by a 150 -hp variable-frequency drive (VFD). A 200 -hp VFD is not much more expensive and would allow the pump to operate at full speed. (2) The best nozzle performance was achieved by using 15 / 16 -in. nozzles operated alternately. This configuration appeared to most effectively mine the surrogate. (3) The Solartron densitometer, which was tested as an alternative mass <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>device,</b> did not operate effectively. Consequently, it is not suitable for application to the AWR process. (4) Initially, the spray ring (operated at approximately 2300 psi) and the nozzles provided by the pump vendor did not perform acceptably. The nozzles were replaced with a more robust model, and the performance was then acceptable. (5) The average solids concentration achieved in the slurry before Bentogrout addition was approximately 16 % by weight. The solids concentration of the slurry after Bentogrout addition ranged from 26 % to approximately 40 %. The slurry pump and ITL system performed well at every concentration. No line plugging or other problems were noted. The results of the CTL runs and later ITL testing are summarized in an appendix to this report...|$|E
40|$|California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo is {{currently}} working towards developing a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) database for future code validation efforts. Cal Poly will complete a wind tunnel test on the Advanced Model for Extreme Lift and Improved Aeroacoustics (AMELIA) in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) 40 foot by 80 foot wind tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center {{in the summer of}} 2011. The development of two measurement techniques is discussed in this work, both with the objective of making measurements on AMELIA for CFD validation. First, the work on the application of the Fringe-Imaging Skin Friction (FISF) technique to AMELIA is discussed. The FISF technique measures the skin friction magnitude and direction by applying oil droplets on a surface, exposing them to flow, measuring their thickness, and correlating their thickness to the local skin friction. The technique has the unique ability to obtain global skin friction measurements. A two foot, nickel plated, blended wing section test article has been manufactured specifically for FISF. The model is illuminated with mercury vapor lamps and imaged with a Canon 50 D with a 546 nm bandpass filter. Various tests are applied to the wing in order to further characterize uncertainties related with the FISF technique. Human repeatability has uncertainties of ± 2. 3 % of fringe spacing and ± 2. 0 ° in skin friction vector direction, while image post processing yields ± 25 % variation in skin friction coefficient. A method for measuring photogrammetry uncertainty is developed. The effect of filter variation and test repeatability was found to be negligible. A validation against a Preston tube was found to have 1. 8 % accuracy. Second, the validation of a micro <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>device</b> is investigated. Anemometers have always had limited capability in making near wall measurements, driving the design of new devices capable of measurements with increased wall proximity. Utilizing a thermocouple boundary layer rake, wall measurements within 0. 0025 inches of the surface have been made. A Cross Correlation Rake (CCR) has the advantage of not requiring calibration but obtaining the same proximity and resolution as the thermocouple boundary layer rake. The flow device utilizes time of flight measurements computed via cross correlation to calculate wall velocity profiles. The CCR was designed to be applied to AMELIA to measure flow velocities above a flap in a transonic flow regime. The validation of the CCR was unsuccessful. Due to the fragile construction of the CCR, only one data point at 0. 10589 inches from the surface was available for validation. The subsonic wind tunnel’s variable frequency drive generated noise which could not be filtered or shielded, requiring the use of a flow bench for validation testing. Since velocity measurements could not be made in the flow bench, a comparison of a fast and slow velocity was made. The CCR was not able to detect {{the difference between the two}} flow velocities. Currently, the CCR cannot be applied on AMELIA due to the unsuccessfully validation of the device...|$|E
40|$|The {{information}} on river flows {{is important for}} a number of reasons including; the construction of hydraulic structures for water management, for equitable distribution of water and {{for a number of}} environmental issues. The <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> are generally installed across the workspace at various locations to get data on river flows but due to a number of technical and accessibility issues, it is not always possible to get continuous data. The amount rainfall in a basin area also contributes towards the river flows and intense rainfall can cause flooding. The extended rainfall maps for the study areas to analyze these extreme events can be of great practical and theoretical interest. This thesis can be generally regarded as a work on catchment hydrology and mapping rainfall extremes to estimate certain hydrological variables that are not only useful for future research but also for practical designing and management issues. We analyzed a number of existing techniques available in literature to extend the hydrological information from gauged basin to ungauged basin; and suggested improvements. The three main frontiers of our work are: Monthly runoff regime regionalization, Flow duration curves (FDCs) regionalization and preparing rainfall hazardous maps. The proposed methods of regionalization for runoff regime and FDCs are tested for the basins located in northern Italy; whereas for rainfall extremes, the procedure is applied to the data points located in northern part of Pakista...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{search for}} optimal segmentations aimed at {{defining}} district metering areas (DMAs) is a challenging and crucial {{issue in the}} analysis, planning and management of water distribution networks (WDNs). The need to select optimal segmentations relates {{to a number of}} important technical reasons. Today, the most relevant one is the leakage management by means of pressure-control zones. This contribution proposes a novel two-steps strategy for DMAs planning. The strategy is based on the segmentation design as first step, to achieve a scenario of optimal locations of “conceptual cuts”; during the second step, these are the candidate for the location of (closed) gate valves or <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> that gave rise to district monitoring areas (DMAs). The segmentation step is performed solving a multi-objective optimization problem (i. e. WDN-oriented modularity maximization versus the number of “conceptual cuts” minimization). The second step accomplishes the real DMAs design by solving a three-objective optimization, i. e. the minimization of the background leakages versus the unsupplied customers demand versus the flow observations. This means that the procedure will search for a set of scenarios having a number of closed gate valves installed at the “conceptual cuts” that do not decrease the WDN hydraulic capacity below that necessary for a sufficient service to customers, while contemporarily reducing the background leakages. A pressure-driven modelling approach is used to predict background leakage reduction and the unsupplied customers demand. The procedure is explained on a benchmark network from literature, the Apulian network...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{continued}} research project for the Utah Water Research Laboratory and the State of Utah, a study of <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> is being conducted throughout the state. Initially the project included only <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> associated with high-risk dams, but has since been broadened to any measurement structure of interest for water users in the state. The physical dimensions, relative elevations, and flow accuracy were documented for each included device. After visiting sixteen sites, {{it was found that}} fourteen of the measuring devices had incorrect geometries. Of these fourteen, thirteen of them were originally Parshall flumes. A large percentage of Parshall flumes with geometry inaccuracies was also found from previous data collected for this project. One reoccurring issue was that the flumes had not been well maintained and had damage to the walls or floor. Some of these Parshall flumes did not have a diverging downstream section and are referred to as Montana flumes. In these cases, a standard Parshall rating curve was used to determine flow where it did not apply. Some of the flumes that were tested operated regularly under submerged conditions, and no adjustments were made for submergence. The objective of this research is to determine if Montana flumes (Parshall flumes without a diverging section) operate similarly to fully constructed Parshall flumes under both free-flow and submerged conditions. Laboratory tests were performed in the Utah Water Research Laboratory to determine corrections for submergence. Flow 3 D, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software program, was also used to develop corrections for a submerged Montana flume. The laboratory results were compared to the computational fluid dynamics results. By using Flow 3 D, a reliable numerical process was developed to determine the flow rate in a submerged Montana flume in an effort to expand the results to other seized flumes...|$|R
