500|$|Lamont {{gave her}} first conference speech as party leader at Scottish Labour's conference in March 2012, setting out {{an agenda for}} {{rebuilding}} confidence in the party. Later the same month she welcomed {{the passing of the}} Scotland Bill, which devolved further powers to Scotland in accordance with the recommendations of the Calman Commission, praising it as [...] "an important development of devolution". In May 2012 she participated in the Scottish Parliament debate paying tribute to Queen Elizabeth as the UK celebrated her Diamond Jubilee. Lamont commented, [...] "60 years in the one job is good going– I've been in this one for just six months and some days, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>it</b> feels like 60 years– so we recognise the scale of the achievement of the particular, very strong woman." [...] Lamont was a guest on the 7 June 2012 edition of the BBC's political debate programme Question Time.|$|E
2500|$|In early December, Moore made a {{preliminary}} offer to Saban's agent Jimmy Sexton to coach at Alabama for $5 million per season {{for seven years}} with a $7 million signing bonus. At that time Saban also stated he had not personally interviewed at Alabama and told his players {{that he was not}} leaving. After West Virginia head coach Rich Rodriguez turned down an offer to coach the Crimson Tide, speculation again focused on Saban. As the rumors persisted that he was prepared to take the Alabama job, on December 21 Saban stated [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> I'm {{not going to be the}} Alabama coach" [...] in an effort to stop the Alabama rumors. After the Dolphins season ended, it was speculated again that Alabama was to offer their head coaching position to Saban. On January 3, 2007, Saban officially resigned from the Dolphins and became the head coach of the Crimson Tide. At that time he signed an eight-year contract worth a guaranteed $32 million to coach Alabama.|$|E
2500|$|Oregon's 52–21 {{defeat of}} Fresno State was Bellotti's 100th win {{as a coach}} at the University of Oregon. [...] Dennis Dixon threw for two {{touchdown}}s and ran for another. [...] Ducks running back Jonathan Stewart ran for 165 yards and scored two touchdowns, one touchdown being part of an 88-yard run. [...] Dixon said [...] "The sky's the limit right now. This offense is really clicking." [...] Although Dixon didn't put up numbers as impressive as he did at Michigan the previous week, he had a solid performance, completing 14 for 20 passes for 139 yards and running for 59 yards. [...] Oregon's mascot was suspended and watched the game, but not from the sidelines. [...] Fresno State's quarterback Tom Brandstater completed 18–32 passes for 219 yards and one touchdown. [...] The loss was Fresno State's second against a ranked team on the road. [...] The previous week the Bulldogs lost 47–45 to Texas A in triple overtime. [...] Fresno State coach Pat Hill said [...] "ow many times do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it?</b> We got dominated in all three phases. We got beat pretty good today. That doesn't happen at Fresno State very often. Today we got beat by a better football team. [...] They took it to us. End of conversation." ...|$|E

Brygel proclaimed that the Ramsay Street crash was [...] "undoubtedly the most dramatic and shocking Neighbours storyline of the year so far". Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap named the storyline [...] "Nightmare on Ramsay Street" [...] and called the crash [...] "terrifying". Jaci Stephen from the Daily Mail wrote [...] "How often do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it?</b> Get some flamin' driving lessons! Is anyone actually capable of taking to the road without ending up in a car wreck?" [...] She believed that it was [...] "just as well" [...] that Rhys injured his hand, forcing him to cancel his trip to Japan as [...] "the plane would probably have crashed." [...] Stephen continued [...] "At least, on Wednesday, Chris's driving licence is suspended. If only the same could happen to the rest of Erinsborough's residents." [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton stated [...] "I really enjoyed Neighbours this past week. The crash and the aftermath made for some really strong storytelling and I'm surprised at how prominent Chris has been in the storyline." [...] Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly branded the crash one of the soap's [...] "biggest episodes of the year".|$|E

In response to such appeal <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>it</b> gave me pain when I learned that Mr. Vallandigham had been arrested (that is, I was pained that there should have seemed to be a necessity for arresting him), and that it will afford me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as I can by any means believe the public safety will not suffer by it.|$|E
