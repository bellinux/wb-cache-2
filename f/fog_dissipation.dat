40|$|A {{detailed}} study {{was made of}} the micrometeorological and microphysical characteristics of eleven valley fogs occurring near Elmira, New York. Observations were made of temperature, dew point, wind speed and direction, dew deposition, vertical wind velocity, and net radiative flux. In fog, visibility was continuously recorded and periodic measurements were made of liquid water content and drop-size distribution. The observations were initiated in late evening and continued until the time of <b>fog</b> <b>dissipation.</b> The vertical distribution of temperature in the lowest 300 meters and cloud nucleus concentration at several heights were measured from an aircraft before fog nucleus concentrations at several heights were measured from an aircraft before fog formation. A numerical model was developed to investigate the life cycle of radiation fogs. The model predicts the temporal evolution of the vertical distributions of temperature, water vapor, and liquid water as determined by the turbulent transfer of heat and moisture. The model includes the nocturnal cooling of the earth's surface, dew formation, fog drop sedimentation, and the absorption of infrared radiation by fog...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSome {{of the more}} recent results of studies involving the use of hygroscopic materials and ionic surfactants as warm fog dispersants are covered in a brief survey of the literature. The fog chamber, equipment and experimental procedures {{used in this study}} are described in detail. Seeding agents utilized during these small-scale fog chamber experiments were limited to the use of hygroscopic materials, surfactants and ethyl alcohol. Results indicated that those hygroscopic agents tested, such as NaCl and glycerin, proved to be relatively effective warm fog dispersants compared to distilled water. The ionic and nonionic surfactants tested dissipated warm fog at approximately the same rate as distilled water and were considered ineffective. Ethyl alcohol appeared to initially increase the fog intensity, and thus, retard <b>fog</b> <b>dissipation.</b> Conductivity/Resistivity measurements and illustrations of the relative droplet sizes and shapes of the various agents used are also contained in this report. The effects on plants of four of the hygroscopic agents are also discussed and illustrated. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Fog-top height (fog thickness) is {{very useful}} {{information}} for aircraft maneuvers, data assimilation/validation of Numerical Weather Prediction models or nowcasting of <b>fog</b> <b>dissipation.</b> This variable is usually difficult to determine, since the fog-layer top cannot be observed from the surface. In some cases, satellite data, ground remote sensing instruments or atmospheric soundings {{are used to}} provide approximations of fog-top height. These instruments are expensive and their data not always available. In this work, two different methods for the estimation of fog-top height from field measurements are evaluated from the statistical analysis of several radiation-fog events at two research facilities. Firstly, surface friction velocity and buoyancy flux are here presented as potential indicators of fog thickness, since a linear correlation between fog thickness and surface turbulence is found at both sites. An operational application of this method can provide a continuous estimation of fog-top height with the deployment of a unique sonic anemometer at surface. Secondly, the fog-top height estimation based on the turbulent homogenisation within well-mixed fog (an adiabatic temperature profile) is evaluated. The latter method provides {{a high percentage of}} correctly-estimated fog-top heights for well-mixed radiation fog, considering the temperature difference between different levels of the fog. However, it is not valid for shallow fog (~ less than 50 m depth), since in this case, the weaker turbulence within the fog is not able to erode the surface-based temperature inversion and to homogenise the fog layer...|$|E

40|$|A field {{investigation}} of the microphysical and micrometeorological features of fogs occurring near Los Angeles and Vandenberg, California was conducted. Observations of wind speed and direction, temperature, dew point, vertical wind velocity, dew deposition, drop-size distribution, liquid water content, and haze and cloud nucleus concentration were obtained. These observations were initiated in late evening prior to fog formation and continued until the time of dissipation in both advection and radiation fogs. Data were also acquired in one valley fog and several dense haze situations. The behavior of these parameters prior to and during fog are discussed in detail. A two-dimensional numerical model was developed to investigate the formation and <b>dissipation</b> of advection <b>fogs</b> {{under the influence of}} horizontal variations in surface temperature. The model predicts the evolution of potential temperature, water vapor content, and liquid water content in a vertical plane as determined by vertical turbulent transfer and horizontal advection.

40|$|International audienceRadiative cooling {{and heating}} impact the liquid water balance of fogs and {{therefore}} {{play an important}} role in determining their persistence or dissipation. We demonstrate that a quantitative analysis of the radiation-driven condensation and evaporation is possible in real-time using ground-based remote sensing observations (cloud radar, ceilometer, microwave radiometer). Seven continental fog events in mid-latitude winter are studied. The longwave (LW) radiative cooling of the fog is able to produce 40 – 70 [*]g[*]m − 2 [*]h − 1 of liquid water by condensation when the fog liquid water path exceeds 30 [*]g [*]m − 2 and there are no clouds above the fog, which corresponds to renewing the fog water in 1 – 2 hours. The variability is related to fog temperature and atmospheric humidity, with warmer fogs below drier atmospheres producing more liquid water. The appearance of a cloud layer above the fog strongly reduces this cooling, especially a low cloud (up to 100 [*]%), thereby perturbing the liquid water balance in the fog, and may therefore induce <b>fog</b> <b>dissipation.</b> Shortwave (SW) radiative heating by absorption by fog droplets is smaller than the LW cooling, but it can contribute significantly, inducing 10 – 15 [*]g[*]m − 2 [*]h − 1 of evaporation in thick fogs at (winter) midday. We also find that the absorption of SW radiation by aerosols in the fog may strongly increase this evaporation rate if a large concentration of absorbing aerosols is present, but that this increase likely is below 30 [*]% in most cases. The absorbed radiation at the surface can reach 40 – 120 [*]W[*]m − 2 during daytime depending on the fog thickness.

We demonstrate that a quantitative analysis of the radiation-driven condensation and evaporation is possible in real time using ground-based remote sensing observations (cloud radar, ceilometer, microwave radiometer). Seven continental fog events in midlatitude winter are studied, and the radiative processes are further explored through sensitivity studies. The longwave (LW) radiative cooling of the fog is able to produce 40 – 70  g m − 2  h − 1 of liquid water by condensation when the fog liquid water path exceeds 30  g m − 2 and there are no clouds above the fog, which corresponds to renewing the fog water in 0. 5 – 2  h. The variability is related to fog temperature and atmospheric humidity, with warmer fog below a drier atmosphere producing more liquid water. The appearance of a cloud layer above the fog strongly reduces the LW cooling relative to a situation with no cloud above; the effect is strongest for a low cloud, when the reduction can reach 100  %. Consequently, the appearance of clouds above will perturb the liquid water balance in the fog and may therefore induce <b>fog</b> <b>dissipation.</b> Shortwave (SW) radiative heating by absorption by fog droplets is smaller than the LW cooling, but it can contribute significantly, inducing 10 – 15  g m − 2  h − 1 of evaporation in thick fog at (winter) midday. The absorption of SW radiation by unactivated aerosols inside the fog is likely less than 30  % of the SW absorption by the water droplets, in most cases. However, the aerosols may contribute more significantly if the air mass contains a high concentration of absorbing aerosols. The absorbed radiation at the surface can reach 40 – 120  W m − 2 during the daytime depending on the fog thickness. As in situ measurements indicate that 20 – 40  % of this energy is transferred to the fog as sensible heat, this surface absorption can contribute significantly to heating and evaporation of the fog, up to 30  g m − 2  h − 1 for thin fog, even without correcting for the typical underestimation of turbulent heat fluxes by the eddy covariance method. Since the radiative processes depend mainly on the profiles of temperature, humidity and clouds, the results of this paper are not site specific and can be generalised to fog under different dynamic conditions and formation mechanisms, and the methodology should be applicable to warmer and moister climates as well. The retrieval of approximate emissivity of clouds above fog from cloud radar should be further developed...|$|E

There are several small fog collecting programmes in countries such as the Dominican Republic, South Africa, Nepal and Peru. Collectors are often made of large, vertically positioned sheets of cloth or other fine-meshed material. The largest project to date, in the arid coastal desert of northern Chile, has provided an average of 11, 000 l of water per day to a village of 330 people. In the Cape Verde Islands, António Advino Sabino is an enthusiastic advocate of fog harvesting amongst the farmers living in mountain areas who are increasingly {{aware of the importance of}} fog collection to supply water for domestic use or watering animals. Four collectors were installed in Santo Antão in the community of Corda at 1200 metres altitude. Sabino has designed various tailor- made fog collectors in combination with sand-filters. Previous collectors used window-screens; in the future, these will be replaced with polypropylene Raschel mesh to enable better efficiency and drainage.

40|$|This {{research}} {{used the}} Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) {{to examine the}} physical processes affecting sea fog development near Kunsan AB. The simulated sea fog event occurred from 30 March to 02 April 2011 and was validated using observations. Model results were analyzed from three perspectives. A trajectory analysis examined {{the evolution of the}} wind, air-sea interaction, and thermodynamic properties of the air column prior to the sea fog formation; a time variation of similar properties at fixed locations investigated the evolution of the fog for the entire life cycle of the fog event; and a vertical cross-section through Kunsan AB revealed the spatial variability and the effects of coastal circulations. Finally, evaluation of a current forecast tool, Fog Stability Index (FSI), was conducted to determine its adequacy. Results from this analysis indicated strong influence of the adjacent sea on the fog development and maintenance at Kunsan AB. For the fog event studied in this research, fog initially developed as nocturnal fog over land, but was later maintained by advection from the sea. Strong cooling within the fog layer was present resulting in significant surface-air temperature difference, likely associated with radiation cooling. Radiative cooling, however, did not result in turbulent mixing due to the shallowness of the fog layer and the stable thermal stratification. The presence of the fog layer along the coast appeared to modify the coastal circulation, which was also an important component in introducing moisture into Kunsan AB for <b>fog</b> formation/maintenance. <b>Dissipation</b> of the <b>fog</b> was dominated by synoptic changes.

40|$|A 6 -year {{climatology}} {{of radiation}} fog has been compiled at two sites: the Research Centre for the Lower Atmosphere (CIBA, Spain) and the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR, The Netherlands). These sites are contrasting {{in terms of}} geographical situation, climate zone, altitude, humidity and soil water availability. Therefore, several climatological differences in <b>fog</b> abundance, onset, <b>dissipation</b> and duration have been quantified between both sites. The more humid site (CESAR) is characterised by relatively short radiation-fog events distributed throughout the year. However, radiation fog at the drier site (CIBA) is more persistent and appears during late-autumn/winter months. In general, its formation requires more time after sunset (~ 2 h more), since further cooling is required to reach saturation. The forecast of these fog events has been evaluated through two different approaches. On the one hand, we extend the statistical method presented by [Menut ~al. (2014) Menut, Mailler, Dupont, Haeffelin and Elias] (M 14). This method uses statistics to define threshold values on key variables for fog formation (pre-fog) and verifies its predictability using observations and numerical model output. We present {{some of the most}} appropriate threshold values for the forecasting of pre-fog periods at both sites, which differ from those presented in M 14 and depend on the optimisation of the hit-rate or the false-alarm rate. Additionally, we also extend M 14 suggesting other variables as potential predictors for fog formation (friction velocity and visibility tendency). Finally, we focus on the fog simulation by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in terms of liquid water content. The WRF model was able to simulate radiation fog when configured with sophisticated physical options and high resolution. However it failed simulating the onset, dissipation and vertical extension of fog (overestimated). The model results were extremely sensitive to the spin-up time...|$|R

Surface observations from Tyndall AFB, Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport, Eglin AFB, Hurlburt Field and Keesler AFB were {{used in conjunction with}} the National Data Buoy CenterÎ±s marine sensors to determine the low-level atmospheric state and the sea surface temperatures during advection sea fog events at the five locations listed above. Forecasting rules of thumb were created and then modified to maximize forecasting effectiveness. The criteria examined include: sea surface temperature, wind speed and direction, air temperature and dewpoint spread, dewpoint and sea surface temperature spread. Data from December 1999 to March 2004 and from December 2005 to March 2006 was used for the Keesler AFB analysis. Data from February 2005 to March 2006 was used for the Tyndall AFB, Eglin AFB, Hurlburt Field and Destin-Fort Walton Beach analysis. Missing sea surface temperatures limited the amount of winter time advection sea fog seasons that could be examined. The averaged results from all of the locations indicate that fog with visibility {{less than or equal to}} three statute miles is present 86. 8 % of the time at the observing site within one hour of meeting the following criteria: sea surface temperature less than or equal to 18. 7 degrees Celsius, onshore surface winds less than or equal to 12 knots or surface winds from any direction if the speed is less than or equal to three knots, surface air temperature minus surface dewpoint is less than or equal to one degrees Celsius and sea surface temperature minus surface dewpoint is less than or equal to 1. 9 degrees Celsius. Results also indicate that fog is present 85. 9 % of the time at the observing site within two hours of meeting the following criteria: sea surface temperature less than or equal to 19. 7 degrees Celsius, onshore surface winds less than or equal to 14 knots or surface winds from any direction if the speed is less than or equal to three knots, surface air temperature minus surface dewpoint is less than or equal to one degrees Celsius and sea surface temperature minus surface dewpoint is less than or equal to 3. 0 degrees Celsius.
