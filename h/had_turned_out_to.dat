The film was shot in Europe, which <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be the more profitable market for Dr. No. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam—who {{went to work on}} Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain—and title designer Maurice Binder, who was replaced by Robert Brownjohn.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding, {{celebrated for}} his {{development}} of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related {{the story of how}} he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.|$|E

25|$|The Mustangs were a surf music instrumental/dance band {{formed in}} Adelaide in 1964 with Mick Bower on rhythm guitar, Rick Morrison on lead guitar, Brian Vaughton on drums and Gavin Webb on bass guitar. Initially they played covers of The Shadows and The Ventures songs. The band's output was profoundly {{influenced}} by the Australian tour of The Beatles in June 1964, which had a particular impact in Adelaide, due to recent migrants from United Kingdom (UK). When The Beatles arrived in Adelaide they were greeted by the largest crowd ever seen in their touring career—estimates as high as 300,000 while Adelaide's population being less than 1 million—one-third of the city <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> greet them (see The Beatles' influence on popular culture). Following The Beatles' chart breakthrough and tour, {{it was obvious that}} the surf/instrumental style was passé. The Mustangs changed style and took on a lead singer, Scottish immigrant, Jim Keays. The Mustangs rehearsed regularly in a shed behind a hotel owned by Vaughton's family. Their original manager, Graham Longley, made a tape recording of a rehearsal; it was rediscovered and released on CD in 2004 as Mustangs to Masters... First Year Apprentices. After Keays joined on lead vocals, the band produced more original songs in the beat style.|$|E

500|$|Amongst the {{architectural}} community, the Exposition in Chicago inspired many in America to champion designing cities {{that had a}} unified design, in which each building had unique features but elegantly complemented its neighbours, typically by being built to a common height: [...] "horizontal visual unity". In {{the aftermath of the}} Exposition, many of these advocates joined with the Beaux-Arts movement to form the City Beautiful movement, proposing low-rise cities with wide boulevards, built in a classical style. These critics condemned New York's skyscrapers, Montgomery Schuyler describing how they had produced a [...] "horribly jagged sierra" [...] of a city skyline and complaining that no modern skyscraper <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be an architectural success. Charles Lamb argued that the skyscraper impinged {{on the rights of the}} rest of the city by destroying the collective appearance of an urban area. Some architects, such as Charles McKim and Stanford White refused to work on such projects altogether.|$|E
500|$|On November 9 the {{expedition}} {{finally reached the}} Saint Lawrence at Pointe-Levi, {{across the river from}} Quebec. [...] Arnold had about 600of his original 1,100men, and the journey <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be 350miles (560km), not the180 that Arnold and Washington had thought it would be. [...] From John Halstead, a New Jersey-born businessman who operated a mill near Pointe-Levi, Arnold learned of the arrest of his courier and the interception of some of his letters. [...] Halstead's mill became the organizing point for the crossing of the Saint Lawrence. [...] Some of Arnold's men purchased canoes from the habitants and the local Saint Francis Indians, and then transported them from the Chaudière to the mill site. [...] The forces crossed the Saint Lawrence on the night of November 13–14 after three days of bad weather, likely crossing the mile-wide river between the positions of HMS Hunter and HMS Lizard, two Royal Navy ships that were guarding the river against such a crossing.|$|E
500|$|The Liberals {{concluded}} {{their campaign}} {{with a large}} rally at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on June 7. Entertainment at the event {{was provided by the}} Leslie Bell singers, and according to Grosart, many in the audience were Tory supporters who <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> hear them. St. Laurent's speech at the rally was interrupted when William Hatton, a 15-year-old boy from Malton, Ontario, climbed onto the platform. Hatton carried a banner reading, [...] "This Can't Be Canada" [...] with a Liberal placard bearing St. Laurent's photograph, and moved to face the Prime Minister. Meisel describes Hatton as an [...] "otherwise politically apathetic boy who... slowly and deliberately tore up a photograph of the Prime Minister as the latter was speaking" [...] and states that Hatton engaged in [...] "intensely provocative behavior". Liberal partisans interceded, and in the ensuing fracas, Hatton fell from the platform, audibly hitting his head on the concrete floor. St. Laurent watched in apparent shock, according to his biographer Dale Tompson, as officials aided the boy and took him from the hall. According to Tompson, the crowd [...] "turned its indignation on the men on the platform" [...] and spent the remainder of the evening wondering about the boy's possible injuries rather than listening to the Prime Minister's speech. Hatton was not seriously injured, but, according to Newman, [...] "the accident added to the image of the Liberal Party as an unrepentant arrogant group of old men, willing to ride roughshod over voters". Grosart later described the incident as [...] "the turning point" [...] of the campaign. Professor Meisel speculated that the Hatton incident might have been part of an organized campaign to annoy St. Laurent out of his pleasant [...] "Uncle Louis" [...] persona, and Grosart later related that Liberal frontbencher Jack Pickersgill always accused him of being behind the boy's actions, but that the incident was [...] "a sheer accident". Hatton's mother described his actions as [...] "ust a schoolboy prank," [...] and a reaction to reading an article about how the art of heckling was dying. According to public relations executive J.G. Johnston in a letter to Diefenbaker on June 10, Hatton had come to the rally with several other boys, including Johnston's son, but had gone off on his own while the other boys paraded with Diefenbaker posters which had been smuggled inside. According to Johnston, Hatton was caught on CBC tape saying to St. Laurent, [...] "I can no longer stand your hypocrisy, Sir" [...] before tearing the St. Laurent poster. Attempts by Johnston to have the Liberal activist who pushed Hatton off the platform arrested failed, according to Johnston, on the ground that the police could find no witnesses.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first big}} {{scientific}} debate about Marx's economic theory, {{starting in the}} 1890s, was the so-called [...] "breakdown controversy", in which the tendency toward falling profitability played an important role. The debate began, when the veteran German socialist leader Eduard Bernstein claimed {{that it was wrong}} to think that [...] "the end was nigh" [...] or that capitalism would collapse through a catastrophic breakdown. He aimed to show with facts and figures that Marx's analysis of the tendencies of capitalism <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be partly wrong. Bernstein believed that Marx's theory therefore had to be revised (this was known as the [...] "revisionist" [...] position). In response, numerous [...] "orthodox" [...] Marxist critics tried to prove that capitalism was necessarily doomed, at least in the long term. This controversy about the fate of the capitalist system still continues.|$|E
2500|$|These {{surprise}} attacks {{left the}} Georgians in confusion {{as to the}} identity of their attackers: the record of one contemporary chronicler indicates that he is unaware {{of the nature of}} the attackers and does not mention them by name. In 1223, when the Mongols had seemingly deferred their plans regarding Georgia, King George IV's sister and successor Queen Rusudan wrote in a letter to Pope Honorius III, that the Georgians had presumed the Mongols were Christians because they fought Muslims, but they <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be pagans. The Mongol invasion also inadvertently altered the fate of the 5th Crusade. Georgia had planned to send its splendid army to open up a second front in the north at the same time as the European crusaders invaded from the west. Because the Mongols annihilated the Georgian army, it could not help, and the European Crusaders spent critical time waiting inactively for their allies who would never come.|$|E

The balloon part of his story was unchanged, except for the detail added by Ozma, that the people probably saw his initials on his balloon and took them as a message {{that he was to}} be their king. She relates that the country was already named Oz (a word which in their language means [...] "great and good"), and that it was typical for the rulers to have names that are variations of Oz (King Pastoria being a notable exception to this rule).|$|E
