5000|$|Another {{effect the}} load {{has on the}} {{indentation}} is the piling-up or sinking-in of the surrounding material. If the metal is work hardened it {{has a tendency to}} pile up and form a [...] "crater". If the metal is annealed it will sink in around the indentation.

40|$|Electron {{backscattered}} diffraction (EBSD) {{has been}} used to determine microtexture in a zirconium alloy tube subject to interrupted pilgering and therefore exhibiting varying amounts of deformation as a function of axial position along the transition between the initial and final size. Texture and <b>hardness</b> <b>measurements</b> have been made {{as a function of the}} distance through the tube wall thickness and along the tube length. Texture results have been compared with co-located <b>hardness</b> <b>measurements.</b> The results show a systematic variation in the deformation texture with changes in Q (the ratio of the reduction in thickness to reduction in diameter). This is consistent with previous observations of the effect of Q on texture evolution in zirconium alloys.

50|$|The {{determination}} of the Rockwell hardness of a material involves {{the application of a}} minor load followed by a major load. The minor load establishes the zero position. The major load is applied, then removed while still maintaining the minor load. The depth of penetration from the zero datum is measured from a dial, on which a harder material gives a higher number. That is, the penetration depth and hardness are inversely proportional. The chief advantage of Rockwell hardness is its ability to display hardness values directly, thus obviating tedious calculations involved in other <b>hardness</b> <b>measurement</b> techniques.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of hardness {{has been and}} continues to be of significant importance to many of the world's manufacturing industries. Conventional hardness testing is the most commonly used method for acceptance testing and production quality control of metals and metallic products. Instrumented indentation {{is one of the few}} techniques available for obtaining various property values for coatings and electronic products in the micrometre and nanometre dimensional scales. For these industries to be successful, it is critical that measurements made by suppliers and customers agree within some practical limits. To help assure this measurement agreement, a traceability chain for <b>hardness</b> <b>measurement</b> traceability from the hardness definition to industry has developed and evolved over the past 100 years, but its development has been complicated. A <b>hardness</b> <b>measurement</b> value not only requires traceability of force, length and time measurements but also requires traceability of the hardness values measured by the hardness machine. These multiple traceability paths are needed because a <b>hardness</b> <b>measurement</b> is affected by other influence parameters that are often difficult to identify, quantify and correct. This paper describes the current situation of <b>hardness</b> <b>measurement</b> traceability that exists for the conventional hardness methods (i. e. Rockwell, Brinell, Vickers and Knoop hardness) and for special-application hardness and indentation methods (i. e. elastomer, dynamic, portables and instrumented indentation) ...|$|E

40|$|Hardness is {{a measure}} of the {{resistance}} of a material to be penetrated and eroded by sharp projections of other materials such as diamond. The process of creating sharp projections on any test surface is known as indentation. <b>Hardness</b> <b>measurement</b> of any material is the result of a complex process of deformation during indentation. The indenter tip geometry, which includes radius of curvature at the tip and tip angle, affects the <b>hardness</b> <b>measurement</b> by influencing the nature of the penetration process on the test surface, because every indenter deforms the specimen surface with a different geometry. The controlled indenter geometry can improve the consistency of <b>hardness</b> <b>measurement.</b> In this paper we report the estimation of two important geometrical parameters, radius of curvature and tip angle of a Rockwell indenter by using a simple method of image processing and compare the results with those obtained with a traceable 3 D optical profiler. Evaluation of uncertainty in measuremts is carried out as per ISO guidelines (ISO-GUM) and a detailed uncertainty budget is presented. The tip angle estimted is 119. 95 degree.
