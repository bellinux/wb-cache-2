40|$|Bacteriophage SN- 1 has a 62 kD protein {{associated}} with the DNA. The protein appears to be covalently linked to the DNA in that chemical agents such as high salt, detergents, reducing agents, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, urea, guanidine <b>hydrochloride,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide, sodium perchlorate, formamide or phenol extraction did not remove the protein from the DNA. A protein of similar size is a minor component of whole phage SN- 1. ^ Polyclonal antibodies to SN- 1 DNA were produced in a Californian rabbit. The antibodies were specific for SN- 1 DNA and mutants of phage SN- 1, and did not react with other DNA or BSA. ^ The insensitivity of phage SN-l indicated that the phage codes for and carries a capsid-born DNA dependant RNA polymerase. ^ Phage SN- 1 DNA is replicated between 60 and 75 minutes after infection. Upon replication the DNA reacts with antibodies against SN- 1 DNA. The identity of the recognized antigenic determinant present on the DNA is unknown. Recognition {{may be due to}} the modified base present in the DNA, the DNA-associated protein, a DNA conformational structure, or to a combination of factors since the antibody is polyclonal. The anti-SN- 1 DNA antibodies also recognize a 62 and 65 kD protein that is present in infected cells. The 65 kD protein appears to be processed into the 62 kD protein. ...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{dissolution}} {{methods have}} been largely used to get insight on trace element association with solid phases. Modern instrumental techniques offer many tools to test the validity of selective dissolution methods and should be systematically used to this end. The association of trace elements with Fe- and Mn-oxides in soil nodules has been studied here by electron probe microanalysis. The results were compared with findings from an earlier study on selective dissolution of the same nodules by hydroxylamine <b>hydrochloride,</b> acidified <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide, and Na-citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite. Electron probe microanalysis results were consistent with previous findings using selective dissolution and showed that P, As and Cr were mainly present in Fe-oxides, while Co was mainly associated with Mn-oxide phases. These results support {{the applicability of the}} studied selective dissolution methods for fractionation of trace elements in soils and sediments containing appreciable amounts of Fe and Mn-oxide phase...|$|R
40|$|A rapid, simple, accurate, and {{sensitive}} visible spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} trace amounts of hydrogen peroxide in acidic buffer medium is reported. The proposed method {{is based on the}} oxidative coupling of Ampyrone with dibenzazepin <b>hydrochloride</b> by <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide in the buffer medium of pH 4. 0 which is catalyzed by ferrous iron. The blue-colored product formed with maximum absorption at 620 nm was found to be stable for 2 h. Beer's law is obeyed for hydrogen peroxide concentration in the range of 0. 03 - 0. 42 mu g ml(- 1). The optimum reaction conditions and other important optical parameters are reported. The molar absorptive and Sandell's sensitivity are found to be 5. 89 x 10 (4) mol(- 1) cm(- 1) and 0. 57 g/cm(2), respectively. The interference due to diverse ions and complexing agents was studied. The method is successfully applied to the determination of hydrogen peroxide in green plants satisfactorily...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{enhanced}} {{room temperature}} phosphorescence (MERTP) of fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I (FITC) was observed {{with the presence}} of proper content of Ag@SiO 2 core-shell (Ag@SiO 2). The FITC-MERTP was quenched by the existing of lysine in the system. Based on this phenomenon, a novel method for determination of lysine had hereby been developed. Under the added amount ratio of FITC to Ag@SiO 2 of 1 : 1. 5, pH of 8. 0, the detection limit for lysine was 0. 270 mu mol/L, the response was linearly proportional to the concentration of lysine in the range of 1. 50 - 90. 5 mu mol/L, the recoveries of standard addition of artificial samples were in the range of 97. 0 %- 108. 0 %, the relative standard deviation was less than 2. 1 % (n= 9). A satisfactory result was obtained when the established method applied to the determination of lysine in compound lysine hydrochloride and zinc gluconate granules and lysine <b>hydrochloride</b> and calcium <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate tablet...|$|R
