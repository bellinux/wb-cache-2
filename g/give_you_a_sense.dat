2500|$|Los Santos, one of {{the three}} central cities in San Andreas, is the main {{location}} of the latest game in the franchise, Grand Theft Auto V. Although GTA San Andreas included three cities separated by open countryside, Grand Theft Auto V included only one city, Los Santos, as well as adjoining countryside and desert areas. By focusing their efforts on one city instead of three, the team were able to produce Los Santos in higher quality and at greater scale. For both games, Los Angeles was used as the model for Los Santos, but the team felt that the ambition of having three cities in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was too great and that the game did not emulate the cities as well as they had hoped.

Therefore, the team disregarded San Andreas as a jumping-off point for Grand Theft Auto V, as they had moved on to a new generation of consoles since the former and wanted to build the city from scratch.

50|$|Radhika Rajamani from Rediff, while {{reviewing}} the film Telugu film Nippu, has given 2/5 stars and {{feels that the}} film is formulaic and hence, disappoints.Producer YVS Chowdary and director Gunasekhar team up with Ravi Teja in Nippu (Fire). One knows {{what to expect from}} a Ravi Teja film, and Gunasekhar provides the usual commercial ingredients for the mass hero. There's enough action, half-a-dozen songs (two of them shot in picturesque Turkey) and a middle-class family set-up. However, instead of scorching the screen, the fire seems to have been extinguished by the director himself with his cold and lacklustre screenplay. Even Ravi Teja's presence doesn't seem to prop up the film that has a wafer-thin story.Director Gunasekhar grapples with this story but loses his grip over it and thereby the audience's attention. Some of the scenes <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of déjà vu. The linkages and the sub-plots do not help the story. Gunasekhar's script is tedious and predictable and there's not much clarity in the writing. Ravi Teja has been doing far too many roles of this kind, and though he does it with ease, he has nothing new to add. Deeksha Seth suits her role and plays her part pretty well. For an actor of his calibre, Rajendra Prasad doesn't have much to do. Sriram is impressive even in a small role. Pradeep Rawat, too, has been enacting similar villainous roles and is quite adept at them. Mukul Dev, Harish Shankar (the director) and even Krishnudu make appearances in roles that are not well fleshed out. Gunasekhar's last film, Varudu, met with a disastrous fate at the box office. So there were expectations for Nippu. Unfortunately, this also follows a formulaic pattern.|$|E
