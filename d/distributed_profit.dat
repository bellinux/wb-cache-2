40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the burgeoning research on inequality and top incomes around the globe by presenting the first available estimates of top income shares and effective income tax rates in contemporary Chile based on analysis of anonymous income tax return microdata. We {{pay special attention to}} business income, which dominates {{at the top of the}} distribution. Our analysis includes not only <b>distributed</b> <b>profits,</b> but also the large proportion of accrued profits retained by firms. Our most conservative estimate of the income share received by the top 1 per cent of Chileans, constructed directly from income reported to the tax agency, is 15 per cent for 2005 and 2009 – the fifth highest share reported in the top incomes literature. When <b>distributed</b> <b>profits</b> are adjusted for widespread under-reporting, we estimate that the top 1 per cent share increases to roughly 22 per cent. When <b>distributed</b> <b>profits</b> are replaced by accrued profits in our definition of income, we obtain 19 per cent as our lowest estimate for the top 1 per cent share. Despite this impressive income concentration, the rich in Chile pay modest effective income tax rates. The top 1 per cent pay an average effective rate of 16 - 17 per cent when <b>distributed</b> <b>profits</b> are not adjusted for under-reporting, and less than 9 per cent when <b>distributed</b> <b>profits</b> are adjusted to national accounts. When we include corporate income tax and accrued profits in our analysis (without adjustments), the effective tax burden for the top 1 per cent is 16 per cent...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the critique of}} the aggregational problem attached to the financial instability hypothesis of Hyman Minsky. The core of this critique {{is based on the}} Kaleckian analytical framework and, in very broad terms, states that the expenditure of firms for investment {{is at the same time}} a source of income for the firms producing capital goods. Hence, even if investments are debt financed, as in Minsky's analysis, the overall level of indebtedness of the firm sector remains unchanged, since the debts of investing firms are balanced by the income of capital goods-producing firms. According to the critics, Minsky incurs a fallacy of composition when he does not take this dynamic into account when applying his micro analysis of investment at the macro level. The aim of this paper is to clarify the consequences of debt-financed investments over the financial structure of an aggregate economy. Starting from the works of Micha 1 Kalecki and Josef Steindl, we developed a stock-flow consistent analysis of a highly simplified economy under four different financial regimes: (1) debt-financed with no <b>distributed</b> <b>profits,</b> (2) debt-financed with <b>distributed</b> <b>profits,</b> (3) internally financed with no <b>distributed</b> <b>profits,</b> and (4) internally financed with <b>distributed</b> <b>profits.</b> The results of our investigation show that debt-financed investments do not lead to a worsening of the financial position of the firm sector only if specific assumptions are taken into account...|$|R

40|$|<b>Distributed</b> <b>profit</b> {{taxation}} is {{the corporate}} taxation regime of Estonia. A theoretical model on dividend policy under this tax system, compared to traditional gross profit taxation, {{is presented in}} this paper. The paper seeks to model a company operating under uncertainty in a binomial framework, including company and investor level taxes and investor’s different consumption levels. Overall, the tax effects on different forms of payout (e. g. dividends or share repurchases) are equal under this tax regime and the main question is deciding upon the timing of dividends. There appear to be different optimums for the timing, depending on the investor’s consumption {{as well as the}} probability of losses, tax rates and interest rates. Though one of the aims of the Estonian corporate tax system is to motivate companies to reinvest the profits earned instead of paying them out, the theoretical analysis in this paper shows that from the investor’s perspective retaining of all profits in the company may not be the optimal payout policy in many cases. The study helps to understand the characteristics of this unusual tax regime and may potentially lead to discussions on introducing a similar system in other jurisdictions or on modifying the corporate taxation principles in Estoniadividend policy, corporate taxation, <b>distributed</b> <b>profit</b> taxation...|$|E

The practice of share holdings by households is considered important from q social perspective as well because it enhances households’ ownership towards their organizations (CBSPOs). Moreover, households with higher share contributions to CBSPOs hold more voting rights (value) in the decision making process. This norm is similar to that of private companies and not to the general cooperative principle where one member one vote is applied regardless of the distribution of share amount among the members (Acharya 2008). However, 75 % of the households included in this study are organized either in informal groups or cooperatives.|$|E

The results give support to the hypothesis that the share of external financing in total capital of Estonian companies is lower in the conditions of DPT in comparison to that under the traditional gross profit taxation system. The DPT system has led companies to distribute lower portions of profit as dividends. The undistributed profits appear to be largely retained as surplus cash, instead of being reinvested into long term productive assets.

40|$|Systems {{of profit}} {{taxation}} are undergoing continuous change and {{are subject to}} numerous studies. This paper estimates {{the effect of the}} corporate tax reform in Estonia in the year 2000, a reform that was unique anywhere. This reform nullified the taxation of retained earnings and retained the corporate income tax only on distributed profits. We estimate the effect of the reform on firms’ capital structure, liquidity, investments and productivity. The effect of the reform is identified by comparing the performance of Estonian firms that were affected with that of firms from Latvia and Lithuania, the two other Baltic states, which are economically fairly similar to Estonia and have correlated business cycles. We use firm-level financial data and the difference in differences and propensity score matching methods for our analysis. The results show that the corporate tax reform has resulted in increased holdings of liquid assets and lower use of debt financing; these results can be seen especially among the smaller companies affected by the liquidity constraints. These developments have contributed positively to firms’ survival during the recent global economic crisis. A positive effect on investment and labour productivity has also been found, especially among companies in the services sector. The results imply that <b>distributed</b> <b>profit</b> taxation schemes may have significant positive effects on economic development and firms’ survival. corporate income tax, capital structure, liquidity, investments, productivity, comparative economic development...|$|E
40|$|Profit-rate {{maximization}} {{leads to}} use fewer factors —including labor— even if profits {{are high and}} it corresponds to shareholders’ financial behavior, by contrast to economic-profit maximization which corresponds to shareholders’ strategic behavior. This is shown in two steps. In part 1, two types of firms are considered: those which maximize their net profit, as assumed classically in the microeconomic theory, and those which maximize their profit rate. We compare the behavior of both types of firms by respect to output and price. If the firm is producing, the output (and the input consumption) of a profit-rate-maximizing firm is lower than (or equal to) those of a pure-profit-maximizing firm; the price of output evolves in the opposite way. The demonstration is valid for monopoly (higher price, lower input) and for perfect competition (lower input); in perfect competition with fixed coefficient of capital, the output price loses any role in the equilibrium what implies no coordination. It is also applied to the case where the capital is the total capital engaged (EVA versus ROCE) or where it is the equity (EVA versus ROE) as in part 2. Part 2 explores how shareholders’ behavior may influence companies’ objective. Two main cases are examined (leaving aside the questions of corporate governance or agency theory). (i) The “strategic behavior”. Strategic or controlling shareholders try to maintain fixed their control rate on firms: they maximize their own net income which includes companies' <b>distributed</b> <b>profit.</b> Hence companies maximize their economic profit. (ii) The “financial behavior”. Financial shareholders control the composition of their portfolio, allocating freely their equity capital between firms: they maximize the return on their equity capital. Hence companies are encouraged to maximize their profit rate: they employ less factors, as labor. (iii) The “sleepingpartner” behavior; sleeping shareholders let their equity invested in the firm for a long time, without subscribing to any new issue of shares: they maximize the return on their equity but because of their inertia, they have a small influence on the firm. The combination of these behaviors is considered. As a result, profit-sharing leads to profit-rate maximization and natural selection {{is in favor of}} profit-rate-maximizing firms.

30|$|The debt {{of local}} {{government}} belongs to the behavior of public policy so that relevant power, responsibility, and interests exist. They play different roles in debt. The first aspect is about the debt power {{of local government}}. The optical debt has its reasonability and object necessity, which could improve the local economy and bring about more efficiency, which means it benefits the social development. Therefore, the public {{would be willing to}} endow the power of debt financing and debt management to the local government. In most foreign countries, local governments have the power to issue bonds, including whether to borrow the debt, how much debt would be raised, who would become the creditor and the way of debt financing, etc. In 2014, the government issued a new “Budget Law” which brings a due power of debt financing to the local government. While it is clear that debt power is produced by the motivation of public and collective interests, it is not the private power of someone but the public power essentially. The second aspect is about the debt interests of local government. Being in the category of public interests, it mainly intends {{to make use of the}} action of debt financing to increase the capital input of constructing the infrastructure and various public services, and then make contributions to promote the development and structure of the economy, improve the quality of life and wellbeing of the public, and reduce the social cost of the enterprise production. Since the local officer is the person holding the debt power, the local debt is not only for achieving the public interests, but also for pursuing the private benefit which displays political achievement and rent-seeking profits. From the respective research, the political achievement of profit mainly reflects a person’s private goal to get a promotion as soon as possible; the local officer takes an action to replace “expenditure efficiency” with “debt burden” which would lead to “short-term and high-speed” economic growth. Yaling Tan, the director of the Institute of Chinese Foreign Exchange Research, says that “the local government makes use of investment to help realize someone’s achievement rather than improve the local economy.” 9 Rent-seeking profit means some other relevant beneficial subject has to bribe the officers for pursuing some debt power which transfers or detracts from the local government and then achieve the private benefit for himself. For example, some credit preference banks use bribery with the power holders to benefit from a kind of loan with “low risk, stable income” from the local government. What’s more, some programmers will distribute the dividends to some power leaders in order to obtain the public welfare program contracts. It is obvious that the attraction of private benefit will push public power about the local government debt separating, surpassing, or even deviating from public interests so that the original public interests will be damaged. The third aspect is about the debt responsibility of local government. In fact, this role is to restrict a person to use this public power for personal profit. The social public should be the carriers endowed with the responsibility to the local government, because they are the givers of public power of local debt financing. On the positive side, the content of responsibility involves stipulating the issue of how to realize the social interests by the local debt, such as confirming the debt scale and structure, managing the debt use and efficiency, redemption of the debt and controlling the risk, and so on. In contrast, on the negative side, the responsibility mainly means the local government would be punished if it goes against the social interests from the debt. In practice, this punishment mostly aims at abusing the debt’s public power to seek personal profit, therefore, this kind of responsibility mainly restricts the local leader’s behavior. For example, this punishment includes accountability and administrative penalties to the local officers who take debt financing blindly for the pursuit of short-term economic growth or who accept bribes and <b>distributed</b> <b>profit</b> from some other related stakeholders. In fact, the responsibility restriction of local debt behavior is security to preserve the public interests.|$|E
