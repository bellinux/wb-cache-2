40|$|The fine {{structure}} of plastids and their starch deposits in differentiating sieve elements was studied in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Ultrastructural cytochemistry employing two carbohydrases specific for different linkages was {{then used to}} compare the chemical nature of "sieve tube starch" (the starch deposited in sieve elements) with that of the ordinary starch of other cell types. Hypocotyl tissue from seedlings was fixed in glutaraldehyde, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Epon-Araldite. Treatment of thin sections on uncoated copper grids with α-amylase or diastase at pH 6. 8 to cleave α-(1 → 4) bonds resulted in digestion of ordinary starch grains but not sieve element grains, as determined by electron microscopy. Since α-(1 → 6) branch points in amylopectin-type starches make the adjacent α-(1 → 4) linkages somewhat resistant to hydrolysis by α-amylase, other sections mounted on bare copper or gold grids were treated <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase</b> (a bacterial α-[1 → 6] glucosidase) prior to digestion <b>with</b> diastase. <b>Pullulanase</b> did not digest sieve element starch, but rendered the starch digestible subsequently by α-amylase.

40|$|The {{effects of}} cyclodextrins and {{derivatives}} on the activity {{and structure of}} pullulanase were investigated in this study. Our results showed that cyclodextrins and derivatives decreased the activity of pullulanase. This decrease was attributed to {{the interaction between the}} hydrophobic cavities of cyclodextrins and pullulanase. The hydrophobic cavity was confirmed to encapsulate the groups of pullulanase molecules by the addition of competitive guests. The results obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy analysis showed that β-CD showed more efficient interactions <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase</b> molecules and the side chain groups of cyclodextrin significantly prevented the interaction between the hydrophobic cavities of β-CD and pullulanase molecules. These findings suggest that the geometric dimension of hydrophobic cavities was crucial for matching between cyclodextrins and pullulanase and steric hindrance caused by side chains led to the decrease of the interaction...|$|R

The optimum temperature and pH of the crude enzyme were 60 oC and pH 9. 0 respectively. Plackett-Burman design was applied in the screening process of 17 nutrients for pullulanase production and five nutrients were identified as significant and effective factors for the pullulanase production. The five significant factors are sago starch, NH 4 Cl, Na 2 HPO 4, KCl and MgSO 4. The five nutrients were selected for further optimization studies using Central Composite Design (CCD). Optimum pullulanase production was achieved using 3. 86 %w/v sago starch, 0. 002 % w/v NH 4 Cl, 0. 05 %w/v Na 2 HPO 4, 0. 015 %w/v KCl and 0. 025 %w/v MgSO 4, <b>with</b> predicted <b>pullulanase</b> activity, 1. 252 U/ml.

Combinations of surfactants with high and low hydrodynamic volume (V) indicated that there is a relationship between V and emulsion stability. Degree of branching (DB) had little direct influence on emulsions, though surfactants with the highest DB were poor emulsifiers due to their reduced molecular size. Results indicate that V and branch length (including linear components) are the primary influences on octenylsuccinylated starches forming stable emulsions, due to the increased steric hindrance from short amphiphilic branches, consistent with current understanding of electrosteric stabilization.

We used {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) to investigate, in vivo, the binding strength and surface distribution of fibronectin attachment proteins (FAPs) in Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). We measured the specific binding forces of FAPs (approximately 50 pN) and found that they increased with the loading rate, as observed earlier for other receptor-ligand systems. We also mapped the distribution of FAPs, revealing that the proteins are widely exposed on the mycobacterial surface. To demonstrate that the proteins are surface-associated, we showed that treatment of the cells <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase,</b> an enzyme possessing carbohydrate-degrading activities, or with protease, an enzyme that conducts proteolysis, led to a substantial reduction of the FAP surface density. A similar trend was also noted following treatment with ethambutol, an antibiotic which inhibits the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{resistant}} starch (RS), type 3, {{was prepared}} by the autoclaving and debranching of normal maize starch isolated from a selected ZP genotype. The objectives {{of this study were}} to optimize both starch autoclaving and debranching <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase</b> (PromozymeBrewQ) for the production of RS. Autoclaving at 120 °C (30 min) increased the RS content of all samples, whereas freezing at – 20 °C did not have an obvious effect on the RS contents. The highest RS yield in the autoclaved starch samples was 7. 0 % after three autoclaving–cooling cycles. After pullulanase debranching at 50 °C and retrogradation at 4 °C, the RS yields ranged from 10. 2 to 25. 5 % in all samples (depending on the hydrolysis time). Debranched starch samples with a maximum RS yield of 25. 5 % were obtained after a debranching time of 24 h. This study showed that starch from the selected ZP maize genotype is suitable for pullulanase treatment and RS preparation but that additional studies with a greater number of different treatments (incubation time/temperature) are necessary to manipulate and promote crystallization and enhance RS formation...|$|R

The pullulanase expressed {{from this}} clone in Escherichia coli was cell associated and soluble {{and had a}} molecular mass of 72 kilodaltons by gel filtration. Maxicell analysis of proteins coded by the cloned insert showed that a 71. 6 - to 73. 2 -kilodalton doublet was associated <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase</b> activity. Thus, the pullulanase is probably a monomer. The cloned pullulanase produced maltotriose as an end product of pullulan digestion. In B. thetaiotaomicron the pullulanase activity was cell associated. Approximately 80 % of the activity was soluble, and 16 to 18 % was membrane associated. The molecular mass of the soluble pullulanase was 77 kilodaltons by gel filtration. To determine whether the cloned pullulanase gene was essential for pullulan utilization, we used directed insertional mutagenesis to inactivate the B. thetaiotaomicron pullulanase gene. The pullulanase specific activity of the mutant was approximately 45 % of that of wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron.

40|$|Single screw {{extrusion}} of cassava starch was evaluated as a pre-treatment for the enzymatic hydrolysis of the extrudate and fermentation to yield alcohol. The acid concentration, barrel temperature and moisture content showed {{that all the}} variables were significant.

Acid concentration was significant in the production of reducing sugars. At concentrations above 0. 024 N, as the temperature increased, the reducing sugar content also increased. Nevertheless, at concentrations below 0. 024 N, the reducing sugar content showed the opposite result. The best yield of alcohol obtained from the extruded starch was 98. 7 % (0. 56 g of ethanol/g starch), which, on average, was 5. 7 % and 6. 8 % higher than that obtained from starch extruded without acid and from starch gelatinized by the conventional method, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{activities}} of {{the two types of}} starch debranching enzymes, isoamylase and pullulanase, were greatly reduced in endosperms of allelic sugary- 1 mutants of rice (Oryza sativa), with the decrease more pronounced for isoamylase than for pullulanase. However, the decrease in isoamylase activity was not related to the magnitude of the sugary phenotype (the proportion of the phytoglycogen region of the endosperm), as observed <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase.</b> In the moderately mutated line EM- 5, the pullulanase activity was markedly lower in the phytoglycogen region than in the starch region, and isoamylase activity was extremely low or completely lost in the whole endosperm tissue. These results suggest that both debranching enzymes are involved in amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm. We presume that isoamylase plays a predominant role in amylopectin synthesis, but pullulanase is also essential or can compensate for the role of isoamylase {{in the construction of the}} amylopectin multiple-cluster structure. It is highly possible that isoamylase was modified in some sugary- 1 mutants such as EM- 273 and EM- 5, since it was present in significant and trace amounts, respectively, in these mutants but was apparently inactive.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{processing}} temperature and time on the rheological properties of recycled tyre rubber-modified bitumens (RTR-MBs) produced using two different base binders and an ambient ground crumb rubber modifier (CRM). The production of the RTR-MBs was accomplished {{by means of a}} standard Brookfield rotational viscometer together with a modified impeller, dual helical impeller, to allow mixing as well as real-time viscosity measurements of the produced RTR-MBs. The rheological properties of the final RTR-MBs were determined by means of standard dynamic mechanical analysis oscillatory and multiple stress creep recovery testing using a dynamic shear rheometer. The results indicate that the low processing conditions (160 °C and 60  min) are not appropriate for developing RTR-MBs with enhanced physical and rheological properties. However, allowing the crumb rubber to interact with the base binder for longer mixing times (140  min) {{led to the development of}} an enhanced rubber (polymer) network structure within the blend (i. e. swelling of the CRM particles) and superior rheological properties. At the other extreme, using high-processing conditions (200 °C and 140  min) led to RTR-MBs in which the rubber network had been subjected to devulcanisation and <b>depolymerisation</b> <b>with</b> a subsequent reduction in modification...|$|R

Lines with modifiers of the soft kernel phenotype (mo 2) called "Quality Protein Maize" (QPM) have high lysine and kernel phenotypes similar to normal maize. Prior research indicated that the formation of vitreous endosperm in QPM might involve changes in starch granule structure. In this study, we focused on analysis of two starch biosynthetic enzymes that may influence kernel vitreousness. Analysis of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross of W 64 Ao 2 and K 0326 Y revealed that pullulanase activity had significant positive correlation with kernel vitreousness. We also found that decreased Starch Synthase III abundance may decrease the pullulanase activity and average glucan chain length given the same Zpu 1 genotype. Therefore, Starch Synthase III could indirectly influence the kernel vitreousness by affecting pullulanase activity and coordinating <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase</b> to alter the glucan chain length distribution of amylopectin, resulting in different starch structural properties. The glucan chain length distribution had strong positive correlation with the polydispersity index of glucan chains, which was positively associated with the kernel vitreousness based on nonlinear regression analysis. Therefore, we propose that pullulanase and Starch Synthase III are two important factors responsible for the formation of the vitreous phenotype of QPM endosperms...|$|R

All three legume starches showed a C-type X-ray diffraction pattern and two-stage swelling pattern.

Cowpea showed a lower weight ratio of short:long chains than chickpea and yellow pea starches. The larger portion of long side chains in cowpea amylopectin can be correlated with a higher gelatinization temperature, greater pasting peak and a slight difference in crystalline structure found for cowpea starch. Chickpea and yellow pea starches exhibited similarity in unit chain profile of amylopectin as well as in gelatinization temperature and pasting profile, while they differed in amylose content, particle size and syneresis.

The role of these macromolecules in mediating adhesion and attachment were examined. Interfacial forces and adhesion affinities of A. pullulans were probed for early-exponential phase (EEP) and late-exponential phase (LEP) cells, using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Biochemical assays showed that A. pullulans produces both pullulan and a uronic acid based polymer. The pullulan is not produced until the LEP, {{and it can be}} removed by treatment <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase.</b> Both adhesion forces between the microbe and the AFM tip (silicon nitride) and attachment of the cells to quartz sand grains were controlled by the density of the uronic acid polymer. Uronic acid polymers doubled in density between the EEP and the LEP and were unaffected by the enzyme pullulanase. Retention to quartz in a packed column was quantified using the collision efficiency (R), the fraction of collisions between the microbes, and the sand grains, that result in attachment. Adhesion forces and retention on glass were well correlated, with these values being higher for EEP cells (Fadh) 7. 65 (4. 67 nN; R) 1. 15) than LEP (Fadh) 2. 94 (0. 75; R) 0. 49) and LEP + pullulanase cells (Fadh) 2. 33 (2. 01 nN; R) 0. 43).

The pullulanase gene (pulA) encodes a protein of 849 amino acids with a 28 -residue signal peptide. The pulA gene was subcloned without its signal sequence and overexpressed in E. coli {{under the control}} of the trc promoter. This clone, E. coli FD 748, produced two proteins (93 and 83 kDa) <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase</b> activity. A second start site, identified 118 amino acids downstream from the ATG start site, with a Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence (GGAGG) and TTG translation initiation codon was mutated to produce only the 93 -kDa protein. The recombinant purified pullulanases (rPulAs) were optimally active at pH 6 and 80 °C and had a half-life of 2 h at 80 °C. The rPulAs hydrolyzed α- 1, 6 glycosidic linkages of pullulan, starch, amylopectin, glycogen, α-β-limited dextrin. Interestingly, amylose, which contains only α- 1, 4 glycosidic linkages, was not hydrolyzed by rPulAs. According to these results, the enzyme is classified as a debranching enzyme, pullulanase type I. The extraordinary high substrate specificity of rPulA together with its thermal stability makes this enzyme a good candidate for biotechnological applications in the starch-processing industry...|$|R

By sequence analysis of the Group B Streptococcus (GBS) genome we found a novel putative surface exposed protein <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase</b> activity. We named such a protein SAP. The sap gene is highly conserved among GBS strains and homologous genes, such as PulA and SpuA, have been described in other pathogenic streptococci. The SAP protein contains two N-terminal carbohydrate-binding motifs, followed by a catalytic domain and a C-terminal LPXTG cell wall-anchoring domain. In vitro analysis revealed that the recombinant form of SAP is able to degrade a-glucan polysaccharides, such as pullulan, glycogen and starch. Moreover, NMR analysis showed that SAP acts as a type I pullulanase. Studies performed on whole bacteria indicated {{that the presence of}} a-glucan polysaccharides in culture medium up-regulated the expression of SAP on bacterial surface as confirmed by FACS analysis and confocal imaging. Deletion of the sap gene resulted in a reduced capacity of bacteria to grow in medium containing pullulan or glycogen, but not glucose or maltose, confirming the pivotal role of SAP in GBS metabolism of a-glucans. As reported for other streptococcal pullulanases, we found specific anti-SAP antibodies in human sera from healthy volunteers. Investigation of the functional role of anti-SAP antibodies revealed that incubation of GBS in the presence of sera from animals immunized with SAP reduced the capacity of the bacterium to degrade pullulan.

40|$|We have {{previously}} isolated two MIN 6 beta-cell sublines, B 1, highly responsive to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and C 3, markedly refractory (Lilla, V., Webb, G., Rickenbach, K., Maturana, A., Steiner, D. F., Halban, P. A. and Irminger, J. C. (2003) Endocrinology 144, 1368 - 1379). We now demonstrate that C 3 cells have substantially increased amounts of F-actin stress fibres whereas B 1 cells have shorter cortical F-actin. Consistent with these data, B 1 cells display glucose-dependent actin remodelling whereas, in C 3 cells, F-actin is refractory to this secretagogue. Furthermore, F-actin <b>depolymerisation</b> <b>with</b> latrunculin B restores glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in C 3 cells. In parallel, glucose-stimulated ERK 1 / 2 activation is greater in B 1 than in C 3 cells, and is potentiated in both sublines following F-actin depolymerisation. Glucose-activated phosphoERK 1 / 2 accumulates at actin filament tips {{adjacent to the}} plasma membrane, indicating {{that these are the}} main sites of action for this kinase during insulin secretion. In addition, B 1 cell expression of the calcium-dependent F-actin severing protein gelsolin is > 100 -fold higher than that of C 3 cells. Knock-down of gelsolin reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas gelsolin over-expression potentiated secretion from B 1 cells.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that F-actin reorganization prior to insulin secretion requires gelsolin and plays a role in the glucose-dependent MAPK signal transduction that regulates beta-cell insulin secretion...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} and contraction of a cytokinetic actomyosin ring (CAR) {{is essential for}} the execution of cytokinesis in fission yeast. Unlike most organisms in which its composition has been investigated, the fission yeast CAR contains two type II myosins encoded by the genes myo 2 (+) and myp 2 (+). myo 2 (+) is an essential gene whilst myp 2 (+) is dispensable under normal growth conditions. Myo 2 is hence the major contractile protein of the CAR whilst Myp 2 plays a more subtle and, as yet, incompletely documented role. Using a fission yeast strain in which the chromosomal copy of the myo 2 (+) gene is fused to the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), we analysed CAR {{formation and}} function in the presence and absence of Myp 2. No change in the rate of CAR contraction was observed when Myp 2 was absent although the CAR persisted longer in the contracted state and was occasionally observed to split into two discrete rings. This was also observed in myp 2 Delta cells following actin <b>depolymerisation</b> <b>with</b> latrunculin. CAR contraction in the absence of Myp 2 was completely abolished in the presence of elevated levels of chloride ions. Thus, Myp 2 appears to contribute to the stability of the CAR, in particular at a late stage of CAR contraction, and to be a component of the signalling pathway that regulates cytokinesis in response to elevated levels of chloride. To determine whether the presence of two type II myosins was a feature of cytokinesis in other fungi that divide by septation, we searched the genomes of two filamentous fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus and Neurospora crassa, for myosin genes. As in fission yeast, both A. fumigatus and N. crassa contained myosins of classes I, II, and V. Unlike fission yeast, both contained a single type II myosin gene that, {{on the basis of its}} tail structure, was more reminiscent of Myp 2 than Myo 2. The significance of these observations to our understanding of septum to formation and cleavage is discussed...|$|R
50|$|In a {{pioneering}} study by Bernstein and Bamburg, {{it was observed}} that the actin-binding protein actin depolymerisation factor (ADF)/cofilin, a factor that promotes actin filament <b>depolymerisation,</b> competed <b>with</b> tropomyosin for binding to the actin filament. The expression of Tropomyosin 5NM1 in neuronal cells eliminated ADF/cofilin from the growth cone region, leading to more stable actin filaments. However, the increased expression of Tropomyosin Br3 was observed to recruit ADF/cofilin to actin filaments bound to the Tropomyosin Br3 isoform within the lamellipodium, which led to the disassembly of actin filaments. This phenomenon, whereby a specific tropomyosin isoform directs specific interactions between actin-binding proteins, and the actin filament has been observed in a variety of model systems with a range of different binding proteins (reviewed in Gunning et al., 2008). These interactions, under the influence of tropomyosin isoforms, allow actin filaments to be involved in a diverse range of cellular functions.|$|R
40|$|Prebiotics are food {{ingredients}} that selectively stimulate {{the growth of}} probiotic bacteria in the colon. Resistant starch (RS) is the starch {{that can not be}} digested by digestive enzymes and resistant to gastric acid so it can reach the colon to be fermented by probiotic bacteria. There are treatments to increase the content of RS such as: autoclaving-cooling cycling, combination of lintnerized with autoclaving-cooling, and combination of debranching <b>pullulanase</b> <b>with</b> autoclaving-cooling. The results of techno-economical study showed that the combination of fermentation followed by autoclaving-cooling can be used as an alternative technique to increase the content of resistant starch in food more effectively and efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Visando obter informações a respeito da estrutura dos grânulos, amidos de milho normal e ceroso foram isolados e submetidos à ação da a-amilase e amiloglucosidase. Para elucidar a estrutura dos grânulos, os resíduos desta hidrólise foram submetidos à cromatografia de permeção em gel Sephadex G- 50, diretamente e após sucessivas digestões enzimáticas com pululanase e b-amilase. Os resultados mostraram que existem diferenças nos resíduos dos amidos de milho ceroso e normal, tratados com a-amilase e amiloglucosidase. No resíduo do amido de milho ceroso, os perfis de eluição mostraram duas frações a 290 e 350 ml (picos I e II) respectivamente, que não eram suscetíveis ao ataque da a-amilase e amiloglucosidase, indicando que estas frações faziam parte das zonas cristalinas do amido. Estas frações também faziam parte das áreas cristalinas no amido normal. A presença do pico V à 390 ml na a-glucana do amido de milho normal sugeriu que além das duas frações não suscetíveis à hidrólise existia outra que também participava das zonas cristalinas deste amido como regiões não suscetíveis às enzimas formando, consequentemente, rede cristalina fortemente associada. A presença deste pico a 390 ml sugeriu arranjo cristalino distinto entre o amido de milho ceroso e o normal. In {{order to}} obtain more {{information}} on the structure of corn starch granules, normal and waxy corn starches were both isolated and hydrolysed with a-amylase and amyloglucosidase. Sephadex G- 50 gel-permeation chromatography of the a-glucan of normal and waxy corn starches was performed directly and after successive enzymatic digests <b>with</b> <b>pullulanase</b> and b-amylase. The results showed differences in the residues of the waxy and normal corn starches treated with a-amylase and amyloglucosidase. The elution patterns of the waxy corn starch residue showed two fractions at 290 and 350 ml (peak II and III) respectively, which were not susceptible to the a-amylase and amyloglucosidase attack indicating that these fractions took part in the waxy starch cristalline areas. These fractions also took part in normal starch cristalline areas. However, in addition to two chains not susceptible to hydrolysis, the presence of the peak V at 390 ml on the a-glucan of the normal corn starch suggested the existence of another fraction that also took part in normal corn starch cristalline areas forming tightly associated cristalline network. The presence of this peak at 390 ml suggested the distinct cristalline arrangement between the waxy and normal corn starches...|$|R
40|$|The {{rates and}} {{mechanisms}} of the thermal degradation of nine alternating poly(olefin sulphone) s with different olefin structures {{have been investigated}} at 150 °C and 200 °C by a novel technique which is particularly suitable for studying the initial steps of the degradation. Rapid degradation was initiated at the CS bond <b>with</b> <b>depolymerisation</b> to sulphur dioxide and olefin. The rate of thermal degradation showed a moderate correlation with the ceiling temperature for monomer-polymer equilibrium and also {{with the number of}} β-hydrogen atoms, but neither parameter provided an adequate measure of the sensitivity of all the poly(olefin sulphone) s to thermal degradation.

40|$|Abstract. Boysenberry fruit was {{harvested}} at five developmental stages, {{from green}} to purple, {{and changes in}} pectin and hemicellulose solubilisation and depolymerisation, polymer neutral sugar contents, and the activities of cell wall degrading enzymes were analysed. The high xylose to glucose ratio in the 4 % KOH-soluble hemicellulose fraction suggests that xylans are abundant in the boysenberry cell wall. Although the cell wall changes associated with fruit development do not proceed in discrete stages and the cell wall disassembly {{is a consequence of}} highly regulated changes occurring in a continuum, the results suggest that the temporal changes in cell wall degradation in boysenberry account for at least three stages: an early stage (green to 75 % red colour), associated with metabolism of cellulose and cross-linking glycans; an intermediate period (75 to 100 % red colour), characterised by substantial pectin solubilisation without depolymerisation in which α-arabinofuranosidase increasesmarkedly and 50 %of thewall arabinose is lost; and a final stage (100 % red colour to purple), characterised mainly by a reduction of pectic galactose content and a dramatic increase in pectin <b>depolymerisation</b> associated <b>with</b> higher polygalacturonase, pectin methylesterase, acetyl esterase and β-galactosidase activities. From a biotechnological perspective enzymes involved in pectin matrix disassembly seem to be the better candidates to affect boysenberry fruit late-softening by genetic intervention. A model for cell wall disassembly in boysenberry fruit is proposed...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{pullulanase}} which mainly produced panose from pullulan was found in Bacillus stearothermophilus and purified. The enzyme can hydrolyze pullulan efficiently and only hydrolyzes {{a small amount of}} starch. When pullulan was used as a substrate, the main product was panose and small amounts of glucose and maltose were simultaneously produced. By using pTB 522 as a vector plasmid, the enzyme gene was cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis. Since the enzyme from the recombinant plasmid carrier could convert pullulan into not only panose but also glucose and maltose, we concluded that these reactions were due to the single enzyme. The new <b>pullulanase,</b> <b>with</b> a molecular weight of 62, 000, was fairly thermostable. The optimum temperature was 60 to 65 degrees C, and about 90 % of the enzyme activity was retained even after treatment at 60 degrees C for 60 min. The optimum pH for the enzyme was 6. 0...|$|R
40|$|Forty-two bifidobacterial strains were {{screened}} for α-amylase and/or pullulanase activity by investigating their capacities to utilize starch, amylopectin, or pullulan. Of the 42 bifidobacterial strains tested, 19 {{were capable of}} degrading potato starch. Of these 19 strains, 11 were able to degrade starch and amylopectin, as well as pullulan. These 11 strains, which were shown to produce extracellular starch-degrading activities, included 5 strains of Bifidobacterium breve, 1 B. dentium strain, 1 B. infantis strain, 3 strains of B. pseudolongum, and 1 strain of B. thermophilum. Quantitative and qualitative enzyme activities were determined by measuring the concentrations of released reducing sugars and by high-performance thin-layer chromatography, respectively. These analyses confirmed both the inducible nature and the extracellular nature of the starch- and pullulan-degrading enzyme activities and showed that the five B. breve strains produced an activity that is consistent <b>with</b> type II <b>pullulanase</b> (amylopullulanase) activity, while the remaining six strains produced an activity with properties that resemble those of type III pullulan hydrolase...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} a thermoactive pullulanase {{from the}} hyperthermophilic anaerobic archaeon Desulfurococcus mucosus (apuA) was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. apuA from D. mucosus showed 45. 4 % pairwise amino acid identity <b>with</b> the <b>pullulanase</b> from Thermococcus aggregans and contained the four regions conserved among all amylolytic enzymes. apuA encodes a protein of 686 amino acids with a 28 -residue signal peptide {{and has a}} predicted mass of 74 kDa after signal cleavage. The apuA gene was then expressed in Bacillus subtilis and secreted into the culture fluid. This {{is one of the}} first reports on the successful expression and purification of an archaeal amylopullulanase in a Bacillus strain. The purified recombinant enzyme (rapuDm) is composed of two subunits, each having an estimated molecular mass of 66 kDa. Optimal activity was measured at 85 °C within a broad pH range from 3. 5 to 8. 5, with an optimum at pH 5. 0. Divalent cations have no influence on the stability or activity of the enzyme. RapuDm was stable at 80 °C for 4 h and exhibited a half-life of 50 min at 85 °C. By high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis it was observed that rapuDm hydrolyzed α- 1, 6 glycosidic linkages of pullulan, producing maltotriose, and also α- 1, 4 glycosidic linkages in starch, amylose, amylopectin, and cyclodextrins, with maltotriose and maltose as the main products. Since the thermoactive pullulanases known so far from Archaea are not active on cyclodextrins and are in fact inhibited by these cyclic oligosaccharides, the enzyme from D. mucosus should be considered an archaeal <b>pullulanase</b> type II <b>with</b> a wider substrate specificity...|$|R
