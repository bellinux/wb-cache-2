50|$|Gosnold {{was first}} settled in 1641, {{the year of}} {{purchase}} of the islands by Thomas Mayhew, Sr. The islands were claimed by the Wampanoag until 1658, when the Wampanoag sachem transferred the <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> to Mayhew. Constituting Dukes County, New York since 1683, the Elizabeth Islands, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket, were transferred to the newly created Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691. Gosnold was separately incorporated as a municipality in 1864; previously it {{was a part of}} the town of Chilmark.|$|E
50|$|In 1131, {{the place}} was {{mentioned}} for the first time, as Waltprugele in a papal <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> for the St. Cassius abbey in Bonn. In this document Pope Innocent II confirmed the Church's ownership and the ecclesiastical tithe (which later evolved into land tax and wealth tax). Back then, this housing estate belonged to the sphere of influence of the first counts of Berg, {{as well as of}} the first counts of Sayn. In the same year, construction began on a new Protestant church, whose steeple survives to the present day.|$|E

The Act {{was created}} in 1830, the 1840 Act being the third version to be passed. The change in the law made it {{necessary}} for persons to have continued residence within the building that they were intending to use after an application for the issuing of a licence for the selling of alcohol, and that they be in possession <b>of</b> the <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> the building.|$|R

50|$|The first {{mention of}} Oliwa dates to AD 1186 when the Cistercians {{established}} a monastery there. The Cistercian Monks named it Oliva, either derived from an older Slavic name or the biblical Mount of Olives or olive tree. The monks received a <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> from the contemporary Pomeranian duchies and dukes Sambor I of Pomerania in 1188. The deed encompassed {{a number of}} villages, including Oliwa which became a monastic village for long centuries to come.

5000|$|Another story {{involved}} acting Governor Thomas B. Cuming. Apparently, Cuming {{hired an}} Irish man named Callahan to make improvements on Cuming's land {{in order to}} conform with the homestead law. Callahan, however, filed a claim on the land for himself. When the claim club demanded that Callahan surrender the <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> a committee was appointed to [...] "persuade" [...] him. Callahan was then taken to the Missouri River, a hole was chopped in the ice, and he was dunked through the hole until he and the claim club came to an agreement. Callahan died within a year, apparently from the after-effects of hypothermia brought on from his dunking.|$|E
50|$|He was {{originally}} a robo-servant at the Grand Hall of Justice, and {{was drafted by}} Judge Dredd during the First Robot War to help him infiltrate the robot stronghold. Unlike {{the majority of the}} robots, Walter believed robots should be diligent slaves for humans. It was Walter who landed the final blow on rebel leader Call-Me-Kenneth, being used to override the city's Weather Control computers and unleash a lightning storm, and he was made a free robot (the first ever) with the rights of a human citizen in 2099 for his loyal services. However he was so devoted to Dredd that he chose to remain in Dredd's employ and even got rid of his freedom papers in exchange for a <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ownership</b> giving him to Dredd. (A later story would retroactively reveal he was granted his freedom again for services against the insane Judge Cal.).|$|E

50|$|The rise in {{population}} in the Middle Ages, the demand of the trading centres of Cologne, present-day Belgium and the Netherlands and the, compared with today, high per-capita consumption of wine must have led to {{an expansion of the}} winegrowing areas and associated terracing needed. In <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and enfeoffment <b>of</b> the time there are even sites managed today that could have been terraced as early as the 12th century. Gepirg pringt edlern wein ("steep slopes produce better wine") was an adage recorded in a farming guide of the 14th century. Gebirge or Gepirg was the name given to steep locations on the valley sides until the 19th century. Phases of closure, abandonment and ruination of terraces followed plagues, war or climatic changes.|$|R

50|$|As Baloo and Kit {{land in the}} {{volcanic}} Pirate Island, Rebecca seduces the prison guard into letting them out by saying she will give him the <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> of the Sea Duck if he promises {{to let them go}} free. The guard agrees to this, but just as he gets the keys, Baloo knocks him out and takes the deed, then lets Rebecca and Molly out. Just then, Karnage and his men return, and Baloo and company are forced to hide from the pirates' sight. Upon his return, Karnage reveals the master weapon he has been working on building using the junk they have stolen - a lightning gun, with which, he says, they will use to plunder Cape Suzette. He then sings a catchy song {{about what it means to}} be air pirates, during which Baloo and company try to sneak past disguised as other pirates, only to have Baloo foolishly try to prolong the song, blowing their cover in the process. To cover their escape, Kit pretends to rejoin the pirates and gives them the stone, but his acting angers Baloo, who believes it to be true. Baloo, Rebecca, and Molly make their escape not knowing that Kit was faking his betrayal, but the pirates are right behind. With the pirate fighters unshakable, Baloo turns on an overdrive function in the Sea Duck that allows them to get away very fast.|$|E
50|$|Haslach {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in a document {{in the year}} 786. The document, a <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> donation, transferred <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> some land from Heimo and his daughter Svanahilt to the Abbey of Saint Gall, including Haslach (then called Haslaha). Because there are no earlier mentions in records {{there is no way}} of telling how old Haslach really is, but it is clear that it was established sometime before 786.|$|R

40|$|We {{know that}} for Hegel the notion of spirit takes so many shapes that their unity is {{difficult}} to find. For instance, what does the soul in the subjective spirit, the property in the objective spirit and {{the cult of the}} Greek gods in the absolute spirit have in common? Furthermore, when we consider property, for example, the problem is knowing if the spirit is here constituted by the owner, by the <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> or by the living relationship between the owner and the possessed goods. Moreover, the Hegelian spirit is a philosophical descendant of several different traditions. The question is, therefore, to know how these traditions are linked in the Hegelian notion. I will present these briefly before stating my general hypothesis about the definition of the spirit. First, the Hegelian spirit is connected to the noûs of the Greek philosophers (the Latin spiritus, intellectus). The noûs — on the one hand, an immaterial entity leading the universe, and, on the other, a faculty of the soul — is most often distinguished by its separate and rational nature. For Hegel too, the spirit, as a non-perceptible entity, constitutes the freest and most rational stage {{in the development of the}} Idea...|$|R
50|$|With a {{construction}} boom then underway {{in the northeast}} region, the priests feared that rising costs, already in excess {{of what had been}} planned, would become prohibitive if action was not taken quickly to finalize the sale and commence building. With the Cardinal's encouragement, they renewed negotiation with city officials. Finally, these efforts produced agreement at a price that the parish deemed affordable and Mayor John Collins signed the <b>deed,</b> transferring <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> the land to the parish.|$|R
50|$|The second {{method is}} calling your {{favorite}} charity {{to see if}} they accept timeshare donations. Some charities are able to utilize timeshare weeks to generate revenue; by renting them to donors, or offering the vacation week for auction at a charity event. However, most charities are unable to take on <b>deeded</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> your timeshare, so they opt to sell the timeshare for you. If a charity sells the timeshare on your behalf and keeps the proceeds as the donation, the donor is then entitled to a tax deduction.|$|R
50|$|The Nolichucky Grants {{were two}} of five {{property}} transactions made near present-day Elizabethton, Tennessee at the Sycamore Shoals of the Watauga River, collectively known as The Watauga Treaties. The Path Grant Deed was for lands in East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia needed by Richard Henderson & Co to permit free passage into Kentucky and {{the property of the}} Great Grant Deed. That transaction was concluded a few days earlier on March 17, 1775.

40|$|Abstract Within biblical studies it {{is often}} assumed that the prophetic texts of Micah 2 : 1 - 2 and Isaiah 5 : 8 - 10 point to {{significant}} landownership abuse, coupled with one generic group oppressing another generic group by taking their land. Faced with a lack <b>of</b> <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> land <b>ownership</b> in ancient Israel, many scholars have turned to social science for contextual clues and found them helpful. As an alternative to a social scientific approach, however, this research provides {{a new perspective on}} land ownership that draws on the Northeast Indian tribal experience. This new interpretation combines contextual post colonial, liberation and cultural approaches to interpretation. It is a reading {{from the point of view}} of an oppressed group of people in Northeast India, the community of which the researcher is a part. This perspective provides a useful model for interpreting the socio-economic contexts behind the prophetic critique <b>of</b> land <b>ownership</b> abuse. Rather than focusing on the economic and political dimensions <b>of</b> land <b>ownership,</b> it looks at land ownership from the perspective of religio-cultural identity. This emphasises a link between land, God, ancestors, family and community, both in ancient Israelite society and in Northeast Indian society. From this new perspective, it is possible to discern an ethos and set of values which the eighth-century prophets, especially Micah and Isaiah tried to defend and uphold. These revolved around the socio-political and religio-cultural identity of the close-knit rural family and community, communitarian values of land sharing, and the interconnectedness of God, humans and land. Thus, new insights can be gained into land ownership abuse through the use of the Northeast India tribal perspective which provides a fresh interpretation to biblical studies. Furthermore, this perspective offers valuable insights into prophetic protest against injustice, not only in ancient Israel, but also in modern societies. ...|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} {{communities}} on SNL in Swaziland, Ntjanini is a farming community {{with the majority}} of the inhabitants living on subsistence farming practices. SNL is one of the land tenure systems in Swaziland whereby land is managed under Chiefdoms and residents do pay for use of the land. The second tenure system is Title Deed Land where the owner purchases the land and is given a title <b>deed</b> as proof <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> Maize is planted by all families as this forms the staple food in Swaziland. Many families keep cattle and goats that graze on the mountains surrounding Ntjanini. A colliery is located in Maloma 18 km away from Ntjanini school. Those working in the cities provide much needed farm inputs in the form of seeds, fertilisers and monies for tractor hire services to those living in the village since there is very little income generated by the farming activities in the area1.|$|R

On April 4, 1765, the chapel was declared an abbey church and confirmed as such by the Bishop of Malta Lorenzo D'Astiria on April 24 of the same year. The founder, Gregorio Bonnici, decreed that the <b>deeds</b> and <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> the church be passed on to the first-born of his successors.

The Source of Life Benevolent Society was a fraternal organization incorporated in New York on September 21, 1911. According to the state of New York incorporation records (Box 2, folder 12), the Society was founded “for the advancement of social, intellectual and moral and charitable purposes…to foster the bonds of brotherhood…to voluntarily afford relief and assistance to distressed and needy members and furnish ministration for the sick; to bury our dead and offer prayers for the repose of their souls according to the rites of the Hebrew faith, and to render voluntarily aid necessary in the proper preparation of the dead for burial. ” A Florida branch was incorporated in Miami on May 15, 1972 and registered as a charitable organization in 1984, at which point there was mention of a scholarship fund (box 1, folder 1).

40|$|Contrary to {{the common}} {{intention}} of a transferor (Schmidt) and transferee (Innova), an entire erf, instead of a subdivided portion of it, was transferred to Innova. This mistake was later discovered {{in the course of}} the liquidation process of Innova. During Schmidt's application to rectify the mistake, and in seeking clarification on the <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> the remaining extent of said erf, it was unsuccessfully contended that Schmidt was not entitled to any legal assistance in this respect, as his claim has prescribed; alternatively, he was estopped from any relief. The Supreme Court of Appeal again, indubitably, confirmed that the abstract theory applies to the passing <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> Consequently it was held that since neither Schmidt nor Innova, respectively, had the intention to transfer and obtain <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> the remaining extent of the erf, Innova had never become the owner of it. The Supreme Court of Appeal further held that there is no difference between the rectification of a contract on the one hand and the rectification <b>of</b> a <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> transfer on the other. It follows that the rectification of both a contract and <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> transfer does not constitute a "debt" as contemplated by section 10 of the Prescription Act 68 of 1969 which could be extinguished by prescription. An additional technical question concerning the procedure to be applied to rectify the incorrect <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> transfer was also introduced. Even though the Supreme Court of Appeal approved an amendment in terms of section 4 (1) (b) <b>of</b> the <b>Deeds</b> Registries Act 47 of 1937 (the act) in order to correct the mistake, the deeds community, especially through the Deeds Office intranet and grapevine, was notably sceptical about this ruling. For this purpose a detailed analysis is prepared to facilitate the various methods that may be applied to correct a defective <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> transfer. The possibilities investigated relate to an amendment in terms of section 4 (1) (b) of the act, cancellation <b>of</b> a <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> transfer according to section 6, a section 3 (1) (v) endorsement and a rectification transfer.
