At another place we had seen before, we dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else could we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> <b>without</b> meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E
500|$|The fourth major {{entry to}} the Guitar Hero series, at the time named Guitar Hero IV, was officially {{announced}} upon the merger of Activision and Vivendi Games in December 2007. [...] "We couldn't <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> Red Octane's support." [...] says the Guitar Hero Team. The game's new name, Guitar Hero World Tour, was officially announced by Activision in May 2008.|$|E
500|$|A {{day after}} the Leicester City match, Arsenal paraded the Premier League trophy on an open-top bus, in front of more than 250,000 fans. The victory parade {{commenced}} at Highbury and ended at Islington Town Hall. At the town hall balcony, Vieira addressed the crowd: [...] "It has been a fantastic season. We achieved something unbelievable but we couldn't <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> the fans." [...] In {{an interview with the}} BBC, Dein added: [...] "We've seen history made and I'd be surprised if it happens again. It's just been a privilege to watch Arsenal this season." ...|$|E
5|$|Many people {{weighed in}} on the {{decision}} on both national and local levels. Auriemma felt guilty that he put Sales through the ordeal and was angry that some columnists chose to fault her and not him. Auriemma was criticized for compromising {{the integrity of the}} game, but defended the decision saying it was a school record and he would never <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> Bascom's blessing.|$|R
2500|$|Gable did {{not want}} to shed tears for the scene after Rhett {{inadvertently}} causes Scarlett to miscarry their second child. Olivia de Havilland made him cry, later commenting, [...] "...Oh, he would not <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> He would not! Victor (Fleming) tried everything with him. He tried to attack him on a professional level. We <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> him weeping several times and then we had one last try. I said, 'You can <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> I know you can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and you will be wonderful...' Well, by heaven, just before the cameras rolled, you could see the tears come up at his eyes and he played the scene unforgettably well. He put his whole heart into it." ...|$|R
60|$|He made a {{sufficient}} impression upon me then, as I told {{you at the}} time. That was because I overheard his well-merited rebuke to Hopper. But I little dreamed that I was looking on {{the man who was}} {{to come out of the}} West and save this country from disunion. And how quietly and simply he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> <b>without</b> parade or pomp or vainglory. Of all those who, with every means at their disposal, have tried to conquer Lee, he is the only one who has in any manner succeeded. He has been able to hold him fettered while Sherman has swept the Confederacy. And these are the two men who were unknown when the war began.|$|R
500|$|Kevin O'Donnell from Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} {{although}} [...] "nytime Madonna announces a new video, it's a global event. And it's no different with [...] ", he called it [...] "her most bonkers video in years". Hicks from the San Jose Mercury News {{was impressed with the}} video, but felt Madonna could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> the guest appearances. Emilee Linder from MTV News observed that the video was completely different from the one released by Swift, but described it as [...] "action-packed" [...] in a different way, that of portraying a party. Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone declared that with the release of [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna, [...] "The age of blockbuster all-star music videos are upon us". Both Nolan Feeney from Time and August Brown from the Los Angeles Times noted that Madonna was able to successfully bring together her music industry peers in one video.|$|E
500|$|Arts, which Playford {{showed no}} {{personal}} interest in, and regarded as [...] "frills not fundamentals" [...] and [...] "non-productive", became a more prominent issue among the emerging middle-class. For his attitude, Playford was often mocked by his opponents and critics for his [...] "philistinism". The Nation derisorily quipped that [...] "It is axiomatic that the Premier draws his orchard spray {{gun at the}} mention of the word 'culture'". Sir Arthur Rymill, an LCL member of the upper house, criticised the demolition of the Theatre Royal, lobbied Playford for increased funding without success, pointing out that world-class performing arts venues were generally subsidised by the government. Hurtle Morphett, a former State President of the LCL, quipped that if Playford [...] "had wanted to convert the Art Gallery on North Terrace into a power house he would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> hesitation". In the 1960s, the Adelaide Festival started, while the Australian Dance Theatre and the State Theatre Company of South Australia was founded in the capital, with minimal assistance from Playford's government. The festival was well-received despite the effect of censorship in a state well known for social conservatism. With the success of the festival, public interest in arts increased, and with increasing calls for government funding, particularly from Dunstan, Playford finally agreed to fund the [...] "non-productive area" [...] in 1963 by allocating funding for the eventual building of the Festival Centre.|$|E
500|$|In what {{proved to}} be one of the {{tightest}} ever pitching duels in a perfect game, Joss took the mound for the Naps, while the White Sox pitcher was future Hall of Famer Ed Walsh. Neither pitcher would give up an earned run in the 1–0 game. Walsh, blistering through his own 39 win season, struck out 15 batters, gave up only one base on balls and allowed only four scattered hits by the Naps. The Naps' Joe Birmingham scored the team's only run, which came in the third inningthe lone, unearned run scored as a result of a botched pickoff play and a wild pitch. The tension in the ballpark was described by one writer as [...] "a mouse working his way along the grandstand floor would have sounded like a shovel scraping over concrete." [...] Joss, having faced the minimum 24 batters in the first eight inning, retired the first two batters in the bottom of the ninth. [...] Joss then faced White Sox pinch hitter John Anderson. Anderson hit a line drive that could have resulted in a double had it not gone foul. He then hit a ball to Naps third baseman Bill Bradley, which Bradley bobbled before throwing to first baseman George Stovall. Stovall dug the ball out of the dirt to achieve the final out. With the win, Joss recorded the second ever perfect game in MLB's modern era. He accomplished the feat with just 74 pitches, the lowest known pitch count ever achieved in a perfect game. Fans swarmed the field. After the game, Joss said, [...] "I never could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> Larry Lajoie's and Stovall's fielding and without Birmingham's base running. Walsh was marvelous with his splitter, and we needed two lucky strikes to win." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the right}} time and in the right frame of mind man is capable of stoic endurances that excite wonder and admiration. Mr Pickering was no weakling. He had once upset his {{automobile}} in a ditch, and had waited for twenty minutes until help came to relieve a broken arm, and he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> a murmur. But on the present occasion there was a difference. His mind was not adjusted for the occurrence. There are times when it is unseasonable to touch a man on the leg. This was a moment when it was unseasonable in the case of Mr Pickering. He bounded silently into the air, his whole being rent asunder as by a cataclysm.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the next}} morning the Captain went his way, and did ample homage to the kindly exertions made on his behalf by the two girls. [...] "Now I know you must have been up all night, for you couldn't <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> all <b>without</b> a servant in the house." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dead Space 3 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics upon release. Game Informer gave the game 9.75/10 saying, [...] "Dead Space 3 evolves the winning formula into a title not only befitting of the fantastic series, {{but also one}} of the best games of this generation." [...] Polygon gave the game 9.5/10 saying, [...] "Visceral hasn't just avoided screwing up its game with co-op — it has made it feel natural and at home, and <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> impacting the single-player experience in any negative way. That alone would be enough to make Dead Space 3 an achievement. But the new crafting system and bigger, more open level structure join co-op to make Dead Space 3 one of the best action games in years." ...|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] {{is used in}} its irreverent sense, as in [...] "blowing a raspberry". Wilson commented to {{the author}} of Blame It on the Dog: [...] "When I {{registered}} the term with the Library of Congress in 1980, they asked me, 'Why raspberry? What's the significance of that?' But since then, razz has pretty much permeated the culture. We couldn't <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> Hollywood's help." [...] Wilson {{is referred to as}} [...] "Ye Olde Head Razzberry". The ceremony's program is modeled after the Academy Awards, but is [...] "deliberately low-end and tacky". The awards themselves typically cost US$4.79 each, {{in the form of a}} [...] "golfball-sized raspberry" [...] which sits atop a Super 8 mm film reel; the whole of which is spray-painted gold.|$|E
2500|$|The IDF {{was heavily}} {{criticized by the}} Israeli press. The {{headline}} of Maariv read [...] "Foul-Up in the North - A Blow to the Army". The press also called for an investigation {{as to how the}} infiltration was possible. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir blamed Syria for the attack, saying [...] "It is clear that they could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> the patronage and the help of the Syrians", and stated that Israel held Syria responsible. Deputy Chief of Staff (Ramatkal) Ehud Barak vowed that the PFLP-GC [...] "will in due time pay the price". Speaking before the Knesset on 30 November, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin sent his condolences {{to the families of the}} casualties. He assured the residents of the Galilee that the IDF will do the best they can to prevent similar raids. However, he admitted that [...] "all the steps required by orders and procedures were not taken in this camp, which led to the grave consequences." ...|$|E

60|$|Before {{we reached}} New York, Mr. Crowder {{had made me}} promise that I would spend a few days with him {{at his home in}} that city. His family was small, he told me,--a wife, and a {{daughter}} about six,--and he wanted me to know them. Naturally we had become great friends. Very likely the man had saved my life, and he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> any act of heroism or daring, but simply by impressing me with the fact that his judgment was better than mine. I am apt to object to people of superior judgment, but Mr. Crowder was an exception to the ordinary superior person. From the way he talked it was plain that he 'had much experience of various sorts, and that he had greatly advantaged thereby; but he gave himself no airs on this account, and there was nothing patronizing about him. If I were able to tell him anything he did not know,--and I frequently was,--he was very glad to hear it.|$|R

Could he <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> them? Which {{could have come}} the nearest to doing it without the other? Ground was taken against it by the Republicans long before Douglas did it. The proposition of opposition to that measure is about five to one.

500|$|En Esch, {{one of the}} {{longtime}} core members of KMFDM, had almost {{nothing to do with}} Xtort, contributing to just two songs.

50|$|Reasons {{for wanting}} a solo home birth include: wanting a natural process, {{going through a}} {{polluted}} period, and increased self-confidence <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> alone.

6000|$|Nothing, I think, {{could be}} more moving, more beautiful, than this close. This piece is just one long, soulful, sardonic laugh at human life. Its title might {{properly}} be 'Is Life a Failure?' and leave the five acts {{to play with the}} answer. I am not at all sure that the author meant to laugh at life. I only notice that he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Without</b> putting into words any ungracious or discourteous things about life, the episodes in the piece seem to be saying all the time, inarticulately: 'Note what a silly poor thing human life is; how childish its ambitions, how ridiculous its pomps, how trivial its dignities, how cheap its heroisms, how capricious its course, how brief its flight, how stingy in happinesses, how opulent in miseries, how few its prides, how multitudinous its humiliations, how comic its tragedies, how tragic its comedies, how wearisome and monotonous its repetition of its stupid history through the ages, with never the introduction of a new detail; how hard it has tried, from the Creation down, to play itself upon its possessor as a boon and has never proved its case in a single instance!' ...|$|R

60|$|On {{one of our}} trips Mr. Smythe and I got out at {{a station}} to walk up and down, and {{when we came back}} Smythe's bed was in the hanging shelf and an English cavalry officer was in bed on the sofa which he had lately been occupying. It was mean to be glad about it, but it is the way we are made; I could not have been gladder if it had been my enemy that had {{suffered}} this misfortune. We all like to see people in trouble, if it doesn't cost us anything. I was so happy over Mr. Smythe's chagrin that I couldn't go to sleep for thinking of it and enjoying it. I knew he supposed the officer had committed the robbery himself, whereas without a doubt the officer's servant <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> his knowledge. Mr. Smythe kept this incident warm in his heart, and longed for a chance to get even with somebody for it. Sometime afterward the opportunity came, in Calcutta. We were leaving on a 24-hour journey to Darjeeling. Mr. Barclay, the general superintendent, has made special provision for our accommodation, Mr. Smythe said; so {{there was no need to}} hurry about getting to the train; consequently, we were a little late.|$|R

He <b>had</b> already <b>done</b> all that was difficult in the matter, and <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> any awkwardness. He had already made himself master of her heart, and it was only necessary now that he should enter in and take possession. The ripe fruit had fallen, as Miss Furnival had once chosen to express it, and there he was to pick it up,--if only he considered it worth his trouble to do so. That manner of the picking would not signify much, as Madeline thought. That he desired to take it into his garner and preserve it for his life's use was everything to her, but the method of his words at the present moment was not much. He was her lord and master. He was the one man who had conquered and taken possession of her spirit; and as to his being awkward, there was not much in that. Nor do I say that he was awkward. He spoke his mind in honest, plain terms, and I do not know he could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better.|$|R
