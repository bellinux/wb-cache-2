40|$|PURPOSE. Infantile {{strabismus}} {{in humans}} and the monkey {{is associated with}} maldevelopment of visual motion responsive-ness, one manifestation of which is directionally asymmetric motion visual evoked potentials (motion VEPs). Early repair of strabismus in infant monkeys {{has been shown to}} restore nor-mal development of motion responsiveness for pursuit and optokinetic eye movements (optokinetic nystagmus [OKN]). The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how early versus delayed repair of strabismus influences the development or maldevelopment of motion VEPs. METHODS. Optical strabismus was created in infant macaques by fitting them with prism goggles on day 1 of life. The Early Repair group wore the <b>goggles</b> <b>for</b> a period of 3 weeks (the equivalent of 3 months before surgical repair in humans), whereas the Delayed Repair group wore the <b>goggles</b> <b>for...</b>|$|R

50|$|In vision therapy of {{amblyopia}} and of intermittent central suppression, {{liquid crystal}} devices {{have been used for}} purposes of enhanced occlusion therapy. In this scenario, the amblyopic patient wears electronically programmable liquid crystal glasses or <b>goggles</b> <b>for</b> continuously for several hours during regular everyday activities. Wearing the device encourages or forces the patient to use both eyes alternatingly, similar to eye patching, but rapidly alternating in time. The aim is to circumvent the patient's tendency to suppress the field of view of the weaker eye and to train the patient's capacity for binocular vision. The goggles mostly feature a much slower flicker rate than the more well-known active shutter 3D glasses.|$|R
