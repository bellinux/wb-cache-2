Without intensifying <b>further,</b> <b>the</b> depression crossed the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula on September26. The next day, the depression turned toward the north in the central Gulf of Mexico before beginning a northeast motion. On September28, Debbie intensified into a tropical storm, attaining peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). This occurred after the storm developed two distinct spiral rainbands.|$|E
