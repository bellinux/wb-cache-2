25|$|Morris {{contends that}} there is no two-state {{solution}} to the Middle <b>East</b> <b>crisis,</b> and that the One-state solution is not viable because of Arab unwillingness to accept a Jewish national presence in the Middle East and cultural differences including less Arab respect for human life and rule of law.

In particular, this paper describes how the conditionality has been adjusted in reponse to strong criticim by the international community made after the <b>East</b> Asian <b>crisis.</b> Also, a detailed comparison is made between the <b>East</b> Asian <b>crisis</b> and the current crises in Iceland, Ukraine, Lativia and Hungary, with respect to IMf-supported problems and conditionality. ...|$|R

2500|$|On June 19, 1967 President Johnson {{declared}} the five principles, including land for peace, {{that he believed}} comprised the components of any United Nations settlement of the Middle <b>East</b> <b>crisis.</b> He pledged the U.S. Government would [...] "do its part for peace in every forum, at every level, at every hour". On July 12, 1967, Secretary of State Rusk announced that the U.S. position on the Near <b>East</b> <b>crisis</b> was outlined in the President's statement of June 19 and that it {{provided the basis for}} a just and equitable settlement between the Arab states and Israel. On August 16, 1967 the Israeli Foreign Office stated that Israel agreed with the principles set forth by the President on June 19 and indicated that no resolution would be acceptable if it deviated from them.|$|E

2500|$|On 2 June, Powell spoke {{against the}} {{stationing}} of American Cruise missiles in Britain and claimed the United States had an obsessive {{sense of mission}} and a hallucinatory view of international relations: [...] "The American nation, as we have watched their proceedings during these last 25 years, will not, when another Atlantic crisis, another Middle <b>East</b> <b>crisis</b> or another European crisis comes, wait upon the deliberations of the British Cabinet, whose {{point of view and}} appreciation of the situation will be so different from their own".|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that credit rating agencies aggravated the <b>East</b> Asian <b>crisis.</b> In fact, having jailed {{to predict the}} emergence of the crisis, rating agencies became excessively conservative. They downgraded <b>East</b> Asian <b>crisis</b> countries more than the worsening in these countries' economic fundamentals would justify. This unduly exacerbated, for these countries, the cost of borrowing abroad and caused the supply of international capital to them to evaporate. In turn, lower than deserved ratings contributed [...] at least for some time [...] to amplify the <b>East</b> Asian <b>crisis.</b> Although this goes beyond the scope of our paper we also propose an endogenous rationale for rating agencies to become excessively conservative after having made blatant errors in predicting the <b>East</b> Asian <b>crisis.</b> Specifically, rating agencies would have an incentive to become more conservative, so as to recover from the damage these errors caused to them and to rebuild their own reputation...|$|R

2500|$|The {{economy was}} soon in turmoil again, with the Middle <b>East</b> <b>crisis</b> between Egypt and Israel raising oil prices. Furthermore, {{the economy was}} hit in mid-September when a {{national}} dock strike lasted for eight weeks. A run on Sterling began with the six-day war and with {{the closure of the}} Suez Canal and with the dock strike, the balance of payments deficit grew to a critical level. A Common Market report suggested that the pound could not be sustained as a reserve currency and it was suggested again that the pound should be devalued. Wilson and Callaghan refused a contingency fund offered from the IMF because of several conditions attached. On Wednesday 15 November, the historic decision was taken to commit the government to a 14.3% devaluation. The situation was a great political controversy at the time.

2500|$|The {{support of}} Palestinians is {{frequently}} {{due to the}} consideration of them as people of color—Andrew Hacker writes: [...] "The presence of Israel in the Middle East is perceived as thwarting the rightful status of people of color. Some blacks view Israel as essentially a white and European power, supported from the outside, and occupying space that rightfully belongs to the original inhabitants of Palestine." [...] Martin Luther King Jr. criticized this position at the 68th Annual Rabbinical Assembly for Conservative Judaism, [...] "On the Middle <b>East</b> <b>crisis,</b> we have had various responses. The responses of the so-called young militants does not represent {{the position of the}} vast majority of Negroes.
