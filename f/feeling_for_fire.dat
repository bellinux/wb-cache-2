Near to it was a large, hollow-surfaced rock, filled now with water like a bath. From this she drank, then washed and tidied herself as well as she could without the aid of soap, comb or towels, which done, she returned to the cave.|$|R

5000|$|As Kristina's romantic {{feelings}} on Ethan re-emerged, {{she began to}} openly pursue him. Ethan's mixed signals towards Kristina for several months only compounded the problem, especially {{when he made his}} marriage to Maya seem like it was simply a business arrangement. This became an issue when Kristina boarded a plane to accompany Ethan to the Dominican Republic on June 9 so he could obtain a quickie divorce from Maya, which led to her father contemplating Ethan's murder when he discovered their trip to the Dominican Republic (with Alexis and Sonny assuming {{they were going to get}} married). After a few days of fun in the sun and a humorous mix-up in the divorce officiator's office, her parents escorted the two back to Port Charles. Sonny, in particular, seems especially against Ethan having any sort of relationship with his daughter and has threatened Ethan's life numerous times in order to reinforce that belief. Ethan, however, has been adamant about continuing his association with Kristina, with or without Sonny's approval. In a discussion about Ethan and Kristina's relationship, Alexis pointed out to Sonny he had no problem with his son living with a woman ten years his senior, which led to Sonny's retort Michael's situation with Abby was different because Michael was [...] "a boy." [...] Their trip to the Dominican Republic only stoked the flames of Kristina's desire to be with Ethan. On June 24, under the guise of planning a trip abroad for a college class, Kristina invites Ethan to the Lake House, where she created a romantic setting and flirted with him and, ultimately, kissing him upon Ethan's invitation to see if she still has <b>feelings</b> <b>for</b> him once they have kissed. After the kiss, Kristina informs Ethan she still has romantic <b>feelings</b> <b>for</b> him, but their conversation is interrupted by Alexis and Molly coming home. Months later, Kristina was accosted by Anthony Zacchara, who threatened her as a means to get to Sonny. Ethan intervened, much to her relief, and turned Anthony away, causing Kristina to become grateful to Ethan. Ethan went to see Michael about Kristina's feelings towards him, but Michael pointed out Ethan did little to dissuade her romantic <b>feelings</b> <b>for</b> him for several months. Afterwards, Ethan, Michael, and Abby formulated a plan that involved Ethan feigning interest in Abby in order to get Kristina to move on from Ethan. Kristina was not fooled by the deception, however. After several months of sending Kristina mixed signals about their relationship, Ethan finally told Kristina on July 7 about her skewed perceptions about the two of them together. Kristina, while taken aback, is nonetheless determined to prove Ethan does, in fact, care about her. In an attempt to protect Ethan, Kristina goes to see Johnny Zacchara, Ethan's employer and friend, with the request he fire Ethan in an attempt to get him out of harm's way. Throughout all of this, Ethan himself has shown on numerous occasions he could also be developing <b>feelings</b> <b>for</b> her, albeit conflicted, through the actions which he has taken in Kristina's honor, i.e. protecting her with an intensity that eventually caused Johnny to urge him to admit he likes her. Johnny, in particular, calls Ethan out on having <b>feelings</b> <b>for</b> Kristina, and <b>fires</b> him.|$|R
