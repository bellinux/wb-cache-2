I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
500|$|Bowyer {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Bowyer also earned $248,250 in race winnings. Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, [...] "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, we were one of the fastest cars here. That’s what it takes to run at this level, {{to be a part of}} that Chase, if we can go and continue to have as much fun as we did this weekend. I know it’s the key, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to my success." ...|$|E

Small of stature at 5 feet 5inches tall and {{weighing}} only 100 pounds (45kg), her husband was nicknamed [...] "Little Billy".

2500|$|Red Shirt {{adopted a}} show {{business}} persona and {{proved to be}} a statesman. Red Shirt presented an image of Native Americans that Europeans could associate with progress, nobility, and civilization. Queen Victoria adored Chief Red Shirt and requested a special command performance. Red Shirt commented to The Brisbane Courier [...] on the future of Natives in the United States. [...] "The red man is changing in every season. [...] The Native of the next generation will not be the Native of the last. [...] Our buffaloes are nearly all gone, the deer have entirely vanished, and the white man takes more and more of our land. But the United States government is good. True, it has taken away our land, and the white man have eaten up our deer and our buffalo, but the government now gives us food that we may not starve. They are educating our children and teaching them to use farm implements. [...] Our children will learn the white man’s civilization and to live like him. [...] It is our only outlook in the future. [...] Now we are dependent upon the rations of the Government but we feel we are fully entitled to that bounty. [...] It {{is a part of the}} price they pay for the land they have taken from us, and some compensation to us for having killed off the herds upon which we subsisted. [...] For myself, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> no use fighting against the United States government. [...] I accept my fate. [...] The red man cannot kill all the white men that live in villages as big as the largest forests. [...] But some of our young men do not know this, and they may perhaps elect to die like their fathers with their tomahawks in their hands rather than starve to death like a dog upon the prairie." ...|$|E
