5|$|Immediately {{after the}} trials Sissoi Veliky {{was ordered to}} join the Mediterranean Squadron which was engaged in the naval {{blockade}} of Crete {{in the wake of}} the 1896 Cretan riots and the Hamidian massacres. Her maiden voyage revealed more problems; the lack of ventilation in the steering compartment was so appalling that during the first port call the captain purchased <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> with his own money and the electrical systems failed one by one before reaching Gibraltar. The copper rings for sealing the portholes were left in Kronstadt and were not found until February 1897.|$|E

25|$|The Kayak Experience: After {{the second}} visitor {{death in the}} park's history in 1982 {{occurred}} at this ride, it was closed permanently.

25|$|When {{electricity}} {{was first}} introduced into houses, it was primarily used for lighting. At that time, many electricity companies operated a split-tariff system where the cost of electricity for lighting was lower than that for other purposes. This led to portable appliances (such as vacuum cleaners, <b>electric</b> <b>fans,</b> and hair driers) being connected to light bulb sockets using lampholder plugs.|$|E
25|$|The theatre {{incorporated}} several cooling features. Four small waterfalls {{were located}} {{on either side}} of the proscenium arch, intended to cool the audience in tandem with <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> and a retractable dome in the ceiling. The dome was split down the middle, with each half sliding to either side to open. The dome was decorated in imitation of an umbrella, with panels of gold and silver with scrollwork embellishment. The artificial waterfalls were removed early in the life of the theatre.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{equipped}} with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to {{all parts of the}} vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water supply was taken aboard while Titanic was in port, but in an emergency the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by <b>electric</b> <b>fans,</b> around the ship, and First Class cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} surviving oast {{house is}} at Golford, Cranbrook near Tunbridge Wells. It dates from {{sometime in the}} 17th Century and closely mirrors the first documentary evidence on oasts soon after their introduction of hops into England in the mid 16th century. Early oast houses were simply adapted barns but, by the 18th Century, the distinctive tall buildings with conical roofs had been developed to increase the draught. At first these were square but around 1800 roundel kilns were developed {{in the belief that}} they were more efficient. Square kilns remained more popular in Hereford and Worcester and came back into fashion in the south east in the later 19th Century. In the 1930s, the cowls were replaced by louvred openings as <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> and diesel oil ovens were employed.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, {{the church}} was {{elevated}} {{to the status of}} cathedral when the Diocese of Malacca was revived. Bishop Edouard Gasnier, the first bishop of the revived Diocese of Malacca died in 1896 and is interred in the cathedral. His successor, Bishop René-Michel-Marie Fée, was the first bishop consecrated in the cathedral in 1896. Although {{the church was}} elevated to the status of cathedral in 1888, the consecration ceremony was performed only on 14 February 1897 when the cathedral had finally repaid its debts incurred from the extension of the nave in 1888. Improvements were gradually made to the cathedral. The dwarf wall, gate pillars, and ornamental cast iron gates and railings around the grounds were completed in 1908. The Gallery Organ was in place by 1912, while electric lighting came in 1913 and <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> in 1914.|$|E
25|$|Champneys {{suggested}} that, {{in order}} to protect the books and manuscripts, 'it will be very desirable to keep the air in the interior of the building as clear and free from smoke and chemical matter (both of which are held in the air of Manchester) as may be possible'. The ground floor was built with numerous air inlets and, although his client felt it would prove impossible to exclude foul air, Champneys installed jute or hessian screens to trap the soot, with water sprays to catch the sulphur and other chemicals, which was a very advanced system for the period. Internal screen doors were employed in the entrance hall to prevent the air being 'fouled by the opening of the outer doors' with internal swing doors between the circulation areas and the main library to 'preserve the valuable books from injury'. By 1900 the ventilation system had evolved to include <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> to draw in air at pavement level through coke screens sprayed with water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cooling {{equipment}} is the frequent occurrence of fire despite {{the absence of}} the heating element. National fire statistics in 2013 show that a total of 263 fires occurred in the cooling equipment and the number of <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> has 145 fire cases. This is accounted for 55. 1 % of the whole. <b>Electric</b> <b>fan</b> is the electrical appliance that the heat is generated on the winding wire and the iron core. If such characteristic is not controled properly, fire would break out at the <b>electric</b> <b>fan.</b> also there is a gap filled with an insulator between connection terminals of the capacitor in the <b>electric</b> <b>fan.</b> But in case that the gap on the capacitor is covered with some conductive material such as dust, there would be a fire as well caused by electrical heating locally. Although many studies related with those have been conducted, <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> fire is continuously occurred. In this study, thermal characteristics and current signal in various conditions such as the heat generation of windings including iron cores of the motor and the dielectric breakdown of terminals on the capacitor connected to the motor were detected.

25|$|The {{local news}} papers in Hamburg {{were full of}} praise for the modern crew accommodations: The crew of 38 had all a single cabin, except a few mess-boys who were in double berth cabins below the main deck. However, no air {{condition}} was fitted in the entire passenger and crew accommodations, but individual <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> only, {{in addition to the}} central ventilation system. The upper deck was reserved for 12 passengers, accommodated in 10 single and in one double cabin, all with their own bath rooms. The charterers requested from the owners, that two stewardesses are employed on each ship to look after the well-being of the passengers. The forward front of the superstructure housed the dining room, smoking saloon and the bar, where the captain, chief engineer and first officer were dining with the passengers. The public rooms and the cabins were tastefully furnished with plenty of wood. The boat deck was strictly reserved for the master, the deck officers and the radio operator. The single cabins for the deck crew and the motormen were on the poop deck on two levels. These cabins had a washbasin, but toilettes and showers were for common use. In the deckhouse on the top was the crew bar. The mess rooms with a small pantry for the deck crew and the motormen were located in the aft mast house. Mid ships on the main deck were the engineer's and the chief engineer's cabins, the cabins of the chief steward and the cooks, the galley and the officer's mess. Even the engineers, except for the chief, had a communal shower and toilette.|$|E
500|$|The initial design had two islands {{with the}} flight deck running between them. Each island {{contained}} one funnel; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were connected by braces and the bridge was mounted {{on top of the}} bracing, which left a clear height of [...] for the aircraft on {{the flight deck}}. Fairly early in the design process, {{the decision was made to}} delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by <b>electric</b> <b>fans.</b> They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large <b>electric</b> <b>fans.</b>|$|E
