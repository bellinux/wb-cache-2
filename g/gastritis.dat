5|$|Up to 85% {{of people}} {{infected}} with H. pylori never experience symptoms or complications. Acute infection may appear as an acute <b>gastritis</b> with abdominal pain (stomach ache) or nausea. Where this develops into chronic <b>gastritis,</b> the symptoms, if present, are often those of non-ulcer dyspepsia: stomach pains, nausea, bloating, belching, and sometimes vomiting or black stool.|$|E
5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found {{usually in}} the stomach. It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who {{found that it was}} present in a person with chronic <b>gastritis</b> and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or <b>gastritis</b> seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Mortality under captivity is {{generally}} high; reasons include stillbirths, birth defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, neglect of cubs by mothers, and infectious diseases. A study comparing {{the health of}} captive and wild cheetahs noted that despite having similar genetic make-up, wild cheetahs are far healthier than their captive counterparts. The study identified possible stress factors such as restricted habitat and interaction with human beings and other carnivores, and recommended private and spacious areas for captive cheetahs. A study of diseases suffered by captive cheetahs in the period 1989–92 in several North American zoos showed that hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a disease of the liver, had affected 82% of the deceased cheetahs, caused nine deaths, and occurred in 51% of living females. Chronic <b>gastritis</b> was detected in 91% of the population. Glomerulosclerosis, a disease of the kidneys, emerged as another significant disease, affecting 84% of the cheetahs; another renal disease, nephrosclerosis, affected 39% of the cheetahs. Feline infectious peritonitis caused two deaths. Pneumonia was a major cause for juvenile deaths. Another study concluded that excess of vitaminA in their diets could result in veno-occlusive disease in their livers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastritis</b> {{may also}} develop after major surgery or {{traumatic}} injury ("Cushing ulcer"), burns ("Curling ulcer"), or severe infections. <b>Gastritis</b> may also occur {{in those who}} have had weight loss surgery resulting in the banding or reconstruction of the digestive tract.|$|E
25|$|For <b>gastritis,</b> {{drinking}} viscous lidocaine {{may help}} with the pain.|$|E
25|$|Wallace died {{at home in}} Crawfordsville, on February 15, 1905, of atrophic <b>gastritis.</b> He was seventy-seven years old. Wallace {{is buried}} in Crawfordsville Oak Hill Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|A major {{causative factor}} (60% of gastric {{and up to}} 50–75% of {{duodenal}} ulcers) is chronic inflammation due to Helicobacter pylori that colonizes the antral mucosa. The immune system is unable to clear the infection, despite the appearance of antibodies. Thus, the bacterium can cause a chronic active <b>gastritis</b> (type B <b>gastritis).</b> Gastrin stimulates the production of gastric acid by parietal cells. In H. pylori colonization responses to increased gastrin, the increase in acid {{can contribute to the}} erosion of the mucosa and therefore ulcer formation.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol use {{increases}} the risk of chronic <b>gastritis</b> (stomach inflammation); it is one cause of cirrhosis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis in both its chronic and acute forms.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} {{of cases of}} H. pylori infection will eventually lead to an ulcer and {{a larger proportion of}} people will get non-specific discomfort, abdominal pain or <b>gastritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bilious {{vomiting}} {{syndrome is}} vomiting {{in response to}} bile-induced inflammation of the stomach. Bile salts interfere with the gastric mucosal barrier, allowing acid to irritate the stomach lining and cause <b>gastritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomachs of {{more than}} half of the world's population, and the {{infection}} continues to play a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of gastroduodenal diseases. Colonization of the gastric mucosa with Helicobacter pylori results in the development of chronic <b>gastritis</b> in infected individuals, and in a subset of patients chronic <b>gastritis</b> progresses to complications (e.g., ulcer disease, stomach cancers, some distinct extragastric disorders). However, over 80 percent of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic and it has been postulated that it may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of studies have {{indicated}} that most cases of peptic ulcers, and <b>gastritis,</b> in humans are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, and an association has been seen with the development of stomach cancer.|$|E
25|$|Antacids are {{a common}} {{treatment}} for mild to medium <b>gastritis.</b> When antacids do not provide enough relief, medications such as H2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors that help {{reduce the amount of}} acid are often prescribed.|$|E
25|$|Kcne2-/- mice exhibit achlorhydria, gastric hyperplasia, and mis-trafficking of KCNQ1 to the parietal cell basal membrane. The mis-trafficking {{occurs because}} KCNE3 is {{upregulated}} in the parietal cells of Kcne2-/- mice, and hijacks KCNQ1, {{taking it to}} the basolateral membrane. When both Kcne2 and Kcne3 are germline-deleted in mice, KCNQ1 traffics to the parietal cell apical membrane but the gastric phenotype is even worse than for Kcne2-/- mice, emphasizing that KCNQ1 requires KCNE2 co-assembly for functional attributes other than targeting in parietal cells. Kcne2-/- mice also develop <b>gastritis</b> cystica profunda and gastric neoplasia. Human KCNE2 downregulation is also observed in sites of <b>gastritis</b> cystica profunda and gastric adenocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastritis</b> is {{inflammation}} of {{the lining of the}} stomach. It may occur as a short episode or may be of a long duration. There may be no symptoms but, when symptoms are present, the most common is upper abdominal pain. Other possible symptoms include nausea and vomiting, bloating, loss of appetite and heartburn. Complications may include bleeding, stomach ulcers, and stomach tumors. When due to autoimmune problems, low red blood cells due to not enough vitamin B12 may occur, a condition known as pernicious anemia. Endoscopy, a type of X-ray known as an upper gastrointestinal series, blood tests, and stool tests may help with diagnosis. The symptoms of <b>gastritis</b> may be a presentation of a myocardial infarction. Other conditions with similar symptoms include {{inflammation of}} the pancreas, gallbladder problems, and peptic ulcer disease.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are another {{common cause of}} unexplained weight loss – in fact {{they are the most}} common non-cancerous cause of idiopathic weight loss. Possible gastrointestinal etiologies of unexplained weight loss include: celiac disease, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease (crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), pancreatitis, <b>gastritis,</b> diarrhea and many other GI conditions.|$|E
25|$|Helicobacter pylori was {{identified}} in 1982 by two Australian scientists, Robin Warren and Barry J. Marshall as a causative factor for ulcers. In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most gastric ulcers and <b>gastritis</b> {{were caused by}} colonization with this bacterium, not by stress or spicy food as had been assumed before.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} <b>gastritis</b> {{experience}} no symptoms at all. However, upper central abdominal pain {{is the most}} common symptom; the pain may be dull, vague, burning, aching, gnawing, sore, or sharp. Pain is usually located in the upper central portion of the abdomen, but it may occur anywhere from the upper left portion of the abdomen around to the back.|$|E
25|$|A gastric {{peptic ulcer}} is a mucosal {{perforation}} which penetrates the muscularis mucosae and lamina propria, usually produced by acid-pepsin aggression. Ulcer margins are perpendicular and present chronic <b>gastritis.</b> During the active phase, {{the base of}} the ulcer shows 4 zones: fibrinoid necrosis, inflammatory exudate, granulation tissue and fibrous tissue. The fibrous base of the ulcer may contain vessels with thickened wall or with thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastritis</b> is {{believed}} to affect about half of people worldwide. In 2013 there were approximately 90 million new cases of the condition. As people get older the disease becomes more common. It, along with a similar condition {{in the first part}} of the intestines known as duodenitis, resulted in 50,000 deaths in 2015. H. pylori was first discovered in 1981 by Barry Marshall and Robin Warren.|$|E
25|$|One should {{watch for}} side effects like <b>gastritis</b> and {{salicylate}} poisoning. In children and teenagers, {{the use of}} aspirin and aspirin-containing products {{can be associated with}} Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially deadly condition. The risks, benefits, and alternative treatments must always be considered when administering aspirin and aspirin-containing products in children and teenagers. Ibuprofen for pain and discomfort and corticosteroids for moderate to severe inflammatory reactions manifested by rheumatic fever should be considered in children and teenagers.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{avoiding}} things {{that cause the}} disease. Treatment includes medications such as antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors. During an acute attack drinking viscous lidocaine may help. If <b>gastritis</b> is due to NSAIDs these may be stopped. If H. pylori is present it may be treated {{with a combination of}} antibiotics such as amoxicillin and clarithromycin. For those with pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 supplements are recommended either by mouth or by injection. People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them.|$|E
25|$|The H. pylori {{hypothesis}} was initially poorly received, so {{in an act}} of self-experimentation Marshall drank a Petri dish containing a culture of organisms extracted from a person with an ulcer and five days later developed <b>gastritis.</b> His symptoms disappeared after two weeks, but he took antibiotics to kill the remaining bacteria at the urging of his wife, since halitosis is one of the symptoms of infection. This experiment was published in 1984 in the Australian Medical Journal and is among the most cited articles from the journal.|$|E
25|$|Frequently alcoholics have {{disrupted}} social {{links in}} their lives and have an irregular lifestyle. This may cause an alcoholic to change their eating habits including more missed meals and a poor dietary balance. Alcoholism may also result in loss of appetite, alcoholic <b>gastritis,</b> and vomiting, which decrease food intake. Alcohol abuse damages the lining of the gastrointestinal system and reduces absorption of nutrients that are taken in. The combination of all of them may result in a nutritional deficiency that is linked to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} potential {{side effect of}} spironolactone is hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which, in severe cases, can be life-threatening. Hyperkalemia in these patients can present as a non anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Spironolactone may put patients at a heightened risk for gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and <b>gastritis.</b> In addition, {{there has been some}} evidence suggesting an association between use of the drug and bleeding from the stomach and duodenum, though a causal relationship between the two has not been established. Also, spironolactone {{has been shown to be}} immunosuppressive in the treatment of sarcoidosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{stress of}} racing year round and on several continents {{eventually}} caused medical problems for Stewart. During the 1972 Grand Prix season {{he missed the}} Belgian Grand Prix at Nivelles due to <b>gastritis,</b> and had to cancel plans to drive a Can-Am McLaren, but won the Argentine, French, U.S. and Canadian Grands Prix, to come second to Emerson Fittipaldi in the drivers' standings. Stewart also competed in a Ford Capri RS2600 in the European Touring Car Championship, with F1 teammate François Cevert and other F1 pilots, at a time where the competition between Ford and BMW was at a height. Their best result was at the 6 Hours of Paul Ricard, finishing second. 1n 1972 Stewart also received the OBE.|$|E
25|$|Prunus mume is {{a common}} fruit in Asia and used in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine. It has long {{been used as a}} traditional drug and healthy food in East Asian countries. A recent study has indicated that Prunus mume extract is a potential candidate for developing an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with several oral pathogenic bacteria. Recent studies have also shown that Prunus mume extract may inhibit Helicobacter pylori, associated with <b>gastritis</b> and gastric ulcers. Experiments on rats suggest that P. mume extract administered during endurance exercise training may enhance the oxidative capacity of exercising skeletal muscle, and may induce the muscle to prefer fatty acids for its fuel use rather than amino acids or carbohydrates, thus assisting endurance.|$|E
25|$|Absorption of food vitamin B12 thus {{requires}} an intact and functioning stomach, exocrine pancreas, intrinsic factor, and small bowel. Problems with {{any one of}} these organs makes a vitamin B12 deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B12. In pernicious anemia, {{there is a lack of}} IF due to autoimmune atrophic <b>gastritis,</b> in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B12 protective function. Due to the complexity of B12 absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B12 deficiency. This results in 80–100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30–60% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.|$|E
25|$|Aged 15, it was Anne's {{first time}} away from home, and she made few friends at Roe Head. She was quiet and hard working, and {{determined}} to stay and get the education she needed to support herself. She stayed for two years, winning a good-conduct medal in December 1836, and returning home only during Christmas and summer holidays. Anne and Charlotte {{do not appear to}} have been close while at Roe Head (Charlotte's letters almost never mention her) but Charlotte was concerned about her sister's health. Sometime before December 1837, Anne became seriously ill with <b>gastritis</b> and underwent a religious crisis. A Moravian minister was called to see her several times during her illness, suggesting her distress was caused, in part, by conflict with the local Anglican clergy. Charlotte wrote to her father who took Anne home where she remained while she recovered.|$|E
25|$|Barium X-ray {{examinations}} {{are useful}} tools {{for the study}} of appearance and function of the parts of the gastrointestinal tract. They are used to diagnose and monitor esophageal reflux, dysphagia, hiatus hernia, strictures, diverticula, pyloric stenosis, <b>gastritis,</b> enteritis, volvulus, varices, ulcers, tumors, and gastrointestinal dysmotility, as well as to detect foreign bodies. Historically barium X-ray examinations are the standard approach used to assess and diagnose diseases of the gut, but they are increasingly being replaced by more modern techniques such as computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, endoscopy and capsule endoscopy. However, barium contrast imaging remains a common diagnostic test, which has the advantage of lower costs and being more widely available as compared to newer techniques. Newer techniques are also not able to assess superficial mucosal lesions in as much detail as some barium X-ray techniques such as enteroclysis.|$|E
