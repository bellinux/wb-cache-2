5|$|In February 1884, the <b>Impeachment</b> <b>trial</b> of Prime Minister Christian Selmer and {{his entire}} cabinet was nearing its end.

5|$|Koht's role in {{the weak}} and unorganised defense against Operation Weserübung was debated {{during and after the}} occupation. After the World War, a {{commission}} named Undersøkelseskommisjonen av 1945 ("Scrutiny Commission of 1945") was set to scrutinise the actions of the Norwegian government in 1940. It concluded with a partial criticism of Koht's dispositions. After receiving Undersøkelseskommisjonen analysis, Koht volunteered to undergo an <b>Impeachment</b> <b>trial.</b> The Parliament of Norway did not find it necessary, and no such trial took place.|$|E

He was one of {{the eleven}} votes during the trial that {{successfully}} voted to block the opening of an envelope that was believed to contain proof of the corruption charges against Estrada. Public anger over the Senate vote triggered the EDSA Revolution of 2001, leading to the ouster of Estrada and the accession of Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the presidency.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1678, Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on {{the charge}} of high treason. Although {{much of the nation}} had sought war with Catholic France, Charles had {{secretly}} negotiated with Louis XIV, trying to reach an agreement under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles's wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Danby from the <b>impeachment</b> <b>trial,</b> Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.|$|E
5|$|The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges. The Senate {{refused to}} meet to hold an <b>impeachment</b> <b>trial</b> {{before the end of}} the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was {{represented}} by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly. The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} Constitutionally {{mandated}} requirements for <b>impeachment</b> <b>trials.</b> The provision that Senators must sit on oath or affirmation {{was designed to}} impress upon them the extreme seriousness of the occasion. The stipulation that the Chief Justice is to preside over presidential <b>impeachment</b> <b>trials</b> underscores the solemnity of the occasion and aims to avoid the possible conflict of interest of a Vice President's presiding over the proceeding {{for the removal of}} the one official standing between him (or her) and the presidency. The specification that a two-thirds supermajority vote of those Senators present is necessary in order to convict designed to facilitate serious deliberation and to make removal possible only through a consensus that cuts across factional divisions.|$|R

5|$|The {{office of}} Vice President had been vacant sixteen times {{due to the}} death or {{resignation}} of the Vice President or his succession to the presidency. For example, there was no Vice President for nearly {{four years after the}} assassination of Abraham Lincoln. During the impeachment of Andrew Johnson there was no Vice President to succeed him. At that time, the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 provided that the President pro tempore of the Senate would succeed Johnson if he was removed from office. Had the <b>impeachment</b> <b>trial</b> of Andrew Johnson resulted in Johnson being removed from office, Senator Benjamin Wade, then the President pro tempore of the Senate, would have become acting president pending a special presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an <b>Impeachment</b> <b>trial</b> with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Christian Selmer was impeached on 27 February; {{his cabinet}} members {{followed}} one by one, the last being impeached on 1 April. On 11 March, Selmer resigned. Two acting Prime Ministers {{were drawn from}} his cabinet; Ole Bachke from 11 to 29 March and Niels Mathias Rye from 29 March to 3 April. Then, a new cabinet led by Selmer's former Minister of Finance Christian Homann Schweigaard was formed, but in reality it stood no chance of surviving as it faced the Liberal-dominated Parliament, whose means of pressuring the executive branch had been strengthened following the <b>Impeachment</b> <b>trial.</b> In June, as Schweigaard entered his last month as Prime Minister, the King summoned mathematics professor Ole Jacob Broch to form a compromise cabinet, but this failed owing to Conservative opposition, spearheaded by up-and-coming politician Emil Stang. Broch gave up on 22 June, and Johan Sverdrup became Prime Minister on 26 June. In light of this change in circumstances, the case against Hol had been annulled by Royal Resolution earlier on 6 June.|$|E
