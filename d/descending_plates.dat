30|$|The frequency-magnitude {{distribution}} (b-value) for seismicity {{within the}} Pacific plate is not definitely homogeneous. An anomaly of b-value higher than 0.9 is detected within the descending Pacific {{plate in the}} Hokkaido corner. In the western Hokkaido, the anomaly exists {{at a depth of}} about 150 km, which is directly beneath active volcanoes. In the eastern Hokkaido, the anomalies exist at approximately 200 and 300 km depths, which is tens of kilometers sideways from active volcanoes. The results obtained in this paper are more reliable than previous studies on b-value heterogeneity within <b>descending</b> <b>plates,</b> since I used a catalog homogeneous, both in time and space, which was obtained through re-examination of all seismograms and relocation of hypocentral parameters based on arrival times from fixed seismic stations.|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} the earth's crust is {{presented}} as a set of rigid crustal blocks in which the crust is consumed, compressed, or created only at the boundaries of the blocks. As such the trench boundary moves with respect to the colliding plates because of down-buckling {{at the corner of the}} <b>descending</b> <b>plate.</b> It is further shown that this mechanism requires plate consumption of the <b>descending</b> <b>plate</b> at a rate faster than the relative plate motion, which in turn causes infilling of the basin behind the arc to compensate for the increased destruction. It is demonstrated that earthquake, heat flow, paleomagnetic, gravity anomaly, and geologic data derived from Japan and the Sea of Japan support the model...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of {{this type}} of obduction may follow from the development of a subduction zone near the continental margin. Above and behind the subduction zone, a welt of oceanic crust and mantle rides up over the <b>descending</b> <b>plate.</b> The ocean, intervening between the continental margin and the subduction zone is progressively swallowed until the continental margin arrives at the subduction zone and a giant wedge or slice (nappe) of oceanic crust and mantle is pushed across the continental margin. Because the buoyancy of the relatively light continental crust is likely to prohibit its extensive subduction, a flip in subduction polarity will occur yielding an ophiolite sheet lying above a <b>descending</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{process is}} {{operative}} beneath {{and behind the}} inner walls of oceanic trenches (subduction zone) where slices of oceanic crust and mantle are ripped from {{the upper part of}} the <b>descending</b> <b>plate</b> and wedged and packed in high pressure assemblages against the leading edge of the other plate.|$|R
5000|$|Standard plate tectonic theory {{holds that}} once a trench is closed by an {{overriding}} plate reaching a rift/spreading center, the plate that has just been fully consumed continues to descend beneath the overriding plate for some time, transmitting compressive pressures to the overriding plate above as well as occasional volcanism. Meanwhile, the <b>descending</b> <b>plate</b> leaves behind it a [...] "window" [...] of inactivity. In this view, there is no mantle upwelling, so once the crustal rift is overridden, the only residual effects are from the remnant <b>descending</b> <b>plate</b> slab. However, actual observations of the crust in western North America where the Farallon Plate's trench and rift was snuffed out {{millions of years ago}} by the westward movement of the North American Plate, and replaced by the San Andreas Fault, show not compression inland, but extension.

Snyder and Brueckner supported the Speed model with detailed lithic descriptions of the Havallah. They interpreted the lithic composition of the Havallah to be the sedimentary floor of an extensive ocean basin. Brueckner and Snyder expressed some uncertainty about the exact time of final emplacement of the allochthon, but emphasized that structures associated with the Sonoma orogeny had a long history from the middle Paleozoic to the Permian-Triassic periods.|$|R

Because Titan's icy mantle is less viscous than Earth's magma mantle, and because its icy bedrock is softer than Earth's granite bedrock, mountains are unlikely to reach heights as great as those on Earth.

50|$|Haddington Island is {{a member}} {{in the chain of}} eroded volcanoes that run from Brooks Peninsula northeastward across Vancouver Island to Port McNeill, called the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt. The {{existence}} of felsite and andesite at Haddington Island suggests it might have formed 3.7 million years ago as the Juan de Fuca and Explorer Plate to its west subducted under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. As the ocean crust of the Juan de Fuca and the Explorer Plate melts, it creates magma that penetrates the crust, causing periodic eruptions of the volcanoes. The western end of the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt is now approximately 80 km northeast of the Nootka Fault, which separates the Explorer and Juan de Fuca plates. However, {{at the time of its}} formation Haddington Island may have been coincident with the subducted plate boundary. Also, the timing of volcanism corresponds to shifts of plate motion and changes in the locus of volcanism along the Pemberton and Garibaldi volcanic fronts.

Large-scale thermo-mechanical numerical models based on finite difference marker-in-cell staggered grid technique are implemented to investigate slicing processes {{that lead to the}} detachment of oceanic slivers and their exhumation before the onset of the continental collision phase. In particular, we investigate the role of the serpentinized sub-crustal slab mantle in the mechanisms of shallow and deep crustal slicing. Results show that spatially homogeneous serpentinization of the sub-Moho slab mantle leads to complete accretion of oceanic crust within the accretionary wedge. Spatially discontinuous serpentinization of the slab mantle in form of unconnected patches can lead to shallow slicing of the oceanic crust below the accretionary wedge and to its deep slicing at mantle depths depending on the patch length, slab angle, convergence velocity and continental geothermal gradient. P-T paths obtained in this study are compared to natural examples of shallow slicing of the Crescent Terrane below Vancouver Island and deeply sliced crust of the Lago Superiore and Saas-Zermatt units in the Western Alps.

We suggest hat the differences in the frequency content can be explained by assuming that the source was a unilateral fracture that propagated downwards with a speed of around the S-wave speed in the medium.

This means that cryovolcanism on Titan would require a large amount of additional energy to operate, possibly via tidal flexing from nearby Saturn. [...] The low-pressure ice, overlaying a liquid layer of ammonium sulfate, ascends buoyantly, and the unstable system can produce dramatic plume events.

30|$|Our {{experimental}} {{results indicated that}} the recovery of fault strength differs according to materials, in which clay minerals show weak and slow recovery. In the regions of extensively hydrated plate boundaries that produce abundant clay minerals such as chlorite, a large elastic strain is difficult to accumulate and does not generate large thrust earthquakes, whereas the regions escaped from the hydration reactions could result in a strong mechanical coupling that acts as a seismic asperity. The <b>descending</b> <b>plate</b> undergoes changes in mineralogy at certain pressures and temperatures; however, these mineralogical transformations cannot explain the lateral heterogeneity in coupling along the plate interface. The subduction of seamounts may explain such variations in coupling (Cloos 1992; Scholz and Small 1997). However, Wang and Bilek (2011) suggested that subducted seamounts are mostly aseismic and produce numerous small earthquakes, indicating that the regions containing subducted seamounts are unlikely to be locked; instead, they release strain energy by slip on complex fracture systems. This behavior is probably due to the relatively high permeability around seamounts inferred from heat flow data (Hutnak et al. 2008). Audet and Schwartz (2013) proposed that the spatial distribution of fluid supply is a consequence of the complex hydrological structure of oceanic crust and is related to the geometry of palaeospreading ridges. Irregularities in seafloor topography could also contribute to heterogeneity in fluid pathways along subduction interfaces. Hydration reactions result in a progressive change in mineralogy at the plate interface. The frictional properties of a fault zone depend on the amount of clay minerals, as friction coefficient decreases with increasing clay content (Tembe et al. 2010). Consequently, the boundary between extensively hydrated and unaltered regions may display a transitional behavior. Moreover, in addition to mineralogical variations, pore fluid pressure {{plays a key role in}} controlling the occurrence of slip at the subducting plate interface (e.g., Seno 2003).|$|R

In contrast to earlier finite element models the geometry of the models in this work were derived from a well constrained density model.
