5|$|Second class' {{passengers}} were leisure tourists, academics, {{members of the}} clergy and middle class English and American families. The ship's musicians travelled in second class accommodations; they were not counted {{as members of the}} crew but were employed by an agency under contract to the White Star Line. The average ticket price for an adult second class passenger was £13, the equivalent of £ today. and for many of these passengers, their travel experience on the Titanic was akin to travelling first class on smaller liners. Second class passengers had their own library and the men had access to a private smoking room. Second class children could read the children's books provided in the library or play deck quoits and shuffleboard on the second class promenade. Twelve-year-old Ruth Becker passed the time by pushing her two-year-old brother Richard around the <b>enclosed</b> <b>promenade</b> in a stroller provided by the White Star Line.|$|E

500|$|The Titanics {{first-class}} {{list was}} a [...] "who's who" [...] {{of the rich}} and prominent of the upper class in 1912. A single-person berth in first class cost between £30 (...) , to £870 (...) for a parlour suite and small private promenade deck. First class passengers enjoyed a number of amenities, including a gymnasium, a squash court, a salt water swimming pool, electric and Turkish baths, a barbershop, kennels for first class dogs, elevators, and both open and <b>enclosed</b> <b>promenades.</b> First class passengers also traveled accompanied by personal staff—valets, maids, nurses and governesses for the children, chauffeurs and cooks.|$|R

2500|$|Despite {{being an}} {{intermediate}} liner {{designed for the}} second and third-class trade, Carpathias interior accommodations were still quite comfortable and set a standard for the day. The dining saloon was described as decorated in [...] "cream and gold, which combine effectively with the rich upholstery and mahogany of the...furniture...and old gold curtains screening the ports," [...] and was capped by a stained-glass dome underneath an electrical fan for ventilation. The second-class accommodations also included a walnut-paneled smoking room located in the aft deckhouse and a handsome library at the forward end of the bridge (A) deck. After the 1905 renovation, these spaces would be converted to first-class accommodations. Third-class accommodations on Carpathia were extraordinarily generous for the time. The third-class dining saloon extended the full width {{of the ship and}} seated 300 passengers, with [...] "walls paneled in polished oak and teak dado." [...] Third-class also included a smoking room and ladies room located immediately forward of the dining saloon on the upper (C) deck, adjacent to the <b>enclosed</b> <b>promenade</b> (or open space) similar to the design on Ivernia and Saxonia. [...] Officers were berthed in the forward deckhouse on the bridge (A) deck, above the second-class dining saloon, while the captain's quarters was located on the boat deck immediately below the ship's bridge.|$|E

2500|$|Because it sailed the {{southern}} Atlantic routes, Andrea Doria {{was the first}} ship to feature three outdoor swimming pools, one for each class (first, cabin, and tourist). When fully booked, the ship was capable of accommodating 1,241 passengers in three different classes; 218 in first class, 320 in cabin class, and 703 in tourist class. As was the rule aboard Trans-Atlantic passenger liners, each passenger class was strictly segregated to specific parts of the ship. First class accommodations were located amidships on the upper decks, cabin class accommodations were located just aft of first class, and tourist-class accommodations were divided between the forward- and after-most ends {{of the ship and}} were connected by corridors which ran the full length of the ship. Each class had its own separate dining room, lounges, and social halls, designated areas of open deck space and <b>enclosed</b> <b>promenades,</b> and even their own swimming pools with verandas. In addition, 563 crew members were charged with operating and maintaining the ship. Over US$1 million was spent on artwork and the decor of the cabins and public rooms, including a life-sized statue of Admiral Doria, and many consider the ship to {{have been one of the}} most beautiful ocean liners ever built next to Cunard's two Queens, , , and the French Line's [...]|$|R
2500|$|In January 1919, the {{government}} asked the Morse company at very short notice {{to revamp the}} U.S. Navy transport [...] in preparation for President Woodrow Wilson's voyage to Europe for the Paris Peace Conference. In the space of just 76 hours, the company redecorated 49 of the ship's staterooms, rebuilt 16 bathrooms (including the installation of both hot and cold fresh water in place of unheated seawater); rebuilt a conference hall, two smoking rooms, a ladies lounge and a messhall; refinished all corridors on the main deck, fully <b>enclosed</b> the <b>promenade</b> deck under 106 panes of glass, and refinished or replaced missing furniture. The swift completion of this contract earned a letter of commendation from the Navy.|$|R
5000|$|The aft {{end of the}} Promenade was a large {{open air}} space flanked by two large cargo cranes. This part of the deck was {{installed}} with wooden slatted wrought iron benches from where passengers could enjoy views of the stern and the sea. Francis Browne took several photos of this area on the Titanic, including a famous one of 12 year old Douglas Spedden spinning a top with his father. [...] A key distinguishing feature between the Titanic and her sister ship is the Titanics <b>enclosed</b> forward <b>Promenade</b> Deck, which was installed as protection against the elements and to reinforce {{a part of the}} ship prone to heavy vibration. Both had proven to be issues on board the Olympic.|$|R

6000|$|In this {{palatial}} {{ship the}} passengers dress for dinner. The ladies' toilettes make a fine display of color, {{and this is}} in keeping with the elegance of the vessel's furnishings and the flooding brilliancies of the electric light. On the stormy Atlantic one never sees a man in evening dress, except at the rarest intervals; and then there is only one, not two; and he shows up but once on the voyage--the night before the ship makes port--the night when they have the [...] "concert" [...] and do the amateur wailings and recitations. He is the tenor, as a rule [...] . There has been a deal of cricket-playing on board; it seems a queer game for a ship, but they <b>enclose</b> the <b>promenade</b> deck with nettings and keep the ball from flying overboard, and the sport goes very well, and is properly violent and exciting [...] . We must part from this vessel here.|$|R

It is a busy beach <b>promenade</b> <b>enclosed</b> by the city and on the south by the Playa de Santa Bárbara and the north of Playa de La Atunara. It has all the basic services required of an urban beach, daily waste collection season, toilets, showers and disabled access and presence of police and local rescue equipment.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, Mountwood and Woodchurch were {{withdrawn}} and extensively refurbished internally {{which resulted}} in complete rewiring and main engine repairs. They were given new modern interiors and their separate bridge wings and wheel houses were plated over to form one large bridge, although none of the original equipment {{was removed from the}} new bridge. They entered service by July 1990 in time for the QE2's first visit to the Mersey and also operated the new [...] "heritage cruises". They also were given a new black and red livery replacing the red white and blue given for the Garden Festival season of 1984. The Overchurch was withdrawn and retired from regular service and subsequently moved to Bootle, where she was internally refurbished and rewired. She was then moved to the ferries' regular berth on the East Float, where she saw very little use for nearly a decade. The reason for this was somewhat unknown as Overchurch was more than suitable for ferry service. In 1996 the Overchurch was given a small refit which involved the <b>enclosing</b> of the <b>promenade</b> deck shelter.|$|R

The Band of the Bangalore Rifle Volunteers, played at the bandstand every first Saturday of the month. YWCA used to run of the tennis courts. The park is fairly maintained, even though there is some encroachments. Coles Park is officially known as the Freedom Fighters Park, however still popularly known by its former name. The Park is open between 5AM to 11PM, but the Nursery is closed except during the Lalbagh Flower Show. The Madras Sappers Regiment has a memorial for fallen Indian soldiers in various conflicts, including the Kargil Conflict.|$|E
