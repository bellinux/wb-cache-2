The objective of this research is to study the performance of polypropylene hinges with the influence hot air in the fabricated chamber and high humidity condition. The performance of this sample was analysed by using <b>folding</b> <b>endurance</b> <b>tester</b> with hot air chamber, adopting the Design of Experiment L 9 (3 4) Taguchi Method for the selected factors which are temperature, relative humidity, breaking time and motor speed. All of these factors were selected with a constant force. Based on the findings, the best combination of parameters which signify the performance of folding endurance test in humidity environment is 70 0 C for temperature, 60 N for relative humidity, 2 days of breaking time and 850 rpm for motor speed. As for hot air environment, the best setting is 70 0 C for temperature, 55 N for relative humidity, 3 days of breaking time and 700 rpm for motor speed. For Signal to Noise ratio, the result showed that the temperature was the most influential factor for humidity effects and hot air environment, whereby the Signal to Noise ratio value obtained for the humidity and hot air environment are 129. 5 dBi and 130. 5 dBi respectively. The conclusion of this research is the polypropylene hinges have performed better with hot air environment as compared with higher humidity environment condition...|$|E

40|$|Filter paper (FP), acidic {{wood-free paper}} (AP), neutral wood-free paper (WP) and neutral wood-free paper {{containing}} recycled fibers (RP) were heated {{to investigate the}} permanence of the neutral wood-free papers. The <b>folding</b> <b>endurance</b> of AP become zero after being heated for 10 days, while RP and WP heated for 28 days lost their <b>folding</b> <b>endurances</b> by 59. 7 % and 53. 6 %, respectively. This indicated that although the deterioratrion of the neutral wood-free papers was not so fast {{as that of the}} acidic wood-free paper was, it was progressing during accelerated aging. The Raman spectra of RP and WP suggested that thermohydrolytic degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and starch in the papers took place during heating. The analyses on RP and WP by pyrolysis-gas chromatography suggested that the losses in the <b>folding</b> <b>endurances</b> of the papers depended deeply on the contents of rosin sizes and polyacrylamides in the papers. Printing with a laser printer or a copier greatly reduced the <b>folding</b> <b>endurances</b> of the papers. FP, AP, RP and WP heated for 28 days lost their brightnesses by 6. 2 %, 17. 2 %, 11. 6 % and 10. 3 %, respectively. The neutral papers also suffered significant losses in the brightnesses during the accelerated aging. The fact that RP lost 13 % more brightness demonstrated that recycled fibers and papermaking additives in the papers influenced the brightness stability of the papers. 濾紙(FP),酸性上質紙(AP),中性上質紙(WP) 及びリサイクル繊維を含む中性上質紙(RP) を乾熱の条件下で強制劣化させ,中性上質紙の耐久性を検討した. 10 日間乾熱強制劣化処理すると,APの耐折強さは零になった. これに対して,RPとWPは 28 日間加熱すると,耐折強さの減少はそれぞれ 59. 7 %と 53. 6 %であった. 中性上質紙の劣化は酸性紙ほど強くはないが,かなり進行していることがわかった.
