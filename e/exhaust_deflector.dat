5000|$|Type 86A - WZ-501 with an {{improved}} engine and <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflector.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{were many}} {{optional}} feature for the Classics, including the rear exit doors. Most orders specified the wide versions, but a narrower single-stream door was also available. A majority of orders had either large or no rear windows, {{but a few}} opted for a small rear window {{at the top of}} the rear cap. The rear window was dropped as an option for US-built buses due to revised air conditioning equipment and a stand-out <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflector</b> that extended the upper half of the rear cap by a few inches. Another modification during the production run was the size of the front destination sign. A taller and wider version was offered from 1990 as more transit systems specified larger electronic signs. The major exception was Montreal, as MCI and NovaBus built an [...] "M-version" [...] which retained the narrow destination sign windows, and was ordered primarily by properties in the Montreal area.|$|E
40|$|A lift/cruise <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflector</b> {{system for}} the LF 336 /A tip turbine lift fan was designed, built, and tested to {{determine}} the design and performance characteristics of a large-scale, single swivel nozzle thrust vectoring system. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflector</b> static testing was performed at the Ames Research Center outside static test stand facilities. The test hardware was installed on a hydraulic lift platform to permit {{both in and out}} of ground effect testing. The exhaust flow of the LF 336 /A lift fan was vectored from 0 degrees through 130 degrees during selected fan speeds to obtain performance at different operating conditions. The system was operated with and without flow vanes installed in the small radius bends to evaluate the system performance based on a proposed method of improving the internal flow losses. The program also included testing at different ground heights, to the nozzle exhaust plane, to obtain ground effect data, and the testing of two methods of thrust spoiling using a duct bypass door system and nozzle flap system...|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was painted}} {{in a red}} livery and was officially named L.D. Porta after the Argentinian engineer responsible {{for some of the}} ideas and developments incorporated in its modification. Initial steaming and yard running took place on Thursday 5 February 1981 and the first test trip, running light from Salt River to Bellville and back, took place the following day. On Monday 9 February the rebuilt no. 3450 hauled its first three-coach train filled with various railway officials, staff and media representatives to Dal Josafat, about 66 km from Cape Town. In subsequent Cape Town press reports the locomotive was dubbed the Red Devil. The nickname eventually became official and the locomotive now bears it on the Class 25NC type <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflectors</b> which later replaced the Continental European style <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflectors.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{preliminary}} acoustic {{tests of the}} engine over the wing concept are summarized. The tests were conducted with a small wing section model (32 cm chord) having two flaps set at the landing position, which is 30 and 60 deg respectively. The engine exhaust was simulated by an air jet from a convergent nozzle having a nominal diameter of 5. 1 centimeters. Factors investigated for their effect on noise include nozzle location, wing shielding, flap leakage, nozzle shape, <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflectors,</b> and internally generated exhaust noise...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of a semispan STOL jet transport wing-body with an upper-surface blown jet flap for lift augmentation was conducted in a low-speed wind tunnel having a 12 -ft octagonal test section. The semispan swept wing had an aspect ratio of 3. 92 (7. 84 for the full span) and had two simulated turbofan engines mounted ahead of and above the wing in a siamese pod equipped with an <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflector.</b> The purpose of the deflector was to spread the engine exhaust into a jet sheet attached to the upper surface of the wing {{so that it would}} turn downward over the flap and provide lift augmentation. The wing also had optional boundary-layer control provided by air blowing through a thin slot over a full-span plain trailing-edge flap...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the model preparation area o f the NASA Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel to determine the internal performance of a fixed-shroud nonaxisymmetric nozzle equipped with an aft-hood <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflector.</b> Nineteen nozzle configurations were tested with primary emphasis placed on determining performance with the aft-hood deflector deployed. Model geometric parameters investigated included nozzle power setting, aft-hood deflector angle, throat area control with the aft-hood deflector deployed, and yaw vector angle. All tests were conducted with no external flow, and nozzle pressure ratio was varied during jet simulation from 1. 5 to approximately 12. 3. Results indicate that cruise nozzle configurations produced peak thrust ratio performance in the range consistent with previous investigations of nonaxisymmetric convergent-divergent nozzles. Deploying the aft-hood deflector produced resultant pitch vector angles that were always less than the geometric aft-hood de [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first of}} class, Sheffield, was {{initially}} fitted with the odd-looking [...] "Mickey Mouse" [...] ears on her funnel tops {{which were in}} fact <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflectors</b> - [...] "Loxton bends" [...] - for the Rolls Royce Olympus TM1A gas turbines, to guide the high-temperature exhaust efflux sidewards and minimise damage to overhead aerials. As this provided a prominent target for then-new infrared homing missiles, only Sheffield and both the Argentinian Hércules and Santísima Trinidad had these 'ears'. All subsequent Olympus and Tyne uptakes were fitted with 'cheese graters' which mixed machinery space vent air with the engine exhaust to reduce infrared signatures.|$|R
50|$|Based on the SH-60F, the HH-60H is {{the primary}} combat search and rescue (CSAR), naval special warfare (NSW) and anti-surface warfare (ASUW) helicopter. It carries various {{defensive}} and offensive sensors, {{it is one of}} the most survivable helicopters in the world. Sensors include a FLIR turret with laser designator and the Aircraft Survival Equipment (ASE) package including the ALQ-144 Infrared Jammer, AVR-2 Laser Detectors, APR-39(V)2 Radar Detectors, AAR-47 Missile Launch Detectors and ALE-47 chaff/flare dispensers. Engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflectors</b> provide infrared thermal reduction reducing the threat of heat-seeking missiles. The HH-60H can carry up to four AGM-114 Hellfire missiles on an extended wing using the M299 launcher and a variety of mountable guns including M60D, M240, GAU-16 and GAU-17/A machine guns.|$|R
2500|$|After repairs from a {{crash landing}} on 27 June 1949, the XF-89 was flown to March AFB to {{participate}} in the RKO movie Jet Pilot in February 1950. Shortly afterward, the aircraft crashed on 22 February, killing the observer, when flutter developed in the elevator and the subsequent vibrations caused the entire tail to break off. Construction of the production models was suspended until the reasons for the accident were discovered. Engineering and wind-tunnel tests revealed that the geometry of the rear fuselage and the engine exhaust created flutter-inducing turbulence that was aggravated by the high-frequency acoustic energy from the exhaust. Fixes for the problem involved the addition of a [...] "jet wake fairing" [...] at the bottom rear of the fuselage between the engines, external ("ice tong") mass balances for the elevator, pending the design of internal mass balances, and the addition of <b>exhaust</b> <b>deflectors</b> to the fuselage to reduce the turbulence and the consequent flutter.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in the NASA Langley 14 - by 22 -foot subsonic tunnel to determine the low-speed aerodynamic characteristics of a powered, generic, hypersonic configuration in ground effect. The model was a simplified configuration consisting of a triangular wedge forebody, a rectangular mid-section which housed the flow through, an ejector type propulsion simulation system, and a rectangular wedge afterbody. Additional model components included a delta wing, a rectangular wedge forebody, inlet fences, <b>exhaust</b> flow <b>deflectors,</b> and afterbody fences. Aerodynamic force and moment data were obtaind over an angle of attack range from - 4 to 18 degrees while model height above the tunnel floor was varied from 1 / 4 inch to 6 feet. Variations in freestream dynamic pressure, from 10 psf to 80 psf, and engine ejector pressure yielded a range of thrust coefficients from 0 to 0. 8...|$|R
50|$|In 1926, the German {{engineer}} Adolf Schnürle {{developed the}} system of ports that bears his name. The ports were relocated to both {{be on the same}} side of the cylinder, with the transfer port being split into two angled ports, one on either side of the <b>exhaust</b> port. A <b>deflector</b> piston was no longer required. The gas flow was now a circular loop, flowing in and across the piston crown from the transfer ports, up and around the combustion chamber and then out through the exhaust port.|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} on the low-speed aerodynamic {{characteristics of a}} simplified NASP (for National Aerospace Plane Program) -like configuration, obtained in the NASA-Langley 14 -by- 22 -foot subsonic tunnel. The model consisted of a triangular wedge forebody, a rectangular midsection housing the propulsion simulation system, and a rectangular wedge aftbody; it also included a delta wing, <b>exhaust</b> flow <b>deflectors,</b> and aftbody fences. Flow visualization was obtained by injecting water into the engine simulator inlets and using a laser light sheet to illuminate the resulting exhaust flow. It was found that power-on ground effects for NASP-like configuration can be substantial; these effects can be reduced by increasing the angle-of-attack {{to the value of}} the aftbody ramp angle. Power-on lift losses in ground effect increased with increasing thrust, but could be reduced by the addition of a delta wing to the configuration. Power-on lift losses also increased with use of aftbody fences...|$|R
40|$|The Augmented <b>Deflector</b> <b>Exhaust</b> Nozzle (ADEN) {{was tested}} in PSL- 3 at NASA-Lewis Research Center using an F 404 engine. The ADEN is a flight weight Single Expansion Ramp Nozzle with thrust vectoring, an {{internal}} cooling system utilizing the available engine fan flow, and a variable area throat {{controlled by the}} engine control system. Test conditions included dry and max A/B operation at nozzle pressure ratios from 2. 0 to 15. 0. High nozzle pressure loading was simulated to verify structural integrity at near maximum design pressure. Nozzle settings covered the full range in throat area and + or - 15 deg deflection angle. Test results demonstrated expected aerodynamic performance, cooling system effectiveness, control system stability, and mechanical integrity...|$|R
50|$|In a {{cross-flow}} engine, {{the transfer}} and exhaust ports are {{on opposite sides}} of the cylinder, and a deflector on the top of the piston directs the fresh intake charge into the upper part of the cylinder, pushing the residual exhaust gas down the other side of the deflector and out the <b>exhaust</b> port. The <b>deflector</b> increases the piston's weight and exposed surface area, affecting piston cooling and also making it difficult to achieve an efficient combustion chamber shape. This design has been superseded since the 1960s by the loop scavenging method (below), especially for motorbikes, although for smaller or slower engines, such as lawn mowers, the cross-flow-scavenged design can be an acceptable approach.|$|R
2500|$|In {{late 1990s}} the Hellenic Air Force (HAF) issued {{a request for}} {{acquiring}} more modern and capable SAR helicopters [...] in order to replace its ageing fleet of Agusta Bell AB-205 SAR helicopters, which were in use since 1975. The need for an all-weather, day and night, long range SAR helicopter for operations throughout the Athens FIR came up after the Imia/Kardak incident of 1996 and the growing tension between Greece and Turkey over territorial water disputes on the Aegean Sea. The Greek government, signed a deal with Eurocopter in 1998 [...] for purchasing initially 4 AS-332 C1 Super Pumas. H.A.F. acquired 2 more Super Pumas for air support operations of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games and 6 more helicopters followed up in the period 2007–2011 for the new CSAR role of the 384 SAR/CSAR Sq. All HAF helicopters are of the C1 version, including a 4-axis auto pilot, a NADIR type1000 navigation and mission management computer, FLIR turrets, an RBR1500B search radar, an engine anti-icing system, a hydraulic and an electrical hoist, a SPECTROLAB SX-16 searchlight, engine <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>deflectors,</b> a Bertin loudspeaker and 6 stretcher interior configuration for MEDEVAC missions.|$|R
40|$|The aeroacoustic {{performance}} of several generic nozzle geometries was tested {{to evaluate the}} potential benefits of using non-round jet exit geometries to reduce noise from combat military aircraft. Both the aerodynamics and far field acoustics of several M(sub d) = 1. 5 and 2. 0 round, elliptic, and rectangular nozzles, including an augmented <b>deflector</b> <b>exhaust</b> nozzle (ADEN), were studied to assess noise emission. The nozzles were operated to jet total temperatures, T(sub 0) = 1160 degree R, and the data scaled to constant thrust. The data were propagated to 1500 ft. and corrected to perceived noise level. The aerodynamic results of the study show that the non-round nozzle geometries mix much faster with the surrounding medium than does an equivalent round nozzle plume. Both the ADEN and elliptic nozzles provide significant reduction of noise, 6 to 7 PNdB, along the major axis direction with little expected impact on nozzle performance. Shock noise processes are eliminated for elliptic nozzles, but are still significant with rectangular nozzles. Comparison of measurements to theoretical predictions of noise using the quasi-linear instability wave model demonstrates good qualitative agreement...|$|R
40|$|The YF- 17 {{aircraft}} was evaluated {{as a candidate}} nonaxisymmetric nozzle flight demonstrator. Configuration design modifications, control system design, flight performance assessment, and program plan and cost we are summarized. Two aircraft configurations were studied. The first was modified as required to install only the augmented <b>deflector</b> <b>exhaust</b> nozzle (ADEN). The second one added a canard installation {{to take advantage of}} the full (up to 20 deg) nozzle vectoring capability. Results indicate that: (1) the program is feasible and can be accomplished at reasonable cost and low risk; (2) installation of ADEN increases the aircraft weight by 600 kg (1325 lb); (3) the control system can be modified to accomplish direct lift, pointing capability, variable static margin and deceleration modes of operation; (4) unvectored thrust-minus-drag is similar to the baseline YF- 17; and (5) vectoring does not improve maneuvering performance. However, some potential benefits in direct lift, aircraft pointing, handling at low dynamic pressure and takeoff/landing ground roll are available. A 27 month program with 12 months of flight test is envisioned, with the cost estimated to be $ 15. 9 million for the canard equipped aircraft and $ 13. 2 million for the version without canard. The feasiblity of adding a thrust reverser to the YF- 17 /ADEN was investigated...|$|R
