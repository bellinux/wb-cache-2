40|$|BACKGROUND: Current World Health Organization {{guidelines}} recommend exclusive breastfeeding for {{the first}} 6 months of life. Breastfeeding conveys clear benefits to both mother and child. These benefits {{are likely to be}} amplified by prolonged feeding. OBJECTIVE: This article outlines the emerging evidence that suggests possible benefits from introducing complementary solids from 4 months of age in developed countries. DISCUSSION: The human gut may have a critical early window during which it has an opportunity to develop immunological tolerance. Introducing complementary solids from 4 months of age may decrease the risk of food allergy and coeliac disease - <b>immunological</b> <b>illnesses</b> that have become a public health priority. The new draft National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines recommend introducing solids at around 6 months (22 - 26 weeks). However, given recent evidence, it may be appropriate to recommend the introduction of solids from 4 months of age in the Australian context. Brian Symon and Michael Bamman...|$|E
50|$|Health {{concerns}} around mould include infections, allergenic or <b>immunological</b> <b>illness,</b> and nonallergic illness. Asthma is also {{triggered by}} the sensitization of dust mites accruing humid, wet regions of a structure. Another health effect associated with structural dampness {{is the presence of}} bacteria in an indoor environment. Bacteria requires water to grow and multiply. Bacteria is a source for the transmission of diseases, therefore putting occupants' health at risk by water intrusion into the indoor environment. Water removal and drying of wet building materials within 2 days will likely prevent mold and bacteria growth, therefore reducing occupants' vulnerability to disease.|$|R
40|$|The {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is one of}} the few investigations dating from the 19 th century that are still widely used as an important test for diagnosing tuberculosis. Though very commonly used by physicians worldwide its interpretation always remains difficult and controversial. Various factors like age, <b>immunological</b> status coexisting <b>illness</b> etc influence its outcome, so also its interpretation. Utmost care is required while interpreting the result and giving an opinion. This article has been written with the purpose of elucidating the performance and interpretation of the standard tuberculin test...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundInformation on {{peripheral}} neuropathy {{in children with}} cystic fibrosis is scanty. The etiology can be multifactorial (micronutrient deficiency, chronic hypoxia, impaired glucose tolerance, <b>immunological,</b> vasculopathic, critical <b>illness).</b> MethodsForty five cystic fibrosis children aged 1 – 18 years on vitamin E supplementation for at least 6 months underwent detailed neurological examination, serum vitamin E, vitamin B 12, folate, copper levels and detailed nerve conduction studies. ResultsThe {{mean age of the}} study population was 8. 35 years (± 4. 9 years) with 62. 2 % being males. Overall 22 out of 45 (48. 88 %,CI: 33. 7 – 64. 2) had electrophysiological evidence of {{peripheral neuropathy}} which was predominantly axonal (86. 4 %), sensory (50 %), and polyneuropathy (95. 45 %). There was no significant association between status of serum micronutrients and electrophysiological evidence of peripheral neuropathy. ConclusionPatients with cystic fibrosis have electrophysiological evidence of peripheral neuropathy (predominantly axonal, sensory and polyneuropathy). There is significant association of higher chronological age with occurrence of peripheral neuropathy...|$|R
40|$|Background—Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) {{remains the}} leading cause of {{acquired}} heart disease in children worldwide. No therapeutic agent has been shown to alter the clinical outcome of the acute <b>illness.</b> <b>Immunological</b> mechanisms appear {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of ARF. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a proven immunomodulator, may benefit cardiac conditions of an autoimmune nature. We investigated whether IVIG modified the natural history of ARF by reducing the extent and severity of carditis. Methods and Results—This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluated IVIG in patients with a first episode of rheumatic fever, stratifying patients by the presence and severity of carditis before randomization. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 1 g/kg IVIG on days 1 and 2 and 0. 4 g/kg on days 14 and 28, or they received a placebo infusion. Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic evaluation was performed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 26, and 52 weeks. Fifty-nine patients were treated, of whom 39 had carditis (including 4 subclinical) and/or migratory polyarthritis (n 539). There was no difference between groups in the rate of normalization of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or acute-phase proteins at the 6 -week follow-up. On echocardiography, 59 % in the IVIG group and 69 % in the placebo group had carditis at baseline. There was no significant difference in the cardiac outcome, including the proportion of valves involved, or in the severity of valvar regurgitation at 1 year. At 1 year, 41 % of the IVIG and 50 % of the placebo group had carditis...|$|R
40|$|I {{have chosen}} topic Diet with Food Allergy as {{a topic of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis. This illness is quite common these days. It affect infants mostly but allergy of cow´s milk protein of children under three years disappears itself mostly. There is increasing amount of causes when patient suffers more allergies. Number {{of people who have}} the most serious reaction the anaphylactic shock, icreeases. It can end with death. Doctors recommend to patients to strictly follow the elimination diet which is basic treatment of this illness. The most accurate diagnosis of <b>illness</b> (<b>immunological</b> or not) is another important factor for effective treatment. I have chosen three aims for this bachelor thesis. First to find out if patients are informed about their illness. Second to map eating habbits of people with food allergy. Third the evaluation of correctness of daily menus. I used approach of guality research. Research group consisted of six respondents with different food allergy. Those respondents wrote down their weeks menus. Menus were evaluated with program Nutriservis and it was assessed if it follows recommended dietary value. Suitable intake of energy and essential nutrients was calculated for every respondent. It was evaluated if respondents follows priciples of rational diet and if their diet contains sufficient amount of minerals and vitamins. Questionnaires were another key point of this research. Questionnaires were about illness know-how of patients and who has instructed them about it. It was found out the patients hasn´t got enough information about their illness and half of them has no idea which essential nutrients, minerals and vitamins could lack in their diet. It resulted from menus simultaneously that five of six respondents do not follow principles of rational diet and eat very monotonously. Only one respondent follows strictly elimination diet others violate diet exceptionally. Respondets would appreciate other research would focus on creation of special centres and training of doctors and nutritional therapist who would be focused on food allergies. Spreading the information about illness not only to patients but to public also is really important. Another important point is to increase amount of books about food allergies at the market...|$|R
