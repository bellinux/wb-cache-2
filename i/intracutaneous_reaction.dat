40|$|To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of cardiac function on the nutriture, operated cases of mitral valve disease were evaluated for preoperative cardiac function by morbid type and were examined for {{the influence of}} cardiac function on the pre- and post-operative nutriture. The findings revealed that the hypofunctional group showed no difference in visceral protein index from the normal group preoperatively, and showed significant decreases in % IBW, % TSF, and CHI, indexes of fat stores and skeletal muscle mass. The hypofunctional group also showed low value of PPD <b>intracutaneous</b> <b>reaction,</b> an index of the immunological status. The early postoperative nutriture of the hypofunctional group showed changes {{similar to those in}} the normal group and was less influenced by the preoperative cardiac function. These findings suggest that the cardiac function influences the body composition and immunological status and that somatometry and PPD <b>intracutaneous</b> <b>reaction</b> are useful for the nutritional assessment of heart diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{immunological}} {{status of}} five children with West syndrome consequent to previous cerebral lesions was investigated. Three children had West syndrome and two were in transition from West to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. All of them showed cellular immunological deficiencies in the following tests: sensitization to DNCB, <b>intracutaneous</b> <b>reaction</b> to PHA, inhibition of leucocyte migration, blastic transformation of lymphocytes, T and B lymphocytes in peripheric blood and levels of serum immunoglobulins. These immunological deficiencies, of different degrees of severity, were associated to frequent infections in these children. A possible association between the immunological deficiencies and autoimmunity is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The author {{studied the}} sero-immunological {{characters}} of the infectious hepatitis virus isolated by the chik-embryo technic. The results are briefly summarized as follows: 1) In some cases of the neutralization test and Absaettigungsversuch, with young hamsters. a pretty high degree of noutralizatien could be observed, but no definite result could be obtained. 2) With the use of chick-embryos, the neutralization could be well established between the isolated virus and convalescent sera; this fact indicates that the isolated virus is from the patients of infectious hepatitis. 3) The <b>intracutaneous</b> <b>reaction</b> with the antigen prepared from the isolated virus-infected animal organs showed a unequivocal difference to the control. Though further studies are needed, this fact suggests {{the existence of the}} relationship between the isolated virus and the infectious hepatitis...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{collagen}} {{derived from}} fish scales, skin, and bone {{has been widely}} investigated for application as a scaffold and carrier due to its bioactive properties, including excellent biocompatibility, low antigenicity, and high biodegradability and cell growth potential. Fish type I collagen is an effective material as a biodegradable scaffold or spacer replicating the natural extracellular matrix, which serves to spatially organize cells, providing them with environmental signals and directing site-specific cellular regulation. This {{study was conducted to}} confirm the safety of fish (tilapia) atelocollagen for use in clinical application. We performed in vitro and in vivo biological studies of medical materials to investigate the safety of fish collagen. The extract of fish collagen gel was examined to clarify its sterility. All present sterility tests concerning bacteria and viruses (including endotoxin) yielded negative results, and all evaluations of cell toxicity, sensitization, chromosomal aberrations, <b>intracutaneous</b> <b>reactions,</b> acute systemic toxicity, pyrogenic reactions, and hemolysis were negative according to the criteria of the ISO and the [URL] Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The present study demonstrated that atelocollagen prepared from tilapia is a promising biomaterial for use as a scaffold in regenerative medicine...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{reactions}} {{caused by}} tuberculin, various tuberculin fractions and various non-specific stimuli were studied in tuberculous animals. The reactions were then {{compared with those}} in the Arthus phenomenon caused by tuberculin in animals previously sensitized with tuberculin. At an early stage tuberculin reactions were evidently leukocytic, later monocytic reactions were dominant. Apparently this process of the cellular reactions is related to the quantity of tuberculin injected. In general the cellular response, in tuberculin reactions was of a monocytic type, while that in the Arthus phenomenon was leukocytic. The difference between them seemed to be {{due to the fact that}} the tuberculin showed a reaction of a delayed type. These monocytic reactions were more intense when purified tuberculin was used. The histological changes in the <b>intracutaneous</b> tuberculin <b>reaction</b> were fundamentally due to the vascular reaction, and were somewhat similar to those in the Arthus phenomenon, but at least a part of the regressive changes of the epidermis and the cutis, which were simultaneously observed, seemed to he primary when considered from the findings on the intracorneal reactions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} in vivo antiviral cellular immune reactions in the Shope rabbit papilloma – carcinoma model. Antigens studied in experimentally infected domestic rabbits were cottontail rabbit papillomavirus particles produced with the athymic (nu/nu) mouse xenograft system and bacterial fusion proteins containing the major or minor capsid protein. Recall reactions to antigens were tested by classic <b>intracutaneous</b> tests. Positive <b>reactions</b> had a biphasic course. Histopathology of skin test biopsy specimens showed infiltrating polymorphonuclear cells {{during the early}} stages. Later they were replaced by predominantly perivascular infiltrates composed of mononuclear cells. Time course of swelling and infiltrates resembled a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Ten of 11 regressor rabbits (p = 0. 00006) and 10 of 20 progressors (p = 0. 009) had positive skin tests with intact and/or denaturated virus particles and individual capsid proteins also could elicit specific skin reactions. Skin reactivity to the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus particles was also greater (p = 0. 042) in regressor rabbits (8 of 11) when compared to progressors (7 of 20). Recall reactions remained detectable at post-regression times, ranging from several months {{up to more than}} 2 years. We conclude that specific skin reactions against the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus in infected domestic rabbits exist, and are strongly positive to intact particles of this papillomavirus in animals (regressors) clinically free of disease...|$|R
40|$|The author {{studied the}} {{distribution}} of the Paragonismus westermani in Ehime prefecture of Japan; at first the <b>intracutaneous</b> <b>reaction</b> was performed on 51865 students or pupiles of primary, junier and senier high school; final examination such as sputum examination, feces examination, chest X-ray were performed on the skin reaction-positive persons; examination of metacercaria in the crab, Composcia retusa, distribution in the dog were also studied. The rusults are briefly summarized as follows: 1) Of 51865 persons tested, the <b>intracutaneous</b> <b>reaction</b> revealed 3032 positive cases (3. 9 %), 1252 males (4. 7 %) and 780 females (3. 0 %). The positive cases vised with the rise of age; 3. 7 % in primary school pupils, 3. 6 % in junior high school students, 5. 0 % in senior high school students and 7. 7 % in adults. 2) Of 3032 skin reaction-positive cases, paragonismus westermani egg was positive in 405 cases (13. 4 %). The positive cases of parasite egg decreased with the rise of the age. 3) Of 405 parasite egg positive cases (72. 3 %) had chest X-ray findings. In about 80 % of them, the pathologic shadow appeared in the middle or lower pulmonary area. 4) Further study revealed that the patient group had eaten. morecrabs, Camposicia retusa, and has more chances to contact the crab than the femele. 5) The comparative examination on subjective symptomes between the patient and heathy groups revealed a significant difference. 6) Of 909 crabs tested, 444 (48. 9 %) had metaceraria. The metacercaria-containg percentage was parallel to the positive rate of skin reaction. 7) Paragonismns westermani was proved in the lung of 13 (2. 6 %) of 482 dogs tested. This rate was parallel to that of positive skin reaction and to that of metacercaria containing in crabs...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with a case of vesical cand i diasis which we saw recently and also {{with the results of}} experiments on Candida strains isolated and cultured from this clinical case, together with some results of studies that we have been carrying out on Candida for several years. a) Clin i c al case 1) Vesical ca n didiasis A 26 -years-o l d woman was stricken with this disease about June 20, 1960, when the severe symptoms of the urinary bladder appeared. On July 3 she visited our out-patient clinic. On urological testing her case was diagnozed as colicystitis. The case was alleviated by chemotherapy. The woman was admitted to the hospital for closer examination on July 18 because the same symptoms of the urinary bladder reappeared. As a result of tests, her case was diagnozed as vesical cadidiasis. By oral administration of myocostatin she was completely cured of this disease. b) Experiments: 1) F our Candida strains were isolated to make some cultures from the urine of the said case of vesical candidiasis, 2 from the vaginal serection and 1 from the sputum. These were classified and identified according to the method of Martin et al. All these were identified as Candida albicans. 2) The same t est as mentioned under (1) was used on 43 Candida strains which were isolated from the vaginal secretion of healthy woman, pregnant woman and other woman. These were classified into 3 C. albicans strains, 7 C. krusei strains, 26 C. guilliermondii strains and 7 unidentified strains. 3) Use was made of SchObl and Mizuno-Takada media as differential media, and the strains under (1) and the standerd strains supplied by Jyuntendo University were inoculated into these media for observation purposes. However, it was impossible to identify the former strains by the use media. 4) Candida was isolated t o make cultures from the urine and vaginal secretion 700 cases of urosis, and attempts were also undertaken determine whether these cases were treated with antibiotics. As a result {{it was found that the}} Candida-positive rate was high in those patents with a history of antibiotic treatment. 5) Using Akiba and Kitamura antigens, the Candida <b>intracutaneous</b> <b>reaction</b> test was perfomed on 177 subjects, who were made up of healthy persons, case of urosis and other cases. There were many positive reactors in a group of cases with a high detection rate of Candida. 6) The lethal test which was done on mice using the strains under (1) and the standard strains under (1) and the standard strains disclosed no difference according to the type of Candida. 7) When the dye absorptive capacity of the strains under (6) was examined by adding a 3000, 000 dilution of gentian and crystal violets, it was revealed that the dye absorptive capacity of C. albicans was greater than those of other Candida strains. 8) The heat resistance test of the same strains under (6) sho w ed that C. albicans and C. krusei were 1 or 2 degrees more heat-resistant than other Candida strains...|$|E

It was {{reported}} in the first report of this series that in the majority of urogenital tuberculosis a transient leucopenia was brought about when a small quantity of tuberculous vaccine or tuberculin was injected subcutaneously. It {{was reported}} also that this phenomenon disappeared several weeks after the removal of the cardinal tuberculous lesions, even if the tuberculin reaction preserves the same intensity. In the second report, the change in the leucocytes count due to a reinjection of the same antigen in sensitized rabbits was described. The antigens employed were typhoid vaccine, human serum, BCG and purified variola vaccine (the animals sensitized with BCG were reinjected with tuberculin). The dosage of the second injection was so small that it did not influence on the leucocytes count in nonsensitized rabbits. Nevertheless, a transient leucopenia appeared in the majority of the sensitized rabbits by such antigens as typhoid vaccine and the human serum which were considered to produce humoral type of antibodies. On the contrary, the leucopenia appeared only in a small number of the sensitized rabbits by such antigens as BCG and purified variola vaccine which were considered to produce mainly tissue antibodies. These facts indicated that such a transient leucopenia might only be caused by an antigen-antibody reaction in body fluid. The present study aimed to make clear the mechanism of such a transient leucopenia. For this purpose, the problem was studied first as to whether the crystalline egg-albumin (in small dosage) would cause such a leucopenia in rabbits which had been passively sensitized by a transfusion of serum obtained from actively sensitized rabbits by the same antigen. Then the influence on the leucopenia thus produced of anti-histamine and anti-plasmin was studied. The influence on the leucocytes count of the precipitate was studied also which was produced by an antigen-antibody reaction in vitro and was injected into normal rabbits. As a clinical study, it was investigated the influence of anti-histamine and anti-plasmin on Yoshida's reaction, a transient leucopenia which was brought about in patients of uro-genital tuberculosis by an injection of tuberculin. Thus the following results were obtained: 1) A recognizable change in the leucocytes count was not demonstrated in the streaming blood of normal rabbits when 0. 1 % solution of crystalline egg-white albumin or anti-serum (0. 2 ml/kg) was intravenously injected. 2) A significant leucopenia was temporarily brought about, however, when the same antigen was introduced in the same way into rabbits which had passively sensitized with anti-serum against the same antigen. The leucopenia appeared less pronounced, however, when the same antigen was given again 21 hours after the first injection. 3) A greater leucopenia with a longer duration was brought about when a serum with a higher precipitation titer was employed in the passive sensitization. 4) The leucopenia in actively sensitized animals seemed to be impeded by anti-histamine to some extent, while that in passively sensitized animals {{did not seem to be}} impeded to any extent. 5) A slight leucopenia was temporarily brought about by an injection of histamine but it was complately inhibited by antihistamine injected simultaneously. 6) The leucopenia in passively sensitized animals was not inhibited by anti-plasmin injected simultaneously. 7) The transient leucopenia was brought about when a small quantity of precipitate (produced by an antigen-antibody reaction in vitro) was intravenously injected into normal rabbits, and the leucopenia was not inhibited by anti-histamine. A slight but typical leucopenia was also brought about when such precipitate was used as produced by mixing highly diluted antigen with antibody at the most adequate ratio. 8) Yoshida's reaction by tuberculin in patients of uro-genital tuberculosis was not inhibited by anti-histamine or anti-plasmin. The following conclusions were derived from the present data as well as those reported previously as the first and second report of this series. 1) A transient leucopenia with is brought about in tuberculous patients when a small dosage of tuberculous vaccine or old tuberclin is subcutaneously injected, and which is known as Yoshida's reaction, is caused by an antigen-antibody reac-between tuberculin and the humoral antibody in the serum of the patients. It has, tion therefore, no relation with the tissue antibodies which cause the cutaneous reaction known as tuberculin reaction. For this reason, Yoshida's reaction does not appear paraller with the <b>intracutaneous</b> tuberculin <b>reaction.</b> 2) Positivity of Yoshida's reaction may be influenced by the amount of tuberculous antibodies in the serum, for a leucopenia is of higher degree and of logger duration when the precipitin titer is higher as indicated by the experiment with eggalbumin. An increase in the intensity of Yoshida's reaction may, therefore, indicate an increase in the titer of serum precipitin against tuberculous antigen of the respective patient; thus, probably, an increase in the activity of the tuberculoss lesion. 3) Yoshida states that his reaction can be employed in the differentiation of tuberculous diseases from others, and in the estimation of the activity of tubercuous lesions and of prognosis. The present auther considers that the results of his experiments corroborate Yoshida's assertion...|$|R
