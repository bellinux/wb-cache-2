Soon {{after the death of}} Anthemius, Ricimer also died, on August 9 or 19; his nephew Gundobad was {{elevated}} to Magister militum in his place. Very little is known of Olybrius' policy; in his Vita Epifanius, Ennodius describes him as a pious man who acted accordingly. As evidence, he had minted a new series of gold coins bearing a cross and the new legend SALVS MVNDI ("Welfare of the World") instead of the usual SALVS REIPVBLICAE ("Welfare of the State"). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>noteworthy</b> that Olybrius is depicted on his coins without helm and spear, common symbols on his predecessors' coinage, suggesting he had little interest in military matters.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{introduction}} to the U.S. market in late 2000, the XG/Azera had been a consistent seller until late 2008, when it suffered a significant drop in sales. Although there are several possible explanations for this decline, it's worth {{pointing out that the}} Hyundai Genesis sedan was introduced to the U.S. market in late 2008, suggesting that the more sophisticated rear-wheel drive Genesis may have cannibalized sales of the Azera. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>noteworthy</b> that the Hyundai Genesis sedan is considered by auto journalists to be a rival to the aforementioned full-size and near luxury vehicles that the 2012 Azera is positioned against, such as the Ford Taurus, Toyota Avalon, and Buick LaCrosse.|$|E
25|$|The 1918 season {{showed that}} the {{so-called}} 'Association game' {{was in a state}} of flux, with the competition being contested by at least 22 Brisbane teams, many of which were from new clubs (it is unclear whether the competition included separate 'divisions'). The competition included Celtic (Junction Park), Ellenas (Gregory Park, Milton), Excelsior (New Farm), Fairfield (Yeronga), Kalinga (Hendra), Kurilpa (Musgrave Park, South Brisbane), Latrobe (Milton), Natives (Raymond Park, Kangaroo Point), Oxley (Ramblers?), Park Church, Pineapple A (Pineapple Sportsground, Kangaroo Point), Pineapple B (Raymond Park), Ramblers (possibly Oxley Ramblers), Red Rovers, Rangers (Junction Park), Rebels (Milton), Royals, St Philip's, Violets (Musgrave Park), Wanderers, Wallabies and Wellington (Pineapple Sportsground). It is noteworthy that there was significant ground sharing by a number of clubs (e.g., at least four clubs at Pineapple/Raymond Park and at least three clubs at Milton). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>noteworthy</b> that during the Great War the Ipswich teams once again did not play in the QBFA Brisbane competition, with at least some of those teams re-joining by the 1921 season (as noted below).|$|E

2500|$|In 1893, George Cadbury bought 120 acres (0.5km²) of land {{close to}} the works and planned, at his own expense, a model village which would 'alleviate the evils of modern, more cramped living conditions'.

2500|$|Biochemically, prokaryotic {{heterotrophic}} metabolism is {{much more}} versatile than that of eukaryotic organisms, although many prokaryotes share the most basic metabolic models with eukaryotes, e. g. using glycolysis (also called EMP pathway) for sugar metabolism and the citric acid cycle to degrade acetate, producing {{energy in the form}} of ATP and reducing power in the form of NADH or quinols. [...] These basic pathways are well conserved because they are also involved in biosynthesis of many conserved building blocks needed for cell growth (sometimes in reverse direction). [...] However, many bacteria and archaea utilize alternative metabolic pathways other than glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. [...] A well-studied example is sugar metabolism via the keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate pathway (also called ED pathway) in Pseudomonas. [...] Moreover, there is a third alternative sugar-catabolic pathway used by some bacteria, the pentose phosphate pathway. The metabolic diversity and ability of prokaryotes to use a large variety of organic compounds arises from the much deeper evolutionary history and diversity of prokaryotes, as compared to eukaryotes. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>noteworthy</b> that the mitochondrion, the small membrane-bound intracellular organelle that is the site of eukaryotic energy metabolism, arose from the endosymbiosis of a bacterium related to obligate intracellular Rickettsia, and also to plant-associated Rhizobium or Agrobacterium. [...] Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} all mitrochondriate eukaryotes share metabolic properties with these Proteobacteria. [...] Most microbes respire (use an electron transport chain), although oxygen is not the only terminal electron acceptor that may be used. [...] As discussed below, the use of terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen has important biogeochemical consequences.|$|E
6000|$|At other {{hours and}} seasons the general {{aspect of the}} plain is monotonous, {{and in spite of}} the {{unobstructed}} view, and the unfailing verdure and sunshine, somewhat melancholy, although never sombre: and doubtless the depressed and melancholy feeling the pampa inspires in those who are unfamiliar with it is due in a great measure to the paucity of life, and to the profound silence. The wind, as may well be imagined on that extensive level area, is seldom at rest; there, as in the forest, it is a [...] "bard of many breathings," [...] and the strings it breathes upon give out an endless variety of sorrowful sounds, from the sharp fitful sibilations of the dry wiry grasses on the barren places, to the long mysterious moans that swell and die in the tall polished rushes of the marsh. It is also curious to note that with a few exceptions the resident birds are comparatively very silent, even those belonging to groups which elsewhere are highly loquacious. The reason of this is not far to seek. In woods and thickets, where birds abound most, they are continually losing sight of each other, and are only prevented from scattering by calling often; while the muffling effect on sound of the close foliage, to' which may be added a spirit of emulation where many voices are heard, incites most species, especially those that are social, to exert their voices to the utmost pitch in singing, calling, and screaming. On the open pampas, birds, which are not compelled to live concealed on the surface, can see each other at long distances, and perpetual calling is not needful: moreover, in that still atmosphere sound travels far. As a rule their voices are strangely subdued; nature's silence has infected them, and they have become silent by habit. This is not the case with aquatic species, which are nearly all migrants from noisier regions, and mass themselves in lagoons and marshes, where they are all loquacious together. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>noteworthy</b> that the subdued bird-voices, some of which are exceedingly sweet and expressive, and the notes of many of the insects and batrachians have a great resemblance, and seem to be in accord with the aeolian tones of the wind in reeds and grasses: a stranger to the pampas, even a naturalist accustomed to a different fauna, will often find it hard to distinguish between bird, frog, and insect voices.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} recent World Trade Organization {{dispute settlement}} case for {{many developing countries}} concerned European Union exports of sugar. Brazil, Thailand, and Australia alleged that the exports have substantially exceeded permitted levels as established by European Union commitments in the WTO. This case had major implications for both European Union sugar producers and developing countries that benefited from preferential access to the European Union market. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>noteworthy</b> {{in the use of}} economic arguments by the WTO dispute settlement panel, which held that the excess sugar exports were in part a reflection of illegal de facto cross-subsidization-rents from production that benefited from high support prices being used to cover losses associated with exports of sugar to the world market. Although in principle the economic arguments of the panel could apply to many other policy areas, in practice WTO provisions greatly limit the scope to bring similar arguments for trade in products that are not subject to explicit export subsidy reduction commitments of the type that were made for sugar and other agricultural commodities.
