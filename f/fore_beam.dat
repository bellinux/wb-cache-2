40|$|Abstract — In a {{continuing}} {{evaluation of the}} ERS- 1 C-band scatterometer {{as a tool for}} studying polar sea ice, we evaluate the azimuthal modulation characteristics of Antarctic sea ice. ERS- 1 AMI scatterometer mode data sets from several study regions dispersed in the Antarctic seasonal sea ice pack are evaluated for azimuthal modulation. When appropriate, the incidence angle dependence is estimated and removed in a study region before determining whether azimuthal modulation is present in the data. Other comparisons are made using the <b>fore</b> and aft <b>beam</b> measurement difference. Our results show that over the ice pack, azimuthal modulation is less than 1 dB at the scale of observation of the ERS- 1 C-band scatterometer. I...|$|R
