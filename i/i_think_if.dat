At first it was painful to watch all those things but now I take it as {{constructive}} criticism or I don't bother to look at it.|$|E
25|$|When {{you take}} a tree that {{is rooted in the}} ground, and {{transfer}} it from one place to another, the tree will no longer bear fruit. And if it does, the fruit will not be as good as it was in its original place. This is a rule of nature. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I had left my country, I would be the same as the tree.|$|E
500|$|... "Polkarama!", {{a medley}} of popular hit songs set to a polka beat, was {{recorded}} during the second parody session. Yankovic explained that, [...] "if there’s a song that I think is really ripe for parody but I just can’t think of a clever enough idea, sometimes it’ll {{end up in the}} polka medley." [...] Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, [...] "At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley. Fans would be rioting in the streets, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> I didn't do a polka medley." ...|$|E

500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation. I don't think it ever worked on any level for me. It was just weird and creepy, but I think the whole idea was distasteful to me." [...] He later bluntly {{concluded}} that [...] "it's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn't done." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, Strummer's daughters, Jazz and Lola, gave a rare {{interview}} {{to discuss the}} upcoming tenth anniversary of their father's passing, his legacy {{and the possibility of}} a Clash reunion had their father lived. Jazz said [...] "There was talk about the Clash reforming before he died. But there had been talk for years and years about them reforming. They had been offered stupid amounts of money to do it, but they were very good at keeping the moral high ground and saying no. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> Dad hadn't died, it would have happened. It felt like it was in the air." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{was aware}} {{from the outset}} that her {{circumstances}} would make her vulnerable to [...] "ladies who lunch"-style remarks (sometimes made against women, married to wealthy, high-profile men, who engage in charitable activities), but said, [...] "People who criticise these women are probably giving into cynicism, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you get cynical about life, you lose the real meaning of it." [...] In 2007, she {{became a member of}} the board of directors for Chernobyl Children's Project International, a role that would give her a voice in the organisation's policy making. In 2009, she staged a public abseil of the 17-storey Elysian Tower in Cork to raise funds for the organisation.|$|E

500|$|Strong {{support in}} Montreal, and the {{response}} in Ottawa after the games were moved to the national capital left Eagleson increasingly confident in the tournament's future. The 1981 Canada Cup turned a profit of about C$1 million to be split between Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League Players Association pension fund, one third that of the 1976 tournament. Shortly after the tournament ended, Eagleson confirmed he intended to hold a third Canada Cup. [...] He noted that Canada's loss in the final {{played a role in}} his decision: [...] "As far as I am concerned personally, it's probably preferable that we lost. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> we had won, I'd have said, 'To hell with it'." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success. Lords later commented: [...] "The problem with that album {{was that it was}} ahead of its time. Electronica was just starting to happen. Moby was just starting to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> it had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. I am proud of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E
500|$|Following pleas from Brown {{to resurrect}} Nick, John Altman {{returned}} to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin). [...] Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|E

500|$|In his {{response}} to the controversy generated by the removal of Confederate monuments as highlighted by the August, 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Barkley stated, [...] "I’ve never thought about those statues a day in my life. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you asked most black people to be honest, they ain’t thought a day in their life about those stupid statues. What we as black people need to do: We {{need to worry about}} getting our education, we need to stop killing each other, we need {{to try to find a}} way to have more economic opportunity and things like that. Those things are important and significant. You know, I’m wasting time and energy [...] screaming at a neo-Nazi, or [...] ‘Man, you’ve got to take this statue down.'” ...|$|E
500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and {{directed}} by Harry Winer, marking both Klemmer and Enbom's eleventh writing credit, and Winer's third directing credit for the series. Klemmer and Enbom initially thought {{that they would be}} unable to write the episode because they didn't know very much about American football—so they tried to make the episode less about football. Enbom stated, [...] "Rob just sort of handed [...] down. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you play strict attention, you'll find it isn't as footbally as an episode about a football player could possibly be. And I think that's why." [...] The episode did not have the budget to hire a full football team, so several scenes were devoid of extras, including when Veronica meets one of the football players and when she breaks into the locker room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "you're right, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and, <b>if</b> I'm {{given an}} opportunity, I'll {{undertake}} the thing. The credit will be yours if I'm successful." ...|$|R

500|$|The band {{spent the}} {{remainder}} {{of the year in the}} studio, recording what would become Seventh Star. Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band's manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as [...] "Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi" [...] in January 1986. [...] "It opened up a whole can of worms really", Iommi explained, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> we could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more." [...] Seventh Star, which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album [...] "often misunderstood and underrated".|$|E
500|$|Delany {{compared}} Katherine's new realizations {{to that of}} actress Meredith Baxter, who {{realized she}} was a lesbian late in her life after entering into {{a relationship with a}} woman. Delany said she believed her character would be taken by surprise by the new feelings she is experiencing: [...] "I think that she’s still so emotionally vulnerable from getting out of the loony bin, and I think she and Robin connect on a kind of wounded, emotional level. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> anything, she’s feeling this kind of emotional solace with her, and that draws her to Robin in a physical way, and that’s confusing to her." [...] Delany and Benz were both sick when they filmed their kiss scene. Benz said of the scene, [...] "Dana's a great kisser." [...] Delany said more male crew members were present for the filming of the lesbian kiss scene than usual due to the sensuality of the scene.|$|E
500|$|He {{frequently}} {{tells the}} press that [...] "My music is not Christian, Lecrae is." [...] He told Miami New Timess Crossfade that [...] "I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you're going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it's spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! it's all {{the same}} to me, in coorse, but <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>if</b> ye know'd that it's 'bout the Termagant, and that 'ere whale wot--but it don't matter. Good-mornin'." ...|$|R

500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} {{presumptive}} 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump, Cryer shared his feelings on the May 5, 2016, {{episode of the}} podcast Never Not Funny. Cryer stated, [...] "I have been pointing out, and I have been screaming to the rooftops, that Donald Trump is the Charlie Sheen of politics. [...] I have to tell you, I love Charlie Sheen, I loved working {{with him when he}} was sober, but he was, he's full of shit. He has been full of shit, you know, he has serious addiction. You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You know, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E
500|$|The Frenchman took {{a sabbatical}} in 1992 after {{being fired from}} Ferrari for {{publicly}} criticizing {{the car and the}} team, while the Brazilian struggled as McLaren was no longer competitive with Williams. Prost announced his signing with Williams for the upcoming 1993 season. Senna had wanted to join Williams too, as they were the most competitive, but Prost had a clause in his contract forbidding the Brazilian as a teammate. An infuriated Senna called the Frenchman a [...] "coward" [...] during a press conference at Estoril, and decried his unwillingness to compete for the Drivers' Championship on equal sporting terms: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> Prost wants to be called the sole champion, three-times world champion, come back in a sportive way, maybe win another championship, he should be sportive. The way he's doing, he's behaving like a coward. And if he wants to be sportive, he must be prepared to race anybody, at any condition, at equal terms.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suggest nothing," [...] {{answered}} Wilding, unmoved. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>I</b> state. <b>If</b> I {{thought a}} man's honour imperilled in this service, {{you would not}} see me at this table now. I can make you no more convincing answer." ...|$|R
