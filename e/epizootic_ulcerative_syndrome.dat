40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} a rat model of <b>ulcerative</b> colitis with <b>syndrome</b> of spleen deficiency and dampness stagnancy. METHODS: Sixty rats {{were divided into}} normal control group, ulcerative colitis group, <b>ulcerative</b> colitis with <b>syndrome</b> of spleen deficiency and dampness stagnancy group (model group) and strengthening spleen for resolving dampness group. Ulcerative colitis in rats was induced by enema containing trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and ethanol. The rats in the model group were suffered from standing in water, limiting sleeping time and abnormal diet based on administration of TNBS and ethanol. The rats in the spleen strengthening and dampness resolving group were gastrically administered with Shenlin Baizhu Powder, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Symptoms, signs and pathological changes in colon tissue of rats were observed after modeling. The levels of interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 8 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in serum of rats were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The rats in the model group showed lethargy, poor appetite, loss of energy, diarrhea and bloody stool. Their body weight decreased significantly compared with the normal control group, and similar changes {{were found in the}} comparison of food intake, drinking amount, urine amount, stool wet weight and assay of spontaneous activity (P< 0. 05). When observed under a light microscope, the colon tissues of rats in the model group showed mucosal edema, congestion, inflammatory cell infiltration and ulceration.

40|$|Abstract. Turner {{syndrome}} is a chromosomal disease frequently associated with autoimmune disorders including diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease and {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD). Although the etiology of IBD has not been fully elucidated, genetic analysis has recently revealed several susceptibility genes. Recently, cases with Turner syndrome associated with IBD have been reported. We report here a 13 -yr-old girl with Turner <b>syndrome</b> associated with <b>ulcerative</b> colitis. The patient was undergoing growth hormone treatment and presented with abdominal discomfort and bloody diarrhea. Her karyotype pattern was 46,X,i(Xq). Barium enema revealed punctate collections of barium suggesting microulcerations in the descending and sigmoid colon with loss of haustra. Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed that the mucosa was erythematous and friable upon touch and that the wall had frank hemorrhage and inflammatory polyp formation from the anal verge through the splenic flexure. Histologically, mucosal and submucosal inflammation was prominent, suggesting cryptitis and crypt abscess formation. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as having ulcerative colitis, and 5 -aminosalicylic acid, prednisolone and dietary therapy were initiated. Our observations in this patient suggest that X chromosome abnormality may influence the development of IBD and that screening for gastrointestinal disease in patients with Turner syndrome may help lengthen life expectancy in these patients.

40|$|David J Gracie, 1 Alexander C Ford 1, 2 1 Leeds Gastroenterology Institute, St James’s University Hospital, 2 Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) are chronic gastrointestinal disorders that, until recently, {{have been}} considered dichotomous conditions falling {{on either side of}} a functional-organic divide. However, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, akin to those of IBS, are observed in up to one in three patients with quiescent UC. Whether these lower gastrointestinal symptoms are secondary to coexistent IBS or occult UC disease activity is uncertain, but when objective evidence of disease activity is lacking, escalation of conventional pharmacotherapy in such patients is often ineffective. The etiologies of both UC and IBS remain unclear, but dysregulation of the enteric nervous system, an altered microbiome, low-grade mucosal inflammation, and activation of the brain–gut axis is common to both; this suggests that some overlap between the two conditions is plausible. How best to investigate and manage IBS-type symptoms in UC patients remains unclear. Studies that have assessed patients with UC who meet criteria for IBS for subclinical inflammation have been conflicting in their results. Although evidence-based treatments for IBS exist, their efficacy in UC patients reporting these types of symptoms remains unclear. Given the disturbances in gut microbiota in UC, and the possible role of the brain–gut axis in the generation of such symptoms, treatments such as probiotics, fecal transfer, antidepressants, or psychological therapies would seem logical approaches to use in this group of patients. However, there are only limited data for all of these therapies; this suggests that randomized controlled trials to investigate their efficacy in this setting may be warranted.

40|$|The {{research}} reported herein {{was designed}} to assess whether the bacterium, Dietzia subspecies C 79793 - 74, used as a probiotic, could prevent development of parameters indicative of bovine paratuberculosis after potential in utero, birthing and neonatal (colostrum) exposure to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Such exposure avenues are especially relevant for dairy farms practicing good management procedures since calves on these farms could be infected via dams {{that have yet to}} be identified as MAP-positive. Indeed, of 18 calves in the present study that became paratuberculosis parameter-positive, five had dams that were negative for all parameters pre-calving. Parameters used herein to define paratuberculosis status were serum ELISA, serum agar gel immunodiffusion, cultureable fecal MAP, histopathology at necropsy and clinical disease. Thirty-four newborn calves whose dams were paratuberculosis-positive were assigned to four different treatment groups. Ten were treated daily for 60 days with viable Dietzia added to their antibiotic-free milk feedings; none became positive for any parameter with age. In contrast, seven of eight calves that were not treated became positive for one or more paratuberculosis-associated parameter. Sixteen calves were treated with viable Dietzia for the first two days of life; eight were then not treated further, whereas the other eight were treated an additional 58 days with Dietzia added to tetracycline-fortified milk (Dietzia is sensitive to tetracycline). In these two groups, positivity developed in five of eight and six of eight, respectively. These results indicated that (a) a daily, 60 -day treatment with viable Dietzia effectively prevented development of parameters indicative of paratuberculosis and (b) this treatment, in combination with good management practices, has the potential to eradicate MAP from animals/herds, which should curtail the spread of MAP.

40|$|Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) {{is a human}} sexually {{transmitted}} disease caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars L 1 -L 3).

Besides potential host-related factors, the differential disease severity and tissue tropism among LGV strains is likely {{a function of the}} genetic backbone of the strains. We aimed to characterize the genetic variability among LGV strains as strain- or serovar-specific mutations may underlie phenotypic signatures, and to investigate the mutational events that occurred throughout the pathoadaptation of the epidemic L 2 b lineage. By analyzing 20 previously published genomes from L 1, L 2, L 2 b and L 3 strains and two new genomes from L 2 b strains, we detected 1497 variant sites and about 100 indels, affecting 453 genes and 144 intergenic regions, with 34 genes displaying a clear overrepresentation of nonsynonymous mutations. Effectors and/or type III secretion substrates (almost all of those described in the literature) and inclusion membrane proteins showed amino acid changes that were about fivefold more frequent than silent changes. More than 120 variant sites occurred in plasmid-regulated virulence genes, and 66 % yielded amino acid changes. The identified serovar-specific variant sites revealed that the L 2 b-specific mutations are likely associated with higher fitness and pointed out potential targets for future highly discriminatory diagnostic/typing tests. By evaluating the evolutionary pathway beyond the L 2 b clonal radiation, we observed that 90. 2 % of the intra-L 2 b variant sites occurring in coding regions involve nonsynonymous mutations, where CT 456 /tarp has been the main target. Considering the progress on C. trachomatis genetic manipulation, this study may constitute an important contribution for prioritizing study targets for functional genomics aiming to dissect the impact of the identified intra-LGV polymorphisms on virulence or tropism dissimilarities among LGV strains.

Indirect immunofluorescence using human umbilical cord as substrate was employed and the total levels of IgA were determined by turbidimetry in all groups. The study was conducted on 57 celiac patients (18 at diagnosis, 24 who adhered to a gluten-free diet and 15 with marked or slight transgression of the diet), 115 relatives of celiac patients (39 families), 94 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases, and 126 healthy individuals from the general population. Results - The results demonstrated 100 % positivity for the recently diagnosed patients and for those consuming gluten, in contrast to the patients who complied with the diet (0 %). In the control group one individual was positive, but refused to undergo a biopsy. In the group of other gastrointestinal diseases, one positive patient presented <b>ulcerative</b> colitis, Down's <b>syndrome</b> and epilepsy, and the intestinal biopsy was diagnostic for celiac disease. These data showed 99. 3 % specificity for the test. Eighteen relatives were positive for antiendomysial antibodies IgA (15. 65 %), and comparison with the healthy population revealed a significant difference. An intestinal biopsy was obtained from seven subjects (one with total villous atrophy and six withouth alterations in the mucosal architecture, but all with a high number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes). Conclusions - The method revealed 100 % sensitivity and 99. 3 % specificity. Because it is not an invasive method it can be used for the screening of atypical and latent forms of celiac disease to avoid serial biopsies and to control adherence to a gluten-free diet with implications in the prevention of malignancy in celiac disease...|$|R
