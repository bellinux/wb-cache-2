The worst act of terrorism against the United States prior to 9/11, the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 189 Americans, happened during the Reagan years.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mandibles {{were highly}} specialized. Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia {{provides}} {{further evidence that}} the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual mouthparts of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other extinct species found in Burmese, French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which also show morphologies not seen in extant ants.|$|E
5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, it is <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, {{most of the major}} structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as it was <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not {{stood up to the}} strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over {{defining}} URLs and URNs it became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two concepts embodied by the terms were merely aspects of the fundamental, overarching notion of resource identification. In June 1994, the IETF published Berners-Lee's RFC 1630: the first Request for Comments that acknowledged the existence of URLs and URNs, and, more importantly, defined a formal syntax for Universal Resource Identifiers— URL-like strings whose precise syntaxes and semantics depended on their schemes. In addition, this RFC attempted to summarize the syntaxes of URL schemes in use at the time. It also acknowledged, but did not standardize, the existence of relative URLs and fragment identifiers.|$|E
5|$|It {{quickly became}} <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{cyclical}} {{pattern of the}} monsoon weather would dictate the timing and pace of military operations in the northeast. From November through May (the dry season), North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces advanced out of Sam Neua Province along Route 6 {{and out of the}} Barthelemy Pass through Ban Ban toward the Plain of Jars. The lack of roads and the primitive state of those that did exist forced the communists to stretch their lines of communication taut, inviting counterattack. This Vang Pao's forces did from June through October (the wet season), utilizing air power, air mobility, and guerrilla tactics to push the communists back to their starting places.|$|E

5|$|It {{soon became}} <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dominicans needed to {{reestablish}} themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, while de las Casas was in Spain, Francisco Marroquín, bishop of Guatemala, placed the first stone {{for the new}} Dominican convent in Ciudad Real. The Dominicans dedicated themselves to destroying indigenous temples and idols, and preached sermons with destructive imagery, such as from the Book of Revelation, that were more familiar to the Mesoamerican worldview. Saints were associated with animals, {{in much the same}} way as the Indians identified themselves with nahual spirit-forms. Different Mesoamerican otherworlds were tied to Christian concepts, where the Mictlan world of the dead became Hell, Ihuicatl became Heaven, and Tlalocan became Paradise.|$|E
5|$|Later, more {{specific}} similarities were discovered: for example, the Distal-less gene {{was found in}} 1989 {{to be involved in}} the development of appendages or limbs in fruit flies, the fins of fish, the wings of chickens, the parapodia of marine annelid worms, the ampullae and siphons of tunicates, and the tube feet of sea urchins. It was <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gene must be ancient, dating back to the last common ancestor of bilateral animals (before the Ediacaran Period, which began some 635 million years ago). Evo-devo had started to uncover the ways that all animal bodies were built during development.|$|E
5|$|The DVD's special {{features}} include {{an interview with}} Wiseau, who is asked questions by an off-screen Greg Sestero.

A few of Wiseau's answers are dubbed in, although it is <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dubbed responses match what he was originally saying. Wiseau fails to answer several of the questions, instead offering non sequiturs.|$|E

5|$|The Pisones {{had been}} {{longtime}} {{supporters of the}} Claudians, and had allied themselves with the young Octavian after his marriage to Livia, the mother of Tiberius. Germanicus's death and accusations indicted the new Princeps. Piso was placed on trial and, according to Tacitus, threatened to implicate Tiberius. Whether the governor actually could connect the Princeps {{to the death of}} Germanicus is unknown; rather than continuing to stand trial when it became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Senate was against him, Piso committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|After {{confirming}} {{the development of}} a tropical depression, authorities in Costa Rica issued a green alert for coastal regions on September14. The following day, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Atlantic coast of the country. National television and radio stations broadcast warning messages to the public, and emergency crews were dispatched in case conditions were to warrant intervention. This helped with the effective and timely clearing of hospitals, as well as the evacuation of residents in high-risk zones. A tropical storm warning was posted for the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on September15, extending south from Puerto Cabezas to the adjacent islands. In Honduras, early storm warnings allowed several hundred residents to evacuate well ahead of Gert's arrival. Once it became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> storm would strike the Yucatán Peninsula, coastal areas from Belize northward to Cozumel, Mexico were placed under a tropical storm warning on September17 until Gert's landfall the next day.|$|E
5|$|As it {{had become}} <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Aouzou Strip was being used by Libya {{as a base for}} deeper {{involvement}} in Chad, Malloum decided to bring the issue of the Strip's occupation before the UN and the Organisation of African Unity. Malloum also decided he needed new allies; he negotiated a formal alliance with Habré, the Khartoum Accord, in September. This accord was kept secret until 22 January, when a Fundamental Charter was signed, following which a National Union Government was formed on 29 August 1978 with Habré as Prime Minister. The Malloum-Habré accord was actively promoted by Sudan and Saudi Arabia, both of which feared a radical Chad controlled by Gaddafi. The two nations saw in Habré, with his good Muslim and anti-colonialialist credentials, the only chance to thwart Gaddafi's plans.|$|E

5|$|At noon on 9 February, while {{cruising}} independently, Truxtun's men sighted a frigate off {{the coast}} of Nevis. Upon approach it was <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vessel was flying American colors, and Constellation attempted to move closer to investigate. The frigate was the French L'Insurgente under Michel-Pierre Barreaut. Approaching L'Insurgente, Truxtun signaled her to discern her nationality, first displaying British signals followed by the American signals. L'Insurgente replaced the American colors with the French and fired a gun, the purpose of which was unclear. Truxtun claimed L'Insurgente's shot was fired to windward to signal a fight, while Barreaut claimed he ordered the shot fired to leeward to signal that he wished to communicate. Regardless, Barreaut mistook the Constellation for a British warship and fled toward the Dutch islands of Saba and Sint Eustatius to escape, while Truxtun gave chase. By 1:30p.m. both ships had sailed into a gale. In the storm L'Insurgente was damaged and lost her main topmast. Constellation came through unscathed and continued to close on Barreaut.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 21st century it became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> soft stone of the Cenotaph was deteriorating badly as a result of water damage and frost. Recutting the names on the {{monument}} was discounted as a solution due to the long term damage this repeated work would cause to the Cenotaph's structure: {{the decision was made to}} expand the war memorial instead. A glass wall consisting of eight large panels 2.85m (9ft) by 1.2m (4ft) in size, was built alongside the Cenotaph at a cost of £130,000. The panels were engraved with the names of the World War I casualties and, in addition, those from Southampton who had died in later conflicts. The Memorial Wall included a total of 2,368 names from the First World War, 927 from the Second World War and three from subsequent conflicts. This addition to the Cenotaph was opened on 11 December 2011.|$|E
5|$|Groves made {{critical}} {{decisions on}} prioritizing the various methods of isotope separation and acquiring raw materials {{needed by the}} scientists and engineers. By the time he assumed command of the project, it was <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> AA-3 priority rating that Marshall had obtained was insufficient. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although {{there was also a}} special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide an AAA rating on request for critical materials to remove bottlenecks. Groves went to Donald M. Nelson, the chairman of the War Production Board and, after threatening to take the matter to the President, obtained a AAA priority for the Manhattan project. It was agreed that the AA-3 priority would still be used where possible.|$|E

5|$|In February 1996, Molyneux {{decided to}} focus on the project full-time. According to Carter, the creatures were made from bitmaps, and there was around 90 {{megabytes}} of graphics data on screen as of April 1996. In July 1996, Alex Peters joined the project and ported the game to Windows 95. Dungeon Keeper was shown at the European Computer Trade Show in September 1996, and was scheduled for release in December. It became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deadline would be missed, and release was pushed back to March 1997. The final testing began in April 1997, and Dungeon Keeper was signed off in June. Dungeon Keeper was released by Electronic Arts in June 1997 for Windows 95 and MS-DOS. Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation versions were in development and due for release in 1997, but cancelled. An internet version was in development, and would have supported up to 250 players.|$|E
5|$|In the {{canonical}} I Ching, the hexagrams {{are arranged in}} an order dubbed the King Wen sequence after King Wen of Zhou, who founded the Zhou dynasty and supposedly reformed the method of interpretation. The sequence generally pairs hexagrams with their upside-down equivalents, although in eight cases hexagrams are paired with their inversion. Another order, found at Mawangdui in 1973, arranges the hexagrams into eight groups sharing the same upper trigram. But the oldest known manuscript, found in 1987 and now held by the Shanghai Library, was almost certainly arranged in the King Wen sequence, and it has even been proposed that a pottery paddle from the Western Zhou period contains four hexagrams in the King Wen sequence. Whichever of these arrangements is older, it is not <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> order of the hexagrams was {{of interest to the}} original authors of the Zhou yi. The assignment of numbers, binary or decimal, to specific hexagrams is a modern invention.|$|E
5|$|Securing the {{favour of}} the priesthood was {{essential}} for the Ptolemaic kings to retain effective rule over the populace. The High Priests of Memphis—where the king was crowned—were particularly important, as they were the highest religious authorities {{of the time and}} had influence throughout the kingdom. Given that the decree was issued at Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt, rather than Alexandria, the centre of government of the ruling Ptolemies, it is <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young king was anxious to gain their active support. Thus, although the government of Egypt had been Greek-speaking ever since the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Memphis decree, like the two preceding decrees in the series, included texts in Egyptian to show its connection to the general populace by way of the literate Egyptian priesthood.|$|E
