5|$|Bitter {{for having}} nothing left but a pot, the son {{closes the door}} on every person who asks for his help. Each time he does so, the pot takes on the {{symptoms}} of the ones who ask for help, it starts disturbing the son and prevents him from having any peace of mind. This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed {{one by one and}} the son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob wishes he could fly with the jellyfish. He makes several attempts to do so, but all of these fail. At home, SpongeBob is drying his hair and receives a phone call, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> hair dryer in his square pants, and the dryer inflates them, giving him the ability to fly. He goes around helping people, earning their admiration and becoming a superhero of sorts. However, other characters continue to ask increasingly unnecessary favors of him, leaving him no time to fly with the jellyfish.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there are times when {{it may be necessary to}} restrict capital flows. Rather, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{arrives in}} Albert Square {{with his brother}} Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), as {{the owners of the}} local garage, the Arches. Grant had {{returned}} from being a paratrooper in the Army involved in the Falklands War. After a brief fling with Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright) and getting involved in various dodgy deals, Grant starts wooing the local barmaid, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). Sharon is attracted to his machismo, and soon their flirting progresses into a relationship. Fiercely protective of his girlfriend, most of Grant's initial problems in the Square revolve around his over-possessive nature and jealousy. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> landlord of The Queen Victoria public house, Eddie Royle (Michael Melia), in hospital after he makes a pass at Sharon; he later becomes prime suspect for Royle's murder, but Nick Cotton (John Altman) eventually owns up to the crime. In the wake of this, Grant decides to re-enlist in the army, but is rejected when he fails their psychiatric tests.|$|E

[...] The title is a reference to her belief that [...] "we as individuals... are still so innocent that we think if we asked our murderer just before <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> final wrench upon the throat, 'Would you please give me a cool drink of water?' and he would do so'". [...] Angelou has said that if she [...] "didn't believe that, [...] wouldn't {{get up in the}} morning".|$|E

But the butler does not know the identities of the guests, and so <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> hats into boxes selected at random.

500|$|While {{acting as}} regent, Eddard learns that Ser Gregor [...] "The Mountain" [...] Clegane was spotted leading brigands and attacking {{villages in the}} Riverlands. Realizing this is revenge for Tyrion's arrest, Eddard orders Lord Beric Dondarrion to secure Gregor's arrest, strips him of his lands and titles, and summons his Lord Tywin Lannister to answer for Gregor's actions. Fearing war with the Lannisters and for his daughters' lives, he orders Arya and Sansa to return to Winterfell for their safety. Sansa protests and {{mentions}} her desire to have the blond-haired Joffrey's children; Eddard realizes something and re-reads the book of lineages of the Baratheon family. Doing so, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> pieces together: Joffrey does not have black hair like his father, his father's ancestors, and Robert's bastards whom he and Jon Arryn had been researching. Eddard concludes Joffrey is not Robert's real son.|$|E
500|$|The film {{contains}} further self-referential material, as a {{film about}} a writer having difficulty writing (written by the Coen brothers while they were having difficulty writing Miller's Crossing). Barton is trapped between his own desire to create meaningful art and Capitol Pictures' need to use its standard conventions to earn profits. Audrey's advice about following the formula would have saved Barton, {{but he does not}} heed it. However, when <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> mysterious package on his writing desk (which might have contained her head), she might have been helping him posthumously, in other ways. The movie itself toys with standard screenplay formulas. As with Mayhew's scripts, Barton Fink contains a [...] "good wrestler" [...] (Barton, it seems) and a [...] "bad wrestler" [...] (Charlie) who [...] "confront" [...] each other at the end. But in typical Coen fashion, the lines of good and evil are blurred, and the supposed hero in fact reveals himself to be deaf to the pleadings of his [...] "common man" [...] neighbor. By blurring the lines between reality and surreal experience, the film subverts the [...] "simple morality tales" [...] and [...] "road maps" [...] offered to Barton as easy paths for the writer to follow.|$|E

2500|$|In the Analects, Confucius {{presents}} {{himself as}} a [...] "transmitter who invented nothing". <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> greatest emphasis {{on the importance of}} study, and it is the Chinese character for study (...) that opens the text. Far from trying to build a systematic or formalist theory, he wanted his disciples to master and internalize older classics, so that their deep thought and thorough study would allow them to relate the moral problems of the present to past political events (as recorded in the Annals) or the past expressions of commoners' feelings and noblemen's reflections (as in the poems of the Book of Odes).|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} study in 1985 by the {{anthropologist}} Alfred Kemp Pallasen compares the oral traditions with historical facts and linguistic evidence. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> {{date of the}} ethnogenesis of Sama-Bajau as 800 AD and also rejects a historical connection between the Sama-Bajau and the Orang Laut. He hypothesises that the Sama-Bajau originated from a proto-Sama-Bajau people inhabiting the Zamboanga Peninsula who practised both fishing and slash-and-burn agriculture. They were the original inhabitants of Zamboanga and the Sulu archipelago, and were well-established in the region long before the first arrival of the Tausūg people at around the 13th century from their homelands along the northern coast of eastern Mindanao. Along with the Tausūg, they were heavily influenced by the Malay kingdoms both culturally and linguistically, becoming Indianised by the 15th century and Islamised by the 16th century. They also engaged in extensive trade with China for [...] "luxury" [...] sea products like trepang, pearls, and shark fin.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} 20 {{years of his}} {{photography}} Weston determined all of his exposure settings by estimation based on his previous experiences and the relatively narrow tolerances of the film at that time. He said, [...] "I dislike to figure out time, and find my exposures more accurate when only [...] "felt"." [...] In the late 1930s he acquired a Weston exposure meter and continued {{to use it as}} an aid to determine exposures throughout his career. Photo historian Nancy Newhall wrote that [...] "Young photographers are confused and amazed when they behold him measuring with his meter every value in the sphere where he intends to work, from the sky to the ground under his feet. He is [...] "feeling the light" [...] and checking his own observations. After which <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> meter away and does what he thinks. Often he adds up everything ‒ filters, extension, film, speed, and so on ‒ and doubles the computation." [...] Weston, Newhall noted, believed in [...] "massive exposure", which he then compensated for by hand-processing the film in a weak developer solution and individually inspecting each negative as it continued to develop to get the right balance of highlights and shadows.|$|E
5000|$|Gustave A. Sedon (1820- April 5, 1893) was a noted {{carpenter}} and craftsman in nineteenth century Roanoke, Virginia.

[...] "He didn't build buildings, he ornamented them. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> woodwork on Pleasant Grove, he carved <b>the</b> columns, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> woodwork on West Dormitory at Hollins {{and a number of other}} places." ...|$|R
