50|$|In the United States, caller ID {{information}} {{is sent to}} the called party by the telephone switch as an analogue data stream (similar to data passed between two modems), using Bell 202 modulation {{between the first and second}} rings, while the telephone unit is still on hook. If the telephone call is answered too quickly after the first ring, caller ID information will not be transmitted to the recipient. There are two types of caller ID, number only and name+number. Number-only caller ID is called Single Data Message Format (SDMF), which provides the caller's telephone number, the date and time of the call. Name+number caller ID is called Multiple Data Message Format (MDMF), which in addition to the information provided by SDMF format, can also provide the directory listed name for the particular number. Caller ID readers which are compatible with MDMF can also read the simpler SDMF format, but an SDMF caller <b>ID</b> <b>reader</b> will not recognize an MDMF data stream, and will act as if there is no caller ID information present, e.g. as if the line is not equipped for caller ID.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{proposes a}} method of pose (position and orientation) fitting of {{construction}} compo-nents in a construction site for automated handling based on the relation between components (parts) and their information (packets). Robots can acquire the required information of the component via the environment-attached storages, such as RFID devices. When an <b>ID</b> <b>reader</b> identifies an ID device, it should take some pose in its communication range. This fact may bring the idea of estimating the pose of a component that carries the de-vice. In this idea, only single device identification cannot fix the pose of the component. We define the condi-tions of the <b>ID</b> <b>reader</b> and ID devices for the pose fitting, and propose a fitting method {{with at least two}} different identifications where two devices are not attached to the same plane or parallel planes of the component.

In Experiment 1, the anaphor test of Elosúa, Carriedo, and García-Madruga (2009) confirmed that readers with intellectual disability (ID) are slower than control readers resolving clitic anaphoric pronouns, especially when the use of morphological cues (e. g. gender) is necessary. In order to test if the poor performance {{could be due to}} low levels of metacognitive skills during reading, an inconsistency detection task combined with eye tracking was designed in Experiment 2. Participants read short texts with an anaphoric pronoun in the fifth sentence, either morphologically (gender) consistent or not with the information provided in the second sentence. The scores in the anaphor comprehension questions presented after the text confirmed that <b>readers</b> with <b>ID</b> are affected by the gender inconsistency but they are unable to explicitly report it and recover from it, as the number of re-fixations after reading the critical sentence suggests. As their answers to the explicit detection questions showed, the adults control group did not show any preference for morphosyntax or semantics in spite of being aware of the inconsistency.

50|$|Unlike the {{biometric}} ID {{cards in}} EU countries which comply with ICAO standards, the second-generation ID card imposes older technologies similar to MIFARE used on public transportation systems, which, unlike its ICAO-compliant counterparts, lacks the proper encryption of personal data such as BAC control, thus making the information stored on the chip openly accessible to any <b>ID</b> card <b>readers</b> at a near enough distance. Strangely, the document's validity period is not recorded on the IC chip, therefore {{one can only}} tell {{the validity of the}} document by physically examining the dates printed {{on the back of the}} card. Also, because ID cards lacks a different numbering scheme from the citizen's identity number for Chinese nationals, there's currently no way to deregister a lost ID card completely even when the loss of the ID card is reported to the police. The above characteristics have made ID cards vulnerable to identification theft, which is overwhelmingly common in China, with stolen ID cards retailing for over 200 yuan each on the black market.

30|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) has substantially {{replaced the}} conventional bar code system of automated identification because RFID is faster, more convenient, and contactless. The many RFID applications developed so far include inventory control, object tracking, and supply chain management. An RFID system usually contains a reader and multiple tags. Each tag {{has a unique}} identification (<b>ID),</b> and the <b>reader</b> recognizes all tags in its radio range through wireless communication. However, collisions occur when multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously because they share the same wireless channel. In this case, the reader cannot immediately recognize any tags, and the collided tags must retransmit their IDs until they are identified. This wastes bandwidth and delays identification. Therefore, an efficient anti-collision algorithm is needed to reduce tag collisions and to accelerate tag identification.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—RFID {{systems with}} battery powered active tags {{are widely used}} in various {{applications}} such as supply chain management and object tracking. In RFID identification, tags transmit their <b>IDs</b> to <b>readers</b> over a shared wireless medium; thus, transmissions from tags often collide causing some tags to use their scarce energy resources to retransmit their IDs. Existing RFID identification protocols are unfair {{in the sense that}} some tags transmit more times compared to others and thus deplete their batteries faster. Locating tags with depleted batteries for replacement is troublesome. This paper addresses the fundamental problem of ensuring required fairness in the number of transmissions per tag while minimizing identifica-tion time in active RFID tag identification. We propose the first Fair RFID Identification Protocol (FRIP) that can achieve any required amount of fairness. The key idea behind FRIP is to bound the expected number of tags that transmit more than once by finding optimal frame sizes for the standardized frame slotted Aloha. We implemented and performed side-by-side comparisons of FRIP with all nine major existing RFID identification protocols. Our results show that FRIP can achieve arbitrarily high fairness. FRIP reduces the average number of transmissions per tag by at least 2. 62 times compared to the best existing protocol. At the same time, it is faster than the existing protocols. FRIP is easy to deploy because it is compliant with the C 1 G 2 standard, and thus, requires no modifications to tags or to the communication protocol between tags and readers. It only needs to be implemented on readers as a software module. FRIP works with multiple readers. Keywords-RFID; Fairness; Identification...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} the {{anonymous}} cardinality estimation problem in {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) systems. To preserve privacy and anonymity, each tag only transmits a portion of its <b>ID</b> to the <b>reader</b> when it is being queried. To achieve complete system coverage and increase the accuracy of measurement, multiple readers with overlapping interrogation zones are deployed. The cardinality estimation problem is to estimate {{the total number of}} tags (or the tag population) in an RFID system. We first propose an exclusive estimator to estimate the number of tags that are exclusively located in the interrogation zone of a selected reader. We then present a multiple-reader tag estimation (MRTE) algorithm that can accurately estimate the tag population using the measurement from different readers and the exclusive estimator. The accuracy of our proposed algorithm and the approximation are validated via simulations. We compare our proposed MRTE algorithm with the enhanced zero-based (EZB) and maximum a posteriori tag estimation (MPTE) algorithms. Although the mean of the estimation error for all three algorithms approaches zero under certain circumstances, the variance of the estimation error for MRTE algorithm increases linearly with the number of readers while it increases exponentially for EZB and MPTE algorithms.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of active travel {{to school in}} children is low and declining. For example, the 2014 National Travel Survey showed that just 46 % of primary school children walk to school. This is {{despite the fact that}} children who actively travel {{have been shown to be}} more physically active overall as well as perform better in class. Beat the Street is a community based intervention which uses RFID (Radio Frequency <b>ID)</b> chip <b>readers</b> attached to locations around the neighbourhood. The aim of the intervention is to encourage walking and cycling by gamifying these travel behaviours; individuals taking part gain points by touching a smartcard on the readers and these points become part of a competition. One of the aims of Beat the Street is to encourage children who already walk and cycle to and from school to do so more, as well as achieve modal shift from motorised transport to active travel as a means of commuting. However, habitual travel mode is ‘sticky’ and, despite the potential health benefits being greater, it may be more difficult to change mode than it is to encourage more activity in those who already walk or cycle. Set in a neighbourhood in the city of Norwich, England, this analysis examines how travel mode prior to the initiation of Beat the Street is associated with subsequent engagement with the intervention and what the association of this engagement is with physical activity change. Aim: This pilot study evaluates how prior travel mode to school is associated with engagement in the Beat the Street intervention in schoolchildren in the city of Norwich, England. Methods: The Beat the Street intervention was conducted within a Norwich neighbourhood for 9 weeks during May-July 2014. Children were recruited to the evaluation via two schools; one in the intervention neighbourhood, and a control located on the opposite side of the city. All year 4 and 5 children (aged 8 - 10 years) were invited at both schools. Recruited children completed a travel diary that recorded their mode of travel to school (active or non-active) for 1 week at baseline (Week 0), mid-intervention (Week 7), and 3 months post-intervention (Week 20). Engagement with the intervention was measured by identifying the total number of times each child touched a Beat the Street RFID reader with their smartcard across the 9 weeks, with this information being automatically stored by the RFID readers. Based on this data, children were classified as having either ‘no’, ‘low’ or ‘high’ engagement with the intervention. Finally, to measure children’s physical activity levels, each participant wore an accelerometer during all three measurement periods, and from accelerometery we derived mean counts per minute (CPM) for each measurement occasion. We then examined differences in levels of engagement with the intervention by travel mode to school, and subsequent changes in physical activity, using linear models. Results: Fifty-one children (34. 0 %) participated at the intervention school and 29 (51. 8 %) at the control. We found that engagement with the intervention was highest amongst those actively travelling to school at baseline with individuals making 99. 9 smartcard touches across the 9 weeks (95 %CI 34. 5, 165. 3), versus 35. 9 (2. 4, 69. 4) for non-active travellers and 24. 0 (11. 8, 36. 2) for those using a mix of active and non-active travel. However, those individuals who were non-active travellers at baseline but switched to become active travellers at post-intervention had the highest levels of engagement overall (192. 5 smartcard touches, 95 %CI 84. 5, 300. 5). Those children who engaged with the intervention the most experienced the greatest increase in physical activity. For example, children with high levels of engagement increased their physical activity by + 13. 1 CPM (95 %CI - 30. 9, 57. 0) during the morning commute to school, whereas those with low levels of engagement experienced a smaller increase in physical activity of + 1. 3 CPM (- 22. 5, 25. 0), and those who did not engage with the intervention experienced a decrease in physical activity of - 5. 1 CPM (- 18. 0, 7. 7) across the study. Conclusions: In conclusion, we found that engagement with Beat the Street was highest amongst those children already active travelling to school, with non-active travellers plus those using a mix of active and non-active modes showing much lower levels of engagement with the intervention. Furthermore, children who demonstrated high levels of engagement with the intervention experienced an increase in physical activity, compared to the decline experienced by those who did not engage. These findings suggest that prior travel behaviours were associated with uptake of this intervention and whilst Beat the Street successfully encouraged active children to undertake more activity, a challenge remains for technology based physical activity interventions to find novel ways to engage and support individuals to switch from inactive behaviours to becoming active...|$|R
