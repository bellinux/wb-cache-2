5|$|The 22.5-foot (6.85m) James Caird was {{launched}} on 24 April 1916. The {{success of the}} voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations {{that would have to}} be made in the most unfavourable of conditions. The prevailing wind was <b>helpfully</b> north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in twenty-six years at sea. On 8 May South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay.|$|E

After realizing the folly of his actions, Bizarro convinces Bizarro Amazo to return the powers to the proper persons.|$|E
25|$|Merezhkovsky's major {{literary}} debut {{came with}} the publication of Poems (1883–1888). It brought the author into the focus of the most favourable critical attention, but – even coupled with Protopop Avvacum, a poetry epic released the same year, could not solve young family's financial problems. <b>Helpfully,</b> Gippius unexpectedly reinvented herself as a prolific fiction writer, starting to churn out novels and novelettes she couldn't later even remember the titles of. Sergey Merezhkovsky's occasional hand-outs also helped the husband and wife to keep their meagre budget afloat.|$|E

[...] Steve Weinberg of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the book a positive review, and described Szavalitz as [...] "a talented, relentless investigator". He noted: [...] "Her outrage surfaces frequently as children die, as once-loving families are atomized and as troubled-teen entrepreneurs escape criminal prosecution while using legal maneuvers to prevail in civil court lawsuits seeking damages", and characterized Help at Any Cost as [...] "an important book about an industry that sometimes helps troubled youth but causes harm way too often." ...|$|E
500|$|British {{official}} broadcaster Channel 4 {{received some}} criticism for {{its coverage of}} the Paralympics. Users of Twitter complained that its coverage of the opening ceremony contained too many commercial breaks, drawing comparisons to similar complaints faced by NBC during the Olympics' opening ceremony; unlike the BBC, who televised the Olympics in the United Kingdom, both NBC and Channel 4 are supported by advertising. Complaints noted that Channel 4 had shown five ad breaks within the first hour of the ceremony, and that ironically, it had recently broadcast a six-hour long late-night dance music special with no adverts at all. Channel 4 defended the criticism by stating that it had broadcast [...] "significantly fewer" [...] commercials than normal for primetime programming during the ceremony, and that the ad breaks were {{needed in order to}} help the channel invest in broadcasting programming such as the Paralympics. Criticism was also made towards comments made by Jon Snow and Krishnan Guru-Murthy during the telecast; Snow was criticized for making comments about war-torn countries during the parade of nations, while Guru-Murthy received similar criticism for quipping that [...] "looking at the ages of these athletes, which have been <b>helpfully</b> provided to us, they're really quite old." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite all the {{transformations in}} the industry, by 1961 the average {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature film was still only —after adjusting for inflation, less than 10 percent more {{than it had been}} in 1950. The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The AIP-style dual genre package was the new model. In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, Hercules Unchained, opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. A suspense film, Terror Is a Man, ran as a [...] "co-feature" [...] with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: [...] "The dénouement <b>helpfully</b> includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'" [...] That year, Roger Corman took AIP down a new road: [...] "When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color." [...] The resulting House of Usher typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification. It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But it is generally seen as a B movie: the schedule was still a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000 (one-tenth the industry average), and its 85-minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B: [...] "Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and <b>helpfully</b> supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|E

2500|$|One view of {{negotiation}} involves three basic elements: process, behavior and substance. [...] The process refers {{to how the}} parties negotiate: {{the context of the}} negotiations, the parties to the negotiations, [...] the tactics used by the parties, and the sequence and stages in which all of these play out. Behavior refers to the relationships among these parties, the communication between them and the styles they adopt. The substance refers to what the parties negotiate over: the agenda, the issues (positions and – more <b>helpfully</b> – interests), the options, and the agreement(s) reached at the end.|$|E
2500|$|Stewart Mason from Allmusic said [...] "Following the Big Rawk Anthem ("Run to You") and the Sensitive Power Ballad ("Heaven"), [...] "Somebody" [...] {{covers the}} third base as a {{straight-ahead}} singalong pop song with a killer chorus. A gift to {{an entire generation}} of cover bands working the bar circuit, [...] "Somebody" [...] has a chorus so simple and catchy that you can actually sing along to it even if you've never actually heard the song before, and Adams and his indispensable musical partner, Jim Vallance, <b>helpfully</b> point out the feasibility of said activity by incorporating a large, somewhat ragged group of backing vocalists for the lengthy vamp of a fadeout. Rather like [...] "Run to You," [...] "Somebody" [...] is just slightly too schematic to qualify as an all-time heartland rock classic, but it still sounds good on the radio." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Dictionary of Modern English Usage {{discusses}} [...] "i before e except after c". Henry Watson Fowler's original 1926 edition {{called the}} rule [...] "very useful", restricting it to words with the [...] "long e" [...] sound, stating further that [...] "words {{in which that}} sound is not invariable, as either, neither, inveigle, do not come under it", and calling seize [...] "an important exception". The entry was retained in Ernest Gowers's 1965 revision. Robert Burchfield rewrote it for the 1996 edition, stating 'the rule can <b>helpfully</b> be extended [...] "except when the word is pronounced with [...] "', and giving a longer list of exceptions, including words excluded from Fowler's interpretation. Robert Allen's 2008 pocket edition states, [...] "The traditional spelling rule ' i before e except after c ' should be extended to include the statement 'when the combination is pronounced -ee- '".|$|E
2500|$|The Yeomen come {{to greet}} [...] "Leonard", who {{insists that the}} tales of his bravery are exaggerated. [...] He flounders when Phoebe greets him, not having been {{introduced}} to her, but Wilfred <b>helpfully</b> identifies her, telling Fairfax (with a strong dose of wishful thinking) that he, Wilfred, is betrothed to Phoebe. [...] He commends her {{to the care of}} her [...] "brother" [...] until the marriage. [...] The headsman enters, and all is ready for the execution. [...] Wilfred, Fairfax (still disguised as Leonard) and two Yeomen go to fetch Fairfax. The Yeomen return and Fairfax announces his own disappearance. The Lieutenant blames the jailer, Wilfred, and declares his life forfeit instead. Wilfred protests his innocence and all wonder [...] not all honestly [...] how the prisoner could have escaped. Point is distraught at the escape of Elsie's husband, and Elsie faints into Fairfax's arms, as all rush off to hunt for Fairfax.|$|E
2500|$|After 1739, [...] "England" [...] (or [...] "all-England") {{became a}} generic {{term used to}} denote {{numerous}} teams {{over the next two}} hundred years. They invariably have important match status, depending on the quality and/or status of their opponents. Sometimes, the all-England teams were given names like [...] "The Rest", which more accurately describes them vis-à-vis their opponents. CricketArchive (CA) lists 29 matches involving teams called England or The Rest between 1739 and 1778. These are all important matches but only one, England v Kent in 1744, has a scorecard. The earliest important match that has been designated [...] "first-class" [...] by CA (i.e., coded F1) was between a Hampshire county team and one called England on Broadhalfpenny Down at Hambledon in Hampshire on 24 June 1772. CA lists all matches involving teams called England without differentiating between international and non-international, so it seems they assume the [...] "England" [...] team of 1772 to be a direct predecessor of the modern England Test team. Not <b>helpfully,</b> CA also uses the term [...] "England XI" [...] and has another list, starting in 1872, of matches played by this team which is currently understood to be the England national team when playing non-international matches on tour. CA's list of England XI matches begins five years before Test cricket started and most of the early matches are between a university team and what is loosely termed an England XI.|$|E
2500|$|Rocko's Modern Life {{has been}} noted for its racy humor. Adults made up more than one-fifth of the {{audience}} for the show during its run. The series contained numerous adult innuendos, such as Rocko's brief stint as a telephone operator in the episode [...] "Canned": the instructions {{on the wall behind}} him <b>helpfully</b> remind all employees to [...] "Be Hot, Be Naughty, and Be Courteous" [...] while he flatly repeats [...] "Oh baby" [...] into the receiver. Joe Murray noted that the season one segment [...] "Leap Frogs" [...] received [...] "some complaints from some parents" [...] due to its sexual humor, leading to Nickelodeon removing the episode from air {{for the remainder of the}} show's run, although it later aired on the cable channel Nicktoons, and was made available on DVD and video streaming sites such as Netflix. In [...] "The Good, the Bad and the Wallaby", Heffer encounters a milking machine and finds pleasure, although only his reactions are shown onscreen. According to writer/director Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, the scene was originally supposed to have hearts appearing in Heffer's eyes at the climactic moment. Although it clearly wasn't going to be included, they described the scene to Nickelodeon censors anyway: [...] "We described the scene, and then waited for the axe to fall, but all they said was 'can you change the hearts to stars?', we said sure, and it went in." [...] The scene, as well as a scene showing Heffer's break-up with the machine, were later removed. They are intact in the Canadian broadcasts of the episode, however. In addition, the uncut version can still be found on the VHS [...] "Rocko's Modern Life: With Friends Like These".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the many}} transformations in the industry, the average {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature film was effectively stable {{over the course of}} the 1950s. In 1950, the figure had been $1 million; in 1961, it reached $2 million—after adjusting for inflation, the increase in real terms was less than 10 percent. The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The dual genre-movie package, popularized by American International Pictures (AIP) the previous decade, was the new face of the double feature. In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, Hercules Unchained, opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. An 82-minute-long suspense film, Terror Is a Man, produced by a Manila-based, American-Philippine company, ran as a [...] "co-feature." [...] It had a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: [...] "The dénouement <b>helpfully</b> includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'" [...] That year, Roger Corman took American International down a new road: [...] "When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color." [...] A period piece in the vein of Britain's Hammer Films, House of Usher was a success, launching a series of Poe-based movies Corman would direct for AIP. It also typifies the continuing ambiguities of B-picture classification. House of Usher was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But from a latter-day perspective, it is regarded as a B movie—that schedule was a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000, one-tenth the industry average. Low-budget-movie aficionado John Reid reports once asking a neighborhood theater manager to define [...] "B picture." [...] The response: [...] "Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes." [...] House of Ushers running time is close, 85 minutes. And despite its high status in studio terms, it was not sent out into the world on its own, but screened in tandem with a crime melodrama asking the eternal question Why Must I Die? ...|$|E

Miss Fosbrook offered to commission her sisters to buy the Prussian blue, lake, and gamboge in London, and send them in a letter. This was a new idea to Bessie, and she was only not quite decided between the certainty that London paints must be better than country ones, and the desire of the walk to Bonchamp to buy some; but the thought that the ribbon, after all, might be procured there, satisfied her.
