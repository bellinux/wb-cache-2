5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne, Fairley joined the Australian Army Medical Corps in 1915. He investigated an epidemic of meningitis that was occurring in Army camps in Australia. While with the 14th General Hospital in Cairo, he investigated schistosomiasis (then known as bilharzia) and developed tests and treatments for the <b>disease.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> inter-war period he became renowned as an expert on tropical medicine.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form {{of chemical}} pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 {{and in the}} United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E

5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and bluetongue of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock {{can be devastating}} both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK in 2001 showed.|$|E
5|$|In Argentina, {{the disease}} is known as mal de Chagas-Mazza, in honor of Salvador Mazza, the Argentine {{physician}} who in 1926 began investigating the disease {{and over the years}} became the principal researcher of this <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. Mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of Trypanosoma cruzi in Argentina in 1927, eventually leading to support from local and European medical schools and Argentine government policy makers.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age.

Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{there was an}} {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecognized cattle <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern United States and Canada. Cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures and on some occasions, spontaneously. For example, 21 out of 22 cows died after dehorning and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration.

5|$|The {{disease is}} {{believed}} to occur when there is susceptibility, {{or a lack of}} immune system resistance, to DPB-causing bacteria or viruses, caused by several genes that are found predominantly in individuals of East Asian descent. The highest incidence occurs among Japanese people, followed by Koreans. DPB occurs more often in males, and usually begins around age 40. It was recognized as a distinct new <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s, and was formally named diffuse panbronchiolitis in 1969.|$|E

5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|Ann Bishop (19 December 1899– 7 May 1990) was a British {{biologist}} from Girton College at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of the Royal Society, {{one of the}} few female Fellows of the Royal Society.

Her specialties were protozoology and parasitology; early work with ciliate parasites, including the one responsible for blackhead <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domesticated turkey, lay the groundwork for her later research. While working towards her doctorate, Bishop studied parasitic amoebae and examined potential chemotherapies for the treatment of amoebic diseases including amoebic dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune hemolytic anemia. They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.|$|E
