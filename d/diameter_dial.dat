50|$|The floral {{clock was}} {{the first of its kind}} in the state. It {{consists}} of an hour, minute and seconds hand that move on the 20 ft <b>diameter</b> <b>dial.</b> The machinery moving the clock is underground, giving the clock a natural look.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanical}} marvel {{was reviewed}} in several publications, next are included three of them: [...] Review 1: The largest pendulum in the Exhibition is the revolving one above the large clock made by Farcot. The pendulum m long is {{suspended from the}} roof m high of the building, performs six revolutions in a minute, and is made in conformity with Foucault’s method. The large gilt ball which serves for the bob, about 2 feet in diameter, must be subject to considerable disturbance from the wind, for being just opposite the main entrance {{it is in a}} very draughty position.Review 2: In the middle of the noble space under the entrance tower, stood the Monumental Clock, constructed by M. Eugène Farcot, inmense in size, elaborate in design, and almost equalling as a wonder, though falling very far short in elaboration, the celebrated Clock of Strasbourg. It was of about twenty-two and a half feet in height, with four faces, rich though chaste in ornamentation; and the motion was communicated by a pendulum more than one hundred feet in length, suspended from the centre of the dome above, with a terrestrial globe of some four feet in diameter at the end, oscillating in about ten seconds, and acting upon a needle, invisible, like all the other mechanism. The lower portion had elaborate bas-reliefs in bronze with caryatides of the seasons at the corners; and it was surrounded, at a distance marking the limits of the central pavilion, by a circle of statues virtually forming a guard of honor for the central mechanical curiosity of the exhibition.Review 3 (translated from French): In the middle of the Palais du Champ-de-Mars vestibule of honor, beneath the grand central dome, a monumental clock, work of the skilled mechanical-horologist Mr. Eugène Farcot, attracts keen admiration.This is a real monument, over 7 meters high, composed of a plinth ornamented with bas-reliefs representing the attributes of arts and industry, at each of whose four corners stand two-meter-high bronze caryatids supporting a pedimented turret. The clock sits in the center, with its four 1 meter 25 <b>diameter</b> <b>dial</b> faces.As a pendulum, a 1 m. 25 diameter metallic ball, weighing around 100 kilograms, representing the earth, with its continents and islands emerging in gilt relief against a blue sea background. This globe, encircled by a gilt ring bearing, also in relief, the signs of the zodiac, is suspended {{from the center of the}} dome, 2 meters above the clock, connected to its invisible movement by a needle. This pendulum rotates, under its own weight, around a simulated sun at the centre of the circle it describes, which extends approximately 15 meters. It accomplishes this progression in 10 seconds.The clock [...] "runs by itself"; the spontaneous undulations of this enormous pendulum obey natural laws too well known to require explanation; however some visitors seemed very intrigued and very curious to know where was the [...] "little beast" [...] that moves the entire device. — They were, of course, a tiny minority.|$|E
5000|$|The 17-foot-tall Indiana State Museum steam {{clock in}} Indianapolis, Indiana {{is located on}} the {{sidewalk}} {{on the north side of}} the museum near the canal. It has four 24" [...] <b>diameter</b> <b>dials</b> that are back-lit by neon. The clock’s eight brass whistles play a few notes of [...] "Back Home Again in Indiana" [...] every 15 minutes. A more complete rendition is played at the top of every hour.|$|R
50|$|The Centenary clock has {{one large}} dial in the centre (1.5 m <b>diameter).</b> This <b>dial</b> shows the exact time(UTC+1, during {{daylight}} saving time UTC+2 is used instead). The twelve dials around the centre dial show the following (starting from the dial in the 2 'o clock position and going clockwise): the equation of time, the zodiac, the solar cycle and the dominical letter, the week, the globe, the months, the calendar dates, the seasons, the tides, {{the age of the}} moon, the phases of the moon and the metonic cycle and the epact.|$|R
5000|$|The {{architect}} was E.M. Butz of Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh) {{who designed}} the building in the Queen Anne style and the supervising architect was D. English of Brockville. Henry Warner of Allegheny painted the frescos. The floor tiling was laid by the Star Encaustic Tile Company of Pittsburgh and the Howard Clock Company of New York supplied the 9-foot <b>diameter</b> clock <b>dial</b> and the 1313 pound bell. A galvanized iron sculpture called the [...] "Lady of Justice", standing 9 feet 11 inches tall {{on top of the}} clock tower, is of unknown origin.|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} is 145 m long, 30–50 m wide and 55 m tall {{from the earth}} level to the star on the clock tower. The tower is separated from the main building and features a clock of 5 m <b>diameter.</b> The clock's <b>dial</b> is encircled by the zodiac signs; their sequence is unusual, and Dushkin did not leave a clue to his arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{communities}} have made [...] "the largest sundial in" [...] claims. In 1913 the sundial in Ingleside Terraces, San Francisco was {{claimed to be}} the largest in the world, ignoring the existence of the dials at Jaipur. It had a <b>dial</b> <b>diameter</b> of 35 ft. There is even a larger one (78 ft) at Hunters Point in San Francisco. [...] The Carefree claim is disputed by Sun City, Arizona who have repaired their competing dial which is built from a 64 ftsteel I-bar.|$|R
40|$|Brass Surveying Compass with a 6 1 / 2 inch <b>diameter</b> silvered brass <b>dial</b> signed E. and G. W. Blunt of New York. There is a fleur-de-lis at {{the north}} point and the outer needle ring is {{engraved}} 0 - 90 in four quadrants. There is an engraved central pattern, blue steel hand and brass lifter, shaped limbs and a brass dial cover. This belonged to Samuel DeVeaux Woodruff who was a Civil Engineer. It also belonged to R. D. W. Band {{who was also a}} Civil Engineer. Also, One 13 cm. brass spindle taper for the surveying compass, n. ...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{boring tools}} have three primary {{components}} although many differing designs. The parts include the body, bar holder and dial screw (graduated micro screw). The body, made of solid stock, has two basic parts. The top part threads or presses into the supporting shank. The lower part (bar holder) is connected via dovetail, T-slots or a smooth notch with an adjustment for bore <b>diameter</b> via the <b>dial</b> screw. As the dial screw is adjusted, the cutting bit/s are moved further out, creating a larger cut. This also can create some slight distortion if {{the cutting tool}} is moved further than the boring head is designed to support, if there is undue wear in the bearings supporting the tool or if the tool speed is too great for the off-balance effect caused by moving the tool too far from center. This is called unbalanced gyroscope precession. Once the dial screw has been adjusted to give the proper cut a set screw is generally used to prevent any additional movement of the cutting head. The third basic part is the boring tool. Boring tools can be mounted vertically or horizontally in many boring head designs.|$|R
