The 1954 ERA leader finished 1955 with a 4.02ERA. The Indians finished in {{second place in the}} AL at 93–61, three <b>games</b> <b>behind</b> the Yankees.

Cleveland finished 88–66 and nine <b>games</b> <b>behind</b> first place, which went to the Yankees again. Lopez was replaced as manager by Kerby Farrell. In spring training before the 1957 season, Farrell observed that the league's best pitching staff could not carry the team alone.

5|$|Rebounding {{from their}} 2008 campaign, the 2009 Sounds {{achieved}} a 75–69 record under new manager Don Money. Despite {{a winning record}} and spending {{the majority of the}} season in first place, the Sounds finished the season two <b>games</b> <b>behind</b> their cross-state rivals, and eventual league champions, the Memphis Redbirds. The 2010 season proved to be reminiscent of the previous campaign. Though Nashville finished the year with a winning 77–67 record under Money, it was only good enough to place fourth (last) in the division.|$|E

The Yankees as a team, however, did poorly during {{the remainder of the}} season, and Toronto easily pulled away to win the division. Smith's New York career lasted just those eight games as he filed for free agency after the season. He signed with Baltimore for 1994 for $1.5 million plus incentives.|$|E

5|$|The intrastate rivalry was {{interrupted}} when Nashville {{moved to the}} American Association in 1985, but was renewed when the Sounds joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998. The Sounds and the Memphis Redbirds have been division rivals ever since. In 2009, Memphis clinched the American Conference Northern Division title, finishing the season just two games ahead of Nashville which spent {{the majority of the}} season in first place. Similarly, Nashville finished the 2014 season two-and-a-half <b>games</b> <b>behind</b> Memphis after having led the division for most of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Alston {{managed the}} St. Paul Saints, a Dodgers Class AAA affiliate, to an 86-68 win-loss record. The team {{finished}} in third place, 14 <b>games</b> <b>behind</b> an Indianapolis Indians team managed by Al López. That year, Alston managed Campanella again, where Campanella integrated the American Association. The media {{was critical of}} Alston for playing Campanella; {{they said that the}} catcher was simply there to integrate the league. Campanella hit 13 home runs in 35 games and fans were dismayed when he was called up to the Dodgers. The 1949 Saints finished with a 93-60 record and four of its players collected more than 90 runs batted in (RBI). The team finished in first place, half a game in front of Indianapolis. During the baseball off-season, Alston worked as a teacher in Darrtown.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{after leading}} the {{division}} {{standing by the}} end of April, the Mets again began to struggle. The Mets would not hold first place at any point after May 1, although they came close in mid-June. By {{the end of the season}} the Mets had finished 18 <b>games</b> <b>behind</b> the first place Phillies. For its part, Philadelphia was mainly engaged in a fierce division race with the Atlanta Braves, trailing them as late in the season as September 6. However, Philadelphia would surge at the end of the month and once again be crowned division champs. 2010 ultimately served as a disappointment for the Mets–Phillies rivalry.|$|E

Tim Dillard, who pitched for the Sounds from 2007 to 2014, set three career franchise records during his Sounds career: wins (39), innings pitched (556⅔), and runs allowed (302).|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1938, Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley {{named the}} 37-year-old Hartnett as the team's player-manager, {{replacing}} Charlie Grimm.

By September 27, with one week left in the season, the Cubs had battled back to within a game and a half game of the Pirates in the National League standings as the two teams met for a crucial three-game series. The Cubs won {{the first game of}} the series with a 2 to 1 victory by Cubs pitcher Dizzy Dean, cutting the Pirates' lead to a half game and setting the stage for one of baseball's most memorable moments.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, the Colts won 48 of 64 games, but still could not find much success in the postseason.

In 2003, they won their first two playoff <b>games</b> <b>behind</b> {{impressive}} offensive performances, and reached the AFC title game. There, they lost to the eventual champion New England Patriots 24–14, with Manning throwing four interceptions. In 2004, the Colts {{had one of the}} most spectacular offensive seasons in NFL history, scoring 522 points and gaining 6,582 yards, while Manning set NFL records for most touchdown passes and highest passer rating.
