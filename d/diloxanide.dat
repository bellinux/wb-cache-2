2500|$|Physicians have {{described}} the successful use {{of a variety of}} discontinued antiprotozoals in treatment of Blastocystis infection. [...] Emetine was reported as successful in cases in early 20th century with British soldiers who contracted Blastocystis infection while serving in Egypt. [...] In vitro testing showed emetine was more effective than metronidazole or furazolidone. Emetine is available in the United States through special arrangement with the Center for Disease Control. Clioquinol (Entero-vioform) was noted as successful in treatment of Blastocystis infection but removed from the market following an adverse event in Japan. Stovarsol and Narsenol, two arsenic-based antiprotozoals, were reported to be effective against the infection. Carbarsone was available as an anti-infective compound in the United States as late as 1991, and was suggested as a possible treatment. The reduction in the availability of antiprotozoal drugs has been noted as a complicating factor in treatment of other protozoal infections. [...] For example, in Australia, production of <b>diloxanide</b> furoate ended in 2003, paromomycin is available under special access provisions, and the availability of iodoquinol is limited.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diloxanide</b> furoate destroys trophozoites of E. Histolica and {{prevents}} ameobic cyst formation. The exact mechanism of <b>diloxanide</b> is unknown. <b>Diloxanide</b> is structurally related to chloramphenicol and may {{act in a}} similar fashion by blocking protein synthesis.|$|E
50|$|The prodrug, <b>diloxanide</b> furoate, is metabolized in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{to release the}} active drug, <b>diloxanide.</b>|$|E
50|$|Side effects include flatulence, itchiness, and hives. In general, {{the use of}} <b>diloxanide</b> is well tolerated {{with minimal}} toxicity. Although {{there is no clear}} risk of harm when used during pregnancy, <b>diloxanide</b> should be avoided in the first {{trimester}} if possible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diloxanide</b> furoate is not {{recommended}} in women who are breast feeding, and in children <2 years of age.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diloxanide</b> furoate {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, of {{the most}} {{important}} medication needed in a basic health system.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Diloxanide</b> furoate 500 mg {{three times}} a day for 10 days (or one of the other lumenal amebicides above) must always be given {{afterwards}} ...|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Furoyl {{chloride}} has {{no major}} applications {{but it has}} been used as a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals; examples include mometasone furoate, fluticasone furoate, <b>diloxanide</b> furoate, Ceftiofur (Excenel), and mirfentanil.|$|E
50|$|For {{people who}} are symptomatic, it is used after {{treatment}} with ambecides that can penetrate tissue, like metronidazole or tinidazole. <b>Diloxanide</b> is considered second-line, while paromomycin is considered first line for this use as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diloxanide</b> {{came into}} medical use in 1956. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is not commercially available in much of the developed world as of 2012.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diloxanide</b> {{generally}} has mild side effects. Side effects may include flatulence, vomiting, and itchiness. During pregnancy {{it is recommended}} that it be taken after the first trimester. It is a luminal amebicide meaning that it only works on infections within the intestines.|$|E
50|$|E. histolytica infections {{occur in}} both the {{intestine}} and (in people with symptoms) in tissue of the intestine and/or liver. As a result, both tissue and luminal drugs are needed to treat the infection, one for each location. Metronidazole is usually given first, followed by Paromomycin or <b>Diloxanide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Diloxanide</b> is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} amoeba infections. It is a second line treatment after paromomycin when no symptoms are present in places where infections are not common. For people who are symptomatic, it is used after treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Intestinal infection:Usually {{nitroimidazole}} derivatives {{are used}} {{because they are}} highly effective against the trophozoite form of the amoeba. Since they have little effect on amoeba cysts, usually this treatment is followed by an agent (such as paromomycin or <b>diloxanide</b> furoate) that acts on the organism in the lumen.|$|E
50|$|The {{drug was}} {{discovered}} by Boots UK in 1956 and introduced as Furamide; it was not available {{in much of the}} developed world as of 2012.

50|$|People without {{symptoms}}:For {{people without}} symptoms (otherwise known as carriers, with no symptoms), non endemic areas {{should be treated}} by paromomycin, and other treatments include <b>diloxanide</b> furoate and iodoquinol.There have been problems {{with the use of}} iodoquinol and iodochlorhydroxyquin, so their use is not recommended.Diloxanide furoate can also be used by mildly symptomatic persons who are just passing cysts.|$|E
50|$|Since {{most of the}} amoebae {{remain in}} the {{intestine}} when tissue invasion occurs, {{it is important to}} get rid of those also or the patient will be at risk of developing another case of invasive di effective of which {{has been shown to be}} paromomycin (also known as Humatin); iodoquinol (also known as Yodoxin) is used in the US; and <b>diloxanide</b> furoate (also known as Furamide) is used in certain other countries.|$|E
50|$|Prevention of {{amoebiasis}} is by improved sanitation, including separating {{food and}} water from faeces. There is no vaccine. There are two treatment options depending on {{the location of the}} infection. Amoebiasis in tissues is treated with either metronidazole, tinidazole, nitazoxanide, dehydroemetine or chloroquine, while luminal infection is treated with <b>diloxanide</b> furoate or iodoquinoline. For treatment to be effective against all stages of disease may require a combination of medications. Infections without symptoms do not require treatment but infected individuals can spread the parasite to others and treatment can be considered. Treatment of other Entamoeba infections apart from E. histolytica is not needed.|$|E
50|$|There is {{generally}} {{no need to}} treat for E. coli, due to the rarity of this parasite becoming infectious. In one exceptional situation, E. coli {{was found to be}} infectious: in northern Europe, stool samples and electron microscopy revealed large populations of the amoeba within a group of patients with persistent diarrhea. Some types of treatments may need to be used due to large populations. Some arsenical compounds are shown to treat the trophozoite stage, like carbarsone. Other compounds used to treat large populations of E. coli include <b>diloxanide</b> furoate, and this usually is used in antiamebic therapy.|$|E

40|$|Ratio {{subtraction}} and isosbestic point {{methods are}} two innovative spectrophotometric methods {{for determining the}} concentrations of metronidazole (I) and <b>diloxanide</b> furoate (II) in a mixture. Metronidazole was determined by direct spectrophotometric method at λmax 314. 0  nm {{in the presence of}} <b>diloxanide</b> furoate in the range of 4 – 24  μg ml− 1 with a mean recovery percentage of 99. 83  ±  1. 41. Two spectrophotometric methods were developed for the spectral resolution of <b>diloxanide</b> furoate when present in mixture with metronidazole without preliminary separation. The first method depends on measuring the absorbance at the isosbestic point at 277. 2  nm in the range of 5 – 30  μg ml− 1 with a mean recovery percentage of 99. 96  ±  1. 47 for <b>diloxanide</b> furoate. The second method is the ratio subtraction spectroscopic method for spectral isolation of <b>diloxanide</b> furoate present in the mixture which can be measured at 251. 2  nm in the range of 5 – 30  μg ml− 1 with a mean recovery percentage of 99. 73  ±  1. 33 for <b>diloxanide</b> furoate determination. The suggested procedures were validated using laboratory-prepared mixtures and were successfully applied for the analysis of pharmaceutical preparations.

40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{presented}} for simultaneous determination of <b>diloxanide</b> furoate and metronidazole. The first method depends on first derivative of the ratio-spectra by {{measurements of the}} amplitudes at 242. 5 and 285. 5 nm for <b>diloxanide</b> furoate and 225. 5 and 300 nm for metrinidazole. Calibration graphs were established for 2 - 100 µg mL&# 713; 1 for <b>diloxanide</b> furoate and 1 - 50 µg mL&# 713; 1 for metronidazole. In the second method (HPLC), a reversed-phase column with a mobile phase of ethylacetate:chloroform:dioxin:methanol (8 : 7 : 2 : 3 (v/v/v/v)) at 0. 9 mL min&# 713; 1 flow rate was used to separate both compounds with detection at 250 - 345 nm. Linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 0. 025 - 50 µg mL&# 713; 1 for <b>diloxanide</b> furoate and 0. 15 - 50 µg mL&# 713; 1 for metronidazole. All of the proposed methods have been extensively validated. These methods allow a number of cost and time saving benefits. The described methods can be readily utilized for analysis of pharmaceutical formulations.

40|$|Dientamoeba fragilis is a {{commonly}} encountered trichomonad {{which has been}} implicated {{as a cause of}} gastrointestinal disease in humans. Despite the frequency of reports recording infections with this parasite, little research has been undertaken in terms of antimicrobial susceptibility. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the susceptibility of D. fragilis to several commonly used antiparasitic agents: <b>diloxanide</b> furoate, furazolidone, iodoquinol, metronidazole, nitazoxanide, ornidazole, paromomycin, secnidazole, ronidazole, tetracycline, and tinidazole. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed on four clinical strains of D. fragilis, designated A, E, M, and V, respectively. Molecular testing followed, and all strains were determined to be genotype 1. The activities of antiprotozoal compounds at concentrations ranging from 2 μg/ml to 500 μg/ml were determined via cell counts of D. fragilis trophozoites grown in dixenic culture. Minimum lethal concentrations (MLCs) were as follows: ornidazole, 8 to 16 μg/ml; ronidazole, 8 to 16 μg/ml; tinidazole, 31 μg/ml; metronidazole, 31 μg/ml; secnidazole, 31 to 63 μg/ml; nitazoxanide, 63 μg/ml; tetracycline, 250 μg/ml; furazolidone, 250 to 500 μg/ml; iodoquinol, 500 μg/ml; paromomycin, 500 μg/ml; and <b>diloxanide</b> furoate, > 500 μg/ml.

40|$|SummaryCervical {{amoebiasis}} is {{an extremely}} rare diagnosis with {{only a small number}} of published case reports. This disease may present as cervical growth mimicking cervical carcinoma. Owing to the similarity of the clinical presentation of bleeding per vagina and per speculum examination showing growth or ulcers, definitive diagnosis is made on microscopic examination only. We present a rare case of cervical amoebiasis in a 28 -year-old, multiparous female who presented with a history of vaginal bleeding. The patient was treated with metronidazole and <b>diloxanide</b> furate, after which she recovered. Awareness of this rare entity is important for clinical suspicion and for the pathologist to identify trophozoites and make a diagnosis, preventing unwarranted investigations. Accurate diagnosis also facilitates quick management of a patient; as this disease is an infective pathology that can easily be treated by antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Beta–thalassemia minor is a symptomless carrier {{state of}} a hemoglobinopathy which predisposes to {{bacterial}} infections. We report three cases presenting with giardiasis, a parasitic infection of gastrointestinal tract caused by Giardia lamblia.

40|$|Compounds {{structurally}} {{related to}} known amoebicidal dichloroacetamides were examined for activity against Entamoeba histolytica by an in vivo/in vitro method and an experimental caecal infection in weanling rats. Dichloro-N- 2 -hydroxyethyl-N-p-methylsulphonylbenzylacetamide (M&B 4321) {{was the first}} compound of this series to show high amoebicidal activity against experimental E. histolytica infections in young rats. Some subsequent compounds, particularly several closely related to M&B 4321, had a similar effect. Comparative experiments on both activity and toxicity were carried out on M&B 4321 and <b>diloxanide,</b> since the latter compound had already been administered safely to man and had shown good activity against non-dysenteric amoebiasis. The two compounds {{were found to be}} generally similar in properties. Other compounds which were of the same order of activity were discovered later, but as none had much more activity than M&B 4321 they were not studied in detail.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} work was to develop cyst-targeted alginates microspheres of <b>diloxanide</b> furoate (DF) for the effective treatment of amoebiasis. Calcium alginates microspheres of DF were prepared using emulsification method using calcium chloride as a cross-linking agent. Alginate is a natural polysaccharide found in brown algae. Alginates are widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries and have been employed as a matrix for the entrapment of drugs, macromolecules and biological cells. Alginate microspheres produced by the emulsification method using calcium chloride. Formulations were characterized for particle size and shape, surface morphology, entrapment efficiency, and in vitro drug release in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. XRD and differential scanning calorimetery were used to confirm successful entrapment of DF into the alginates microspheres. All the microsphere formulations showed good &#x 0025; drug entrapment (73. 82 &# 897; 1. 99).

40|$|Previously a cloned emetine-resistant mutant of the protozoal {{parasite}} Entamoeba histolytica {{was shown}} to overexpress a gene for an ameba homolog of the mammalian P-glycoprotein, a plasma membrane pump that removes hydrophobic drugs from multidrug-resistant tumor cells. Three sets of experiments were performed to better characterize the multidrug-resistant phenotype of the emetine-resistant amebae. First, the emetine resistance of the mutant amebae was reversed by concentrations of calcium and sodium channel blockers effective in reversing drug resistance by multidrug-resistant tumor cells, but it was reversed only {{in the presence of}} very high concentrations of the tricyclic antidepressants. Second, the mutant amebae showed cross-resistance to antiamebic drugs used to treat luminal infection (iodoquinol and <b>diloxanide)</b> but were not cross-resistant to drugs used to treat invasive disease (chloroquine and metronidazole). Third, when amebae were loaded with radiolabeled emetine, the mutant parasites released the drug at approximately 1. 6 times the rate of the wild-type organisms.
