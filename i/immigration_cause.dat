Dowling described the challenge for Catholics in the post-World War I era as follows: The old order passeth, giving place to the new. Immigration has all but ceased, and when revived—if it is ever permitted to revive—it is not likely to attain the proportions of the former days. …Language, customs, memories, pass with a generation. So far, the Church in this country has been singularly sustained by the momentum of spiritual agencies that were derived from other lands and other times. In the new day there will be no such powerful auxiliary to supplement our own normal activity. It will be the American Catholic Church or it will be nothing. Archbishop Austin Dowling ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Each year, {{approximately}} 1, 500 Chinese youth migrate {{alone and}} clandestinely to the U. S. While most intend to advance {{themselves and their}} families socially and economically, not all are immediately successful: a number are apprehended and placed in removal proceedings. Here, <b>immigration</b> <b>cause</b> lawyers are tasked with presenting clients who might otherwise be termed "economic migrants" as uniquely vulnerable and deserving of legal status. Drawing on nearly three years of ethnographic research, this dissertation details the goals and responsibilities youth manage through multiple transitions of legality, labor and age alongside attorneys' negotiations of personal motivation and professional constraints. The "cause" that emerges, namely advocacy on behalf of unaccompanied Chinese youth, proves far-reaching and obligatory in largely unconsidered, and I believe unintended, ways. I argue that the lawyers in this study maintain their subjective jurisdiction (Abbott 1988) of this "cause" by constructing Chinese youth as uniquely vulnerable [...] and their parents as uniquely culpable [...] through normative narratives of age and morality alongside Orientalist economics and the "spectacular case. " Cause lawyers further establish their responsibility and, in a sense, worthiness to "treat" this population of migrants through a rhetoric of care [...] i. e. by ambiguously conflating "welfare and safety" with legal status, best interest with rights, and guardianship with legal representation. At the same time, however, the actions, expectations and very presence of Chinese clients unsettle these understandings of care. As I evidence, unaccompanied youth challenge presumptions of passivity or dependency by being "overtly agentful" (Coe, et. al 2008) in their management of migration journeys and legal needs. By attending to the legal strategies of attorneys and youth, this dissertation illuminates the limiting choices attorneys make on behalf of a "cause. " In so doing, it also points to the limited choices available to <b>immigration</b> <b>cause</b> lawyers, and thus to broader contradictions in the institutional practices, rights frameworks and political ideologies that govern the management and care of unaccompanied young migrants...|$|E
40|$|Does <b>immigration</b> <b>cause</b> crime? To {{answer this}} question, we build a two-country general {{equilibrium}} model with search costs in which the migration (in/out-) ‡ows, the crime rates and the equilibrium wages {{in the two countries}} are determined by the interaction between the labor market, the crime market and the decision to migrate. The main result of our model is that, in equilibrium, the relationship between immigration and crime depends on the conditions of both the labor and crime markets of the two countries. In particular, when the tightness of the labor market is su ¢ ciently elastic relative to that of the crime market, immigration causes a reduction in the domestic crime rate of the host country. An implication of this result is that migration ‡ows from countries with strong work rigidities to societies characterized by more elastic labor markets are mutually bene…c in terms of reducing the corresponding crime rates...|$|E

This led us to use of cross-cultural instruments in western country in a large measure. METHOD: Translation of Antonovsky`s “Sense Of Coherence” into Persian and back translation into English. We used WHO recommendation for the translation of research instruments “process of translation and adoption of instruments”. We tried to prevent translation errors, in the translation process. Forward translation should be adapted the instruments in a culturally relevant and comprehensible form. RESULTS: We found the high mean scores of SOC among the research group. But females had lower scores {{in comparison with the}} males. The SOC score was equal with the result from the other research in the western countries. CONCLUSION: Persian version is linguistic equivalent with English version. Persian version can use in research among multilingual Iranian people in western countries...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of recent years unusually large influx of immigrants to Sweden from outside of the European Union, the debate regarding the impact of immigration {{on the economy and}} the labor market has intensified. Some politicians and debaters raise concerns about the fiscal impacts of immigration, while others argue that <b>immigration</b> <b>cause</b> wage and employment drops for native workers. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the impact of immigration from outside of the European Union on municipal wages and unemployment rate. The study has been conducted by regressing the percentage of immigrants from outside of the European Union on average yearly municipal income and municipal unemployment rate in order to evaluate the impact of migration from outside of the European Union on the two dependent variables. This study shows that immigration from outside of the European Union has a significant negative effect on average yearly municipal income and a non-instantaneous positive effect on the municipal unemployment rate for total, male and female population.

40|$|Abstract During {{the last}} five years there has been a {{considerable}} immigration from the Netherlands to Värmland in Sweden. INVA, Invest in Värmland, wanted to highlight this phenomenon and therefore contacted Karlstad University to make a survey about how extensive the immigration is and what consequences it brings for the business life and municipalities in Värmland. We were luckily chosen to perform this research and the main focus in this study has been the following questions: • Why do the Dutchmen choose to buy their house in Värmland? • What are the main reasons for leaving the Netherlands? • What consequences does the <b>immigration</b> <b>cause</b> for the business life in Värmland? • How do the Dutchmen experience the contact with Swedish authorities? To answer the questions we designed a questionnaire that was sent to 200 Dutch house purchasers. The ambition was to survey all the Dutch house purchasers in Värmland, but with the time constrains and the municipalities having problem to find complete data, we limited the survey to 200 households. To sample more information eleven interviews were made with Dutch families, brokers and local authorities. The most important factor behind the Dutchmen moving to Värmland is the nature and the calmness. Other factors that were mentioned in the survey are the mentality {{of the people who live}} in Värmland, a good place to raise your children and house prices. The main reasons for leaving the Netherlands are lack of space, social aspects, work and economic motives. The first big investment that is done by the Dutchmen is buying a house, the consequences of this act is higher house prices. The consuming of items on the local market is another indirect investment that is positive for the local businessmen. 60 % of the Dutchmen that moves to Värmland for permanent living starts their own business or bring their company from the Netherlands. One of the most common problems when buying the house was the poor language skills among the local brokers. Some of the respondent requested the brokers to speak Dutch and some required that the brokers should speak better English. In the future this problem might disappear because during the last year there are some Dutchmen who has started to work together with the local brokers. The contact with Swedish authorities was considered positive in general but some of the Dutchmen had problems to get a social security number and some had problems finding information about the Swedish tax system...|$|E

Results of the ARDL bounds test are supportive of the theory that the variables are in a long-run equilibrium level relationship. On the other hand, results of the Granger-causality tests support the existence of a long-run, bidirectional causality between immigration and GDP per capita.

40|$|Many {{workers with}} {{low levels of}} {{educational}} attainment immigrated to the United States in recent decades. Large inflows of less-educated immigrants would reduce wages paid to comparably-educated native-born workers if the two groups compete for similar jobs. In a simple model exploiting comparative advantage, however, we show that if less-educated foreign and native-born workers specialize in performing complementary tasks, <b>immigration</b> will <b>cause</b> natives to reallocate their task supply, thereby reducing downward wage pressure. Using individual data on the task intensity of occupations across US states from 1960 - 2000, we then demonstrate that foreign-born workers specialize in occupations that require manual tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and building. <b>Immigration</b> <b>causes</b> natives [...] who {{have a better understanding of}} local networks, rules, customs, and language [...] to pursue jobs requiring interactive tasks such as coordinating, organizing, and communicating. Simulations show that this increased specialization mitigated negative wage consequences of immigration for less-educated native-born workers, especially in states with large immigration flows. ...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} some new {{evidence}} {{on the impact of}} immigration on crime, using data from England and Wales. Ascertaining the magnitude and direction of an impact of immigration on crime is a high profile public policy question, but it is one on which we currently have {{only a limited number of}} robust findings. This is important since many media commentators and responses in public opinion polls postulate that <b>immigration</b> <b>causes</b> crime. Nevertheless, and standing contrary to this populist view, the (still relatively small) literature that does exist finds it hard to detect an average impact of immigration on crime. For example, Bianchi et al. (2012) study crime and immigration across Italian areas, finding no significant empirical connection. Bell et al. (2013) conclude the same studying two large immigration waves in the UK.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2016, 61.2% of Swedes {{belonged to}} the Church of Sweden; this number has been {{decreasing}} by about 1.5 percentage points {{a year for the}} last 5 years and one percentage point a year on average for the last two decades. Approximately 2% of the church's members regularly attend Sunday services. The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that, until 1996, children automatically became members at birth if {{at least one of the}} parents was a member. Since 1996, only children that are christened become members. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various Evangelical Protestant free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and <b>immigration</b> <b>caused</b> that there are now some 92,000 Roman Catholics and 100,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians living in Sweden.|$|R

Baltic Old Prussian probably ceased to be spoken around the beginning of the 18th century due to many of its remaining speakers dying in the famines and bubonic plague epidemics which harrowed the East Prussian countryside and towns from 1709 until 1711. The regional dialect of Low German spoken in Prussia (or East Prussia), called Low Prussian, preserved a number of Baltic Prussian words, such as kurp, from the Old Prussian kurpi, for shoe in contrast to common Low German Schoh (standard German Schuh).|$|R
