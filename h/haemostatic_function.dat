40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has a multifactorial {{aetiology}} {{and many}} potential risk markers are known. As {{it was not}} feasible to discuss all markers and their possible interactions in relation to all aspects of CVD, selections {{had to be made}} in this paper. In the context of claims and functional foods, emphasis was placed on those aetiological processes and risk markers that have been shown previously to be modified by diet: lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function,</b> oxidative damage, homocysteine metabolism, and blood pressure. Except for methodological and biological characteristics of these biomarkers, their relationships with the risk of CVD are discussed. For LDL and HDL cholesterol, fasting triacylglycerol, homocysteine, and blood pressure well-validated, easy applicable, and generally accepted biomarkers exist. For <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> and oxidative damage validation of markers with respect to CVD or intermediate clinical markers is recommended. For diet-related CVD, however, the ultimate question is whether changes in the biomarker are truly related to changes in risk. Only for LDL cholesterol and blood pressure does consensus exist among scientists for a possible application as enhanced function claims. For HDL, triacylglycerol, and homocysteine, and in particular for <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> and oxidative damage, however, formal proof is lacking that diet-induced changes in these biomarkers alter the risk of CVD. At the same time, it should be emphasised that CVD is multifactorial. Therefore it does not seem justified that a change in one particular biomarker is enough evidence to substantiate a claim. There are examples of food components or drugs that one biomarker is changed in a favourable way, {{but at the same time}} another biomarker is changed in an unfavourable way.

40|$|Background and Objectives Patients with anaphylactic {{transfusion}} reactions require washed {{platelet concentrates}} (PCs) for subsequent platelet (PLT) transfusions. New PLT additive solutions (PASs) contain substances {{that might be}} beneficial {{for the preservation of}} PLT function during storage. This study compares the quality of PLTs washed and stored with T-Sol, Composol or SSP+. Study Design and Methods Fifteen buffy coats were pooled and divided into three parts. PCs with 30 % plasma and 70 % PAS (T-Sol, Composol or SSP+) were prepared. Washing was performed on day 5 of storage. Ten PCs were prepared and washed with each PAS. In vitro variables including <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> (clotting time and clot retraction) were analysed on day 5 before, directly after and up to 2 days after washing. Results Swirling was well preserved, and pH was within acceptable limits (6 · 4 - 7 · 4) during storage for all PASs. The PLT number was reduced by washing for all PASs, and T-Sol PCs had a further decrease during storage. PLTs in T-Sol were spontaneously more activated and had lower capacity to respond to an agonist than Composol or SSP+ PLTs. The <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> was only slightly changed by washing and during postwashing storage. Conclusion PLTs washed with T-Sol, Composol or SSP+ had good in vitro quality for two days after washing despite absence of glucose. PLTs in T-Sol were more affected by the washing procedure and subsequent storage than Composol or SSP+ PLTs as judged by higher spontaneous activation. © 2011 The Author(s).

40|$|COAGULATION factor V is a {{critical}} cofactor for the activation of prothrombin to thrombin, the penultimate step in the generation of a fibrin blood clot(1, 2). Genetic deficiency of factor V results in a congenital bleeding disorder (parahaemophilia) (3), whereas inheritance of a mutation rendering factor V resistant to inactivation is an important risk factor for thrombosis(4, 5). We report here that approximately half of homozygous embryos deficient in factor V (F upsilon(-/-)), which have been generated by gene targeting, die at embryonic day (E) 9 - 10, possibly {{as a result of}} an abnormality in the yolk-sac vasculature. The remaining F upsilon(-/-) mice progress normally to term, but die from massive haemorrhage within 2 hours or birth. Considered together with the milder phenotypes generally associated with deficiencies of other clotting factors(6, 7), our findings demonstrate the primary role of the common coagulation pathway and the absolute requirement for functional factor V for prothrombinase activity. They also provide direct evidence for the existence of other critical <b>haemostatic</b> <b>functions</b> for thrombin in addition to fibrin clot formation, and identify a previously unrecognized role for the coagulation system in early mammalian development...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequencing}} {{of hundreds of}} thousands of human exomes and hundreds of thousands of whole genomes is providing a progressively accurate and complete catalogue of human genetic variation. The initial studies to use genome wide data to help understand platelet disorders performed genome wide association studies to identify loci linked to variations in blood cell parameters. These studies used normal variation to find corresponding genetic variation. We next wished to investigate the genetic basis of bleeding disorders which may also provide a key to novel genes regulating platelet and <b>haemostatic</b> <b>functions.</b> The BRIDGE consortium (www. bridgestudy. org) is funded by the NIHR and brings together 13 rare disease gene discovery projects. The aim of these projects is to investigate as yet undiagnosed rare inherited diseases and identify the underlying mutational basis. We have used a cluster analysis based on the Human Phenotype Ontology in combination with next generation sequencing techniques to help identify patients with similar phenotypes which we hypothesise will arise from defects in the same gene.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{a patient with}} von Willebrand's disease (vWd) whose von Willebrand factor (vWf) {{multimer}} patterns showed significant decreases of all but the major fast moving vWf multimer (promoter). Bleeding time (BT) was very prolonged, {{there was almost no}} ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) and vWf levels were very low. The factor VIII: C/vWf: Ag ratio appeared to be higher than normal because of the relatively increased concentration of factor VIII: C. The infusion of DDAVP normalized BT, improved RIPA and restored normal factor VIII: C levels, these effects lasted for 5 h even though only a slight increase of vWf: Ag and vWf: RCoF was observed. RIPA was completely inhibited by an anti-glycoprotein (GP) Ib monoclonal antibody that recognizes the ristocetin-induced vWf binding site. Plasma vWf multimer analysis revealed only slight increases of all components and an additional, more pronounced representation of vWf protomer. These data suggest that the patient has an abnormal vWf molecule characterized by a greater ability to carry factor VIII than would be expected from the vWf levels. Furthermore, since the vWf protomer was the only significant vWf component present both before and after DDAVP infusion we hypothesize that some of the <b>haemostatic</b> <b>functions</b> of the patient's vWf may depend on it...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A {{state of}} hypercoagulation and fibrinolytic {{dysfunction}} {{is present in}} individuals with diabetes, which may contribute to disturbed skin microcirculation and impaired ulcer heating. We have previously reported an improved outcome of chronic diabetic foot ulcers during treatment with dalteparin. In the present study we investigated the effects of dalteparin on skin microcirculation and <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function.</b> Materials and methods: 87 patients with diabetes, peripheral arterial obliterative disease and chronic foot ulcers were investigated in a prospective, randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled study. They were randomised to treatment with subcutaneous injections of 5000 U dalteparin (n = 44) or placebo (n = 43), once daily until ulcer heating or for a maximum of six months. Plasma fibrinogen, fibrin get structure [permeability coefficient (Ks) and fiber mass/length ratio (mu) ], prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2) antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) activity and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen were analysed before randomization (baseline value), {{and at the end}} of the treatment period. The skin microcirculation of the foot was investigated by transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO 2) and laser Doppler ftuxmetry (LDF). Results: The changes (A-values) of Ks, mu, tPA and TcPO 2 were higher (p< 0. 05) during treatment with dalteparin, as compared to the changes during treatment with placebo. At baseline, plasma fibrinogen and Ks were significantly correlated to TcPO 2. Conclusions: Local skin oxygenation improved and a less thrombogenic fibrin get structure was formed in patients treated with dalteparin. Beneficial effects on <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> are likely to contribute to the improved skin oxygenation observed during treatment with dalteparin. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} {{the costs and}} effectiveness of an anticoagulant nurse specialist service compared with a conventional consultant service based on two hospital sites in northwest Hertfordshire. METHODS: Sequential design comparing retrospectively the conduct and outcomes of a consultant service with a nurse specialist service over two six month periods. In {{each of the six}} month study periods, all new patients consecutively referred for anticoagulation over a three month period (group A) at the start of each study period and a random selection of patients who had already been attending the anticoagulant service for one year or more (group B) were included in the study. Group A patients wre followed for up to three months and group B patients for six months. The main outcome measures were costs of service provision and effectiveness. Costs included those {{for the use of the}} anticoagulant service, those related to general practitioner (GP) visits and hospitalisations, and running costs (staff time, laboratory tests, patient transport). Measures of effectiveness were the mean proportion of time patients spend in the therapeutic range, the number of drugs being taken that could interact adversely and/or inhibit <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function,</b> and patient and GP satisfaction with service provision. RESULTS: In the consultant service, for group A there were more patients aged 66 - 75 years (p = 0. 004) and fewer patients aged more than 76 years (p = 0. 001); and for group B, there were fewer patients on anticoagulation for cardiac conditions (p = 0. 001), but more on anticoagulation for thromboembolic conditions (p = 0. 02) than in the nurse specialist service. The clinic running costs of the nurse specialist service were 4. 99 Pounds per attendance, compared with 4. 75 Pounds in the consultant service. Including all other costs related to treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in cost per patient. There was no significant difference in the proportion of time patients spent in the therapeutic range between the consultant service and the nurse specialist service. In the nurse specialist service, fewer patients in group A were taking drugs that could interact adversely and/or inhibit <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> (p = 0. 01) and more patients were satisfied with service provision (p = 0. 04) compared with the consultant service. There was no significant variation in GP satisfaction between the two services. CONCLUSION: In the provision of outpatient anticoagulation, the nurse specialist service was no more expensive than the consultant service and, using our primary outcome, at least as effective. The nurse specialist service has some clear advantages compared to the consultant service: provision of domicilliary care for housebound patients, fewer new patients taking drugs that could interact adversely and/or inhibit <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> patients, it is preferred by newly referred patients to the consultant service, and it is as acceptable to their GPs...|$|E

40|$|The binding {{between the}} 45 kDa N-terminal {{domain of the}} a subunit of the GPIb-IX-V complex (GPIbαN) on the {{platelet}} membrane and the A 1 domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF-A 1), a multimeric protein circulating in the plasma, {{plays a key role}} in platelet adhesion and thrombus initiation at sites of cut-injury and atherosclerotic plaque rupture where blood vessels are subjected to high haemodynamic shear. A fundamental yet unresolved issue is how haemodynamic force upregulates this interaction (binding kinetics) and how a mechanical stimulus is translated into a biochemical signal (mechanotransduction). In order to address above issues, we setup a new biomembrane force probe (BFP) with the drifting reduction, temperature control and concurrent fluorescence imaging. My research findings are summarized into three aims: 1. VWF regions surrounding A 1 hinder A 1 -GPIbα interaction at zero force, which is relieved by increasing force that stabilizes the interaction, giving rise to a VWF-GPIbα catch bond. 2. Three transport-related physical factors: receptor-ligand separation distance, Brownian motion and diffusivity govern the VWF-GPIbα association. 3. Mechanical force and structural variation regulate platelet signaling via the engagement duration of GPIbα mechanosensor. My thesis study advances our understanding of the biophysical and structural basis of how the VWF activation, its interaction with GPIbα and signal transduction are regulated by force when platelets' <b>haemostatic</b> <b>functions</b> are most needed.

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{contribution}} of platelet-dependent thrombin formation in haemostasis and thrombosis, we investigated under flow conditions the <b>haemostatic</b> <b>functions</b> of platelets from a patient with Scott syndrome. Scott platelets are characterised by a diminished platelet-dependent thrombin generation. Thrombin generation was determined by calibrated automated thrombography and flow-based experiments were performed to reveal collagen-mediated platelet activation and fibrin deposition. Our studies indicate that adherent Scott platelets do not differ from control platelets {{in the formation of}} stable platelet aggregates under static and flow conditions. While for adherent control platelets a shape change, e. g. balloon formation, and externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) is associated with an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, {{this is not the case}} for Scott platelets. The calcium-induced morphological changes in control platelets are accompanied with a diminished recruitment of free flowing platelets. Scott platelets, not showing a calcium-induced shape change, also lost the ability to recruit free flowing platelets. These findings rebut the hypothesis that the mild bleeding tendency of Scott syndrome patients is due to a preserved adhesive activity of patient’s platelets. Perfusion of tissue factor (TF) -activated control blood over immobilised collagen results in the formation of fibrin fibers that radiate from platelet aggregates. Although platelet aggregates were also observed after perfusion with TF-activated Scott blood, fibrin deposition was not observed. In conclusion, our findings indicate that platelet adhesion and spreading on a collagen matrix in the absence of fibrin formation is sufficient to sustain haemostasis under non-traumatic conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the genetic profile of centenarians aims to {{identify}} the genes and allelic variants which may influence a greater life expectancy {{and that can be}} considered as predisposing factors associated to the aging diseases, such as Alzheimer. Centenarians, that represent a cohort of selected survivors, show an hypercoagulability state characterised by striking signs of high coagulation enzyme activity, as directly assessed by the tested higher plasma level of some important factors involved in the haemostasis balance. Anyway, these individuals seem to have a reduced susceptibility to dementia, as well as to cardiovascular events. In this study we analyze the frequencies of Leiden Factor V polymorphism (G 1691 A), and G 20210 A of prothrombin (FII) in three cohorts of subjects: patients with Alzheimer’s disease (unsuccessful aging), nonagenarians (successful aging) and young healthy controls, to assess whether allelic variants associated to the modification of <b>haemostatic</b> system <b>function,</b> {{may play a role in}} the protection or susceptibility to Alzheimer disease, as well as to reach a successful aging. No significant differences were observed in the frequencies of the three groups studied. These results indicate that the presence or absence of the gene variants examined did not influence the achievement of advanced age and are not risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease. The state of hypercoagulability and the possession of these risk alleles appear to be compatible with the achievement of longevity and are not implied as risk factors in Alzheimer disease development...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{number of}} {{patients}} undergoing shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) in the UK for solitary uni-lateral kidney stones is increasing annually.

40|$|Interest has {{increased}} considerably {{in the past}} few years in the possible interactions amongst insulin, plasma lipoproteins and several components of the haemostatic system. There is now consistent epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence that hypertriglyceridaemia, in particular, may represent a procoagulant state involving derangements of both blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. Imbalance in the haemostatic system secondary to increased clotting activity, impaired fibrinolytic function, or a combination thereof, should influence the growth and final size of evolving thrombi and predispose to arterial occlusion. This might be of particular significance in the coronary circulation, where a hypercoagulable state is likely to promote thrombosis at the site of a suddenly ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, there is accumulating experimental evidence that the haemostatic system plays a part in plaque formation and plaque growth. Basic research on the link between haemostasis and atherosclerosis should be given high priority, because modulation of <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> will probably be a potent complementary approach to the prevention of coronary heart disease...|$|E

30|$|Sepsis and {{septic shock}} affect over 26 million people {{worldwide}} and remain the {{leading causes of}} death in the US hospitals, despite progress in early recognition and treatment [1]. Acidosis is a frequently identified acid–base disorder in patients with sepsis and is linked to different pathophysiological routes (type II respiratory failure, renal failure, lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis). Chloride (Cl−) is the body’s major anion, representing two-thirds of all negative charges in plasma and is also responsible for one-third of plasma tonicity [2]. Its role and significance in acid–base balance, osmosis, muscular activity and immunomodulation has been overshadowed by other serum electrolytes, even though chloride abnormalities have been detected in 25 % of patients in the critical care setting [3]. Aggressive fluid resuscitation, with chloride-rich crystalloids, during the treatment of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, may lead to iatrogenic hyperchloraemic acidosis [4]. The present review focuses on the effects of hyperchloraemia in septic patients (metabolic acidosis, haemodynamics, inflammatory response, renal and gastrointestinal <b>function,</b> <b>haemostatic</b> disorders, mortality) and their underlying pathophysiology.|$|R
30|$|Platelets {{represent}} {{an essential element}} of primary haemostasis [40]. Besides, thrombocytopenia has been described to be a reliable predictor for the outcome of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [41]. In line with the literature, septic patients within the presented investigation revealed significantly decreased platelet counts in comparison with healthy volunteers, whereas septic patients suffering from overt DIC revealed the lowest platelet counts [5, 42 – 45]. Besides decreased platelet counts, we were able to provide evidence for impaired platelet function in sepsis as compared to both control groups. Sepsis-associated changes in arachidonic acid metabolism might serve as an explanation for the observed impairments of platelet function in septic patients. Therefore, further examinations via an LC–MS-based approach for the determination of 11 d-TX B 2 (a stable and inactive metabolite of TXA 2) and PG F 1 α (a stable and inactive metabolite of PGI 2) were performed. TXA 2 and PGI 2 are supposed to be of importance in vascular haemostasis as well as homoeostasis due to their opposing effects on vasoactivity and platelet aggregation [46 – 48]. On the one hand, PGI 2 is known to be a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and acts as a vasodilator. On the other, TXA 2 induces platelet aggregation and acts as a potent vasoconstrictor. Since these two eicosanoids (both representing COX-dependent metabolites of arachidonic acid) are quite unstable, their inactive and stable hydrolysis products 11 d-TX B 2 and PG F 1 α need to be determined as indirect surrogates for the TXA 2 and PGI 2 loads in different inflammatory settings [47, 49 – 51]. In summary, the present investigation revealed a strong upregulation of the anti-aggregatory PG F 1 α (as a surrogate for PGI 2), whereas the proaggregatory 11 d-TX B 2 (as a surrogate for TXA 2) was shown to be downregulated at sepsis onset, resulting in strongly impaired <b>haemostatic</b> platelet <b>function.</b> Therefore, Yaguchi et al. already hypothesized that sepsis seems to induce a redirection of platelet function from haemostasis towards other non-haemostatic functions [45, 52].|$|R
40|$|Introduction. In liver diseases, all {{components}} of the haemostatic system are changed {{and the degree of}} dysfunction is proportional to hepatocellular damage. During the liver transplantation, values of haemostatic parameters show substantial changes, while postoperatively there is a gradual normalisation of the <b>haemostatic</b> system <b>function.</b> Objective The aim was to monitor the changes of the haemostatic system intraoperatively and postoperatively, including the dynamics at which physiological values of parameters are reached after transplantation. Methods. There were 17 cadaveric transplantations performed at the Clinical Centre of Vojvodina in the period from June 2008 to February 2012. The following parameters were tested: platelets, activated partial thromboplastin, prothrombin and thrombin time, fibrinogen, euglobulin clot lysis time, D-dimer, antithrombin and heparinemia. The results were presented intraoperatively in phases of transplantation, and postoperatively from day 1 to day 7, ending with postoperative day 14. Results. During transplantation, the most pronounced disorders among those observed are: thrombocytopenia (96 ± 66. 1 × 109 /L), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin (1. 80 ± 0. 8 R), prothrombin (1. 59 ± 0. 4 R) and thrombin time (2. 03 ± 1. 7 R), hypofibrinogenemia (2. 13 ± 0. 5 g/L), hyperfibrinolysis (29 ± 12. 0 min), increase of D-dimer (1393 ± 1220. 4 ng/mL) and decrease of antithrombin (61 ± 18. 0 %). Further monitoring after transplantation from postoperative day 1 revealed a gradual normalisation in the values, reaching physiological values for all parameters on postoperative day 14, except for the sustained high value of D-dimer (2606 ± 1055. 1 ng/mL). Heparinemia was within the prophylactic range (0. 26 ± 0 IU/mL). Conclusion. Thorough monitoring of the haemostatic system parameters in liver transplantations is of great importance, as it enables the use of optimal substitution therapy during and after transplantation, as well as an adequate postoperative thromboprophylaxis. Our study has shown normalisation of investigated laboratory parameters within 7 - 14 days after transplantation...|$|R

Two investigators independently selected studies, and abstracted data in duplicate. We identified 1, 046 studies of which we included 30 studies (25 longitudinal and 5 cross-sectional studies). All studies reported on haemostatic variables during menstrual cycle. Overall, {{most of the studies}} found no cyclic variation in VWF, FVIII, FXI, FXIII, fibrinolytic factors (PAI, t-PA, uPA, D-dimer and alpha(2) -antiplasmin) and fibrinogen. However, in studies where these variables showed any variation, they reached the lowest levels during menstrual and early follicular phase, especially for VWF, FVIII and platelet function tests. In conclusion, the optimal timing for haemostatic testing during menstrual cycle seems to be menstrual and early follicular phase...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to unravel the {{function}} of PEAR 1 (Platelet Endothelial Aggregation Receptor 1) in the endothelial cell {{and its role in}} the (patho) physiology of endothelial cell activation. Endothelial dysfunction is an important hallmark of both the early and the late stages of cardiovascular disease. The receptor-ligand interactions and the signalling pathways in the activated endothelium are incompletely understood. PEAR 1 was identified in 2005, but it’s role in endothelial and platelet biology was yet unknown 4. Whereas platelet PEAR 1 appears {{to be involved in the}} activation of platelets, the function of endothelial PEAR 1 is completely unknown and has not been studied yet. The expression of PEAR 1 in endothelial cells has already been confirmed in the host laboratory. Using endothelial cell cultures and cell perfusion studies, the role of PEAR 1 in endothelial cells will be investigated. Does PEAR 1 play a role in the regulation of the inflammatory responses or the <b>haemostatic</b> and anticoagulant <b>function</b> of the endothelium? Does PEAR 1 contribute to plateletleukocyte- endothelium interactions? What is the effect of eliminating the expression of PEAR 1 ? Are PEAR 1 polymorphisms of relevance to ischemic cardiovascular disease? Collectively, these studies should provide a molecular basis for the action of PEAR 1 in the endothelium and for its importance in cardiovascular pathology. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{endothelium}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in the regulation of the <b>haemostatic</b> balance. The <b>function</b> of endothelial cells exceeds far beyond providing a non-thrombogenic inner layer of the vascular wall which maintains the blood fluidity. In physiological circumstances endothelial cells carefully prevent thrombosis by different anticoagulant and antiplatelet mechanisms. Endothelial cells are involved in all major haemostatic pathways upon vascular injury and limit clot formation to the areas where haemostasis is needed to restore vascular integrity. Failure of this complex balance between pro- and anticoagulant systems because of genetic or acquired disturbances may result in bleeding or thrombosis. Endothelial heterogeneity assures adequate homeostasis in the different organs and parts of the vascular tree. The local environment induces heterogeneous endothelial cell phenotypes determined by local needs. This heterogeneity also explains the diverse pathological responses upon disturbed vascular integrity. Localised manifestation of thrombosis in spite of systemic procoagulant disturbances depends on vascular bed-specific properties. Endothelial dysfunction not only precedes atherogenesis but may also predispose to arterial thrombosis. The potential role of the endothelium in venous thrombosis with and without overt vessel wall injury is discussed. The vast majority of endothelial cells are located in the microvessels. Therefore, {{it is no surprise that}} endothelial cells play a key role in microcirculatory diseases such as thrombotic microangiopathies and diffuse intravascular coagulation. Microcirculatory endothelial cell activation is an important feature in all thrombotic microangiopathies. In diffuse intravascular coagulation, the endothelium is the interface between inflammation and inappropriate activation of the coagulation system. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The article {{demonstrated}} {{the data on}} changes of hemostasiologic and biochemical parameters measured in blood obtained from children with ventilationa associated pneumonia, from children with respiratory distress syndrome and from ventilated controls without pneumonia signs and symptoms. According to the results assessment, the changes of all measured lung biochemical and hemostasisaregulating parameters were severe in children who developed ventilationa associated pneumonia, and were changed to a lesser and minimal degrees in patients with RDS and controls, respectively. The mentioned changes were most evident in venous blood, clarifying the negative artertiovenous differences of the studied parameters in patients with pneumonia. The degree of arteriovenous differences of the studied parameters correlated with severity of ventilationa associated pneumonia and with the degree of pulmonary gas exchange impairment, thus allowing to consider these changes as early diagnostic criterion for ventilationa associated pneumonia in children.

40|$|The liver plays {{a central}} role in the control of {{haemostasis}} being the site of synthesis of most of the coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants, as well as fibrinolytic factors except the main activators of the fibrinolytic system (t-PA and u-PA). The liver also clears many of the activated clotting and fibrinolytic factors, as well as haemostatic activation complexes (TAT and PAP) and end product of fibrin degradation, FDP. Therefore, liver disease results in a complex and multifactorial pattern of defects in <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> in the form of: (i) decreased synthesis of coagulation factors (ii) Abnormal protein synthesis e. g. dysfibrinogen (iii) Deficiency of natural anticoagulants (iv) Enhanced fibrinolytic activity (v) Quantitative and qualitative platelet defects (vi) Consumptive coagulopathy as in advanced liver disease.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Thesis was to {{investigate}} <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> in diabetes mellitus and to relate abnormalities {{to the presence of}} micro- and macrovascular disease. Since poor metabolic control appears to favour the development of diabetic vascular complications, the influence of hyperglycaemia on <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> was also studied. In Part I, evidence that thrombosis is involved in the pathogenesis of micro- and macroangiopathy was discussed and the physiology of platelets and of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, with particular reference to their respective roles in thrombus formation, was reviewed. In Part II, platelet aggregation and a battery of tests of coagulation and fibrinolysis were performed on 3 ^ patients attending a diabetic out-patient clinic. Compared with non-diabetic controls, significantly higher levels of fibrinogen, factors II, V, VII, VIII:C, OC^-macroglobulin and c^-esterase inhibitor and lower levels of factor XI and antithrombin III were found, though the threshold concentrations of ADP, adrenaline and collagen required to produce second phase platelet aggregation were similar in diabetics and controls. The refinement of a new, non-radioisotopic method for the measurement of platelet survival was described in Part III. Using this method, platelet survival of 12 diabetics was found to be significantly shorter than that of 12 controls. Diminished platelet survival may result from alterations in the platelet membrane; further evidence for membrane abnormalities in platlets from diabetic subjects was provided by the observation that platelets from 8 patients with severe retinopathy had significantly increased "^I-fibrinogen binding compared with 9 non-diabetic controls, fibrinogen binding of platelets from 8 diabetics with slight retinopathy being intermediate between the two groups. Similarly, ADP-induced first phase platelet aggregation was found to be significantly increased in the group with severe retinopathy compared with the controls. Sensitivity of the platelets to ADP was found to be significantly correlated with the HbA^ concentration, but not with the degree of fibrinogen binding, suggesting that platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding were related to the extent of microvascular disease, but that aggregation may also be increased by poor metabolic control. In Part IV, the effect of diabetic serum on the production of PGI^ by thrombin stimulated cultured human vascular endothelial cells was assessed. Both PGI -like activity and 6 -keto-PGFT concentrations were significantly lower in cells cultured in 20...|$|E
40|$|Snake envenomations {{are often}} medical {{emergencies}} and occur regularly in dogs. Snake venom contains hundreds of enzymes, proteins and peptides that assist in paralysing, killing and digesting prey, or as a defence against predators. Multiple snake venom components affect haemostasis in the victim. Inadvertent activation of coagulation may also result from expression of {{large amounts of}} tissue factor (TF) from injured tissues at the envenomation site, especially with potent cytotoxic venoms. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the <b>haemostatic</b> <b>functions</b> in dogs envenomed by two South African snakes (Bitis arietans and Naja annulifera) using thromboelastography and traditional plasma-based coagulation assays. This prospective study included 18 client-owned dogs, of which nine dogs were envenomed by African puffadder and nine by snouted cobra. Blood was collected at presentation and at 24 hours post-envenomation. Complete blood count, thromboelastography (TEG), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), antithrombin (AT) activity and C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen (Fib) concentrations were measured. Ten healthy client-owned dogs served as controls. These dogs were presented for routine ovariohysterectomy, castration or blood donation. Haematologic and haemostatic assay results at presentation were compared between groups using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance), and results over time between the puffadder and cobra groups were compared using linear mixed models at 5 % significance. At presentation, the mean TEG R-time was significantly prolonged in the puffadder group when compared to the cobra and control groups (P= 0. 01 and 0. 05, respectively). Visual appraisal of the thromboelastograms at presentation revealed that 5 / 9 (56 %) of puffadder-envenomed dogs had hypocoagulable thromboelastograms as was demonstrated by prolonged R-time and decreased Angle (á), maximal amplitude (MA) and global clot strength (G). Despite this observation of hypocoagulability, none of the other TEG parameters (á, MA or G) were significantly decreased when compared to the cobra and control groups. This finding of hypocoagulability was surprising, because puffadder venom is cytotoxic, often inducing severe tissue necrosis and potentially leading to limb loss and disability in people. It therefore seems that certain components in puffadder venom affect the thromboelastograph by either interfering with or consuming coagulation factors, resulting in a hypocoagulable tracing. It is also possible that this is a dose-dependent effect, with only dogs with a significant amount of envenoming demonstrating this phenomenon. This effect appears to be transient, as 6 / 8 dogs (one fatality) envenomed by puffadders reverted to a severely hypercoagulable state at 24 hours post-envenomation. One dog was still hypocoagulable and one dog that was hypocoagulable became normocoagulable but still had a prolonged R-time. In the cobra-envenomed group hypercoagulable thromboelastograms were observed in 5 / 9 (56 %) dogs at presentation as was demonstrated by increased MA and G. At 24 hours post-envenomation all cobra-envenomed dogs demonstrated hypercoagulable thromboelastograms. This hypercoagulability at presentation and 24 hours post-envenoming was not statistically significant between groups. This hypercoagulable state was likely due to tissue factor-activated coagulation promoted by inflammation at the envenomation site. At presentation, marked thrombocytopenia was evident in the puffadder-envenomed dogs when compared to the cobras and controls (P= 0. 04 and 0. 001, respectively). Thrombocytopenia following puffadder envenomation has been reported in dogs and baboons. Components have been identified in puffadder venom that interfere with platelet function either by inhibiting or promoting aggregation. At 24 hours post-envenomation mean platelet count (Plt) was mildly increased compared to its value at presentation in the puffadder-envenomed dogs. There were Plt abnormalities in the cobra-envenomed dogs at presentation or at 24 hours post-envenomation. Marked leucocytosis was detected in the puffadder-envenomed dogs at presentation when compared to the cobras and controls (P= 0. 003 and 0. 001, respectively) and was more severe at 24 hours post-envenomation when compared to the cobra group (P= 0. 01). Leucocytosis has been reported in different types of snake envenoming including puffadder-envenomed dogs. C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration at presentation was below the lowest detection limit for most dogs (14 / 18) in this study. At 24 hours post-envenoming all but two dogs (one each in the puffadder and cobra groups) had severely elevated CRP. This increase in CRP was statistically significant in both puffadder and cobra-envenomed dogs when compared to its concentration at presentation (P= 0. 04 and 0. 001, respectively). Fibrinogen (Fib) concentration was not elevated in any envenomed dogs at presentation, but increased 24 hours post-envenoming. Although this increase was not statistically significant, an increase would suggest activation of the inflammatory response, as both Fib and CRP are positive acute phase proteins. Elevated CRP, neutrophilic leucocytosis and increases in cytokine IL- 6 and IL- 8 has been documented in four human patients bitten by Bothrops and Crotalus snakes (two each) in Brazil. CRP levels were low immediately post-envenoming, peaked at two days post-envenoming and dropped to within normal limits four days post-envenoming. These findings demonstrated a typical acute-phase response and it is likely that a similar acute phase response occurred after puffadder and cobra envenoming in our study. Mean antithrombin (AT) activity was mildly decreased in both the puffadder- and cobra-envenomed dogs compared to the controls (P= 0. 002 and 0. 004, respectively), suggesting that the activation of haemostasis led to some AT consumption. Mean PT and mean aPTT were prolonged in the cobra-envenomed dogs compared to the controls (P= 0. 03 for both), but were within their reference intervals (RI). At 24 hours post envenomation mean haematocrit (Ht) was significantly decreased in the puffadder group compared to the cobra group (P= 0. 01), but was within RI. The Ht was significantly lower at 24 hours post envenomation compared to presentation values in both these groups (P< 0. 001 and 0. 02, respectively). At presentation, marked thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis and prolonged clot initiation were common features in puffadder-envenomed dogs and were likely venom-induced. Snouted cobra-envenomed dogs were normo- to hypercoagulable at presentation. Both puffadder- and cobra-envenomed dogs equally showed hypercoagulability at 24 hours post-envenomation and this was more pronounced compared to their coagulability at presentation. TEG proved to be a useful tool to detect abnormal haemostasis in all envenomed dogs in this study. TEG also provided additional insights into certain aspects of snake envenomation (such as hypercoagulability) that has not been reported on previously and cannot be assessed using traditional coagulation assays. TEG may serve as a differentiating tool in early envenomation between these two types of snake envenoming in scenarios where the identity of the snake species involved is not known.

40|$|Objectives. To study {{different}} aspects of cerebral venous and arterial occlusive disease including cerebrospinalfluid hydrodynamics, epidemiology, aetiology, genetics, metabolic and <b>haemostatic</b> disorders, andcognitive <b>function</b> in young adults in Northern Sweden. Methods. Cerebrospinal fluid hydrodynamics were investigated with a constant pressure infusion methodin patients with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. Ten patients were studied with serial examinations, upto 15 years after {{the onset of the}} disease. Epidemiological data on ischaemic stroke in young adults aged 18 to 44 years were collected to calculateincidence and mortality based on the WHO Northern Sweden MONICA register of acute strokeevents. One hundred and seven consecutive patients aged 18 - 44 years with ischaemic stroke referred toUmeå university hospital were studied prospectively during a five-year period and were extensively evaluatedaccording to a standardized protocol. During follow-up at least three months after onset 102 and 80 patients, respectively, were evaluated for disturbances in the fibrinolytic system and in the metabolism ofhomocysteine. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was performed in a subset of 20 patients withinfratentorial infarcts. Results and conclusions. All patients with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis demonstrated a marked increasein intracranial pressure due to raised pressure in the sagittal sinus. A striking feature was the persistentintracranial pressure increase with only a slow decline over time. The incidence rate for ischaemic stroke was higher than previously reported from most countries inWestern Europe. The higher incidence was not explained by a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic vasculopathy. In spite of extensive evaluation, including advanced cardiac imaging, the cause of ischaemic strokein young adults still remains uncertain or unknown in most cases. Patients had lowered tissue plasminogen activator activity and increased plasminogen activator inhibitortype 1 activity. Increased fibrinogen levels and tissue plasminogen activator mass concentration wereindependently associated with ischaemic stroke. Metabolic perturbations were closely interrelated with tissueplasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 activity. Elevated plasma fibrinogenlevels and abnormalities in the fibrinolytic system in conjunction with metabolic perturbations may be importantcontributors to an increased stroke risk among young adults. Stroke patients had an exaggerated increase in total homocysteine levels after methionine loading. Abnormal responsivity to methionine loading was associated with higher tissue plasminogen activatormass concentration, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 levels and lower tissue plasminogen activator activity. Abnormal homocysteine metabolism may provide an additional thrombogenetic risk, partly mediatedby interactions with the fibrinolytic system. Circumscribed infratentorial lesions (mainly cerebellar) impaired central aspects of attention andworking memory, and inflicted damage upon visuospatial skills. In contrast, these patients may not sufferfrom global intellectual impairment and difficulties with respect to memory for previous events. The prognosisis favorable in terms of neurological deficits and handicap, but cognitive disability may be the mostsignificant problem in adapting to their former occupations. Key w ords.

40|$|Background: Most of late {{diabetic}} complications {{have their}} basis in a disturbed microcirculation, i. e. diabetic microangiopathy. This along with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and neuropathy {{contribute to the}} development of chronic diabetic foot ulcers, a severe and expensive complication often leading to lower-limb amputations and an increased death rate. Hypercoagulation and impaired fibrinolysis associated with diabetes mellitus might contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic microangiopathy. Aims: 1. To study the effects of the low molecular weight heparin compound dalteparin (Fragmin®, Pharmacia Corporation/Pfizer) on a) ulcer outcome, b) peripheral macro- and microcirculation, and c) <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function,</b> in patients with diabetes, PAOD and chronic foot ulcers. 2. To evaluate the predictive values of macro- (toe blood pressure, TBP) and microcirculatory (transcutaneous oxygen tension, TcP 02) measurements for ulcer outcome in patients with diabetes. Methods: 1. Prospective, randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled multicenter study. The patients were randomised to treatment with daily injections of 5000 U dalteparin or placebo, until ulcer healing or for a maximum of six months. Ulcer healing was evaluated every fourth week, and peripheral circulation and <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> at baseline, after 3 and 6 months, or earlier in case of discontinuation of treatment. Foot skin microcirculation was evaluated by TcP 02 and laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF), and <b>haemostatic</b> <b>function</b> by analysis of plasma fibrinogen concentration, fibrin gel structure (permeability coefficient, Ks; fiber mass/length ratio, µ), prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2), plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) activity, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen. 2. Prospective study enrolling 50 patients with diabetes and chronic foot ulcers. TBP and TcP 02 were measured at baseline, and the ulcer outcome was evaluated every 4 - 6 weeks during 12 months. Results: 85 out of 87 patients completed the study protocol, of which 43 were randomised to dalteparin and 42 to placebo. Ulcer outcome was significantly (p= 0. 042) better in the dalteparin group, as compared to the placebo group. More patients healed with intact skin or decreased the ulcer area >= 50 %, and the amputation rate was reduced to 25 % in the dalteparin group. Skin microcirculation: TcPO 2 improved significantly (p= 0. 01 5) during treatment with dalteparin. Skin vasodilatory response to local heating measured by LDF improved significantly in dalteparin treated patients who showed an improved ulcer outcome. Haemostatic function: Ks and µ increased significantly during treatment with dalteparin, while plasma fibrinogen concentration was unchanged. High plasma fibrinogen and a tight fibrin gel structure were associated with impaired skin microcirculation. Plasma tPA antigen and vWF increased during treatment with dalteparin, while F 1 + 2 and PAI- 1 activity increased significantly in patients on placebo. Prediction of ulcer outcome: Measurement of TcP 02 provided a higher positive predictive value (79 %; cut-off 25 mmHg) than TBP (67 %; cut-off 30 mmHg). Conclusions: Treatment with a daily dose of 5000 U dalteparin, as an adjunct to a multidisciplinary treatment programme, improves ulcer outcome and skin microcirculation in patients with diabetes and neuro-ischaemic foot ulcers. Impaired local skin microcirculation in these patients is associated with hyperfibrinogenaemia and a tight and rigid fibrin gel structure. Treatment with dalteparin exerts an inhibitory effect on thrombin generation, improves fibrinolytic function and increases fibrin gel porosity, which most probably conduce to the beneficial effects of dalteparin on the local foot skin microcirculation and the outcome of neuro-ischaemic foot ulcers in patients with diabetes...|$|E
