40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{biological}} {{basis for}} cancer of unknown primary (CUP) {{at the molecular}} level remains largely unknown, with no evidence of whether a common biological entity exists. Here, we assessed the possibility of identifying a common diagnostic biomarker for CUP using a microarray gene expression analysis. METHODS: Tumor mRNA samples from 60 patients with CUP were analyzed using the Affymetrix U 133 A Plus 2. 0 GeneChip and were normalized by asinh (<b>hyperbolic</b> arc <b>sine)</b> transformation to construct a mean gene-expression profile specific to CUP. A gene-expression profile specific to non-CUP group was constructed using publicly available raw microarray datasets. The t-tests were performed to compare the CUP with non-CUP groups and the top 59 CUP specific genes with the highest fold change were selected (p-value< 0. 001). RESULTS: Among the 44 genes that were up-regulated in the CUP group, 6 genes for ribosomal proteins were identified. Two of these genes (RPS 7 and RPL 11) are known {{to be involved in the}} Mdm 2 -p 53 pathway. We also identified several genes related to metastasis and apoptosis, suggesting a biological attribute of CUP.

40|$|The purpose {{the present}} paper is to {{construct}} the hyperbolic trigonometry on Euclidean plane without refereing to hyperbolic plane. In this paper we show {{that the concept of}} hyperbolic angle and its functions forming the hyperbolic trigonometry give arise on Euclidean plane in a natural way. The method is based on a key- formula establishing a relationship between exponential function and the ratio of two segments. This formula opens a straightforward pathway to hyperbolic trigonometry on the Euclidean plane. The hyperbolic law of cosines I and II and the <b>hyperbolic</b> law of <b>sines</b> are derived by using of the key-formula and the methods of Euclidean Geometry, only.

40|$|Multi-cut two-matrix {{models are}} {{studied in the}} Z_k {{symmetry}} breaking k-cut (p̂,q̂) critical points which should correspond to (p̂,q̂) minimal k-fractional superstring theory. FZZT-brane or macroscopic loop amplitudes are obtained {{in all of these}} critical points and found to have two kinds of solutions in general. Each of these solutions is expressed by <b>hyperbolic</b> cosine or <b>sine</b> functions with proper phase shifts. The algebraic geometries and ZZ-brane disk amplitudes (instanton actions) of these solutions are also studied. In particular, our results suggest that minimal ∞-fractional superstring theory {{can be viewed as a}} mother theory which includes all the minimal k-fractional superstring theories (k= 1, 2, [...] .) as its perturbative vacua in the weak-coupling string landscape. Our results also indicate that, in the strong coupling regime of this fractional superstring theory, there is a three-dimensional theory which would be understood as the non-critical version of M theory in the sense proposed by P.

LR Generic Package of Elementary Functions (GPEF) Description The proposed standard for the Generic Package of Elementary Functions (GPEF) represents {{the work of a}} large number of people in both the United States and Europe who have collaborated to develop specifications for pack-ages of Ada mathematical functions. This development has been difficult and lengthy. The exceptional dedica-tion and perseverance of these people have resulted in the completed specifications for two packages—GPEF, and the Generic Package of Primitive Functions (GPPF) for Ada. GPEF is the specification for certain elementary functions. They are square root, logarithm and exponential func-tions and the exponentiation operator; the trigonometric functions for sine, cosine, tangent and cotangent and their inverses; and the <b>hyperbolic</b> functions for <b>sine,</b> cosine, tangent, and cotangent together with their inverses...|$|R
