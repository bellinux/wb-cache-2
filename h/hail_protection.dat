500|$|In {{the case}} of El Reno, the {{wrapping}} rain bands {{did not lead to}} a narrow corridor of clear air close to the tornado. Rather, these rotating curtains of rain were the outer circulation of the tornado itself. Former Discovery Channel storm chaser Tim Samaras (an engineer), his son Paul Samaras (a photographer), and Tim's longtime chase partner Carl Young (a meteorologist), all professional storm chasers with the TWISTEX project, were caught directly by the tornado; all three died in their vehicle, two of them were ejected. Normally, Tim drove a reinforced three-quarter ton truck optimized for <b>hail</b> <b>protection</b> and stability in high winds; however, on May31, Carl was driving an unmodified Chevrolet Cobalt, a subcompact vehicle with three 45-lb barometric probes in the trunk likened by one TWISTEX chaser to a [...] "pizza delivery car", making it much less suited to high winds and rain-slicked backcountry dirt roads. It was also underpowered, which hampered their escape in the strong inflow winds. Tim's body was found still buckled in the passenger's seat. They were the first known tornado-related deaths of either recreational storm chasers or scientific researchers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to verify if photo-selective hail nettings {{can be used to}} affect fruit quality at harvest and during cold-storage, in addition to <b>hail</b> <b>protection.</b> The study was carried out in Southern Italy on 7 -year-old Hayward kiwifruit vines. Four types of photo-selective hail nettings (blue, grey, red, and white) were compared with an un-netted control. The nettings affected differentially and significantly most of the qualitative parameters measured in this study. Both the white and the red nets appeared to be very interesting because they allowed a high dry matter accumulation in the fruit. This was translated into a high soluble solids concentration in the fruits during cold-storage. The blue and grey nets tended to affect negatively the percentage of dry matter and soluble solids content of fruit. This may be due to shading effects. In addition, the white and the blue nets had a slight negative effect on flesh chlorophyll concentration and colour. All the tested nets decreased polyphenol concentration and antioxidant activity of the kiwifruit at harvest. It is proposed that in case <b>hail</b> <b>protection</b> is a must, the right choice of photo-selective hail nets can lead to additional benefits, making the netting more cost-effective for the growers...|$|E

Many regulations of this tech-nology are historically applied for active influence of hail processes in the Republic of Moldova. Seeding with a crystallizing agent is carried out in areas of new growth; it involves the following: – Seeding of forming potentially hail-hazardous clouds Cu cong for hail formation preven-tion; – Seeding of regions of new growth of deep convective clouds, being also Cu cong clouds (feed clouds), which merge with the basic hail cloud while growing, with a view of hail-storm suppression. According to the concept, for precipitation acceleration, the concentration of imitation ice crystals in the seeded volume must be on the order of 10 7...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a intensidade e a qualidade da radiação solar disponibilizada às plantas e os seus impactos sobre a fotossíntese, rendimento e qualidade dos frutos, em macieiras 'Royal Gala', cobertas ou não com telas antigranizo nas cores branca e preta. A tela preta provocou redução maior na densidade de fluxo de fótons fotossinteticamente ativos acima do dossel das plantas (24, 8 %), em comparação à tela branca (21, 2 %). O {{interior}} do dossel das plantas sob tela preta recebeu menores valores de radiação ultravioleta, azul, verde, vermelho e vermelho distante, bem como da relação vermelho:vermelho distante, em relação às plantas descobertas. Estas alterações na quantidade e qualidade da luz sob tela preta aumentaram o teor de clorofila total e a área específica nas folhas, e reduziram a taxa fotossintética potencial, o peso de frutos por cm² de seção transversal de tronco e a coloração vermelha dos frutos. As telas antigranizo branca e preta reduziram a incidência de queimadura de sol, porém não tiveram efeito sobre a severidade de "russeting" e sobre o número de sementes por fruto. The {{objective of}} this work {{was to assess the}} amount and quality of the light supplied to plants, and the resulting impacts on photosynthesis, yield, and fruit quality of 'Royal Gala' apple trees uncovered or covered with white and black <b>hail</b> <b>protection</b> nets. The black net caused a higher reduction (24. 8 %) of photosynthetic photon flux density, accumulated over the plant canopy during the day, than the white net (21. 2 %). The canopy internal portion of plants covered by black net received lower levels of ultraviolet, blue, green, red, and far red radiation, and light with a lower red:far red ratio, in comparison to uncovered plants; these ligth changes increased chlorophyll content and specific area of the leaves, and reduced the potential photosynthesis, the weight of fruits per cm² of trunk cross section area, and the share of blush area in the fruit.

40|$|Kiwifruit vines {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to damage caused by hail and wind. For this reason, the use of wind and <b>hail</b> <b>protection</b> systems is recommended for kiwifruit vines in those agricultural areas where windy conditions and hailstorms occur with high frequency. However, the presence of anti-hail nets above the canopy can influence air temperature and humidity and can affect the quantity and/or quality of the light reaching the canopy. Our aim was to study the effect of photo-selective anti-hail nets on the vegetative growth, fertility, and fruit yield of kiwifruit vines, Actinidia deliciosa [(A. Chev.) C. F. Liang et A. R. Ferguson]. The experiment was carried out in a private orchard located in Battipaglia (Southern Italy) on ‘Hayward’ vines grafted on ‘Bruno’. Four knitted photo-selective anti-hail nets (blue, gray, red and white) were placed horizontally above the vines at the beginning of April 2004. Measurements of vegetative and reproductive growth were taken throughout 2004, 2005, and 2006. In this paper, only part of the data collected in 2005 and 2006 is presented. Vines under the blue net exhibited significantly reduced vigor relative to all other covered vines, as well as the uncovered control, whereas the red and gray nets appeared to stimulate vigor. Vine fertility and fruit yield were slightly, albeit significantly decreased under all the nets, but in the covered vines, an increase in fruit size partially compensated for the decreased value of fruit production...|$|E
40|$|Em pomares de macieira, o dano de granizo pode ser evitado através da cobertura das plantas com telas. Todavia, as telas alteram a intensidade e a qualidade da luz solar e, assim, podem comprometer o rendimento e a qualidade dos frutos. Este trabalho objetivou avaliar estes aspectos em macieiras 'Fuji', cobertas com telas nas cores branca e preta. A tela preta ocasionou maiores reduções na densidade de fluxo de fótons fotossinteticamente ativos (DFFFA) disponíveis às plantas (24, 8 %) em relação à tela branca (21, 2 %). O {{interior}} do dossel das plantas sob tela, especialmente quando cobertas com tela preta, recebeu radiação com menores valores da relação vermelho:vermelho distante (V:Vd) em relação às plantas descobertas. Somente sob tela preta, {{a magnitude}} das reduções na DFFFA e na relação V:Vd da luz foi capaz de aumentar a área média e a área específica das folhas e reduzir a taxa fotossintética potencial, reduzindo assim o rendimento (número e peso de frutos por cm² de seção transversal de tronco) e a coloração vermelha dos frutos. As telas antigranizo branca e preta reduziram a incidência de queimadura de sol, porém não afetaram a severidade de "russeting" e o número de sementes por fruto. In apple orchards, hail damage {{can be avoided}} by covering the plants with nets. However, the nets might change light intensity and quality supplied to the plants and, therefore, affect yield {{and quality of the}} fruit. This research was carried out to assess these aspects on 'Fuji' apples trees uncovered and covered with white and black nets. The black net caused more substantial reduction of photosynthetic photons flux density (PPFD) available to the plants during the day (24. 8 %) than the white one (21. 2 %). The inner part of plants canopy covered by nets, especially under black net, received light with a lower red:far red ratio (R:FR), in comparison to uncovered plants. Only under black net, the reductions of PPFD and R:FR of the light supplied to the plants increased the mean area and the specific area of the leaves and reduced the potential photosynthesis, leading to a reduction of yield (number and weight of fruits per cm- 2 of trunk cross section area) and the red color of the fruit.
