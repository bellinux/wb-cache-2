40|$|Since {{nowadays}} {{mobile phone}} messages are flourishing, {{the application of}} electronic coupon (<b>e-coupon)</b> will become a trend for mobile users. <b>E-coupon</b> for mobile commerce can provide mobility for users and distribution flexibility for issuers. However, most of the existed <b>e-coupon</b> schemes usually apply public-key cryptosystem to achieve the security, which will not be implemented in mobile devices due to the complex computations. In this paper, we propose a novel mobile <b>e-coupon</b> system that just applies some simple cryptographic techniques, such as one-way hash function and message authentication code. In our system, the issuer can control the number of issued e-coupons and prevent them from double-redeeming. The merchant can verify {{the validity of the}} <b>e-coupon</b> and the customers can securely transfer the <b>e-coupon</b> to others. The customer does not need to perform any exponential computation in redeeming and transferring the coupons. Key words: e-commerce, <b>e-coupon,</b> mobile commerce 1...|$|E

LBA exploits the real-time location information of customers as well as demographic and personal traits. In LBA, due to the privacy and technology issues, an intermediate advertiser, which we call the super mobile, sends <b>e-coupons</b> to customers on behalf of stores. We study the <b>e-coupons</b> strategy problem in LBA {{from the point of}} view of the super mobile. First, we show that the full information model of the problem is reduced to a well-known optimization problem, the multidimensional 0 - 1 Knapsack problem (MKP). MKP belongs to the NP-Hard class of problems. Because of the total unimodularity of the problem, we show that, in a special case, significant <b>e-coupons</b> strategy problems can be solved in reasonable time. Second, we develop dynamic models of the <b>e-coupons</b> strategy problem such as the online, semi-online, and dynamic and stochastic models. In the online model, we show that our problem is reduced to the online MKP and propose threshold type algorithms which use the weighted efficiency as a criterion to select items. <b>E-coupons</b> strategy problems do not have to be solved purely online, where a decision is made immediately upon the arrival of an item...|$|R

40|$|Previous work on {{electronic}} coupon (<b>e-coupon)</b> systems mainly focused on security properties such as unforgeability, doubleredemption detection, and anonymity/unlinkability. However, achieving both traceability against dishonest users and anonymity for honest users without involving any third party {{is an open}} problem {{that has not been}} solved by the previous work. Another desirable feature of an <b>e-coupon</b> system that has not been studied in the literature is user privacy, which means the shop cannot identify the good (among all the choices specified in the coupon) that has been chosen by the customer during the redemption process. In this paper, we present a novel <b>e-coupon</b> system that can achieve all these desirable properties. We define the formal security models for these new security requirements, and show that our new <b>e-coupon</b> system is proven secure in the proposed models...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies online {{cooperative}} {{promotion and}} cost sharing decisions in competing supply chains. We consider {{a model of}} one B 2 C e-commerce platform and two supply chains each consisting of a supplier and an online retailer. The problem is studied using a multistage game. Firstly, the e-commerce platform carries out the cooperative promotion and sets the magnitude of markdown (the value of <b>e-coupon).</b> Secondly, each retailer and his supplier determine the fraction of promotional cost sharing when they have different bargaining power. Lastly, the retailers decide whether {{to participate in the}} cooperative promotion campaign. We show that the retailers are likely to participate in the promotion if consumers become more price-sensitive. However, it does not imply that the retailers can benefit from the price promotion; the promotion decision game resembles the classical prisoner’s dilemma game. The retailers and suppliers can benefit from the cooperative promotion by designing an appropriate cost sharing contract. For a supply chain, the bargaining power between supplier and retailer, consumer price sensitivity, and competition intensity affect the fraction of the promotional cost sharing. We also find that equilibrium value of <b>e-coupon</b> set by the e-commerce platform is not optimal for all the parties...|$|E
40|$|Cryptography with {{restricted}} conditions {{refers to}} cryptographic primitives with special requirements or conditions. For example, a proxy signature scheme only allows a proxy signer with valid delegation to issue signatures {{on behalf of}} the original signer, while for k-time anonymous authentication, a service provider can be ensured that a user can only have anonymous access to the services for up to k-times. Due to the different requirements in various types of security systems, more and more cryptographic primitives with new features are emerging. In this thesis, we study several cryptographic primitives with restricted conditions and their applications, including proxy signature and its variant in the attribute-based setting, oblivious transfer, k-time anonymous authentication and their applications in the <b>e-coupon</b> systems. To address the problem that a proxy signer might abuse the delegated signing right from the original signer, in this thesis, we present a k-time proxy signature scheme that only permits a designated proxy signer to generate a pre-determined number of proxy signatures. In the subsequent work, we implement proxy signature in attribute-based setting, that is, an original signer with a set of attributes can delegate his signing right to a proxy signer with a normal public and private key pair. One interesting feature of the proposed scheme is that by verifying a proxy signature, the public can be convinced the signature is generated by the proxy signer with valid deletion from the original signer whose attributes satisfy a pre-claimed predicate. Then we identify one attack that has been neglected in many existing delegation-by-warrant proxy signature schemes. We present the details of this attack and propose a general solution that can efficiently thwart the attack. In this thesis, we also construct several <b>e-coupon</b> systems with new properties. In the first <b>e-coupon</b> system, the user identity privacy would be revealed if a dishonest user requests more than pre-determined number of services specified in the coupon. Different from other e-cash and k-time anonymous authentication schemes, we achieve traceability without involvement of a trusted third party. Besides, for the first time, we formalize the concept of privacy of purchase, that is, the choices of the users when redeeming a coupon with the server is hidden. Moreover, we propose a new oblivious transfer (OT) scheme with retrievable receiver 2 ̆ 7 s privacy and design another <b>e-coupon</b> system based on our new OT scheme. If a user remains honest, the user anonymity and privacy of purchase are both well protected. Otherwise, the identity and purchase privacy of the user can be revealed by the service provider...|$|E

This corresponds to an assumption of rational behavior of protocol participants.

We demonstrate such a scheme for Web advertising, employing the concept of <b>e-coupons.</b> We prove that our proposed scheme is safe and meets our stringent security requirements.

40|$|Abstract. In k-times {{anonymous}} authentication (k-TAA) schemes, {{members of}} a group can be anonymously authenticated to access applications for a bounded number of times determined by application providers. Dynamic k-TAA allows application providers to independently grant or revoke group members from accessing their applications. Dynamic k-TAA can be applied in several scenarios, such as k-show anonymous credentials, digital rights management, anonymous trial of Internet services, e-voting, <b>e-coupons</b> etc. This paper proposes the first provably secure dynamic k-TAA scheme, where authentication costs do not depend on k. This efficiency is achieved by using a technique called “efficient provable e-tag”, proposed in [11], which could be applicable to other e-tag systems...|$|R
30|$|Quick {{response}} (QR) code {{has become}} one of the more popular two-dimensional barcodes because of its greater data capacity and higher damage resistance. The barcode scanners can easily extract the information hidden in the QR code while scanning the data modules. However, some sensitive data directly stored in QR codes are insecure in real-world QR applications, such as the e-ticket and <b>e-coupon.</b> To protect the sensitive data, this paper explores the characteristics of QR barcodes to design a secret hiding mechanism for the QR barcode with a higher payload compared to the past ones. For a normal scanner, a browser can only reveal the formal information from the marked QR code. The authorized user/scanner can further reveal the sensitive data from the marked QR tag. The experiments demonstrate a satisfactory secret payload and the feasibility of the proposed scheme.|$|E

We discuss different methods that {{are used in}} practice and propose BEPAC, a new Activation Code scheme that provides both authenticity and confidentiality. The small message space of activation codes introduces some problems that are illustrated by an adaptive chosen-plaintext attack (CPA- 2) on a general 3 -round Feis-tel network of size 22 n. This attack recovers the complete permutation from at most 2 n+ 2 plaintext-ciphertext pairs. For this reason, BEPAC is designed {{in such a way that}} authenticity and confidentiality are in-dependent properties, i. e. loss of confidentiality does not imply loss of authenticity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{efficient}} and secure micro-payment scheme, named <b>e-coupons,</b> which {{can provide the}} users the facility of delegating their spending capability to other users or their own devices like Laptop, PDA, Mobile Phone, and such service access points. The scheme has the promise of becoming an enabler for various Internet-based services involving unit-wise payment. It gives flexibility to the users to manage their spending capability across various access points for a particular service without obtaining an authorization for each and every access point from a facilitating bank. This flexibility which is not present in the existing micro-payment schemes is essential for accessing ubiquitous e-services and other Internet-based applications. The facility of delegation introduces a slight overhead in respect of the proof or verification of the delegated authorization and security provided to the payments. The payoff from the facility of delegation takes away {{the burden of the}} overhead. The paper discusses the design of the protocol and provides a basic analysis of the performance of the system. <b>e-coupons</b> is based on PayWord, a single-seed one-way hash chain for unit-wise payment, TESLA for payment security and SPKI/SDSI as underlying PKI framework for its unique delegation feature. The results obtained from the implementation of ecoupons are quite acceptable and show near real-time response. Our scheme uses multi-seed one-way hash chains for unit-wise payment. Furthermore, it allows an ordered transfer of the portions of payment chains to others. Because of this user’s spending capability can be used from different service access points to access the subscribed service, concurrently...|$|R

A k-Times Anonymous Authentication (k-TAA) scheme {{allows users}} to be {{authenticated}} anonymously {{so long as the}} number of times that they are authenticated is within an allowable number. Some promising applications are e-voting, e-cash, <b>e-coupons,</b> and trial browsing of contents. However, the previous schemes are not efficient in the case where the allowable number k is large, since they require both users and verifiers to compute O(k) exponentiation in each authentication. We propose a k-TAA scheme where the numbers of exponentiations required for the entities in an authentication are independent of k. Moreover, we propose a notion of public detectability in a k-TAA scheme and present an efficient publicly verifiable k-TAA scheme, where the number of modular exponentiations required for the entities is O(log(k)) ...|$|R

40|$|Scoring {{models are}} {{extensively}} used in CRM applications. However, while most scoring models are static in nature, the quickly changing {{environment in which}} firms operate often demands dynamic models {{that are able to}} adapt to that change. Moreover, scoring models are often used in environments that span vast and diverse geographical regions. The online channel is only one example where the underlying environment can be geographical extremely diverse. This calls for models that can take the geographical diversity into account: spatial models. In this work we propose spatial models of choice that adapt to dynamically changing environments. These learning spatial choice models incorporate new information as it becomes available and are therefore superior over static models. We estimate the model using a version of the online EM algorithm. We apply the learning spatial model of choice to an online publishing firm’s data on customer choice of print versus PDF and show how the scoring model can be useful in setting targeted <b>e-coupon</b> promotions or dynamic pricing application...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of GPS-enabled smartphones along with the popularity of micro-blogging and social networking applications, e. g., Twitter and Facebook, {{has resulted in the}} generation of huge streams of geo-tagged textual data. Many applications require real-time processing of these streams. For example, location-based <b>e-coupon</b> and ad-targeting systems enable advertisers to register millions of ads to millions of users. The number of users is typically very high and they are continuously moving, and the ads change frequently as well. Hence sending the right ad to the matching users is very challenging. Existing streaming systems are either centralized or are not spatial-keyword aware, and cannot efficiently support the processing of rapidly arriving spatial-keyword data streams. This paper presents Tornado, a distributed spatial-keyword stream processing system. Tornado features routing units to fairly distribute the workload, and furthermore, co-locate the data objects and the corresponding queries at the same processing units. The routing units use the Augmented-Grid, a novel structure that is equipped with an efficient search algorithm for distributing the data objects and queries. Tornado uses evaluators to process the data objects against the queries. The routing units minimize the redundant communication by not sending data updates for processing when these updates do not match any query. By applying dynamically evaluated cost formulae that continuously represent the processing overhead at each evaluator, Tornado is adaptive to changes in the workload. Extensive experimental evaluation using spatio-textual range queries over real Twitter data indicates that Tornado outperforms the non-spatio-textually aware approaches by up to two orders of magnitude in terms of the overall system throughput...|$|E

40|$|With the {{prevalence}} of social media and GPS-enabled devices, a massive amount of geo-textual data has been continuously generated in a stream fashion. In this thesis, we study the problem of efficiently processing streaming geo-textual data over publish/subscribe systems (pub/sub for short), which has broad applications in location-based advertising and information dissemination. In a spatial-keyword pub/sub system, users can register their interest as spatial-keyword subscriptions (e. g., interest in nearby restaurant discount); a stream of geo-textual messages (e. g., geo-tagged <b>e-coupons)</b> released by publishers will be delivered to the relevant subscriptions continuously. We comprehensively study three important aspects regarding spatial-keyword pub/sub systems as follows. Firstly, we investigate boolean-based spatial-keyword pub/sub, where a message is delivered to a subscription if it contains all the subscription keywords and falls inside the subscription range. We tackle both stationary subscriptions and moving subscriptions by proposing a novel adaptive indexing structure, which significantly reduces the processing time of incoming messages. Secondly, we study ranking-based spatial-keyword pub/sub, where we continuously maintain top-k most relevant messages for all the subscriptions over a sliding window. A novel index which seamlessly integrates both spatial-based and keyword-based pruning rules is proposed to support efficient message dissemination. A cost-based re-evaluation technique is further developed {{to reduce the number}} of re-evaluations. This is the first work to investigate spatial-keyword pub/sub over sliding window. Finally, we investigate distributed stream processing, where we process a continuous data stream in a distributed manner. We first study distributed stream similarity join over textual data. We develop a novel length-based distribution framework to dispatch incoming data by the number of tokens inside, which incurs no data replication, small communication cost and high throughput. We also design a bundle-based local index to facilitate the local join by grouping similar objects. We then consider geo-textual data by extending ranking-based spatial-keyword pub/sub into a distributed environment. Efficient distribution mechanisms are developed to achieve load balance and high throughput. This is the first work that systematically studies ranking-based spatial-keyword pub/sub in a distributed stream environment...|$|R
