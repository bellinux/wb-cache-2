50|$|Materials:Obtain {{a sample}} of mixed liquor. Transfer the sample into a {{laboratory}} in order to analyze it. Measure the volume weight of the sample. Remove two filter papers from a desiccator and record the weight of each. Place the <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> on a vacuum flask and then place another filter {{on top of the}} <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> by using a pair of tweezers. Stir the sample of mixed liquor {{in order to get a}} good mixture for the experiment. After sample is mixed, pour 5 mL into a graduated cylinder. Turn on the vacuum pump and pour the sample into the <b>filter</b> <b>holder.</b> After all the mixed liquor has gone through, run three portions of 10 mL distilled water through the <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> to rinse any particles that may have stuck to the glass. Allow the vacuum pump to run an additional three minutes. This will help remove any extra water from the filter before drying. Switch the vacuum pump off and remove the filter from the <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> and place in the corresponding weighing dish. Repeat above process for as many trials as needed. Place the filter(s) into a drying oven, which is set to 103°-105° C, for one hour. Upon drying, replace filters into a desiccator for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes in the desiccator, the filters are to be weighed.|$|E

Total system efficiency testing with optical particle counters was performed to determine the effectiveness of the new <b>filter</b> <b>holders.</b> The efficacy of the UVGI lamps was determined through biological surface and air sampling. Results indicated that the side with the new <b>filter</b> <b>holders</b> was about 3. 4 % more efficient per year during the 22 -month sampling period, whereas the coil chamber with the UVGI lamps had less biological contamination than the corresponding con-trol chamber for over 75 % of the sampling days...|$|R
40|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>holders</b> and {{continuous}} air monitors (CAMs) are used {{extensively in the}} nuclear industry. It is important to minimize leakage in these devices and in recognition of this consideration, a limit on leakage for sampling systems is specified in ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999; however the protocol given in the standard is really germane to measurement of significant leakage, e. g., several percent of the sampling flow rate. In the present study, a technique for quantifying leakage was developed and that approach {{was used to measure}} the sealing integrity of a CAM and two kinds of <b>filter</b> <b>holders.</b> The methodology involves use of sulfur hexafluoride as a tracer gas with the device being tested operated under dynamic flow conditions. The leak rates in these devices were determined in the pressure range from 2. 49 kPa (10 In. H 2 O) vacuum to 2. 49 kPa (10 In. H 2 O) pressure at a typical flow rate of 56. 6 L/min (2 cfm). For the two <b>filter</b> <b>holders,</b> the leak rates were less than 0. 007 % of the nominal flow rate. The leak rate in the CAM was less than 0. 2 % of the nominal flow rate. These values are well within the limit prescribed in the ANSI standard, which is 5 % of the nominal flow rate. Therefore the limit listed in the ANSI standard should be reconsidered as lower values can be achieved, and the methodology presented herein can be used to quantify lower leakage values in sample collectors and analyzers. A theoretical analysis was also done to determine the nature of flow through the leaks and the amount of flow contribution by the different possible mechanisms of flow through leaks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—When dust is {{collected}} {{by means of}} <b>filter</b> <b>holders</b> for industrial hygiene measure-ments, quite low winds can cause serious errors which are often completely ignored. Collection efficiencies are presented for a filter-holder dust sampler now being used for dust measurements at British coke ovens. When the holder faces the wind, efficiency initially increases with particle size to above 100 per cent, but above about 15 nm efficiency falls. It probably increases again at larger particle sizes. Efficiency rapidly falls with increasing particle size when the holder is side-on to the wind. Dust measurements were made in a dusty place on a coke oven, with one sampler facing, and another side-on to, a 2 - 6 m s- 1 wind. The ratio of the concentrations measured by the two samplers was about 4 for total dust, but only about 1 - 5 for the benzene-soluble matter (BSM), suggesting that the BSM was concentrated on the smaller particles. These ratios are probably overestimates of the normal sampling errors. The errors are clearly important, however, although less so than with more open <b>filter</b> <b>holders.</b> PROBLEMS OF COLLECTING AIRBORNE DUST MOST national hygiene standards for most particulates are {{in terms of the}} mas...|$|R
50|$|Filter mounting: This mount is {{used for}} {{attaching}} filters to EF lenses. There are three types: front threaded mount, inner drop-in mount, and rear gelatin <b>holders.</b> Front threaded <b>filters</b> are used on most lenses, and are attached by threading and tightening the filter. Inner, drop-in filter mounts are used on super telephoto EF lenses. They are attached by first pressing the two buttons on the filter mount, and pulling it out. Then either a round threaded filter is attached, or one can use a gelatin filter. Rear gelatin <b>filter</b> <b>holders</b> are used by cutting out a sheet of gelatin, to the size shown {{on the back of}} the lens and then sliding it into the <b>holder.</b> <b>Filter</b> mounts are useful for all types of photography, and every EF lens has either one or two of the three types used.|$|R

50|$|Drip brew coffee, {{also known}} as {{filtered}} coffee, is made by letting hot water drip onto coffee grounds held in a coffee filter surrounded by a <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> or brew basket. Drip brew makers can be simple <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> types manually filled with hot water, or they can use automated systems as found in the popular electric drip coffee-maker. Strength varies according to the ratio of water to coffee and the fineness of the grind, but is typically weaker in taste and contains a lower concentration of caffeine than espresso, though often (due to size) more total caffeine. By convention, regular coffee brewed by this method is served by some restaurants in a brown or black pot (or a pot with a brown or black handle), while decaffeinated coffee is served in an orange pot (or a pot with an orange handle).|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the first successful detection of airborne Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae under experimental and field conditions with a new nested PCR assay. Air was sampled with polyethersulfone membranes (pore size, 0. 2 μm) mounted in <b>filter</b> <b>holders.</b> <b>Filters</b> were processed by dissolution and direct extraction of DNA for PCR analysis. For the PCR, two nested pairs of oligonucleotide primers were designed by using an M. hyopneumoniae-specific DNA sequence of a repeated gene segment. A nested PCR assay was developed and used to analyze samples collected in eight pig houses where respiratory problems had been common. Air was also sampled from a mycoplasma-free herd. The nested PCR was highly specific and 104 times as sensitive as a one-step PCR. Under field conditions, the sampling system was able to detect airborne M. hyopneumoniae on 80 % of farms where acute respiratory disease was present. No airborne M. hyopneumoniae was detected on infected farms without acute cases. The chance of successful detection was increased if air was sampled at several locations within a room and at a lower air humidity...|$|R
50|$|Wide angle L-lenses {{typically}} have a gelatin <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> on the mounting {{point of the}} lens, which allows the photographer to cut a small, square piece of gelatin out of a larger filter sheet {{and place it on}} the lens. On film cameras, these are typically used to correct the color temperature, but on digital cameras this is largely unnecessary, as the color temperature can be corrected in software. The mount is still commonly used for neutral density gelatin sheets though, especially on certain wide-angle lenses where the protruding front element precludes the use of any screw-in filters. Some telephoto L-lenses, such as the EF 70-200mm zoom lenses, or the EF 300mm f/4L IS USM do not have rear gelatin filter holders. Super-telephoto lenses such as the EF 500mm f/4L IS USM, or the EF 200mm f/2L IS USM do have a rear 52mm drop-in <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> which can be used to hold gelatin type filters.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{by others}} and internal investigations at Philip Morris International (PMI) {{have shown that}} the standard trapping and extraction procedure used for conventional cigarettes, defined in the International Standard ISO 4387 (Cigarettes [...] Determination of total and nicotine-free dry particulate matter using a routine analytical smoking machine), is not suitable for high-water content aerosols. Errors occur because of water losses during the opening of the Cambridge <b>filter</b> pad <b>holder</b> to remove the filter pad as well as during the manual handling of the filter pad, and because the commercially available <b>filter</b> pad <b>holder,</b> which is constructed out of plastic, may adsorb water. This results in inaccurate values for the water content, and erroneous and overestimated values for Nicotine Free Dry Particulate Matter (NFDPM). A modified 44 mm Cambridge <b>filter</b> pad <b>holder</b> and extraction equipment which supports in situ extraction methodology has been developed and tested. The principle of the in situ extraction methodology is to avoid any of the above mentioned water losses by extracting the loaded filter pad while kept in the Cambridge <b>filter</b> pad <b>holder</b> which is hermetically sealed by two caps. This is achieved by flushing the extraction solvent numerous times through the hermetically sealed Cambridge <b>filter</b> pad <b>holder</b> by means of an in situ extractor. The in situ methodology showed a significantly more complete water recovery, resulting in more accurate NFDPM values for high-water content aerosols compared to the standard ISO methodology. The work presented in this publication demonstrates that the in situ extraction methodology applies to a wider range of smoking products and smoking regimens, whereas the standard ISO methodology only applies to a limited range of smoking products and smoking regimens, e. g., conventional cigarettes smoked under ISO smoking regimen. In cases where a comparison of yields between the PMI HTP and conventional cigarettes is required the in situ extraction methodology must be used for the aerosol of the PMI HTP to obtain accurate NFDPM/”tar” values. This would be for example the case if there were a need to print “tar” yields on packs or compare yields to ceilings. Failure to use the in situ extraction methodology will result in erroneous and overestimated NFDPM/”tar” values...|$|R

Air was sampled using miniaturised 13 [*]mm Swinnex two-stage <b>filter</b> <b>holders</b> in a medium-flow pumping system and through the absorption of particulate fluoride and HF vapours on cellulose ester filters uncoated or impregnated with sodium carbonate. Furthermore, filter desorption from the holders and the extraction of the pentafluorobenzyl ester derivative based on solid-phase microextraction were performed using an innovative robotic system installed on an xyz autosampler on-line with gas chromatography (GC) /mass spectrometry (MS). After generating atmospheres of a known concentration of gaseous HF, we evaluated the agreement between the results of our sampling method and those of the conventional preassembled 37 [*]mm cassette (± 8. 10 %; correlation coefficient: 0. 90).

40|$|The {{performance}} of dust cartridge filters {{commonly used in}} dust masks and in room ventilation depends both on the collection efficiency of the filter material and the pressure drop across the filter. Currently, the optimization of filter design is based only on minimizing the pressure drop at a set velocity chosen by the manufacturer. The collection efficiency, an equally important fac-tor, is rarely considered in the optimization process. In this work, a filter quality factor, which combines the collection efficiency and the pressure drop, is used as the optimization criterion for filter evaluation. Most respirator manufacturers pleat the filter to various extents to in-crease the filtration area in the limit space within the dust cartridge.

Weighing bias {{may be caused by}} a number of environmental and operating factors. Among them, the humidity effect is most often addressed. This study proposes a cost-effective weighing chamber with humidity control by using a saturated magnesium chloride solution to meet the USEPA requirements for filter weighing. To exclude the interference of electrostatic charges, filter samples are treated with a radioactive source, Am 241, on a microbalance pan before weighing. Long term monitoring shows that the relative humidity inside the weighing chamber is between 31 – 35 % when the temperature is between 18 – 21 °C. The air pressure inside the weighing chamber is kept slightly positive by adjusting the air supply of the humidity control unit at 15 L/min during filter conditioning and at 25 L/min during filter weighing to maintain a stable humidity condition and prevent aerosol contamination from outside. Moreover, the operator should wear gloves to prevent hand moisture evaporation.
