The biophysical and chemical challenges that arise during freeze-thawing are presented {{from the perspective of}} the large degree of structural and biological diversity found in <b>fish,</b> mollusc <b>and</b> crustacean <b>gametes.</b> Sperm cryopreservation procedures and the challenges raised by cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos or larvae are then discussed with a special focus on the importance of the genetic integrity of the thawed cells. Alternatives to the cryobanking of <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> embryos rely on the cryopreservation of cells of somatic, embryonic and germinal origin. The challenges posed by the use of such cells to reconstruct fish are then described...|$|R

40|$|The {{spermatozoa}} and oocyte {{are very}} specialized cells which possess the unique ability to fuse and {{to produce an}} embryo. This embryo will develop into a mature organism capable of producing gametes again. This colloquial statement comprehends however the most complex mechanisms in biology that is cell differentiation and cell reprogramming. Epigenetic modifications are major actors in this process, both during gametogenesis and embryo development. The epigenetic concept is resulting from the growing scientific understanding of embryology and genetics, and it is made operational by generic molecular mechanisms, namely DNA methylation, histone tails modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Epigenetic modifications associated with <b>gamete</b> differentiation <b>and</b> early embryo development are quite well described in mammals, but increasing research is developed in fish today, either in model or in aquaculture species. Because fish are living organisms thoroughly exposed to temperature and to water quality, environment is likely to influence the epigenetic pattern of the gametes, embryo, or adult organisms. Reproductive biotechnologies are also at risk to modify <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> embryo epigenetics. This review is aimed towards giving the basic knowledge on the molecular actors of epigenetics, highlighting the developing knowledge in mammals which can be useful to <b>fish</b> research <b>and</b> proposing the possible area where epigenetics can enrich research on <b>fish</b> <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> reproductive technologies...|$|R

40|$|Zebrafish female {{germline}} {{stem cell}} (FGSC) cultures were generated from a transgenic line of fish that expresses Neo and DsRed {{under the control}} of the germ cell specific promoter, ziwi [Tg(ziwi:neo);Tg(ziwi:DsRed) ]. Homogeneous FGSC cultures were established by G 418 selection and continued to express ziwi for more than 6 weeks along with the germ cell markers nanos 3, dnd, dazl and vasa. A key component of the cell culture system was the use of a feeder cell line that was initiated from ovaries of a transgenic line of fish [Tg(gsdf:neo) ] that expresses Neo controlled by the zebrafish gonadal soma derived factor (gsdf) promoter. The feeder cell line was selected in G 418 and engineered to express zebrafish leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), basic fibroblast growth factor (Fgf 2) and glial-cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf). These factors were shown to significantly enhance FGSC growth, survival and germline competency in culture. Results from cell transplantation experiments revealed that the cultured FGSCs were able to successfully colonize the gonad of sterile recipient <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> generate functional <b>gametes.</b> Up to 20 % of surviving recipient fish that were injected with the cultured FGSCs were fertile and generated multiple batches of normal offspring for at least 6 months. The FGSC cultures will provide an in vitro system for studies of zebrafish germ cell growth and differentiation and their high frequency of germline transmission following transplantation could form the basis of a stem cell-mediated strategy for gene transfer and manipulation of the zebrafish genome...|$|R

40|$|Ponencia presentada en Aquaculture celebrada en Nashville (EEUU) del 21 al 25 de febrero de 2013 Spanish {{aquaculture}} is nowadays {{a strong}} farming industry, with ca 60, 000 tonnes produced annually. Gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) gather more than 90 % {{of the marine}} <b>fish</b> production <b>and</b> {{most of the research}} efforts. Aquaculture conditions may aggravate natural infections, spread out diseases and disturb the equilibrium between hosts and pathogens, as therefore fish production may be endangered by diseases. The massive application of vaccination programs and other treatments against bacterial pathogens, have contributed to upstage parasites as the second cause of mortality and morbidity. The impact of parasites is not only due to direct mortality but also to weight loss, poor conversion rates, delayed growth and reduced marketability. Infections are the result not only of <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> pathogen interactions, but also are due to environmental and anthropogenic factors. High culture densities and suboptimum water conditions, or the use of materials, which allow the attachment, and proliferation of parasite stages or intermediate hosts, open opportunities for parasites to proliferate above epizootic thresholds and cause disease. In addition, the high density of farms and the global trade of <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> their <b>gametes,</b> or the market of pet shops and exotic species, facilitate colonization of new areas and hosts by exotic parasites. Thus, parasitic diseases are constantly emerging as production constraints both in new and in relatively mature production systems. Monogeneans, ciliates and flagellates are the most prevalent, whereas the presence and impact of myxozoans and coccidians have increased constantly in the last years. The myxozoans Enteromyxum leei and E. scophthalmi constitute a real threat for sparids and turbot cultures, respectively and the scuticociliate Philasteristes dicentrarchi produces problems in turbots. In spite of the latest advancements in our knowledge of the biology of parasites and pathology of the infections, the struggle against fish parasites in production systems is far from being solved. This is way the Fish Pathology group of IATS is devoted to the study of parasites affecting marine aquacultured fish in a multifaceted way. The research lines include 1) the development of reliable, fast and accurate diagnostic methods, 2) basic studies to understand the life cycle, transmission and epidemiology of the infections, 3) structural, genetic and antigenic characterization of parasites, 4) generation of treatment and prophylactic tools including vaccines, immunomodulation and genetic selection, and 5) the study of the mechanisms and key genes involved in the immune response and resistance to parasites.

40|$|Males {{and females}} are a {{fundamental}} aspect of human reproduction, yet procreation is perfectly possible without this division into two sexes. Biologically, males {{are defined as}} the sex that produces the smaller gametes (e. g. sperm), implying that {{the male and female}} sexes only exist in species with gamete dimorphism (anisogamy). Our ancestors were isogamous, meaning that only one gamete size was produced. The question of the evolutionary origin of males and females is then synonymous to asking what evolutionary pressures caused gamete sizes to diverge. Studying the ancestral evolutionary divergence of males and females relies largely on mathematical modelling. Here, we review two classes of models explaining the evolutionary origin of males <b>and</b> females: <b>gamete</b> competition <b>and</b> <b>gamete</b> limitation. These seemingly alternative explanations are not mutually exclusive, but two aspects of a single evolutionary process. Once evolved, anisogamy and the two sexes are evolutionarily very stable. This explains the maintenance of anisogamy in organisms with internal fertilization, which can cause large decreases in both <b>gamete</b> competition <b>and</b> <b>gamete</b> limitation. The ancestral divergence <b>and</b> maintenance of <b>gamete</b> sizes subsequently led to many other differences we now observe between the two sexes, sowing the seeds for what we have becom...|$|R

Nevertheless, we have witnessed a revolution in infertility research and provision of its treatment services in the past thirty-three years (1). One of these developments was made possible by the introduction of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in 1993. This method offered treatment of a wide spectrum of infertile men with a very limited number of spermatozoa in the semen or testicular tissue that would not have had other treatment options earlier (2). Recognition of adult and embryonic stem cells and their applications in biology and medicine, especially in regenerative medicine, is another key area of interest (3). One of the recent remarkable revolutions is the use of vitrification (ultra-rapid freezing) of <b>gametes</b> <b>and</b> reproductive tissues such as the ovaries for fertility preservation (4).
