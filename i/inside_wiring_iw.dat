40|$|With the {{downscaling}} of feature dimensions, copper interconnects exhibit properties differing from bulk or film material. Resistivity {{increases and}} limits electrical performances, {{and reliability of}} interconnects becomes a more important challenge for each new technological node. In this study, we present an approach of copper grain growth control <b>inside</b> narrow <b>wires</b> by adding a step between the copper electro-chemical deposition (ECD) and the chemical–mechanical polishing (CMP). This step corresponds to a partial CMP step (pre-CMP) and is applied after ECD and before anneal in order to modify the copper previous termoverburdennext term thickness. Depending on the targeted thickness, copper grain growth occurs during anneal with different efficiencies. Crystallization and grain growth behavior <b>inside</b> <b>wires</b> is investigated with focused ions beam (FIB). We present here our methodology for sample preparation and characterization. Results are focused on electrical variations and on morphological aspects of copper crystallization and grain growth inside lines observed with various overburden thicknesses. Peer reviewe...|$|R
