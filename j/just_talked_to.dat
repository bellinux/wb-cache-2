500|$|During another {{scene at}} the Snakehole Lounge, a drunken Leslie angrily yells to Ben, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{everybody}} in this bar and nobody wants you here." [...] That line was written by Harris Wittels, who wrote past screenplays for other Parks and Recreation episodes. During the end credits, Andy sings a song he wrote for April called [...] "November," [...] which includes the lyrics, [...] "Let's spread our wings and fly on a date." [...] This is also a reference to [...] "Woman of the Year," [...] in which Andy explained every song he writes includes either the lyrics, [...] "Spread your wings and fly" [...] or [...] "You deserve to be a champion." [...] Schur, who wrote the words to [...] "November", said it was especially challenging working one of those phrases into a love song.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was featured entirely off {{screen in the}} first season, often as a [...] "disembodied voice". In July 2015, she was revealed to be physically appearing in the second season, and Verbeek was cast in the role by October 2015. Verbeek was in Europe when she auditioned for and got the part, and Agent Carter had not yet begun airing there, so Verbeek [...] "didn't really know anything. I <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the showrunners, what is it about, what is the character about." [...] Verbeek wanted to play more than just [...] "the wife of", and noted that her take on the character is [...] "somewhat unexpected with Jarvis being who he is ... Ana just brings a whole different dimension to him." [...] Verbeek, who is Dutch, has [...] "spent {{a lot of time}} in Budapest", which helped with the character's Hungarian accent.|$|E
2500|$|The day Gray resigned, Kleindienst {{spoke to}} Nixon, {{urging him to}} appoint Felt as Gray's replacement, but Nixon instead {{appointed}} William Ruckelshaus as Acting Director. Stanley Kutler reported that Nixon said, [...] "I don't want him. I can't have him. I <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Bill Ruckelshaus and Bill is a Mr. Clean and I want a fellow in there that {{is not part of}} the old guard and that is not part of that infighting in there." [...] On another White House tape, from May 11, 1973, Nixon and White House Chief of Staff, Alexander M. Haig, spoke of Felt leaking material to The New York Times. Nixon said, [...] "he's a bad guy, you see," [...] and that William Sullivan had told him Felt's ambition was to be Director of the Bureau.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I've been enjoying myself immensely. Jean is so interesting, so {{kind and}} clever. She didn't bore me with stupid grammar, but <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me in such pretty French that I got on capitally, and like it as I never {{expected}} to, after Lucia's dull way of teaching it." ...|$|E

He returns to his {{apartment}} building {{one step ahead of the}} police, who now consider him a homicidal maniac. Steve dodges Willoughby and hides with Isobel's help. He then disguises himself as his [...] "sister" [...] by putting on some of Isobel's clothes and shaving his mustache. He finally reaches Susan, only to have Mrs. Cooper and Willoughby show up soon afterwards. When Mrs. Cooper inadvertently confirms Steve <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Isobel at a cafe, Susan finally believes her husband.|$|E
5000|$|Riding for Alien was great; like, there wasn't any bad vibes or anything. I {{really liked}} the company, I really liked {{everyone}} involved in it and I became friends with everyone. And {{when you got to}} quit a company like that, you wanna blow your brains out, you know? I only spoke to Carter and that's probably, like, one of the hardest calls I had to make and <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him and he was, like, [...] "Well, fuck man, it's a bummer, but it's, like, you gotta do what you gotta do." ...|$|E

50|$|Sloane {{is shocked}} and {{confused}} when Andrew calls {{her to tell}} her that Caitlin has died, not believing that she <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> a ghost. So, she decides to see the body for herself. At the hospital, Sloane runs into Patrick, her ex-boyfriend from college, who is a doctor at the hospital. Upon seeing Caitlin’s body, Sloane is clearly more upset about the implications for the movie premiere than the loss of a young girl. Sloane becomes even more flustered after being visited by Caitlin’s ghost again, and seeks consolation from Patrick. The spark between them is still there, and Patrick confronts Sloane about breaking up with him rather than going with him to medical school in Iowa.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Awan {{successfully}} contested for {{the indirect}} elections for Senate, and was elected unopposed. Awan was present alongside prominent party {{leaders such as}} Ameen Faheem when the announcement of Benazir Bhutto's return to Pakistan was made. Awan was present during the 19 October attack on Benazir Bhutto in Karachi, and then when Benazir Bhutto was killed in Rawalpindi. Awan {{was the first one}} to announce Bhutto's death to the Pakistani public, outside Rawalpindi General Hospital which is now known as Benazir Bhutto Hospital. Awan told the party workers outside the hospital, [...] "I have <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Dr. Mussadiq, he has confirmed to me that Mohtarma (Benazir Bhutto) has been martyred." ...|$|E

6000|$|Bert paid no {{attention}} to the colonel or to the judge, or to any of this buzzing. [...] "They are <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> hear themselves make a noise, anyway.

5000|$|... “Cell phones, iPods, {{wireless}} {{computers will}} change people in ways we don’t even understand,” Ruhl stated. “We’re less {{connected to the}} present. No one is where they are.

50|$|Wilson {{thinks that}} House wants the spinal nerve biopsy {{in order to}} grow it and then plant {{it in his own}} leg, a {{procedure}} which might allow him to walk pain free. House considers the possibility of Hannah's problem being endocrine, and visits Cuddy (at night, at her house) for an endocrinology consult, ostensibly because the endocrinologist on call was not picking up his phone. Cuddy tells House that he did not need to personally visit her because the endocrinologist on call is available—she <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him—and that she thinks he visited her to interrupt her date. Cuddy then asks House if he likes her and is jealous, though House denies it saying he simply is trying to destroy other people's happiness. Cuddy's comments seem to fluster House. Cuddy's date overhears their conversation and leaves, saying that he prefers the personality Cuddy showed to House to the one she has been showing him.|$|E
5000|$|Blues arranger/songwriter Willie Dixon wrote [...] "Talk to Me Baby (I Can't Hold Out)" [...] in late 1958 or 1959 in Los Angeles {{while he}} was on tour with Memphis Slim.

5000|$|He {{also spoke}} {{about how many}} tracks {{would be on the}} album, saying: [...] "We’re only doing 12 tracks, maybe. We’ll put some older songs that we did on there and make it a {{complete}} project. We’ll shoot a bunch of videos and drop it. But I <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> 40 today and he was like, ‘Where we at with it?’ So the first songs we did, we got in the studio and did them all together. Now we’ve got the whole nucleus of the album. And we know which beats want because we’ve picked all the tracks. And now we’re like, ‘You do your part in your studio, I’ll do mine in my studio, and you can send me an email." [...] He continued: [...] "All I can tell you is, all of the good product you got from E-40 with all the good product you got from Too $hort—it’s almost impossible for us to make a terrible album together. We’re both opinionated, so I damn sure am not co-signing a song that I think is wack. Whether I’m on it or not, I’m like, 'It’s wack! I don’t like it.' Laughs." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jack White {{said of the}} song's {{origin in}} an NPR interview:"You know, I <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her and she said, [...] "I wanna be in a band with you." [...] Laughs. I said, [...] "Really? Well, I'd love to do something." [...] I've always loved her voice — I mean, I think she {{has the kind of}} soul singing voice of the days of Betty Davis or Aretha Franklin. She took just sort of a sketch of a lyrical outline and turned into the most bodacious, vicious, {{incredible}} song. I don't even know what you'd classify it as — soul, rock and roll, whatever. [...] "Don't Hurt Yourself" [...] is incredibly intense; I'm so amazed at what she did with it."The song's music video is part of a one-hour film with the same title as its parent album, originally aired on HBO. The video presents Beyoncé in a raw, and desperate manner similarly to the songs lyrical composition. The unlikely main scenario of a parking lot acts as juxtaposition to Beyoncé's typical glamorous and chic music video scenarios, such as [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)" [...] and [...] "Freakum Dress".|$|E
5000|$|Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin's tenure on Rocky Top {{is off to}} {{a smooth}} start. Jonathan Crompton threw five {{touchdown}} passes Saturday, leading the Volunteers to a 63-7 rout of Football Bowl Subdivision newcomers Western Kentucky and their largest margin of victory in nine years. [...] "This is the way that we expect to play," [...] Kiffin said. [...] "We have high expectations here. I <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> them about understanding that was one game and it's over. We've {{got to find a way}} to play better next week." [...] In its first two drives, Tennessee looked as if it hadn't learned much under Kiffin, the youngest active coach in the division. Crompton threw a pass over the middle that was easily tipped by Thomas Majors and intercepted by Jamal Forrest, and Montario Hardesty fumbled after a hard hit. The Vols settled down after the first quarter, and Hardesty carried for 18 and 22 yards to help set up a 2-yard touchdown run by freshman Bryce Brown early in the second quarter. Bobby Rainey fumbled on the Hilltoppers' next play, and LaMarcus Thompson recovered for Tennessee. Crompton connected with Luke Stocker on his first of two TD catches to make it 14-0 only 7 seconds later.|$|E
