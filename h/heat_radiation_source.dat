40|$|This chapter starts {{by giving}} a brief {{account of the}} {{development}} of the atomic-molecular conception of chemistry. An essential backdrop to the whole discussion is the importance throughout human history of the practical chemical arts that have informed the production of the whole range of useful materials and stimulated enquiry into the theoretical aspects of chemical processes. Chemistry is concerned with the composition and properties of matter, and with the transformations of matter that can occur spontaneously or under the action of <b>heat,</b> <b>radiation</b> or other <b>sources</b> of energy. From the results of chemical experiments the chemist singles out a particular class of materials that have characteristic and invariant properties. Such materials are called pure substances and may be of two kinds, viz: compounds and elements. Elements may be defined as substances which have not been converted either by the action of <b>heat,</b> <b>radiation,</b> or chemical reaction with other substances, or small electrical voltages, into any simpler substance. Compounds are formed from the chemical combination of the elements, and have properties that are invariably different from the properties of the constituent elements; they are also homogeneous. This characteristic chemical notion of a pure substance is based on an ideal conception of the chemical and physical properties of matter and their changes under specified experimental conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|The use of mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel in {{commercial}} nuclear power reactors operated in Europe has expanded rapidly {{over the past}} decade. The predicted characteristics of MOX fuel such as the nuclide inventories, thermal power from decay <b>heat,</b> and <b>radiation</b> <b>sources</b> are required for design and safety evaluations, and can provide valuable information for non-destructive safeguards verification activities. This report describes the development of computational methods and cross-section libraries suitable {{for the analysis of}} irradiated MOX fuel with the widely-used and recognized ORIGEN-ARP isotope generation and depletion code of the SCALE (Standardized Computer Analyses for Licensing Evaluation) code system. The MOX libraries are designed to be used with the Automatic Rapid Processing (ARP) module of SCALE that interpolates appropriate values of the cross sections from a database of parameterized cross-section libraries to create a problem-dependent library for the burnup analysis.

40|$|Abstract—Heat {{radiation}} equation contains 4 th exponential {{order of}} temperature which makes mathematics analysis very complicated and troublesome. Therefore, most heat transfer experts and scholars believe, {{based on their}} own experiences, that the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> effect can be ignored due to small temperature difference between insulated surfaces and surrounding to simplify analysis. Due to this reason, insulation examples shown in most heat transfer, air conditioning and refrigeration text books, and some commercial packages for the design of insulations, commonly ignore the effect of <b>heat</b> <b>radiation.</b> However, this paper demonstrates that the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> effect can not be ignored in the situations of thin insulation with low ambient convective heat coefficient and a large surface emissivity.

40|$|The {{impact of}} solar <b>radiation</b> <b>heating</b> upon rock {{temperatures}} {{in a cold}} environment was investigated by an experimental simulation. Different rock samples, collected from {{the central part of}} the Tibet Plateau, were pre-treated and put in a low-temperature box. Temperatures in the box changed by a <b>radiation</b> <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> that simulated solar insolation. Results show that the temperature-increase rate of samples saturated by water is similar to that saturated by salt solution, but the decrease rate of the former is higher than the latter. The temperature rebound derived from the potential heat release of the rock-interstitial water transition at - 4 degreesC occurred more frequently on samples saturated by water than upon those saturated by salt solution. Salt content is a possible agent that inhibits the freeze-thaw process. Insolation heating induces faster temperature variations on the rock surface than in the interior. This is more closely related to rock mineral composition than to pore size and pore density. This implies that fast temperature variations may lead to the continuous expanding and contraction of the rock minerals. This may result in rock fatigue and may dominate the weathering process. These results, applied to different rocks saturated by water or salt solution, are also supported by measuring changes in ultrasonic-wave-transmitting rates.
