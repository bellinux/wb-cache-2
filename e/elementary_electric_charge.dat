500|$|The {{electron}} [...] is a subatomic particle, symbol [...] or , with {{a negative}} <b>elementary</b> <b>electric</b> <b>charge.</b> Electrons belong to {{the first generation of}} the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. [...] The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, ħ. As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer De Broglie wavelength for a given energy.|$|E

In the electromagnetic limit the Lagrangean reduces to the Skyrme term of the Skyrme model with {{two degrees of freedom}} only, two Goldstone bosons, corresponding to two polarisations of photons. We derive the equations of motion and discuss their relations with Maxwell’s equations. It is shown that Coulomb and Lorentz forces are a consequence of topology. Further, we relate the U(1) gauge invariance of electrodynamics to the geometry of the soliton field, give a general relation for the derivation of the soliton field from the field strength tensor in electrodynamics and use this relation to express homogeneous electric fields in terms of the soliton field. ...|$|R

It is shown, that consideration of the space-time geometry as a physical geometry, i. e. as a geometry described completely by the single-valued world function, leads to a discrimination of some values of the particle charge.

40|$|A {{physical}} {{interpretation of}} the mathematical consequence of Lorentz transformation within spatial relativity theory {{is presented as a}} result of my new physical model of existent fluctuating vacuum (FlcVcm). It is assumed that the FlcVcm is considered as a molecular dielectric, which consists from neutral dynamides, streamlined in a close-packed crystalline lattice. Every dynamide is a neutral pair, consistent by two massless opposite point-like <b>elementary</b> <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> (ElmElcChrgs) : electrino (-) and positrino (+). In a frozen equilibrium position two contrary pont-like ElmElcChrgs within every one dynamide are very closely installed one to another and therefore the aggregate polarization of every dynamide and its electric field also have zero values. The aggregate electric field of every dynamide polarizes nearest neighbors dynamides in an account of which nearest dynamides interact between them-self, because of which their elementary excitations, phonons and photons, have a wave character and behaviors. We suppose that the photon is an polarization result of the phonon within the fluctuating vacuum considered as an ideal dielectric and therefore the photon could be considered as an elementary collective excitation of the FlcVcm {{in the form of a}} solitary needle cylindrical harmonic oscillation. Hence the light, which is a packet of the photons, must move within FlcVcm with constant velocity and Dopler effect must be observed in both cases, for the light and sound. Then all mathematical results of Lorentz transformation could be considered as results of a demand of an independence of the observation results from the reactive velocity of the observation frame.

2500|$|The {{fact that}} the <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> of {{electrons}} and protons seem to cancel each other exactly to extreme precision {{is essential for the}} existence of the macroscopic world as we know it, but this important property of elementary particles is not explained in the Standard Model of particle physics. While the description of strong and weak interactions within the Standard Model is based on gauge symmetries governed by the simple symmetry groups [...] and [...] which allow only discrete charges, the remaining component, the weak hypercharge interaction is described by an abelian symmetry [...] which in principle allows for arbitrary charge assignments. The observed charge quantization, namely the fact that all known <b>elementary</b> particles carry <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> which appear to be exact multiples of ⅓ of the [...] "elementary" [...] charge, has led to the idea that hypercharge interactions and possibly the strong and weak interactions might be embedded in one Grand Unified interaction described by a single, larger simple symmetry group containing the Standard Model. This would automatically predict the quantized nature and values of all elementary particle charges. Since this also results in a prediction for the relative strengths of the fundamental interactions which we observe, in particular the weak mixing angle, Grand Unification ideally reduces the number of independent input parameters, but is also constrained by observations.|$|R
