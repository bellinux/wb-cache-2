5|$|The Thanhouser Company {{produced}} a 1912 film version, directed by Lucius Henderson and starring James Cruze. The one-reel film, based on Sullivan's play, {{may be an}} exception to the custom of one actor playing Jekyll and Hyde. Although Cruze was credited with a dual role, Harry Benham (who played the father of Jekyll's fiancée), said in 1963 that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> Hyde in some scenes.|$|E
5|$|Australia scored slowly, as Yardley {{employed}} leg {{theory to}} slow the scoring. Brown came in at No. 5, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> {{most of his career}} as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24. Hassett came in and Australia reached stumps at 293/4, a lead of 128. Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes, with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes. It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs.|$|E
5|$|From 1895 to 1899, William Wurtenburg {{served as}} the {{head coach of the}} Dartmouth Big Green {{football}} program, which represented Dartmouth College in collegiate football competitions. Dartmouth had adopted football as a school sport in 1881 when the team went 1–0–1. Prior to Wurtenburg's hiring, the team had won two consecutive Triangular Football League championships under coach Wallace Moyle.

5|$|In 1959–60, {{the season}} {{started with a}} Test trial between the XIs of Lindwall and Benaud. Meckiff claimed a match total of 4/90 for Lindwall's men and was {{selected}} for the Test tour of Pakistan and India. Before the team departed, Meckiff demonstrated his new bowling action, which used a rigid left arm during the run-up, before swinging the arm over during the delivery stride. Over the next two years, sceptics and sporting opponents mostly regarded his action as fair, and said so in public. He was not called for throwing in either India or Pakistan, meaning that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> in five nations without being sanctioned.|$|E
5|$|Morell {{continued}} {{to appear in}} Hammer's horror films in the ensuing decade. He had parts in the Shadow of the Cat (1960), She (1964, again with Peter Cushing) and its sequel Vengeance of She (1967), the lead in The Plague of the Zombies (1965), and The Mummy's Shroud (1966). He also starred with Cushing in Hammer's Cash on Demand, playing the same role <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play, The Gold Inside. He turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer's feature film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He {{did not wish to}} repeat himself.|$|E

He was the state hurdling champion from under-10s through to the under-15s, and in one year held every running and jumping record at the Bendigo Sports Centre, except the 100metres sprint. Growing up with his older brothers, Selwood was accustomed to playing with bigger teammates and opponents.

5|$|The club's {{attempt to}} defend the victory {{came to an end}} after six {{consecutive}} clean sheets, when they were defeated 3–2 by Barnsley with Speirs scoring one of the goals. However, he was limited to ten league games, not playing from September until March, and finished the season with seven goals. They included his second senior hat-trick during a 5–1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday on 30 March 1912. Speirs started the following season, but after playing 13 of the first 15games, he left. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> 96games in total, scoring 33goals.|$|E
5|$|The {{exclusion}} of professionals caused several controversies {{throughout the history}} of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds. Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.|$|E
50|$|As footballer, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>played</b> as goalkeeper {{for several}} clubs, {{including}} Romanian clubs Politehnica AEK Timișoara, Rapid București, and Moldovan side Constructorul Chișinău. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>played</b> in a friednly match for Moldova national football team, on 12 February 2003, a 2:2 draw.|$|R

5|$|The new prince's {{principal}} {{supporters were}} the noblemen {{who had been}} forced into exile in 1594, but they were impoverished young men, without influence. Instead of them, Andrew had to choose his officials from among the Roman Catholic lords: he made István Bodoni ispán (or head) of Kolozs County and Gáspár Sibrik {{the commander of the}} cavalry. Andrew was even unable to get rid of his opponents. For instance, Gáspár Kornis remained a member of the royal council, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> a preeminent role in the execution of Andrew's brother in 1594.|$|E
5|$|Andover {{competed in}} the first Hampshire Senior Cup in 1888, but became {{involved}} in controversy after they were knocked out of the competition by Woolston Works. During this match, a Glasgow–based player called J. Kesson played for Woolston in their victory. Andover protested that Kesson should be disqualified {{on the grounds of}} residency—although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> for Woolston Works earlier that season, he had since moved back to Glasgow. Woolston's appeal rested on the fact that Kesson had left some items of clothing at his lodgings in Woolston, and this should be interpreted as his intention to return. The Hampshire FA upheld the appeal, allowing Woolston to progress through to the next round and eventually win the inaugural competition.|$|E
5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far behind on points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led to charges that he held a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.|$|E
50|$|During {{his career}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>played</b> for the both top clubs from Prekmurje, Mura and Nafta Lendava. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> also <b>played</b> for Domžale in the Slovenian league.|$|R
