Further understanding of the construction and properties of conductive fabric may one day realize the full potential of these applications. Herein, a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) synthetic leather substrate was treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) doped poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and was found to exhibit low sheet resistance and high thermal stability. A study that measured the resistance versus the concentration of conductive material found that saturation was achieved after the addition of only 1 wt. % doped PEDOT:PSS. The treated PET reached sheet resistances as low as 2 Ω/sq. and was capable of resistive heating, and reached a maximum temperature of 150 °C in less than two minutes when a 5 V potential was applied. Additionally, the fabric was soaked in water and resistively heated, self-drying in approximately 8 minutes.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis was to study the {{modification}} of carbon materials with anthraquinone (AQ) and dihydroxybenzene (DHB) functionalities, via diazonium chemistry and electrochemical oxidative polymerization of their amines, and to examine their usefulness as new electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. [...] High surface area carbon materials {{have been widely used}} as electrode materials for supercapacitors. They store charges primarily through an electrostatic double layer charging mechanism which limits their energy density. The need for cost effective supercapacitors with high power and energy densities is crucial for many potential new applications. [...] Modified electrodes were investigated by {{one or more of the}} following techniques: cyclic voltammetry, galvanic cycling, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis. [...] The performances of the supercapacitors were evaluated by cyclic voltarnmetry and constant current discharging chronopotentiometry. Ragone plots were used to determine energy and power densities. [...] Various diazonium coupling approaches were successfully implemented to attach anthraquinone, 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzene and 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzene to different types of carbon electrode materials including carbon fabric (Spectrocarb 2225), Vulcan XC 72, Black Pearls 2000 and glassy carbon. [...] AQ modified carbon fabric was used as a negative electrode with Ru oxide as a positive electrode in a 1 M H₂SO₄ (aq) asymmetric supercapacitor. Better energy and power densities were achieved from this device using 64 % less Ru compared to an expensive symmetric Ru oxide device of the same mass as a result of the extended cell voltage and the higher specific capacitance that the AQ modification provides. Replacing the Ru oxide electrode with DHB modified carbon fabric electrode resulted in doubling the energy densities compared to the symmetric unmodified carbon <b>fabric</b> <b>device.</b> [...] An electrochemical oxidative polymerization approach was successfully used to prepare the following conducting polymers; poly(l-aminoanthraquinone), poly(anilineco- 1 -aminoanthraquinone), poly(dimethoxyaniline) on carbon electrodes. [...] Interestingly, poly(l-aminoanthraquinone) films prepared from 6 M H₂SO₄ (aq) solution showed unusual electrochemical behaviour. These films were extensively studied by cyclic voltarnmetry and impedance spectroscopy and it was found that the AQ electrochemical activity was strongly affected by the conductivity of the polyaniline-like backbone.

This case study discusses how {{computer aided design}} (CAD) and 3 D printing techniques were utilised in providing a suitable assistive device for a partial hand amputee, to meet his specific functional needs. The patient was a 77 year old male {{with a passion for}} music, in particular the French horn, which he played socially with a group of friends. Since undergoing a left 5 th finger amputation he had been unable to hold his musical instrument securely as the 5 th digit of the left hand is fundamental in this action. This had caused him difficulty in playing and resulted in him giving up this recreational activity. The aim of this project was to design and fit a device which would enable him to comfortably hold the musical instrument for prolonged periods, enabling him to play again. An alginate cast of the patient’s hand was taken, and dimensions of the musical instrument were recorded. The cast was scanned using a photogrammetry technique with Autodesk 123 D Catch software to finalise the scan, and 3 different assistive device designs were modelled using Autodesk Fusion 360 software. The designs were then printed using a Zmorph printer, and fitted to the patient. FEA was performed on the designs, taking into account the weight of the musical instrument and forces applied through it. Fit and function were assessed within the clinic, and following the completion of an appropriate risk assessment the patient took the devices for home trial. The patient completed a simple questionnaire after using each device which covered topics such as fitting, comfort, function and cosmesis. The 3 D printed devices were also compared with a low temperature thermoplastic device and a <b>fabric</b> <b>device</b> which he had previously been supplied with. It took an average of 3 hours to design each device, although this would reduce as experience of using the software increases, and printing time averaged 5 hours.

40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} {{have been}} widely utilized in applications such as electrochromic devices, organic photovoltaics, smart windows, organic transistors etc. Their unique electric properties {{and the ability to}} reversibly change color under external electrical stimuli, combined with their low cost, high coloration efficiency and versatile structures make them ideal candidates for the aforementioned applications. However, the processability issue faced by many conjugated polymers, along with the inefficient traditional assembly approach, greatly limited the use of some readily available conjugate polymer materials. We have found a simple yet efficient alternative assembling method in which monomers were mixed with polymer electrolyte before converted to their polymer forms. This novel approach, termed 2 ̆ 2 in situ assembly 2 ̆ 2, is applicable to any monomer that can be dissolved in the electrolyte solution, less sensitive to the polymerization environment, and can reduce assembling time and cost without sacrificing device quality and stability. The device fabrication, polymerization kinetics and mechanism were discussed in Chapter 3. Furthermore, because polymerization takes place after the device assembly, it offers a unique platform for studies that cannot be performed in traditional methods. For example, a high through-put copolymer selection model based on this platform was discussed in Chapter 4. The fundamental of diffusion of small molecules in solid state electrolyte matrix was used as a way to determine how monomer feed ratio affects the resulting copolymer properties. Copolymers of two or more monomers with various ratios can be obtained and characterized in a single run. This method can precisely identify the feed ratio needed to achieve a specific desired color, and could be extended to any other applications that require customized copolymer compositions. ^ We have also extended electrochromic studies onto a spandex fabric substrate.

40|$|Nowadays, {{dependable}} computing {{systems are}} widely required in mission critical and human-life critical applications. While the advance in CMOS technology enables smaller and faster circuits, the dependability of modern ICs has worsened {{as a result}} of the shrinking dimensions of MOS transistors and the increasing complexity of semiconductor devices. For those very complex SoC with many processor cores, dependability enhancement approaches are especially important. In this thesis we first examine the important attributes of a dependable MPSoC. We then explore the possible approaches to enhance these attributes. The cost of the chosen dependability approach in terms of performance and resource (silicon area/energy) overhead are evaluated. The proposed dependability approach is implemented in silicon and its effectiveness is assessed using experiments and actual measurement results. In the scope of this thesis, the dependability of an MPSoC is defined as its ability to deliver expected services under given conditions. Three important dependability attributes being reliability, availability and maintainability are identified. Reliability denotes the probability that the MPSoC will fail after a certain period of time. For an MPSoC, maintainability refers to the isolation/bypass of faulty components and reconfiguration of the fault-free spare parts to maintain its functionality. Availability denotes the readiness of the MPSoC to provide correct service. The reliability of an MPSoC can be improved by using processor cores as spare. Theoretically, system reliability greatly increases as more cores are used as spares. At the same time, the area overhead for reliability enhancement also increases. Maintainability can be realized by incorporating fault detection and self-repair features into an MPSoC. By dynamically detecting faults and reconfiguring the system to circumvent them, the system can be regarded as functionally correct. with a possible drop in performance. The time spent for fault detection and system repair is combined as system down time. Faster fault detection and repair operations will decrease system down time and enable a highly available MPSoC. The dependability approach proposed in this thesis involves test aiming stuck at faults performed at the processor core level at application run-time. Once detected, faulty resources can be isolated by the so-called resource management software and core-level system repair can be performed by means of resource reconfiguration. In order to validate the feasibility of our dependability approach, a homogeneous MPSoC platform with multiple Xentium processing cores was adopted as the vehicle of our experiment. A stand-alone infrastructural IP block, namely the Dependability Manager (DM), has been designed and integrated into the MPSoC platform. The DM can generate the test vectors for the Xentium cores, broadcast them via a Network-on-Chip and then collect the test responses from the core sunder test. Since the cores under test have identical architecture, a faulty core can be detected by majority-voting the test responses. Dedicated test wrappers and NoC (reused as a TAM) were included into the platform MPSoC as well. A modified scan-based test scheme was used for a back-pressure style test data flow control by pausing and resuming the test data in the NoC. The MPSoC platform was fabricated as a Reconfigurable <b>Fabric</b> <b>Device</b> using UMC 90 nm CMOS technology. The dependability overhead in terms of silicon area is about 1 %. Experimental results show that the dependability test can be carried out at application run-time without interrupting the function of other applications. The inclusion of the DM into the RFD makes it a maintainable MPSoC with very short stuck-at and memory fault detection time (21 ms) and reasonable MDT (hundreds of milliseconds). In conclusion, our proposed dependability approach and dependability test methods have proven to be feasible and efficient. The successful integration of the DM into the RF D and its correct operation indicate that our dependability approach can be applied to other homogeneous MPSoC platforms for dependability improvement...|$|E

Here, {{we show that}} nano-composites can be designed to heat {{in the presence of}} near infrared light. This process is useful in transitioning materials through a transition temperature for a range of applications. For example, shape-memory materials (including polymers, metals, and ceramics) are those that are processed into a temporary shape and respond to some external stimuli (e. g., temperature) to undergo a transition back to a permanent shape and may be useful in a range of applications from aerospace to <b>fabrics,</b> to biomedical <b>devices</b> and microsystem components. In this work, we formulated composites of gold nanorods (3 ̆c 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for fabricating straight or curved planar or three-dimensional (C channel, for example) fabric for fabrication into composite structures is presented. In the first embodiment, the fill yarns are inserted between layers of warp yarns, and a canted or curved reed, {{depending on the}} desired orientation of the fill yarns, is used to compact or 'beat-up' the fill yarns. In the second embodiment, the warp yarns of the fabric are curved using a conical {{or a combination of}} conical and cylindrical rollers to effect differential fabric take-up of the warp yarns for obtaining a constant radius of curvature of the warp yarns. In a third embodiment, a clamping bar <b>fabric</b> take-up <b>device</b> is used to effect the differential fabric take-up of the warp yarns for obtaining straight warp yarns, curved warp yarns with a constant radius of curvature, curved warp yarns with a non-contant radius of curvature, or some combinations of straight and curved warp yarns. In a fourth embodiment, for forming the flanges of the curved C channel, the warp yarns are alternately inserted through adjacent dent wires of the reed to permit vertical weaving of the flanges...|$|R
40|$|Fabric-based {{wearable}} {{technology is}} highly desirable in sports, {{as it is}} light, flexible, soft, and comfortable with little interference to normal sport activities. It can provide accurate information on the in situ deformation of muscles in a continuous and wireless manner. During elbow flexion in isometric contraction, upper arm circumference increases with the contraction of elbow flexors, {{and it is possible}} to monitor the muscles' contraction by limb circumferential strains. This paper presents a new wireless wearable anthropometric monitoring <b>device</b> made from <b>fabric</b> strain sensors for the human upper arm. The materials, structural design and calibration of the device are presented. Using an isokinetic testing system (Biodex 3 ®) and the <b>fabric</b> monitoring <b>device</b> simultaneously, in situ measurements were carried out on elbow flexors in isometric contraction mode with ten subjects for a set of positions. Correlations between the measured values of limb circumferential strain and normalized torque were examined, and a linear relationship was found during isometric contraction. The average correlation coefficient between them is 0. 938 ± 0. 050. This wearable anthropometric device thus provides a useful index, the limb circumferential strain, for upper arm muscle contraction in isometric mode. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
