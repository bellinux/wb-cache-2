25|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} S(P,T) we followed a specific path in the P-T diagram: <b>first</b> <b>we</b> integrated over T at constant pressure P0, so that dP=0, {{and in the second}} integral we integrated over P at constant temperature T, so that dT=0. As the entropy is a function of state the result is independent of the path.|$|E
25|$|<b>First</b> <b>we</b> {{prove the}} theorem for the 2-colour case, by {{induction}} on r+s. It {{is clear from}} the definition that for all n, R(n, 1) = R(1, n) = 1. This starts the induction. We prove that R(r, s) exists by finding an explicit bound for it. By the inductive hypothesis R(r−1, s) and R(r, s−1) exist.|$|E
25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started <b>first.</b> <b>We</b> were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E

Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E
