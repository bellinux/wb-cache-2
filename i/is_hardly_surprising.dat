These gardens attract about 150 million visitors a year, so it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> that many people gained their first exciting introduction to the wonders of the plant world in a botanical garden.|$|E
25|$|However, certain EU {{member states}} admit to having lacking quality control in {{occupational}} safety services, to {{situations in which}} risk analysis takes place without any on-site workplace visits and to insufficient implementation of certain EU OSH directives. Based on this, it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> that the total societal costs of work-related health problems and accidents vary from 2.6% to 3.8% of GNP between the EU member states.|$|E
25|$|Control of {{the process}} of gene {{transcription}} affects patterns of gene expression and, thereby, allows a cell to adapt to a changing environment, perform specialized roles within an organism, and maintain basic metabolic processes necessary for survival. Therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> that the activity of RNAP is long, complex, and highly regulated. In Escherichia coli bacteria, more than 100 transcription factors have been identified, which modify the activity of RNAP.|$|E
50|$|Both the Patriarch and Tiberius, {{commander}} of the Excubitors, had been recently appointed, with Justin having {{played a part in}} their respective appointments, in his role as Justinian's curopalates.

6000|$|... "No, no, no!" [...] {{and without}} further speech {{he left the}} room and the house and hurried home.

He wanted no such companion.|$|R
25|$|After the Civil War, General Robert E. Lee {{turned down}} several financially tantalizing offers of {{employment}} that would merely have traded on his name, and instead accepted the post of college president for three reasons. First, he had been superintendent of the United States Military Academy on the Hudson River at West Point, New York, so supervising higher education was in his background. Second, and more important, he {{believed that it was}} a position in which he could actually make a contribution to the reconciliation of the nation. Third, the Washington family were his in-laws: his wife was the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington, and Lee had long looked on George Washington as a hero and role model, so it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> that he welcomed the challenge of leading a college endowed by and named after the first president.|$|E
25|$|Graves {{began his}} {{first-class}} career for the Gentlemen of Philadelphia on September 14, 1894. This match was {{played on the}} Germantown Cricket Club ground against a team of Players of United States of America. Graves scored no runs in the two-day match which ended in a draw. As he was only 14 {{years old at the}} time, Graves' poor showing <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising.</b> Four years later, Graves again played with the Philadelphians, this time against Sir Pelham Warner's touring side. This time {{he was one of the}} opening batsmen, though his performance in the loss still left something to be desired. Graves played in several other series against touring English sides while attending the University of Pennsylvania. He then joined the Philadelphian cricket team in England in 1903. It was against Lancashire on July 6 of that year that Graves reached his highest run total. In the first innings at Old Trafford, he made only 19 runs but in the second he helped the Philadelphians to their nine wicket victory with a 103 not out. This score took 105 minutes to achieve and included 9 fours. His second highest first-class score came a month earlier against Nottinghamshire with a 62 not out. His highest recorded scores came during non-first class matches. One came during a match against Scotland on the same tour. This match saw Graves reach a score of 107. In 1898 he hit 128 against Canada.|$|E
500|$|Drawing on Adam of Bremen's {{assertion}} that Orkney was not conquered {{until the time}} of Harald Hardrada, who ruled Norway from 1043–66, Woolf (2007) speculates that Sigurd {{may have been the}} first Earl of Orkney. He also offers the hypothesis that the earldom was a created by the Danish king Harald Bluetooth, circa 980 rather than in the time of Harald Fairhair one hundred years earlier. He concludes that [...] "If there were no earls in Orkney before Sigurð's time it might help to explain the islands' low profile in the annals since these, for the most part, record only the deaths of great men." [...] However, the absence of comment on this subject by Irish sources prior to Sigurd's death there <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising.</b> Irish sources of the period were not well informed about and [...] "not much concerned" [...] with Orkney. Smyth (1984) is more sympathetic to the claims of the sagas and argues that Torf-Einarr [...] "may be regarded as the first historical earl of Orkney".|$|E
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> {{then that}} Olive, the elder of the girls, sought {{to find herself}} a rich husband who would whisk {{her away from the}} lonely farm to the highs of London society, and this she did three years earlier, marrying Sir Baldwin Jefferys, a middle aged gentleman of wealth and position.|$|R

50|$|In 1789, Leicester played Nottingham {{again in}} two matches at Loughborough. They won one each and full {{scorecards}} have survived. It {{is evident that}} by this time these teams were representative of their counties and, in 1791, they were both deemed good enough to play against MCC, but they were both well beaten. This <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> as northern cricket was still developing while the southern teams had considerable match experience.|$|R
500|$|Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com {{said that}} despite the {{controversy}} the game was attracting due to alleged racism, no expert opinion had been sought. He asked Glenn Bowman, senior lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Kent, whether he thought the game was racist. Bowman considered the racism accusations [...] "silly", saying that the game had an anti-colonial theme and those complaining about the game's racism might be expressing an [...] "inverted racism which says that you can't have scary people who are black." [...] It was reported that one cutscene in the game scene showed [...] "black men" [...] dragging off a screaming white woman; according to Yin-Poole, the allegation was incorrect and the single man dragging the woman was [...] "not obviously black". The scene was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification for evaluation. BBFC head of communications Sue Clark said, [...] "There is only one man pulling the blonde woman in from the balcony [...] is not black either. As the whole game is set in Africa it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> {{that some of the}} characters are black ... we do take racism very seriously, but in this case there is no issue around racism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Besides being {{provided}} with funds and training by the Kataeb Party and the Al-Tanzim, the Guardians also {{claimed to have}} received direct aid from Israel as early as 1974.

2500|$|According to Lawrence Levine, [...] "there was {{a direct}} {{relationship}} between the national ideological emphasis upon the individual, the popularity of Booker T.

[...] Levine stated that [...] "psychologically, socially, and economically, African-Americans were being acculturated in a way that would have been impossible during slavery, and it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> that their secular music reflected this as much as their religious music did." ...|$|E

5000|$|Richard Bath {{writes of}} him: A buoyant larger-than-life figure, Brown was an {{abrasive}} steamroller of a lock. Unmoveable in the scrum and unfailingly sure {{on his own}} ball at the line-out, he also displayed a dynamism in the loose play {{and an ability to}} look after himself when the going got tough. At 6ft 5in. and over 17 stone, Brown had trouble maintaining peak fitness, so it <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> his greatest moments came on tour.|$|R

2500|$|The critic James J.Y. Liu notes “Chinese poets {{seem to be}} perpetually bewailing their {{exile and}} longing to return home.

2500|$|Parts of {{the immune}} system of higher organisms, however, create peroxide, superoxide, and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes. Recently, singlet oxygen {{has been found to be}} a source of biologically-produced ozone: This {{reaction}} proceeds through an unusual compound dihydrogen trioxide, also known as trioxidane, (HOOOH), which is an antibody-catalyzed product of singlet oxygen and water. This compound, in turn, disproportionates to ozone and peroxide, providing two powerful antibacterials. The body's range of defense against all of these active oxidizing agents <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising,</b> then, given their [...] "deliberate" [...] employment as antimicrobial agents in the immune response. Reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack.|$|E
2500|$|Given the {{resources}} it controlled, it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> that the 17th century {{was a period}} of solid achievement for the Mosul patriarchate. [...] The Catholic movement lost its vigour in both patriarchates and although the conversion of the Nestorian bishop Joseph in Amid in 1672 revived Catholic hopes, this unexpected development came after several decades in which the Mosul patriarchs had recovered their old authority in the western districts, consecrating Nestorian bishops for the Catholic dioceses founded by Sulaqa a century earlier. [...] Scribal activity, previously concentrated in the Gazarta district, shifted to Mosul, to the nearby villages of Telkepe and Tel Isqof, and above all to Alqosh, whose Shikwana and Nasro families emerged {{in the second half of}} the century to establish a dominance which was not seriously challenged until the second half of the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Fearchar's wider {{connections}} are further illustrated by his religious patronage. In the 1220s he granted the [...] Premonstratensian Order (perhaps {{the most modern}} one about) of Whithorn in Galloway a new monastery at Mid Fearn in Ross, moving it a decade later to New Fearn. They brought with them some relics of St Ninian too, which is why to this day Fearn Abbey is associated with that saint. Such a move <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising,</b> since all aspiring magnates needed their own monastery.|$|R

2500|$|Archaeologist and scholar Israel Finkelstein {{argues that}} {{these and other}} pro-Judah {{narrative}} strands likely originated after {{the demise of the}} Kingdom of Israel in the 8th Century BCE: [...] "t was only after the fall of Israel that Judah grew into a fully developed state with the necessary complement of professional priests and trained scribes able to undertake such a task. When Judah suddenly faced the non-Israelite world on its own, it needed a defining and motivating text. That text was the historical core of the Bible, composed in Jerusalem {{in the course of the}} seventh century BCE. And because Judah was the birthplace of ancient Israel's central scripture, it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> that the biblical text repeatedly stresses Judah's special status from the very beginnings of Israel's history.... it was Judah, among all of Jacob's sons, whose destiny was to rule over all the other tribes in Israel." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} {{took place}} {{during one of the}} harshest standoffs of the Cold War, so it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> that each side interpreted it as a serious provocation. The Bulgarian Communist government saw the accident primarily as a political negative in the détente in East/West relations that had been achieved in talks in Geneva earlier the same year, so after the incident both pilots were considered for demotion and threatened with prison terms by the minister of the interior Georgi Tzankov. Prison terms were not imposed, as the pilots were determined to have followed the orders given. Although the Bulgarian government at first refused to accept responsibility, blaming the Israeli airliner for penetrating its airspace without authorization, it eventually issued a formal apology, stating that the fighter pilots had been [...] "too hasty" [...] in shooting down the airliner, and agreed to pay compensation to the victims' families.|$|E

The close relationship between the Trust and the NSWCA is evidenced {{by the fact that they}} pooled funds for the next six years.

2500|$|One {{reason for}} McLoughlin's partial {{withdrawal}} from the rotogravure series late in 1948 was undoubtedly the introduction of Christmas annuals to the Boardman line under their Popular Press imprint. The first of these, Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual number one, appeared {{in time for the}} 1949 Christmas market. The book's production was rushed because T.V. Boardman, Sr., did not decide to proceed with the project until the last minute.

Given the success of Buffalo Bill, it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> that the [...] "Adventure" [...] annual series was soon added to the Popular Press offerings.

2500|$|As the old native {{aristocracy}} suffered {{military and}} political defeat and, in many cases, exile, the world order that had supported the bardic poets disappeared. In these circumstances, it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> that much Irish language poetry and song of this period laments these changes and the poet's plight. However, being practical professionals, the poets were not above writing poems in praise of the new English lords {{in the hope of}} finding a continuity of court patronage. This was not generally a successful tactic, and Gaelic poets tended to be folk poets until the Gaelic revival that began {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. However, many of the poems and songs written during this period of apparent decline live on and are still recited and sung today. The end of old ways, a feature of the bardic laments of the 18th century, is also to be found in the early 19th century poem Caoine Cill Chais (The Lament for Kilcash). In this verse the anonymous poet laments that the castle of Cill Chais stands empty, its woods are cut down and its old splendours departed. (Flood and Flood 1999:85-93): ...|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. [...] "Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying," [...] he recalled.
