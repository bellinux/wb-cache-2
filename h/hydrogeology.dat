25|$|<b>Hydrogeology</b> (hydro- meaning water, and -geology {{meaning the}} study of the Earth) is the area of geology that deals with the {{distribution}} and movement of groundwater in the soil and rocks of the Earth's crust (commonly in aquifers). The terms groundwater hydrology, geohydrology, and <b>hydrogeology</b> are often used interchangeably.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the {{movement}} of groundwater has been studied separately from surface water, climatology, and even the chemical and microbiological aspects of <b>hydrogeology</b> (the processes are uncoupled). As the field of <b>hydrogeology</b> matures, the strong interactions between groundwater, surface water, water chemistry, soil moisture and even climate are becoming more clear.|$|E

25|$|The {{injection}} of gases into the groundwater may also cause contamination to spread faster than normal {{depending on the}} site's <b>hydrogeology.</b> In these cases, injections downgradient of groundwater flow may provide adequate microbial destruction of contaminants prior to exposure to surface waters or drinking water supply wells.|$|E
25|$|A pedotransfer {{function}} (PTF) is a specialized empirical estimation method, used {{primarily in the}} soil sciences, however has increasing use in <b>hydrogeology.</b> There are many different PTF methods, however, they all attempt to determine soil properties, such as hydraulic conductivity, given several measured soil properties, such as soil particle size, and bulk density.|$|E

25|$|Hydrology is {{the study}} of the movement, distribution, and quality of water {{throughout}} the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is hydrography. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is <b>hydrogeology,</b> of glaciers is glaciology, of inland waters is limnology and distribution of oceans is oceanography. Ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of ecohydrology.|$|E
25|$|Often we are {{interested}} in how the moving groundwater will transport dissolved contaminants around (the sub-field of contaminant <b>hydrogeology).</b> The contaminants can be man-made (e.g., petroleum products, nitrate, Chromium or radionuclides) or naturally occurring (e.g., arsenic, salinity). Besides needing to understand where the groundwater is flowing, based on the other hydrologic properties discussed above, there are additional aquifer properties which affect how dissolved contaminants move with groundwater.|$|E
25|$|Geology and {{geologic}} principles can {{be applied}} to various environmental problems such as stream restoration, the restoration of brownfields, and the understanding of the interaction between natural habitat and the geologic environment. Groundwater hydrology, or <b>hydrogeology,</b> is used to locate groundwater, which can often provide a ready supply of uncontaminated water and is especially important in arid regions, and to monitor the spread of contaminants in groundwater wells.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrophobicity}} of {{a compound}} can give scientists {{an indication of}} how easily a compound might be taken up in groundwater to pollute waterways, and its toxicity to animals and aquatic life. Partition coefficient can also used to predict the mobility of radionuclides in groundwater. In the field of <b>hydrogeology,</b> the octanol-water partition coefficient, or Kow, is used to predict and model the migration of dissolved hydrophobic organic compounds in soil and groundwater.|$|E
25|$|Fresh-water aquifers, {{especially}} those with limited recharge by snow or rain, also known as meteoric water, can be over-exploited and depending on the local <b>hydrogeology,</b> may draw in non-potable water or saltwater intrusion from hydraulically connected aquifers or surface water bodies. This can be a serious problem, especially in coastal areas and other areas where aquifer pumping is excessive. In some areas, the ground water can become contaminated by arsenic and other mineral poisons.|$|E
25|$|An aquifer is an {{underground}} layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be extracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and {{the characterization of}} aquifers is called <b>hydrogeology.</b> Related terms include aquitard, which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and aquiclude (or aquifuge), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer. If the impermeable area overlies the aquifer, pressure could cause it to become a confined aquifer.|$|E

The National Research Council (NRC) ranked the school 73rd nationally, with Industrial Engineering 34th, Materials science 60th, Civil Engineering 69th, Mechanical Engineering 87th, and Electronic Engineering 96th. The <b>hydrogeology</b> program within the Department of Geosciences was ranked among the top 100 programs in North America by the National Ground Water Association.|$|E
25|$|The {{pollutant}} {{creates a}} contaminant plume within an aquifer. Movement {{of water and}} dispersion within the aquifer spreads the pollutant over a wider area. Its advancing boundary, often called a plume edge, can intersect with groundwater wells or daylight into surface water such as seeps and spring, making the water supplies unsafe for humans and wildlife. The movement of the plume, called a plume front, may be analyzed through a hydrological transport model or groundwater model. Analysis of groundwater pollution may focus on soil characteristics and site geology, <b>hydrogeology,</b> hydrology, {{and the nature of}} the contaminants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrogeology</b> is an {{interdisciplinary}} subject; {{it can be}} difficult to account fully for the chemical, physical, biological and even legal interactions between soil, water, nature and society. The study of the interaction between groundwater movement and geology can be quite complex. Groundwater does not always follow the surface topography; groundwater follows pressure gradients (flow from high pressure to low), often through fractures and conduits in circuitous paths. Taking into account the interplay of the different facets of a multi-component system often requires knowledge in several diverse fields at both the experimental and theoretical levels. The following is a more traditional introduction to the methods and nomenclature of saturated subsurface hydrology.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater is {{the water}} present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces {{and in the}} {{fractures}} of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is <b>hydrogeology,</b> also called groundwater hydrology.|$|E
25|$|Interactions between {{groundwater}} {{and surface}} water are complex. Consequently, groundwater pollution, {{also referred to}} as groundwater contamination, is not as easily classified as surface water pollution. By its very nature, groundwater aquifers are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies, and the distinction of point vs. non-point source may be irrelevant. A spill or ongoing release of chemical or radionuclide contaminants into soil (located away from a surface water body) may not create point or non-point source pollution but can contaminate the aquifer below, creating a toxic plume. The movement of the plume, called a plume front, may be analyzed through a hydrological transport model or groundwater model. Analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on soil characteristics and site geology, <b>hydrogeology,</b> hydrology, {{and the nature of the}} contaminants.|$|E

He returned to geology [...] while continuing to pursue jazz as an avocation. Around 1975 he began working on his doctoral degree in <b>hydrogeology.</b> Employed by the US Department of Energy, he specialized in ground-water contamination from nuclear waste; as a research hydrogeologist, he accepted assignments worldwide and had extensive travels in Ukraine and Russia.|$|E

Since the construction took place in water-saturated soils, over 200 frozen wells had to be formed {{so it could be}} lowered to its proper location. In addition, over [...] of rock had to be removed {{to make way for the}} vestibule. After it was finally installed, construction work began on the lower escalator tunnel. Due to a difficult <b>hydrogeology,</b> the tunnel was not completed by the station's grand opening and until 1 May 1990, it could only be reached with a transfer from the Teatralna station.|$|E
