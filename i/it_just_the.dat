2500|$|Rockabilly {{was most}} popular with country {{fans in the}} 1950s, and 1956 could be called the year of rockabilly in country music. Rockabilly was an early form of rock and roll, an upbeat {{combination}} of blues and country music. The number two, three and four songs on Billboard's charts for that year were Elvis Presley, [...] "Heartbreak Hotel"; Johnny Cash, [...] "I Walk the Line"; and Carl Perkins, [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] Thumper Jones (George Jones) Cash and Presley placed songs in the top 5 in 1958 with No. 3 [...] "Guess Things Happen That Way/Come In, Stranger" [...] by Cash, and No. 5 by Presley [...] "Don't/I Beg of You." [...] Presley acknowledged the influence of rhythm and blues artists and his style, saying [...] "The colored folk been singin' and playin' <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> way I'm doin' it now, man for more years than I know." [...] But he also said, [...] "My stuff is just hopped-up country." [...] Within a few years, many rockabilly musicians returned to a more mainstream style or had defined their own unique style.|$|E
2500|$|... "Satellite" [...] is a pop song {{written by}} American {{songwriter}} Julie Frost and Danish songwriter John Gordon. Frost told HitQuarters that {{the song is}} about [...] "unconditional love". The lyrics describe the thoughts {{of a woman in}} love ("I got it bad for you"), who is frustrated at being ignored ("I went everywhere for you/ I even did my hair for you/ I bought new underwear they're blue/ And I wore <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> other day.") and compares herself to a lonely traveller ("Like a satellite I'm in orbit all the way around you/ And I would fall out into the night/ Can't go a minute without your love."), {{but on the other hand}} seems to draw a kind of masochistic pleasure from her pain. Gordon has said it is a [...] "bubbly" [...] song, [...] "pretty easy and sweet with cheerful lyrics" [...] and [...] "three chords". Frost, the song's lyricist, explained, [...] "It deals with all the crazy hidden things a girl does and feels when she is in love. A man can make her feel everything at once, joyful but also tormented and helpless." ...|$|E
