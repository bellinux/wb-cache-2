2500|$|To define an {{absolute}} filling radius {{in a situation}} where M is equipped with a Riemannian metric g, Gromov proceeds as follows. One exploits an <b>imbedding</b> due to C. Kuratowski. One imbeds M in the Banach space L∞(M) of bounded Borel functions on M, equipped with the sup norm [...] Namely, we map a point x ∈ M to the function fx ∈ L∞(M) defined by the formula fx(y) = d(x,y) for all y ∈ M, where d is the distance function defined by the metric. By the triangle inequality we have [...] and therefore the <b>imbedding</b> is strongly isometric, in the precise sense that internal distance and ambient distance coincide. [...] Such a strongly isometric <b>imbedding</b> is impossible if the ambient space is a Hilbert space, even when M is the Riemannian circle (the distance between opposite points must be π, not 2!).

Of course I do not hold that two fools are better than one wise man; but two men of average ability are, in nearly all circumstances, better than one, especially {{if one of them}} is decidedly and admittedly superior to the other. Lancey's powers were limited, but his ambition was not so, and I am bound to add that his application was beyond all praise. Of course his attainments, like his powers, were not great. His chief difficulty lay in his tendency to drop the letter h from its rightful position in words, and to insert it, along with r and k, in wrong places. But my efforts to impress Lancey's mind had the satisfactory effect of <b>imbedding</b> minute points of the language deeply in my own memory.|$|E
60|$|One day she {{had come}} upon the rotting ribs of a wreck on the beach. Its {{distance}} from the tide line, its position, and its deep <b>imbedding</b> of sand, showed that it was of ancient origin. An omnivorous reader of all that pertained {{to the history of}} California, Jenny had in fancy often sailed the seas in one of those mysterious treasure-ships that had skirted the coast in bygone days, and she at once settled in her mind that her discovery was none other than a castaway Philippine galleon. Partly from her reserve, and partly from a suddenly conceived plan, she determined to keep its existence unknown to her father, as careful inquiry on her part had found it was equally unknown to the neighbors. For this shy, imaginative young girl of eighteen had convinced herself that it might still contain a part of its old treasure. She would dig for it herself, without telling anybody. If she failed, no one would know it; if she were successful, she would surprise her father and perhaps retrieve their fortune by less vulgar means than their present toil. Thanks to the secluded locality {{and the fact that she}} was known to spend her leisure moments in wandering there, she could work without suspicion. Secretly conveying a shovel and a few tools to the spot the next day, she set about her prodigious task. As the upper works were gone, and the galleon not large, in three weeks, working an hour or two each day, she had made a deep excavation in the stern. She had found many curious things,--the flotsam and jetsam of previous storms,--but as yet, it is perhaps needless to say, not the treasure.|$|E

6000|$|... § XXXIV. LAW IV. The shafts may {{sometimes}} {{be independent of}} the construction. Exactly {{in proportion to the}} importance which the shaft assumes as a large jewel, is the diminution of its importance as a sustaining member; for the delight which we receive in its abstract bulk, and beauty of color, is altogether independent of any perception of its adaptation to mechanical necessities. Like other beautiful things in this world, its end is to be beautiful; and, in proportion to its beauty, it receives permission to be otherwise useless. We do not blame emeralds and rubies because we cannot make them into heads of hammers. Nay, so far from our admiration of the jewel shaft being dependent on its doing work for us, it is very possible that a chief part of its preciousness may consist in a delicacy, fragility, and tenderness of material, which must render it utterly unfit for hard work; and therefore that we shall admire it the more, because we perceive that if we were to put much weight upon it, it would be crushed. But, at all events, it is very clear that the primal object in the placing of such shafts must be the display of their beauty to the best advantage, and that therefore all <b>imbedding</b> of them in walls, or crowding of them into groups, in any position in which either their real size or any portion of their surface would be concealed, is either inadmissible altogether, or objectionable in proportion to their value; that no symmetrical or scientific arrangements of pillars are therefore ever to be expected in buildings of this kind, and that all such are even to be looked upon as positive errors and misapplications of materials: but that, on the contrary, we must be constantly prepared to see, and to see with admiration, shafts of great size and importance set in places where their real service is little more than nominal, and where the chief end of their existence is to catch the sunshine upon their polished sides, and lead the eye into delighted wandering among the mazes of their azure veins.|$|E
60|$|Not {{only does}} {{this process of}} <b>imbedding</b> and fossilisation occur with marine and other aquatic animals and plants, but it affects those land animals and plants which are drifted away to sea, or become buried in bogs or morasses; and the animals which have been trodden down by their fellows and crushed in the mud at the river's bank, as the herd have come to drink. In any of these cases, the organisms may be crushed or be mutilated, before or after putrefaction, {{in such a manner}} that perhaps only a part will be left in the form in which it reaches us. It is, indeed, a most {{remarkable}} fact, that it is quite an exceptional case to find a skeleton of any one of all the thousands of wild land animals that we know are constantly being killed, or dying in the course of nature: they are preyed on and devoured by other animals, or die in places where their bodies are not afterwards protected by mud. There are other animals existing on the sea, the shells of which form exceedingly large deposits. You are probably aware that before the attempt was made to lay the Atlantic telegraphic cable, the Government employed vessels in making a series of very careful observations and soundings of the bottom of the Atlantic; and although, as we must all regret, that up to the present time that project has not succeeded, we have the satisfaction of knowing that it yielded some most remarkable results to science. The Atlantic Ocean had to be sounded right across, to depths of several miles in some places, and the nature of its bottom was carefully ascertained. Well, now, a space of about 1,000 miles wide from east to west, and I do not exactly know how many from north to south, but at any rate 600 or 700 miles, was carefully examined, and it was found that over the whole of that immense area an excessively fine chalky mud is being deposited; and this deposit is entirely made up of animals whose hard parts are deposited {{in this part of the}} ocean, and are doubtless gradually acquiring solidity and becoming metamorphosed into a chalky limestone. Thus, you see, it is quite possible in this way to preserve unmistakable records of animal and vegetable life. Whenever the sea-bottom, by some of those undulations of the earth's crust that I have referred to, becomes up-heaved, and sections or borings are made, or pits are dug, then we become able to examine the contents and constituents of these ancient sea-bottoms, and find out what manner of animals lived at that period.|$|E

40|$|This {{experimental}} study investigates the measuring length of an iron rod with {{the interaction between}} ferromagnetic material and inductance. Measuring such a small lengths by using a ruler {{is a major problem}} because of parallax etc. To prevent this, “How does the self inductance value change in inductance when the iron rod is <b>imbedded</b> in different lengths?” question was tested. Because the self inductance value (L) value will help us to calculate the length of the iron rod in the solenoid. The experiment was made in 3 parts. First, when the inductance was empty, self-inductance value was found. After this, to find the permeability of iron rod that was used in the investigation, iron rod was fully <b>imbedded</b> into the solenoid, resonant frequency was read and permeability was calculated. Thirdly, 11 different lengths of iron rod was <b>imbedded</b> into the solenoid and by using their resonant frequencies, L values were calculated and by using another equation, how much length of the iron that was <b>imbedded</b> into the inductance was found. At the beginning of the experiment, how much length that will be <b>imbedded</b> was measured by caliper. These values were accepted as theoretical values, lengths.
