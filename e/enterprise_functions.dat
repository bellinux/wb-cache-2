50|$|EFD is a {{used as a}} {{modeling}} {{technique for}} the representation of <b>enterprise</b> <b>functions</b> and corresponding interactions. Different business processes can be modeled in these representations {{through the use of}} “function modules” and triggers. A starting business process delivers different inputs to different functions. A process flowing through all the functions and sub-functions creates multiple outputs. Enterprise Function Diagrams thereby provide an easy-to-use and detailed representation about a business process and its corresponding functions, inputs, outputs and triggers. In this way EFD has many similarities with IDEF0 diagrams, which also represent business processes in a hierarchical fashion as a combination of functions and triggers. The two differ in that an EFD places the business functions in an organization hierarchical perspective, which outlines the downstream of certain processes in the organization. On the other hand, IDEF0 diagrams show the responsibilities of certain business functions through the use of arrows. Furthermore, IDEF0 provides a clear representation of inputs and outputs for every (sub)function.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: One of {{the tasks}} of {{information}} management is systematic planning of a Hospital Information System (HIS). However, the description and {{the analysis of the}} current state of a HIS typically create high costs and are not well supported. The aim of this paper is therefore to report about the specification of a reference model for the domain layer of a Hospital Information System. Methods: We developed a reference model for the domain layer of a Hospital Information System based on the requirements index for information processing in hospitals for describing the <b>enterprise</b> <b>functions,</b> and based on the object types from the Health Level 7 Reference Information Model (HL 7 -RIM) for describing the entity types. Result: The developed reference model is a comprehensive hierarchic model of the <b>enterprise</b> <b>functions</b> of hospital information systems. The central enterprise function “patient treatment ” for example is described with 35 <b>enterprise</b> <b>functions</b> and 38 entity types on a three-level hierarchy. Discussion: Reference models provide a kind of modelling patterns that can easily be used and adapted to a respective Information System. The availability of reference models should therefore provide a highly valuable contribution to keep the costs for modelling Hospital Information Systems low. We will start to evaluate the reference model by using it in the description of the information systems of a University Clinic of the Tiroler Landeskrankenanstalten GmbH (TILAK), Austria. If this pre-test is positive, it is planned to extend the use of the reference model to th...|$|E
