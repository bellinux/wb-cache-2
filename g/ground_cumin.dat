40|$|There was {{investigated}} microbial quality of spices used in production of meat products (black pepper, allspice, coriander, juniper, cumin, cinnamon, badian, mustard, bay leaf, paprika, rosemary, garlic, ginger, thyme, cardamom). The spices were analysed {{on the presence}} of total count of mesophilic, thermoresistant and coliforming microorganisms, Staphylococcus aureus, methicilin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis and moulds. For the detection of fungal contamination was used agar with glucose, yeast extract and oxytetracyklin and dichloran-glycerol agar. The cultivation was performed at 25 ± 1 °C for 5 - 7 days. The microscopic method was used for species identification. The aflatoxin presence was confirmed by ELISA test in all of tested spices and was performed in ppb (pars per billion = μg/kg). TCM ranged from 200 to 5600000 cfu/g, TRM from 20 to 90000 cfu/g and coliforming bacteria from 30 to 3200 cfu/g. B. cereus was present in juniper, mustard, bay leaf, thyme and cardamom (32 %), while B.  licheniformis was confirmed in 58 % of cases (allspice, pepper, ground juniper, badian, bay leaf, paprika, garlic, thyme and cardamom). S. aureus was detected in whole coriander, cinnamon, badian and mustard but only in law number (30, 40, 20 and 10 cfu/g respectively). No strains S. aureus was identified as MRSA. The presence of Salmonella spp. and E. coli was not confirmed. The fungal contamination was found in 14 spices and the their count varied from 0 to 1550 cfu/g.

Then these banana leaf packages are steamed or grilled. This releases a distinct pleasant aroma of toasted banana leaf.|$|R

5000|$|The Southern New Mexican {{version is}} usually pork cut into strips and chunks. Historically, before refrigeration, the pork was {{fermented}} in red chile in a crock {{using the same}} bacterial cultures as in yogurt (but it is not dairy). Fermented meat {{was a way of}} preservation and imparted a [...] "sour" [...] taste to the pork which explains why modern New Mexican adovada recipes call for a bit of white vinegar or lemon/lime juice. The red chile is prepared [...] "con pellejo" [...] with bits of the chile skin using spices of fresh minced garlic, mortar and pestle <b>ground</b> oregano, comino (<b>cumin),</b> cilantro, and coriander seeds {{that may or may not}} be toasted. The dish is then baked until the meat is tender, moist and succulent on the inside while encrusted with a semi-dry and crisp red chile exterior that is almost blackened. Other versions of red chile and boiled or braised pork may be claimed as carne adovada. Other versions of red chilli and pork sin pellejo are actually what is known as Chile Colorado. Carne adovada may be served with a tortilla, beans and rice, fideos or homefries, or papas with a fresh vinegar slaw or salad.|$|R
40|$|This study determines {{possible}} antibacterial, antioxidant and growth-promoting {{effects of}} some selected herbs in broiler chickens. Ground aerial parts of Thymbra spicata, Origanum minutiflorum, Rosmarinus officinalis, Mrytus communis, Salvia tomentosa and <b>ground</b> seed of <b>Cumin</b> {{were added to}} broiler diets at 0. 0, 0. 25, 0. 50, 1. 00 and 1. 50 % (w/w). Volatile essential oil contents were analysed. Samples of blood, digesta and intestinal tissues were analysed to determine antioxidant activity, bacteria growth and intestinal histomorphology, respectively. The results showed that at 0 - 21 days of age the birds performed better on the diets up to 0. 25 % of herbal inclusion level. Increasing the inclusion level from 0. 5 to 1. 5 % for Origanum minutiflorum, Thymbra spicata and partially for Rosmarinus officinalis increased feed consumption with lower weight gain and depressed efficiency of feed conversion, but not for Salvia tomentosa, Mrytus communis and Cumin. The results further showed that broilers could better perform on the diets up to 0. 5 % of inclusion level at 42 days. All levels (except 1. 5 %) for Cumin and Salvia tomentosa did not cause any impairment in performance of broilers. High inclusion levels (0. 5 to 1. 5 %) reduced E. coli count. The selected herbs did not cause an oxidative stress at a given inclusion level. Of the plants Rosmarinus officinalis clearly demonstrated strong antioxidant effect. The high doses of Origanum minutiflorum caused depression in growth rate associated with shortened villus development of intestinal epithelium in broilers. However, increased growth rate with Cumin associated with longer villus and increased dry matter retention in broilers at 21 days were recorded. It was suggested that some of selected herbs can be incorporated up to 0. 5 % into broiler diets on account of their antibacterial and antioxidant propertie...|$|R
