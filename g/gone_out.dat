The carrier's engineers often resorted to making replacements from scratch.|$|E

5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated {{the image}} of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued to dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of style, and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Crane's {{contract}} with Appleton {{allowed him to}} receive a flat ten percent royalty of all copies sold. However, the contract also stipulated {{that he was not}} to receive royalties from the books sold in Great Britain, where they were released by Heinemann in early 1896 as part of its Pioneer Series. In 1982, W. W. Norton & Company published a version of the novel based on Crane's original 1894 manuscript of 55,000 words. Edited by Henry Binder, this version is questioned by those who believe Crane made the original edits for the 1895 Appleton edition on his own accord. Since its initial publication, the novel has never <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of print.|$|E
5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} has <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of our lives, {{and there is}} {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite {{know what to tell}} you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E

5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on {{his head in the}} end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith is a 1945 book by Fawn McKay Brodie, {{the first}} {{important}} non-hagiographic biography of Joseph Smith, {{the founder of}} Latter Day Saint movement. The book has not <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of print, and 60 years after its first publication, its publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, continues to sell about a thousand copies annually. A revised edition appeared in 1971, and on the 50th anniversary of its first publication, Utah State University issued a volume of retrospective essays about the book, its author, and her methods.|$|E
5|$|While {{initially}} {{released in}} Europe {{as a bonus}} disc for {{a special edition of}} Youthanasia, Hidden Treasures was released as a stand-alone EP in Japan and the US on July 18, 1995.

It also appeared on album charts in the UK and Japan, but did not achieve notable success. The album has <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of print in the US, but was reissued in 2007 for the Japanese and European markets.|$|E

5|$|Zimmer wrote {{several hours}} of music, and an {{abundance}} of different themes, before Malick started to shoot the film. The director played the music on the set, while filming, to get himself, {{and the rest of}} the crew and actors in the right frame of mind. The official soundtrack features tracks that were not used on the film and some tracks from the film are not found on the CD. The film features several pieces of Melanesian choral music sung by the Choir of All Saints in Honiara, only one of which is featured on the soundtrack. However, another soundtrack was released containing several tracks from the Choir, which has since <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of circulation.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating Thomas's move, Michael had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> at {{the head}} of an army to the themes of Thrace and Macedonia in Constantinople's European {{hinterland}} and strengthened the garrisons of several fortresses there to secure the loyalty of their populace. When Thomas landed, the people of the European themes welcomed him with enthusiasm, and Michael was forced to withdraw to Constantinople. Volunteers, including many Slavs, flocked to Thomas's banner. As he set out towards Constantinople, chroniclers recount that his army swelled to some 80,000 men. The capital was defended by the imperial tagmata, augmented by reinforcements from the Opsician and Armeniac themes. Michael had ordered the city walls to be repaired, and chained off the entrance to the Golden Horn, while the Imperial Fleet further guarded the capital from the sea. Nevertheless, judging from Michael's passive stance, his forces were inferior to Thomas's; Warren Treadgold estimates Michael's army to have numbered approximately 35,000 men.|$|E
