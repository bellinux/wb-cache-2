40|$|For {{individuals}} with vision-touch synaesthesia, {{the sight of}} touch on another person elicits synaesthetic tactile sensation on the observer's own body. Here we used the traditional rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998) and a no-touch rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm to investigate and to authenticate synaesthetic tactile sensation. In the traditional rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm, the participant views a prosthetic <b>hand</b> being touched by the Examiner while the participant's <b>hand</b> - hidden from view - is also touched by the Examiner. Synchronous stimulation of the prosthetic <b>hand</b> and the participant's hidden <b>hand</b> elicits the rubber <b>hand</b> illusion. It may seem to the participant that she is feeling touch {{at the location of}} the viewed prosthetic <b>hand</b> - visual capture of touch, and that the prosthetic <b>hand</b> is the participant's own <b>hand</b> - illusion of ownership. Thus, for participants who experience the traditional rubber <b>hand</b> illusion, tactile sensation on the participant's hidden <b>hand</b> is referred to the prosthetic <b>hand.</b> In our no-touch rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm, the participant views a prosthetic <b>hand</b> being touched by the Examiner but the participant's <b>hand</b> - hidden from view - is not touched by the Examiner. Questionnaire ratings indicated that only {{individuals with}} vision-touch synaesthesia experienced the no-touch rubber <b>hand</b> illusion. Thus, synaesthetic tactile sensation on the (untouched) hidden <b>hand</b> was referred to the prosthetic <b>hand.</b> These individuals also demonstrated proprioceptive drift (a change, from baseline, in proprioceptively perceived position) of the hidden <b>hand</b> towards the location of the prosthetic <b>hand,</b> and a pattern of increased proprioceptive drift with increased trial duration (60 sec, 180 sec, 300 sec). The no-touch rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm was an excellent method to authenticate vision-touch synaesthesia because participants were naïve about the rubber <b>hand</b> illusion, and they could not have known how they were expected to perform on either the traditional or the no-touch rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm...|$|R
