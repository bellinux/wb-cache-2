50|$|Seamounts accreted {{in eastern}} Australia {{as parts of}} the New England orogen reveal the hotspot history of Panthalassa. From the Late Devonian to the Carboniferous Gondwana and Panthalassa converged along the eastern margin of Australia along a west-dipping {{subduction}} system which produced (west to east) a magmatic arc, a fore-arc basin, and an accretionary wedge. Subduction ceased along this margin in the Late Carboniferous and jumped eastward. From the Late Carboniferous to the Early Permian the New England orogen was dominated by an extensional setting related to a subduction to strike-slip transition. Subduction was re-initiated in the Permian and the granitic rocks of the New England Batholith were produced by a magmatic arc, indicating {{the presence of an}} active plate margin along most of the orogen. Permian to Cretaceous remains of this convergent margin, preserved as fragments in Zealandia (New Zealand, New Caledonia, and the Lord Howe Rise), were rifted off Australia during the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary break-up of eastern Gondwana and the opening of the Tasman Sea.The Cretaceous <b>Junction</b> <b>Plate,</b> located north of Australia, separated the eastern Tethys from Panthalassa.|$|E
40|$|The {{physiology}} of smooth muscle and endothelial cells {{of a particular}} vascular bed and from different species differs from each other. Acetylcholine causes an endothelium-dependent relaxation of preconstricted pulmonary arteries from the rat. This relaxation is mediated by nitric oxide (NO) plus a yet-unidentified endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, which relaxes the smooth muscles by hyperpolarizing them. Our aim is to test whether these observations could be generalized to the smooth muscle cells from the mouse pulmonary artery. Smooth muscle or endothelial cell membrane potential of strips of murine pulmonary artery were measured simultaneously with the force developed by the strip. Acetylcholine hyperpolarized the endothelial cells. However, acetylcholine did not induce an endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle, while it relaxed the strip in an endothelium-dependent manner. This relaxation was abolished by an inhibitor of NO synthesis, nitro-L-arginine. Moreover, nitroglycerin relaxed the strips without changing the membrane potential of the smooth muscle cells. Injection of Lucifer yellow into the endothelial cells and the smooth muscle cells did not show heterocellular dye coupling. Furthermore, electron microscopy did not show gap <b>junction</b> <b>plate</b> at the myoendothelial junctions. We conclude that in the mouse main pulmonary artery, NO alone {{is responsible for the}} acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, whereas the phenomenon called endothelium-derived hyperpolizing factor is not present. Therefore, caution should be taken when comparing different animal models to study pulmonary circulation and its reactivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} {{property of}} a planar tunnel junction with thin-film diffusive plates and long enough leads {{is an essential}} enhancement of its transmission coefficient compared to the bare transparency of the tunnel barrier [1, 2]. In voltage-biased junctions, this creates favorable conditions for strong nonequilibrium of quasiparticles in the <b>junction</b> <b>plates</b> and leads, produced by multiparticle tunneling. We study theoretically the interplay between the nonequilibrium and relaxation processes in such junctions and found that nonequilibrium in the leads noticeably modifies the currentvoltage characteristic at eV > 2 D, especially the excess current, whereas strong diffusive relaxation restores {{the result of the}} classical tunnel model. At eV > 2 D, the diffusive relaxation decreases the peaks of the multiparticle currents. The inelastic relaxation in the <b>junction</b> <b>plates</b> essentially suppresses the n-particle currents (n > 2) by the factor n for odd and n 2 for even n.

Here we present a combined analysis of InSAR and GPS derived strain maps and seismicity to understand the tectonics of the current Afar triple <b>junction</b> <b>plate</b> boundary zone. Our results show that that the plate spreading motion is accommodated in different ways in the Red Sea Rift after jumping southeastward along the Gulf of Aden Rift. At the Red Sea Rift, extension and shear are coupled with seismicity, occurring both along-rift but also in areas off-rift. In the Gulf of Aden Rift extension and normal faulting occur in the central parts of the rifts while at the rifts tips strike-slip earthquakes are observed. The extensional strains occur over a broad zone encompassing several overlapping rifts. Conversely the strike-slip earthquakes are focused along a narrow EW trending lineament. The pattern suggests that {{the recent history of}} magmatic intrusions in the Red Sea Rift still dominates the plate boundary deformation inducing earthquakes even in areas off-rift and with no previous faults mapped. On the other hand, in the Gulf of Aden Rift our strain and seismicity maps are consistent mainly with extensional tectonics occurring over an exceptionally broad zone (over 200 km). We interpret the strike-slip earthquakes observed at the rift tips as the result of shearing at the rifts tips where the extension terminates against continental lithosphere...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Paleozoic-early Mesozoic geology of Tibet was {{controlled}} by the rift-drift, seafloor spreading and subduction zone tectonics of a Paleo-Tethyan realm, which evolved between the West Cathaysides (WC) and the East Cimmerides (EC). Different suture zones with ophiolites and ophiolitic mélanges, high-pressure metamorphic belts, magmatic arcs and accretionary prism complexes separating different terranes mark multiple subduction-accretion systems within this Paleo-Tethyan domain, reminiscent of the modern Western Pacific Ocean. Discrete basins separated by different continental blocks and magmatic arcs constituted a complex paleogeography of Paleo-Tethys, and these oceanic strands were closed {{as a result of}} subduction with different polarities during the late Paleozoic-Triassic. The Longmu Tso Shuanghu-Changning Menglian Suture zone (LS-CMS) in Tibet represents the main tectonic boundary between the WC and EC that developed in the Devonian. The East Kunlun-A’nyemaqen oceanic slab was subducted northward beneath the East Kunlun terrane in northern Tibet, whereas the Sumdo oceanic slab was subducted northward beneath the South Qiangtang-North Lhasa terrane in southern Tibet. The Longmu Tso Shuanghu-Changning Menglian and Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan-Song Ma ophiolites were developed and emplaced in subduction-accretion systems with opposite polarities (westward and eastward) beneath the North Qiangtang-Qamdo-Simao-Indochina terrane in central Tibet. The Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan-Song Ma oceanic slab was subducted westward beneath the North Qiangtang-Simao-Indochina terrane along the Jinshajiang and Ailaoshan-Song Ma trenches in a trench-ridge-trench triple <b>junction</b> <b>plate</b> configuration.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Nighttime Solar Cell ™ is to produce electric power at night. The cell {{can be used to}} complement daytime photovoltaic electrical energy production, or as a stand-alone device can produce electrical power both night and day in low-wattage applications. The Nighttime Solar Cell ™ op-erates with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) utilizing the ambient or its surroundings as the source of thermal energy while deep space provides a thermal sink. The cold junctions of the TEG are insulated from the surroundings with a vacuum to improve overall effec-tiveness. The Cold <b>Junction</b> <b>Plate</b> (CJP) inside the cell links the TEG's cold junctions to the thermal sink, acting as a heat spreader (HTS) to increase the heat flux from the device. The thermal model describing the operation of the cell has been enhanced to inves-tigate different configurations for the HTS. For this application, the HTS utilizes radiation heat transfer to reject the waste heat to the thermal sink. A simple one-dimensional model is used to investigate the effect of the HTS geometry on the cell. Typically used in high power electronic heat dissipation, here the HTS allows for a greater influence by the thermal sink to increase cell output. Data for two-dimensional, radiatively cooled HTSs is presented, comparing cylindrical and rectangular geometries. The TEG module is modelled as a heat source {{in the center of the}} HTS. The results show that for typical Nighttime Solar Cell ™ thermal systems, square TEG modules can be modeled as cylindrical to match round heat spreaders with little loss of accuracy. The analysis also shows that the HTS thickness is favorable for using copper CJPs to increase the heat transfer to deep space while reducing the mechanical stress on the TEGs. Also, projected performance of a prototype cell currently being built illustrates the effectiveness of high junction density modules for future cell development...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model to {{describe}} an underdamped long Josephson junction coupled to a singlemode electromagnetic cavity, and carry out numerical calculations using this model in various regimes. The coupling may occur through either the electric or the magnetic eld of the cavity mode. When a current is injected into the junction, we nd that the time-averaged voltage exhibits self-induced resonant steps due to coupling between the current in the junction and the electric eld of the cavity mode. These steps {{are similar to those}} observed and calculated in small Josephson junctions. When a soliton is present in the junction (corresponding to a quantum of magnetic ux parallel to the <b>junction</b> <b>plates),</b> the SIRS's disappear if the electric eld in the cavity is spatially uniform. If the cavity mode has a spatially varying electric eld, there is a strong coupling between the soliton and the cavity mode. This coupling causes the soliton to become phase-locked to the cavity mode, and produces step-like anomalies on the soliton branch of the IV characteristics. If the coupling is strong enough, the frequency of the cavity mode is greatly red-shifted from its uncoupled value. We present simple geometrical arguments which account for this behavior.

40|$|It {{is obvious}} {{that there are two}} kinds of motor units, tonic and kinetic, in the neuromuscular system {{following}} studies of many recent workers. It is not easy to differentiate them with routine EMG. In this study, it is shown that the kinetic unit contains more high frequency components than the tonic one in the EMG and an effort is made to differentiate them with a new technique with high cut filter which eliminates harmonies in the EMG. Twenty two dogs were used for fundamental experiments and the results were follows. 1) EMG spiks which are induced by cortical stimulation on the motor area with 40 p. s. stimuli shows much more high frequency components than that of 20 p. s. stimuli. This indicates that the kinetic motor unit contains more high frequency components than the tonic one in the EMG as it was proved by other worker that the EMG induced by cortical stimulation with 40 p. s. stimuli is kinetic motor unit and with 20 p. s. stimuli is tonic motor unit. 2) When the peripheral nerve is stimulated with submaximal intensity at the rate of 20 p. s. stimuli, the kinetic motor unit shows a quick remarkable waning in the amplitude and after that tonic motor unit takes over. 3) Curare affects on the nerve-muscle <b>junction</b> (end <b>plate)</b> of the tonic motor unit. 4) Succinyl choline chloride affects on the nerve-muscle <b>junction</b> (end <b>plate)</b> of the kinetic motor unit...|$|R

40|$|Local {{buckling}} {{is a major}} {{consideration in}} the design of thin-walled cold-formed steel sections. The main effect of local buckling in plate elements under longitudinal compressive stresses is to cause a redistribution of the stresses in which the greatest portion of the load is carried near the supporting edges of the <b>plate</b> <b>junctions.</b> The redistribution produces increased stresses near the <b>plate</b> <b>junctions</b> and high bending stresses as a result of plate flexure, leading to ultimate loads below the squash load of the section. In singly symmetric cross-sections, the redistribution of longitudinal stress caused by local buckling also produces a shift of the line of action of internal force (shift of effective centroid). The fundamentally different effects of local buckling on the behaviour of pin-ended and fixed-ended singly symmetric columns lead to inconsistencies in traditional design approaches. The paper describes local buckling and shift of effective centroid of thin-walled cold-formed steel channel columns. Tests of channel columns have been described. The experimental local buckling loads were compared with the theoretical local buckling loads obtained using an elastic finite strip buckling analysis. The shift of the effective centroid was also compared with the shift predicted using the Australian/New Zealand and American specifications for cold-formed steel structures. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

This suggested that the notochord might suppress, or the prechordal plate might enhance, the cardiogenic fate. Nkx 2. 5 expression is, in the zebrafish embryo, closely correlated with the position of myocardial precursors, which reside adjacent to the notochord–prechordal <b>plate</b> <b>junction.</b> This expression, however, is extinguished in the region posterior to this junction, a region normally not contributing cells to the heart. Laser ablation of the notochord tip between the 4 -somite and 12 -somite stage causes posterior expansion of theNkx 2. 5 -expressing region. Thentlmutation of the notochord is associated with posterior extension ofNkx 2. 5 expression. Lineage tracking, by laser activation of caged fluoresceinated dextran, confirms that, normally, lateral plate cells next to the notochord do not contribute progeny to the heart. After anterior notochord ablation, these cells are redirected to a heart cell fate.
