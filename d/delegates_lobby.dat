50|$|The Democratic Party {{referred}} {{the challenge}} to the Convention Credentials Committee. The MFDP <b>delegates</b> <b>lobbied</b> and argued their case, and large groups of supporters and volunteers established an around-the-clock picket line on the boardwalk just outside the convention. Their actions attracted considerable publicity.|$|R
25|$|Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Sweden {{expressed}} interest in hosting the tournament. Swedish <b>delegates</b> <b>lobbied</b> other countries at the FIFA Congress held in Rio de Janeiro around {{the opening of the}} 1950 World Cup finals. Sweden was awarded the 1958 tournament unopposed on 23 June 1950.|$|R
50|$|The State Bar {{was slow}} {{to comply with the}} Keller, decision, {{resulting}} in a follow-up lawsuit in 1991 brought by the second-named plaintiff in Keller, Raymond L. Brosterhous, and 40 other attorneys who objected to the Bar’s continued use of their dues for political and ideological activities. This litigation eventually resulted in a court order that the Bar’s Conference of <b>Delegates,</b> <b>lobbying,</b> special activities designed to promote the careers of women and minorities, and other social and political programs could not constitutionally be funded by compulsory Bar dues.|$|R
500|$|The Indiana {{constitution}} prevented Marshall {{from serving}} a consecutive term as governor. He {{made plans to}} run for a United States Senate seat after his term ended, but another opportunity presented itself during his last months as governor. Although he {{did not attend the}} 1912 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, his name was put forward as Indiana's choice for president. [...] He was suggested as a compromise nominee, but William Jennings Bryan and his delegates endorsed Woodrow Wilson over Champ Clark, securing the nomination for Wilson. Indiana's <b>delegates</b> <b>lobbied</b> to have Marshall named the vice presidential candidate in exchange for supporting Wilson. Indiana was an important swing state, and Wilson hoped that Marshall's popularity would help him carry it in the general election. [...] He had his delegates support Marshall, giving him the vice presidential nomination. Marshall privately turned down the nomination, assuming the job would be boring given its limited role. He changed his mind after Wilson assured him that he would be given plenty of responsibilities. During the campaign, Marshall traveled across the United States delivering speeches. The Wilson–Marshall ticket easily won the 1912 election because of the division between the Republican Party and the Progressive Party.|$|R
50|$|Voting {{continued}} the following day, 17 October 2006. After the small gifts of chocolate (Venezuela) and cotton bracelets (Guatemala) distributed among the <b>delegates</b> on Monday, <b>lobbying</b> {{for the second}} day of voting was assisted by brightly coloured bookmarks (Venezuela) and a pamphlet stating its position that was distributed to the U.N. members (Guatemala).|$|R
2500|$|During the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a {{delegate}} from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization {{under the auspices}} of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the Secretary General of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organisation. Sze and other <b>delegates</b> <b>lobbied</b> and a declaration passed calling for an international conference on health. The use of the word [...] "world", rather than [...] "international", emphasised the truly global nature of what the organisation was seeking to achieve. The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946. It thus became the first specialised agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed. Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state. The first meeting of the World Health Assembly finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of [...] (then [...] ) for the 1949 year. Andrija Stampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed Director-General of WHO, having served as Executive Secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Its first legislative act was concerning the compilation of accurate statistics on the spread and morbidity of disease. The logo of the World Health Organization features the Rod of Asclepius as a symbol for healing.|$|R
5000|$|The ASU Vice President Academic {{serves the}} ASU in Academic matters and acts [...] "as a liaison between the Union and {{the offices of}} the University Vice President Academic, the Registrar, Admissions, Student Accounts, Financial Aid, Career Services, the Learning Commons, and the Student Resource Centre”. They also {{represent}} the union as the Acadia <b>delegate</b> for external <b>lobbying</b> organizations. The Vice President Academic from Acadia during 2012-2013, Kyle Power, served as chairperson of StudentsNS as part of filling these duties.|$|R
500|$|Humphrey {{entered the}} race {{too late to}} {{participate}} in any primaries, and relied on [...] "favorite son" [...] candidates to help him win <b>delegates.</b> He also <b>lobbied</b> for endorsements from powerful bosses within the Democratic Party, which provided him with necessary delegates. This traditional approach was criticized by the other candidates, who hoped {{to win the nomination}} from popular support. Robert Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968, leaving McCarthy as his only opponent, until the 1968 Democratic National Convention, when Senator George McGovern of South Dakota ran as the successor of Kennedy. Humphrey won the party's nomination at the Convention on the first ballot, amid riots in Chicago. He selected little-known Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine as his running mate.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} gave Menda 7000 yen {{for every}} day he was in prison: 90 million yen in total (approximately 2009 USD $990,540). He donated half of that to a group campaigning to abolish the death penalty. Menda has since become death-penalty abolitionist. Japan is {{the only member of}} the Group of Seven industrialised nations other than the United States to retain capital punishment. Menda spoke at the 2007 World Congress against the death penalty, and has <b>lobbied</b> <b>delegates</b> of the United Nations to globally abolish capital punishment, describing the psychological and dehumanising effects that he encountered while on death row. The scandal in the aftermath of Menda's release prompted reform and aided a reintroduction of jury trials in Japan, as well as showing the Japanese legal system's over-reliance on conviction by means of confession.|$|R
5000|$|Relations with {{official}} [...] "peace" [...] {{groups in}} those countries were tricky, and the Czech government tried to incorporate the initiative into their showpiece pro-Warsaw Pact 1983 conference in Prague - however the group did not partake, although a few members <b>lobbied</b> <b>delegates</b> outside, and were invited in for one discussion). Walking across the USSR was not permitted however. The group entered and transited to Minsk, then Smolensk, hoping for some compromise in negotiations, but this did not happen. At this point many of the members chose to return, and not go to Moscow; the others tried to walk to Moscow anyway, but were immediately apprehended and sent to rejoin the others in Minsk. Some members went to Denmark to join in with peace groups {{and talk about the}} walk. When the walk finished some people from the group talked at a CND rally about their work and the passive resistance movement. The group membership was international, people came {{from all over the world}} to join in and make a difference.|$|R
50|$|The Second Congress, held in 1925, had a {{different}} flavor, as it brought together various church interests and was attended by President Gerardo Machado. Jorge de Tella spoke in favor of birth control causing a fissue with the feminist movement and the Catholic Community. Machaco had promised to make women's suffrage part of the constitution, though he remained inactive until 1927. With growing government unrest, he decided to add enfranchisement {{to a list of}} reforms he wanted, but the legislature rejected universal suffrage. Feminists formed the Committee for the Defense of Women’s Suffrage (Comité de Defensa del Sufragio Femenino) (CDSF) and began <b>lobbying</b> <b>delegates</b> directly. In January, 1928, the Pan-American Conference was held in Havana. Jorge de Tella and Doris Stevens spoke at the rally of women delegates representing the 21 countries of the Americas. Around 200 participants marched to demand suffrage before President Machado and the delegates of the 6th Pan-American Union. Later that year in September, at the Inter-American Commission of Women presentation to the Pan American Union, Jorge de Tella spoke along with Stevens and other delegates of the problems associated with women losing their citizenship upon marriage.|$|R
5000|$|Indeed, {{even before}} the treaty was {{publicly}} released, tobacco industry representatives embarked upon {{a concerted effort to}} thwart the efforts of FCTC drafters, in addition to participating policy-makers from individual WHO member states. Unable to argue against the overwhelming scientific evidence about tobacco's harmful health effects, the tobacco industry seized upon the FCTC's potential for economic harm. In response to the World Bank's CTE,the industry made a number of attempts to discredit the report, especially through the public relations efforts of the International Tobacco Growers' Association (ITGA) and by employing non-World Bank economists to release their own analyses. Between 4-16 March of the year 2000, the ITGA, financed by the tobacco industry, set out on what they dubbed a [...] "Roadshow," [...] during which ITGA representatives spoke to policy-makers in the developing countries of India, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, in addition to two [...] "mini-Roadshows" [...] in Argentina and Brazil, in order to voice ITGA opposition to the FCTC {{on the grounds that the}} CTE had underestimated the threat that tobacco control would pose to developing economies. Once negotiations for the FCTC were underway, the tobacco industry again made attempts to lessen the blow of international legislation on their business by <b>lobbying</b> <b>delegates</b> at the convention in Geneva. According to Mamudu, Hammond, and Glantz, however, [...] "these efforts... did not undermine acceptance of CTE during the FCTC negotiations and CTE remained an authoritative economic analysis of global tobacco control." ...|$|R
