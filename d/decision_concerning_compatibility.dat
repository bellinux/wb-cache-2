Considering the {{uncertainty}} of maintainability design factors and the fuzzy preference information in evaluation values, an evaluation and decision-making method of maintainability was proposed. The linguistic assessment values of maintainability design factors were converted to trapezoid fuzzy numbers by fuzzy set theory, and decision weights under fuzzy preference were given based on maximizing deviation method. Then, evaluation model of maintainability design was established, and confidence index of evaluating decision was given. At last, a case study was given and {{the result showed that}} the method is reasonable and effective for maintainability evaluation. Intorduction Maintainability is a significant characteristic of product that can make maintenance convenient, fast and economical, and design is the stage at which the maintainability of product is almost determined. In the context of concurrent engineering, designers should take maintainability into account during their work. It is important to evaluate maintainability in the early design phase and make <b>decisions</b> <b>concerning</b> the <b>compatibility</b> of a proposed design with specified maintenance requirements or the choice of better alternatives. A series of basic procedures and methods of maintainability prediction are specified in GJB/Z 57 - 1994 [1]. However, information required by most of these methods is no...|$|R

40|$|The {{difficulty}} of decision - making by {{women who are}} widows compared to when they were wives was studied. The areas of decision-making that were rated as to difficult concerned family finance, child care, homemaking (family foods, clothing, home furnishings, and housing), social activities, and yard and car care. The sample consisted of 33 widows living in Logan, Utah during Spring Quarter, 1971. The subjects {{had at least one}} child living at home and had been widowed at least one year. The instruments used were: (l) a background questionnaire, and (2) a decision-making questionnaire. The statistical test used for analysis was the sign (binomial) test. <b>Decisions</b> <b>concerning</b> family finance, child care, cleaning and upkeep of the home, and yard care were more difficult for the women as widows than such decisions had been for them as wives. <b>Decisions</b> <b>concerning</b> food, clothing, and home furnishings were not more difficult for the women as widows. <b>Decisions</b> <b>concerning</b> washing the car were not more difficult, while decisions about maintenance, servicing, and repairs for the car were more difficult for the women as widows. <b>Decisions</b> <b>concerning</b> social activities that are often done as individuals, not couples, were not more difficult for the women as widows. <b>Decisions</b> <b>concerning</b> those social activities that couples often participate in were more difficult for the women as widows than such decisions had been for them as wives...|$|R
