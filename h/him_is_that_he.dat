5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{statistics}} for Shock White's career {{and all that}} is definitely known of <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was active between 1761 and 1773.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversial}} but undeniably important historical figure, reviled by {{many and}} followed almost blindly by others, Juan Lechín Oquendo died in August 2001, {{at the age}} of 87. A major criticism used against <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> tended to de-stabilize precisely those regimes that were friendliest to the interests of the working class (Paz Estenssoro, Torres, Siles Zuazo between 1982 and 1985), while being quite deferential to the most hardline right-wing governments (Barrientos, Banzer, Garcia Mesa), at least until he could get safely out of the country.|$|E
50|$|Mordetzky {{claims that}} the biggest {{misconception}} that most people have about <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> just a bodybuilder.|$|R
60|$|What perplexed <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt {{a curious}} {{physical}} distaste, {{which made it}} uncomfortable for <b>him</b> to <b>be</b> near her.|$|R
2500|$|Booth died in December 1925. On his passing, Michael Grattan O'Leary of the Ottawa Journal {{noted that}} what people should {{remember}} about <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was: ...|$|R
500|$|Embedded in the Primary Chronicle is a eulogy to Prince Yaropolk, {{and among}} the honors {{assigned}} to <b>him,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{in the habit of}} assigning a [...] "tenth part of his wealth to the Mother of God". Probably due to his personal devotion to the papacy and to St Peter, Yaropolk established a new church of St Peter at the monastery of St Demetrios in the city of Kiev. He was said to have left all his wealth to the Monastery of the Caves in Kiev. The Primary Chronicle's eulogy is the first indication of saintly regard, and indeed today he is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with his feast day falling on the reported day of his death, November 22.|$|E
2500|$|Robin Baldrick, {{the medieval}} Baldrick's father. All {{that is known}} about <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a dung gatherer. He is never seen and is only {{mentioned}} once, in the opening credits of The Black Seal when the narrator referred to Baldrick as [...] "Baldrick, Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first that}} is known about <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became a freeman of the Leathersellers Company in January 1623, having served an eight- or nine-year apprenticeship. He was elected a warden of the yeomanry of the leather-sellers in 1630, and a liveryman in 1634. In [...] 1630 he married his wife Sarah, with whom he would {{have at least one}} son, Nicholas Barbon.|$|E
6000|$|They {{remained}} so, face to face; {{the effect}} of which for <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had after a little understood why. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> fundamental. [...] "Well, I see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 73: Very unpoetically designated. Agis {{might as}} well have been left out, if all <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> said of <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "not the last of Spartan names."--BOWLES.|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary, he was {{singularly}} taciturn. All that I {{could gather}} from <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> returning to fulfill some purpose {{which he had}} kept before him for a great many years." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rama {{iconography}} shares {{elements of}} Vishnu avatars, but has several distinctive elements. It never {{has more than}} two hands, he holds (or has nearby) a bana (arrow) in his right hand, while he holds the dhanus (bow) in his left. The most recommended icon for <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> be shown standing in tribhanga pose (thrice bent [...] "S" [...] shape). He is shown black, blue or dark color, typically wearing reddish color clothes. If his wife and brother {{are a part of}} the iconography, Lakshamana is on his left side while Sita always on the right of Rama, both of golden-yellow complexion.|$|E
2500|$|Jim Burke: Burke was {{an opening}} batsman whose {{occasional}} off spin bowling brought him 12 Test wickets (28.75) and whose action was likened to a policeman hitting a small offender with a truncheon. He was no-balled for throwing in grade cricket and Benaud {{was reluctant to}} use him in the Tests. E.W. Swanton wrote [...] "I am sorry that the chief memory of <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the worst chucker I ever saw bowl, bracketed equal with Meckiff and the South African, Griffen: that {{and the memory of}} his piano playing - off the field in fact no one was better company". Even his own Sydney crowd shouted [...] "give him a coconut" [...] when he hit the stumps with his bowling ...|$|E
2500|$|The baptism of Jesus and his crucifixion are {{considered}} to be two historically certain facts about Jesus. James Dunn states that these [...] "two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent" [...] and [...] "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts" [...] that they are often the starting points {{for the study of the}} historical Jesus. Bart Ehrman states that the crucifixion of Jesus on the orders of Pontius Pilate is the most certain element about him. John Dominic Crossan states that the crucifixion of Jesus is as certain as any historical fact can be. Eddy and Boyd state that it is now [...] "firmly established" [...] that there is non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus. Craig Blomberg states that most scholars in the third quest for the historical Jesus consider the crucifixion indisputable. Christopher M. Tuckett states that, although the exact reasons for the death of Jesus are hard to determine, one of the indisputable facts about <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was crucified.|$|E
60|$|He sat {{and looked}} at her, coldly. What she liked about <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> spoke to her simple and flat, as to himself. He was a fellow craftsman, a fellow being to her, first.|$|R
50|$|Professor Johnathan Shakeshaft (John Rogan) - The {{oldest member}} of staff, teaches (and forgets) {{various types of}} magic but {{spends most of his}} time asleep.

50|$|Julaybib's lineage {{was unknown}} {{and there is}} no record of his parents or what tribe he belonged to. All <b>that</b> <b>was</b> known of <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an Arab and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> one of the Ansar in Medina.|$|R
60|$|The {{best that}} we can say of <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wrote imperfectly in Australia those poems that in England he might have made perfect.|$|E
6000|$|... "My chief object {{as regards}} <b>him,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should {{not think that}} I have been looking after her money. Well; good-bye. I suppose we shall all meet at dinner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{exactly the}} opinion of him which he deserves," [...] she said bitterly; [...] "and my opinion of <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is one of the}} wickedest men in England." ...|$|E
60|$|It was stimulating. The {{probability}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> all Jerry Nichols {{wanted to}} tell <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had received stable information about some horse or {{had been given a}} box for the Empire, but for all <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> stimulating.|$|R
6000|$|... "He didn't {{send for}} me," [...] {{answered}} Austen, quietly, [...] "and I {{have no business}} dealings with him except small suits. What I did tell <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would never get the bill through this session or next by lobbying." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dr. Galvin {{shook his}} head. [...] "The last news I heard of <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> sent to Boston or New Haven. This secret {{service for the}} enemy must hamper him a lot, but it's better than lying in a refuge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you mistake {{my husband}} altogether!" [...] cried Mrs. Archibald. [...] "The trouble with <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has too much}} spirit, {{and that is the}} reason I brought him away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{may look}} absurd," [...] said the Prince, in his quiet voice; [...] "but {{he is an}} {{excellent}} Sorcerer. The only fault I find with <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is so often wrong." ...|$|E
60|$|Wood. The worst I know of <b>him</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> loves a wench; {{and that}} good quality {{he has not}} stolen. [Music at the Balcony over head: Mrs TRICKSY and JUDITH appear.]--Hark! There's music above.|$|E
60|$|Bob, {{to the end}} of his life, {{declared}} that--although in {{all things}} he had been an exceptionally happy, and fortunate man--the most fortunate occurrence that ever happened to <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should have taken part in the famous Siege of Gibraltar.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I Gellner was recruited to the Austro-Hungarian army and went to Galicia. The last report about <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> relaxing on a path between Zamość and Tomaszów. On September 13, 1914 he was claimed missing and never found.|$|R
50|$|He was {{subjected}} to a juicio de residencia, or trial of grievances. The accusations against <b>him</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> dealt rudely with soldiers, opened other people's correspondence, granted special favors to the relatives of his wife, played games of chance, persecuted two clergymen, and was not religious.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Giles laughed. [...] "Arthur in danger!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "As {{harmless}} a {{young man}} as ever lived. The worst one can say of <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is throwing away his money--farming in Kerry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor yet mad doctors," [...] said Olivia. [...] "Well, I {{like him}} very much; {{and the only}} thing against <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should have a man, six feet high, going about with him doing nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My husband, your stepfather, has not escaped; {{he is in}} {{the prison}} still, for there I have just bidden him farewell, and the {{sentence}} upon <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> shall be starved to death in a cell overlooking the kitchen." ...|$|E
50|$|When Uthman {{was called}} to account for his {{mismanagement}} as Caliph, one of the grievances against <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had destroyed variant readings of the Qur'an. Much later, Abdullah ibn Masud's variant readings were discussed on equal terms with the Uthmanic text by al-Farra (d. 207/822).|$|R
6000|$|The only {{obstacle}} to reciprocity with <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> looked in advance so {{closely related to}} all one's possibilities that one missed the pleasure of really improving it. [...] "Oh no, you're extremely difficult to treat. I've need with you, I assure you, of all my wit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Kill my dear little dog, who {{had been}} my playfellow {{since he was a}} puppy?' exclaimed he. 'Oh, never would I allow that.'
