50|$|The {{hydraulic}} load on {{this type of}} spillway gate (Tainter gate) is transmitted from the cylindrical skin plate, which is {{in contact with the}} reservoir, through a number of struts to a convergence at the trunnion hub. The hub collects the load from the struts and transfers it across an interface to the trunnion pin, which is stationary and is connected to the dam. When the gate is operated, the hub rotates around the pin. The struts are primarily compression members, but friction at the pin-hub interface induces a bending stress during gate operation. Typically, and in this case, the struts are oriented such that the trunnion <b>friction</b> <b>stress</b> is applied to the weak axis of the struts (see Section modulus). In order to better handle these loads, the struts are connected with diagonal braces that take the stress as axial loads. At Folsom Dam, increasing corrosion at the pin-hub interface had raised the coefficient of friction and, therefore, the bending stress in the strut and the axial force in the brace. The capacity of the brace connection was exceeded and it failed. This caused the load to redistribute and the failure progressed, eventually buckling the struts.|$|E

In this study, we analyse such thermal stress, plastic slip deformation and accumulation of dislocations in STI (Shallow Trench Isolation) type ULSI devices when the temperature drops from the initial at 1000 ℃ to room temperature. For the analysis, we use a crystal plasticity analysis code CLP, assuming that lattice <b>friction</b> <b>stress</b> for the movement of dislocations is proportional to the hardness of silicon, which is known to have strong dependency on temperature.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{demonstrates}} a new method {{to extract the}} <b>friction</b> <b>stress</b> τ from measurements in wire drawing. It is based on simultaneous measurement of drawing force and die temperature; an analytical thermo-mechanical model of the wire drawing operation is used to separate the plastic work Wpl from the frictional work. Thanks to the exploitation of the temperature measurement, the necessity to know the stress-strain curve of the drawn metal beforehand is avoided. This new approach is compared with the more traditional one, in which only the force is measured and friction is extracted by inverse modelling using an experimentally determined stress-strain curve. Drawing experiments have been performed on stainless steel wire, using dies in which thermocouples have been inserted. The linearity of the measured drawing stress-measured die temperature relation is a first confirmation of the model.
