The temple interior {{is a dark}} labyrinth of chapels, illuminated by votive candles and filled with incense. Although portions of the temple has been rebuilt, original elements remain. The wooden beams and rafters have been shown by carbon dating to be original, and the Newari <b>door</b> <b>frames,</b> columns and finials dating to the seventh and eighth centuries were brought from the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, <b>door</b> <b>frames,</b> {{and interior}} doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling. An open, double staircase leads {{from the first}} floor to {{the second and third}} floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which moves from the basement to the third floor. The interior floors are all white pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the ceilings lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the design of <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> curvature, meant for rail vehicle. Flat glass is adhesively bonded onto the curved <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> and due to the elastic {{deformation}} the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> bends backwards. Hence the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> must be bend with reserve so that the elastic deformation is covered. Finite element analysis of currently manufactured door with constant curvatere has been carried out, with this analysis it has been checked that the chosen problem approach is suitable. Design of <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> curvature is then made for <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> with combined curvature (different for lower and upper part of <b>door</b> <b>frame).</b> The aim of this thesis was to design the curvature so that after glass is bonded onto it, the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> will have the right dimensions...|$|R

25|$|Boudin {{oversaw the}} {{installation}} {{of art in the}} Red Room as well. Boudin preferred a French design aesthetic, which emphasized covering as much wall space as possible with paintings. This scheme was implemented early in 1961, but in early 1962 (after the walls were recovered in silk) Boudin altered this scheme. He now created two rows of paintings, one at eye-level and one above the top of the <b>door</b> <b>frames.</b> This mimicked the look of an art gallery, and was used in many French country manor-houses.|$|E
25|$|Doors {{which lead}} from interior, pressurized, {{sections}} of an aircraft to exterior or unpressurized areas can pose extreme risk {{if they are}} inadvertently opened during flight. This can be mitigated by having doors that open inwardly and {{are designed to be}} forced into their <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> by the internal cabin pressure – most cabin doors are of this type. However, an outward opening door is often advantageous for cargo doors to maximise available space, and these need to be secured by hefty locking mechanisms to overcome internal pressure.|$|E
25|$|In some {{decorative}} applications, {{wood with}} knots may be desirable to add visual interest.

25|$|Houses {{were usually}} leased for the year, {{but also for}} longer terms, rent being paid in advance, half-yearly. The {{contract}} generally specified that the house be in good repair, and the tenant was bound to keep it so. The woodwork, including doors and <b>door</b> <b>frames,</b> was removable, and the tenant might bring and take away his own. The Code stipulated that if the landlord re-entered before the term was up, he must remit a fair proportion of the rent. Land could be leased {{for the purpose of}} building houses or other buildings on it, the tenant being rent-free for eight or ten years; after which the building came into the landlord's possession.|$|E
25|$|Pure Gothic {{forms were}} mostly unsuited {{to the day}} to day {{requirements}} of residential and commercial properties; however, neo-Gothic ornamentation and principles were successfully adapted to these uses, and these structures became quite popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In rural areas the Gothic Cottage was immensely popular {{until well into the}} 20th century. Neighbourhoods that grew during this period, such as Cabbagetown and the Annex in Toronto, have many examples of houses that incorporate neo-Gothic elements. This includes a highly vertical emphasis on the structure; ornate decorations on the gables, often incorporating classic Gothic trefoil forms; and lancet windows and <b>door</b> <b>frames.</b> In rural Ontario the ubiquitous Ontario Cottage was often adorned with Gothic elements.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Italy, {{the most}} celebrated doors {{are those of the}} Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence), which {{together}} with the <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> are all in bronze, the borders of the latter being perhaps the most remarkable: the modeling of the figures, birds and foliage of the south doorway, by Andrea Pisano (1330), and of the east doorway by Ghiberti (1425–1452), are of great beauty; in the north door (1402–1424) Ghiberti adopted the same scheme of design for the paneling and figure subjects in them as Andrea Pisano, but in the east door the rectangular panels are all filled, with bas-reliefs, in which Scripture subjects are illustrated with innumerable figures, these being probably the gates of Paradise of which Michelangelo speaks.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{a stroke}} {{affecting}} the right parietal lobe {{of the brain}} can lead to neglect for {{the left side of}} the visual field, causing a patient with neglect to behave as if the left side of sensory space is nonexistent (although they can still turn left). In an extreme case, a patient with neglect might fail to eat the food on the left half of their plate, even though they complain of being hungry. If someone with neglect is asked to draw a clock, their drawing might show only the numbers 12 to 6, or all 12 numbers might be on one half of the clock face with the other half distorted or blank. Neglect patients may also ignore the contralesional side of their body; for instance, they might only shave, or apply make-up to, the non-neglected side. These patients may frequently collide with objects or structures such as <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> on the side being neglected.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the Tent Room is drawn from the original use of striped fabric draped {{on the walls and}} hung in swaths from the ceiling in order to temporarily transform what was normally the tennis court into a dining hall. The room today has a wall covering of vertically sriped red and gold fabric with a padded backing, which rises to meet the same fabric hung in a swag fashion outwards from a single coffer in the centre of the ceiling and trimmed {{around the perimeter of the}} room with a scallop edged valence of simple passementerie and tassels. This gives the space an overall resemblance to the interior of a large tent. The west wall of the room is broken by series of windows, each paired with a double door into the Long Gallery on the opposite wall, and between them a continuous frame and panel wainscotting. All this woodwork, including the <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> and other trim, is painted in a gloss white to contrast with the textured and patterned wall fabric.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} {{influence from}} the East is strangely {{shown in the}} fashion of decorating external brick walls of churches built about the 12th century, in which bricks roughly carved into form are set up {{so as to make}} bands of ornamentation which it is quite clear are imitated from Cufic writing. This fashion was associated with the disposition of the exterior brick and stone work generally into many varieties of pattern, zig-zags, key-patterns etc.; and, as similar decoration is found in many Persian buildings, it is probable that this custom also was derived from the East. The domes and vaults to the exterior were covered with lead or with tiling of the Roman variety. The window and <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> were of marble. The interior surfaces were adorned all over by mosaics or frescoes in the higher parts of the edifice, and below with incrustations of marble slabs, which were frequently of very beautiful varieties, and disposed so that, although in one surface, the coloring formed a series of large panels. The better marbles were opened out so that the two surfaces produced by the division formed a symmetrical pattern resembling somewhat the marking of skins of beasts.|$|E

50|$|A <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> can be {{built into}} the can wall, or rather the can wall is built around the frame. The process {{involves}} initially having a <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> set in place (on the foundation) and stacking cans {{to either side of}} the frame until they reach the other walls of the building and the ceiling. The <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> is fastened to the tin can wall by hammering nails partially {{into the side of the}} frame that will touch the tin can wall and allowing the concrete to harden around the nails. Short strips of metal lath are also attached to the frame and folded out (perpendicular to the frame) and allowed to set in the can/concrete matrix.|$|R

25|$|Many folk {{practices}} may be identified, {{though few}} of them are specific to the Alevis. In this connection, scholar Martin van Bruinessen notes a sign from Turkey's Ministry of Religion, attached to Istanbul's shrine of Eyüp Sultan, which presents...a long list of ‘superstitious’ practices that are emphatically declared to be non-Islamic and objectionable, such as lighting candles or placing ‘wishing stones’ on the tomb, tying pieces of cloth to the shrine or to the trees in front of it, throwing money on the tomb, asking the dead directly for help, circling seven times around {{the trees in the}} courtyard or pressing one’s face against the walls of the türbe in the hope of a supernatural cure, tying beads to the shrine and expecting supernatural support from them, sacrificing roosters or turkeys as a vow to the shrine. The list is probably an inventory of common local practices the authorities wish to prevent from re-emerging.Other, similar practices include kissing <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> of holy rooms; not stepping on the threshold of holy buildings; seeking prayers from reputed healers; and making lokma and sharing it with others.|$|E
25|$|The high rubble built {{enclosure}} is {{entered through}} two lofty double-storeyed gateways {{on the west}} and south, 16 metres high with rooms {{on either side of}} the passage and a small courtyards on the upper floors. Six-sided stars that adorn the main gateway on the west, are also seen on the iwan of the main tomb structure, though it has been used as ornamental cosmic symbol. The mosque usually present alongside royal tombs, like the Taj, is conspicuously missing from the enclosure, which has only one other structure, the tomb of Emperor's favourite barber, now commonly known as Nai ka Gumbad (Dome-of-barber). The tomb built of rubble masonry and red sandstone, uses white marble as a cladding material and also for the flooring, lattice screens (jaalis), <b>door</b> <b>frames,</b> eaves (chhajja) and for the main dome. It stands on a vaulted terrace eight-metre high and spread over 12,000m². It is essentially square in design, though chamferred on the edges to appear octagonal, to prepare ground for the design of the interior structure. The plinth made with rubble core has fifty-six cells all around, and houses over 100 gravestones. Plus, the entire base structure is on a raised platform, a few steps high.|$|E
25|$|Banashankari jatre ('jatre' means a “fair”) is held as a {{religious}} cum cultural festival, at the temple precincts every year {{on the occasion of}} the Rath yatra, for a period of about three weeks starting from the Rath yatra. Its starts on 8th day of Pushya masa. ಬನದ ಹುಣ್ಣಿಮ celebrated on full moon day. No past data is traceable confirming the beginning of such a festival, but it is inferred that it was started some two hundred years back. Pilgrims from across Karnataka and also the neighboring state of Maharashtra belonging to different religious beliefs, congregate here in large numbers to celebrate the festival. The time is considered auspicious to even fix marriages and purchase agricultural implements. Cultural programmes (music, drama and circus) are held to entertain the largely rural community who flock the venue to not only worship their favorite deity but also for fun and frolic. It symbolizes cultural bonding between people of different communities here. A unique feature is that many shops and kiosks set up during the festival selling vermilion, clothing, sacred threads and sweets are operated by Muslims who also display a portrait of goddess Banashankari in their shops. Another interesting marketing activity seen at this venue is of the sale, by artisans of Holeyalur and surrounding areas, of elaborately engraved <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> and doors made in teak, acacia and other varieties of wood. Cattle fair is also held during this festival. Speciality of the cattle fair is the focus on sale of white bulls.|$|E
