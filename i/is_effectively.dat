5|$|Compactification {{can be used}} to {{construct}} models in which spacetime <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> four-dimensional. However, not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature. In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a Calabi–Yau manifold. A Calabi–Yau manifold is a special space which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory. It is named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of players have been called in top-class matches — Test matches, One Day Internationals and {{domestic}} first-class matches — invariably creating controversy and occasionally destroying cricket careers. Often the player {{has been able to}} modify his action to appease his critics and the umpires, but more commonly, especially when the bowler has been called on more than one occasion, his career in international cricket <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> ended.|$|E

5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the brain <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> asleep, while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.|$|E

5|$|A {{party is}} {{held for the}} team, and Dax and Kahn warm to one another's company once more. Afterward, they begin to socialize as they work {{together}} on Kahn's wormhole experiment aboard USS Defiant. They agree to have dinner, but to also bring Bashir along as a chaperone. At the dinner, Bashir feels out of place and <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> ignored by the two Trills. Returning to the tests, Kahn creates the first artificial wormhole in history and Dax hugs her in celebration. Kahn's brother Bejal (Tim Ryan), {{who is on the}} science team, speaks to her separately and highlights his concerns regarding her contact with Dax. Despite this, Kahn goes to Dax's quarters and a discussion between the two leads to a kiss; Kahn leaves before it goes any further.|$|E
5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} subway and bus systems, for many more riders there <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for every dollar of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E
5|$|Inside No. 9 is an {{anthology}} series, with each episode featuring a new story, {{with a new}} setting and new characters. Episodes last around half an hour, with the self-contained story reaching a conclusion. The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place in number 9, be that a mansion, a dressing room or a flat. Every episode stars at least one of Shearsmith or Pemberton, and normally both. Each episode <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> a short play, and could easily be performed on stage. Most episodes take place in real-time, following half an hour {{in the lives of the}} characters.|$|E

5|$|Mimesis or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} the predator mimics an organism that its prey is indifferent to. Unlike in all cases above, the predator is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are close enough for the predator to strike. This <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), may provide one such example. It flies amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over {{whether this is a}} true case of mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Only minute {{traces of}} {{technetium}} occur naturally in the Earth's crust. This is because technetium-98's half-life is only 4.2millionyears. More {{than a thousand}} of such periods have passed since {{the formation of the}} Earth, so the probability for the survival of even one atom of primordial technetium <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> zero. However, small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1nanogram (10−9g) of technetium. Some red giant stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium. These red-giants are known informally as technetium stars.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar, Panthera onca, is {{the only}} extant New World member of the genus Panthera. DNA {{evidence}} shows the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, and clouded leopard share a common ancestor, and that this group is between six and ten million years old; the fossil record points {{to the emergence of}} Panthera just two to 3.8 million years ago. Phylogenetic studies generally have shown the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is basal to this group. The position of the remaining species varies between studies and <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> unresolved.|$|E

5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, {{the amount of}} carbon on Earth <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin cycle, a process of carbon fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|Eastbourne Pier {{was built}} between 1866 and 1872 at the {{junction}} of Grand and Marine Parades. The pier interrupts what {{would otherwise have been}} a ribbon development of buildings – to the west, high-class hotels, with modest family hotels and boarding houses to the east. The Eastbourne Pier Company was registered in April 1865 with a capital of £15,000 and on 18 April 1866 work began. It was opened by Lord Edward Cavendish on 13 June 1870, although it was not actually completed until two years later. On New Year's Day 1877 the landward half was swept away in a storm. It was rebuilt at a higher level, creating a drop {{towards the end of the}} pier. The pier <b>is</b> <b>effectively</b> built on stilts that rest in cups on the sea-bed allowing the whole structure to move during rough weather. It is roughly 300metres (1000ft) long. A domed 400-seater pavilion was constructed at a cost of £250 at the seaward end in 1888. A 1,000-seater theatre, bar, camera obscura and office suite replaced this in 1899/1901. At the same time, two saloons were built midway along the pier. Access to the camera obscura was destroyed by an arson attack in 1970, but was restored in 2003 with a new stairway built.|$|E
