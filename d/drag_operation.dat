Folding means to create both new page and a link to the page at the same time, which can be used to separate the contents of a grand page into sub pages. Editors can specify a target area to be exported anywhere, with casual <b>drag</b> <b>operation.</b> Also Javara has zoomable pane to show a longer page.

40|$|NICOGRAPH　International　 2009 Applications of {{interactive}} world maps {{are one of}} the most often used classifications of software. Most of the software packages in current use show geographical features mapped directly onto the surface of a sphere or onto a flat surface. To date, most of the studies of user interactions with world maps have only considered two-dimensional maps. This means that data visualization with virtual globe applications has not received much attention. We have proposed a method for displaying world map with high degree of freedom (HDF). The proposed method provided a viewer that combines three-dimensional views, as are normally viewed on a globe, with two-dimensional views, as are seen on an ordinary map and allows seamless switching between the two views. The method uses the series of coordinate systems. Each coordinate system resembles one or another of the coordinate systems used by standard computer graphics, but a key feature is that the parameters of each transformation function depend on the parameters of the other transformation functions and is differing from the direct “browse” style of geometric space in currently available packages. In this paper, we describe a method that the viewing system with the above-mentioned feature guarantees that any region designated by the user can be kept within the borders of the display in order to compare plural geographically distant locations (Figure 1). In this method, the region of interest is indicated by dragging it with the mouse. When the screen cannot show the entire target region, due to use of zoom or other reasons, the algorithm automatically divides the display in order to show the entire region. Guaranteed Visibility ensures that all of the regions displayed on the monitor. First of all, it is verified whether region is displayed or not. If there is a region not being displayed, the system automatically inserts an emulated mouse <b>drag</b> <b>operation</b> in order to shift the region onto the viewable area. If the automatic mouse-drag compensation fails to resolve the problem of the missing region, the display is split, either in the horizontal or the vertical direction, with a 1 : 1 ratio of the areas of each side. The display splitting is expressed in a tree-structured data. The change from one display mode to another by creation of nodes is a discontinuous process, but an animation is shown during this procedure that makes it look continuous. It has been pointed out that one of the risks of a split display is losing context awareness. We experiment on the use of Halo to provide clues about relative positions to emphasize the relationships between entities in the display...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To improve single-handed {{operation}} of mobile de-vices, {{the use of}} rear touch panel has potential for user interac-tions. In this paper, a basic study of operational control simply achieved through drag and tap of the index finger on a rear touch panel is conducted. Since a user has to hold the handheld device firmly with the thumb and fingers, a movable range of the tip of an index finger is limited. This restriction requires a user to perform several times of dragging actions to reach a cursor to the long distance target. Considering such kinematic restriction, a technique optimized for rear operation is proposed, wherein not only the position but also the velocity of fingertip movement is regarded. Movement time, the number of <b>dragging</b> <b>operation,</b> and the throughputs of the proposed technique have been evaluated {{in comparison with the}} generic technique using Fitts’s law. Experiments have been conducted to perform the target selection in the form of reciprocal 1 D pointing tasks with ten participants. The combinations of two ways of holding the device (landscape and portrait) and two directions of dragging (horizontal and vertical) are considered. As a result, the proposed technique achieved the improvements of from 5 to 13 % shorter movement time, from 20 to 40 % higher throughputs and no deterioration of the number of dragging even for the longer distance targets. In addition, the further analysis addressed that there exists the advantageous combinations of the way of holding and the direction of dragging, which would be beneficial for better design of single-handed user interactions using rear touch.

This has been done by organizing a user test with fifteen participants, using a self-made gaze interactive software called Discovery and a Tobii X 60 eye tracker. Five demo applications have been created within the Discovery software, all utilizing gaze interaction. They are customized to reflect five user test tasks; playing a video game, exploring a picture gallery, doing <b>drag</b> and drop <b>operations,</b> browsing a web page and interacting with different Microsoft Windows controls. The four types of controls tested are command buttons, links, check boxes and sliders. Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered during the user test. Through a discussion of the test results, we were able to suggest ten specific design guidelines for gaze interaction. These covers both the tested controls, <b>drag</b> and drop <b>operations,</b> automatic scrolling as well as the use of head gestures. Additional findings indicate that gaze interaction is more suitable for passive tasks such as reading with automatic scrolling, than for more physical tasks like doing <b>drag</b> and drop <b>operations.</b> To support gaze interaction, we found that current software will either require a major redesign or to be used in a combination with other interaction styles.

40|$|In {{heavy-duty}} {{disc brake}} systems, braking is a transient, non-linear and asymmetrical thermo-mechanical process. Surface cracking, rather than wear, {{is the major}} factor limiting the brake disc's life. The disc material (cast-iron), heat transfer boundary conditions and pad-disc frictional reactions are characteristically non-linear and asymmetrical during the friction process. Non-uniform deformation and surface cracks in brake discs result from the accumulation of excessive residual stress/strain. During braking processes, many factors affect the distributions of the residual stress and strain in discs, and hence the propagation of the surface cracks. The disc material, structure and boundary conditions are three of the crucial aspects. From the structure, a brake disc could be either solid or ventilated. In practice, solid structures always have higher anti-cracking performance than the same class of ventilated designs. However solid discs cost more material and have lower cooling efficiency. This thesis presents an improved finite element analysis for heavy-duty disc brakes and identifies design improvements. As the friction pads slide against the disc's surfaces continuously, the thermal and mechanical loads are functions of time and spatial coordinates. A 3 -D asymmetrical finite element model was developed to achieve more accurate simulations of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of brake discs during braking processes. A non-linear inelastic material model for cast-iron was employed in the FE model. Permanent plastic stress and strain fields were predicted and analysed for multi-stop <b>drag</b> <b>operations.</b> The residual stress/strain fields in the discs are investigated to {{understand the differences between}} solid and ventilated discs in terms of the cracking resistance ability.

40|$|As a {{good and}} {{competent}} surgical simulator, it should provide surgeons with visual, tactile and behavioral illusion of reality. In literature, methods for object deformation range from non-physically based models to physically based models. Early works of non-physically based models focused on pure geometrical models that were originally employed in computer-aided design. These methods {{could be used to}} produce vivid deformable effects in computer animation. However, the soft tissue simulation in surgical applications requires more realistic models based on physical properties of human tissues. As a result, the mass-spring model and the finite element model have become the most popular representations for deformable organs in surgical simulation. Our research focuses on the real-time soft tissue deformable model based on the finite element method for surgical application. Extended from the hybrid condensed finite element model, an interactive hybrid condensed model with hardware acceleration by the graphics processing unit (GPU) is proposed. Two methods are developed in order to map the data onto the GPU in accordance with the application data structure. The performance of the primary calculation task in the solver is enhanced. Furthermore, an improved scheme is presented to conduct the newly applied forces induced by <b>dragging</b> or poking <b>operations</b> in the non-operational region. In the thesis, new approaches to establish a physically based model for soft tissue deformation and cutting in virtual-reality-based simulators are proposed. A deformable model, called the hybrid condensed finite element model, based on the volumetric finite element method is presented. By this method, three-dimensional organs can be represented as tetrahedral meshes, divided into two regions: the operational region and the non-operational one. Different methods treat the regions with different properties in order to balance the computational time and the level of the simulation realism. The condensation technique is applied to only involve the calculation of the surface nodes in the non-operational region while the fully calculation of the volumetric deformation is processed in the operational part. This model guarantees the smooth simulation of cutting operation with the exact cutting path when users manipulate a virtual scalpel. Moreover, we discuss the relevant aspects on what affect the efficiency of implementing the finite element method, as well as the issues considered for choosing the effective solving method to our problem. Three numerical methods have been examined in our model. Surgical simulator, which benefits from virtual reality techniques, presents a realistic and feasible approach to train inexperienced surgeons within a safe environment. It plays more and more important role in medical field and also changes the world of surgical training. Especially, the minimally invasive microsurgery, which offers patients various attractive advantages over the traditional surgery, has been widely used in otolaryngology, gastroenterology, gynecology and neurology in the last two decades. Through the combination of these approaches, a physically based model which allows users to freely perform the soft tissue cutting and detecting, such as poking or <b>dragging</b> <b>operations,</b> with soft tissue deformation is achieved in real-time.
