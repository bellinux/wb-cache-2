40|$|Information on the {{distribution}} and intensity of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> activity is needed to inform marine spatial planning and to assess fisheries interactions with the environment and other industries. Although fishing vessels under 15 m (overall length) account for 98. 4 % (2011 value) {{by the number of}} the European fleet, information on <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> activity in Europe is very limited as there is no statutory satellite monitoring of smaller vessels (< 15 m length before 2012, < 12 m thereafter).

For the larger inshore vessels, the SPUE estimates of activity were validated with vessel monitoring system (VMS) data and showed good agreement at the scale of analysis. Fishing activity estimates from SPUE are presented with an assessment of uncertainty, to account for spatial differences in enforcement activity.

50|$|The tille {{trevally}} {{is typically}} an inshore species, preferentially inhabiting coastal coral and rocky reefs, {{as well as}} moving through sandy bays and lagoons. The species is known to move with the tide in the Solomon Islands, entering inner lagoon regions through tidal corridors as the tide rises, and exiting back to the outer reef as the tide falls. This {{is thought to be}} due to the fish following small prey fish into the lagoon, where these small species spawn. The species is also known to enter estuarine waters and the lower reaches of rivers. Despite being more prevalent in inshore waters, the tille trevally has also been recorded in far offshore waters, living on seamounts in West Mariana Ridge of the Pacific, where seamount peaks reach to 50 m from the surface. Here it occurs with other normally <b>inshore</b> <b>fishes,</b> {{and is one of the}} top predators in this ecosystem.|$|E

40|$|The <b>inshore</b> <b>fishes</b> of Sirahama were studied, {{particularly}} {{in relation to}} their responses to the cleaner Labroides dimidiatus, common and the only habitual and obligate cleaner at the study area, in the years from 1972 to 1975. According to their responses to the cleaner, <b>inshore</b> <b>fishes</b> can be distinguished into two categories: 'posing species ' which display a pose to it and 'non-posing species' which do not exhibit any pose. It was found that most of the fishes dwelling near the cleaner are the posing species, while the fishes dwelling apart from it are mostly the non-posing. The cleaner cleaned any species, whether posing or non-posing, dwelling near to it. There is a rather extensive range in the attitude to be cleaned either among posing species or among non-posing ones, according to their modes of life. From these facts, it was suggested that posing behavior of host fishes has been developed through their daily contacts with the cleaner in their course of evolution only when cleaning has been significant for their life. Further, the importance of examining how cleaning symbiosis is prevailing among the members of the fish community within a definite area, i. e. how many posing species are found among them, was suggested...|$|E

40|$|Members of the sciaenid family {{include some}} of the most recreationally {{important}} <b>inshore</b> <b>fishes</b> in the southeastern US, such as red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus, and spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus. These fishes create signature noises in a chorus to attract mates, earning them such common names as drum or croaker. The sounds can be easily heard using passive acoustic techniques, allowing biologists to locate spawning aggregations with hydrophones. Identifying and better understanding the habitats used by sciaenid spawning aggregations may help avoid impacts to these economically important species from dredging activities in the Savannah Harbor. Instead of traditional fisheries sampling tools such as nets, electro-shockers, and hook-and-line, acoustic hydrophones were used to determine if, where, and when sciaenid spawning aggregations occur in the proposed harbor expansion project area. This innovative and cost-effective method has been successfully used in several southeastern studies to locate aggregations without interfering with the fish. From August to November, and again from February to June, hydrophone surveys were conducted in and around the Savannah River’s shipping channel to find and characteriz...|$|E

Zoological Studies 38 (4) : 391 - 404. Fishes in the estuary of the Tsengwen River and nearby coastal zone were collected using different gear between October 1994 and July 1997. A checklist of all fish species is given in the present paper together with their lifecycle category, life habits, and world zoogeographical distribution. Totally 80 families and 244 species of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishes</b> were recorded from 5 estuarine zones along the coast near the Tsengwen River mouth. Among these families, Gobiidae had the most species (34 species, 13. 9 %); Carangidae the 2 nd (15 species, 6. 1 %); and then Apogonidae and Clupeidae (11 species, 4. 5 %). Nearly half of these species, including 10 families and 111 species, were not previously recorded from the entire western coast of Taiwan, and include 5 new records for Taiwan. They are Ambassis miops, A. interruptus, and A. commersoni of the Ambassidae; Epinephelus lanceolatus of the Serranidae; and Zenarchopterus dunkeri of the Hemiramphidae. Diagnostic characters and specimen photographs of these 5 species are provided.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the utilization of}} shallow, subtidal bays, associated with rocky shores, by the late-stage larvae and early juveniles of some common <b>inshore</b> <b>fishes.</b> Larval and early juvenile fishes were collected in seven small bays (30 – 50 m wide) between Port Alfred  (33 ° 36 ’ S, 26 ° 53 ’ E) and Hamburg (33 ° 17 ’ S, 27 ° 29 ’ E), using a modified, beach seine net (500 μm mesh).   Four bays were sampled weekly during peak fish spawning (September–November 2004) to firstly assess whether larval fishes occur in these previously-unstudied habitats and secondly, to assess the extent of this utilization in terms of species occurrence, abundance and potential nursery function. An additional three replicate bays, situated > 50 km away near Bira were used for comparison. In total, 14 fish families represented by 26 taxa were recorded but the catch was dominated by a small suite of common species. Bays were extensively utilized by Sparidae (Diplodus capensis and Sarpa salpa), {{and to a lesser}} extent by Clinidae (Clinus superciliosus), Mugilidae (Liza spp.) and Kyphosidae (Neoscorpis lithophilus). Mean CPUE of larvae was high and exceeded 900 individuals per seine haul. Larval abundance peaked at 4000 larvae per haul and at these times, was dominated only by the two sparid species. Abundance of sparid larvae exceeds that recorded for these species in surf zones, estuaries or the shallow nearshore habitats sampled to date in temperate South Africa by an order of magnitude. Larval abundance was significantly higher during new moon sampling throughout the study period, but was not significantly different between repeated samples collected per site on each fieldtrip. The length-frequency of larvae utilizing the bays was dominated by postflexion stages ranging 7 – 14 mm SL. Length-frequency distribution of Diplodus, Sarpa, Clinus, Sparodon, Neoscorpis was indicative of grow-out and use of bays as interim nurseries. The nursery function of these bays is supported by gut analysis of a sub-sample of the dominant species, Diplodus capensis, which showed that these larvae were actively feeding in the area, predominantly on copepods. This work prompts further research on shallow habitats associated with rocky shores particularly the shelter and feeding role that these under-studied habitats are playing in the early life history of coastal fishes. </strong...|$|E
