5|$|The {{following}} season, Rogan {{took over}} from José Méndez {{as manager of}} the Kansas City Monarchs. In that season's NNL playoffs against the Chicago American Giants, he pitched and lost both games of a series-deciding doubleheader to the younger Bill Foster.

Hughes fought three times at Extreme Challenge 21, on October 17, 1998 defeating Victor Hunsaker via TKO and future UFC Midleweight Champion Dave Menne via unanimous decision. In the third fight of that night he lost to then-undefeated Dennis Hallman by technical submission (guillotine choke) at 0:17 of the first round. The result was announced as a KO.

25|$|Egil (Egill)'s boyhood foreshadowed {{his future}} rebelliousness and poetic prowess. His {{unbridled}} behavior and strength beyond his age {{earned him a}} stay at home when a feast was held by Yngvar (Egil's maternal grandfather). Egil defiantly rode a horse to attend, and composed his first skaldic verse at age three. At {{the age of seven}} while playing in the ball games, he committed his first murder (axe-killing an older boy who outclassed him in the sport). By the time Egil was twelve very few grown men could compete with him in games, but when he and his friend challenged his father one day, Skallagrim manifested such strength at nightfall that <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> the friend dead against the ground. Egil was so upset he killed one of his father's favorite workers, and the two were not on speaking terms.|$|E
25|$|The {{house had}} a major roof leak that forced {{an end to the}} house tours in 1998. An {{architectural}} assessment was performed on the house and the cost to reconstruct the house was estimated between $116,020 and $126,220. Before the roof was repaired, there was a broken pipe in the dining room. The break happened in January 1999. It dumped 500,000 gallons of water through the first floor and into the basement. The rising basement waters extinguished the furnace, causing the water in the pipes and the radiators to freeze, then burst. City water meters knew there was a problem somewhere in the city, but no one could find the source of the leak. A volunteer at the house discovered the leak. The volunteer arranged for a heating repairman to stop the flooding. When the repairman left, <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> the door closed. The door frame was so swollen that the volunteer was stuck inside. She had to go upstairs and call for help through a front window.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} between the Big Boss Man, {{accompanied}} by Slick, and [...] "The Bird Man" [...] Koko B. Ware. With Slick as a distraction, the Big Boss Man took the early advantage in the match. After crushing Koko in {{between himself and the}} turnbuckle with a jumping Avalanche, Boss Man refused to pin him and finish the match. Instead, he attempted to climb to the top rope and land on Koko stomach-first, but missed. The Bird Man then retaliated by performing several dropkicks and attempted a pin. Boss Man got his shoulder up to save himself from being pinned, and <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> his opponent into the mat, allowing him to pin Koko for the win.|$|E

50|$|In this {{variation}} of a powerbomb, the attacking wrestler falls to a seated position as <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> the opponent down. Some wrestlers remain in seated position to pin the opponent, while others choose not to. The move {{can either be}} performed as a standard powerbomb or as a gutwrench powerbomb. The move was popularized by Jushin Liger, who {{used it as a}} finisher, known as the Liger Bomb. Matt Morgan briefly used it in WWE. It was also famously used by Batista as the Batista Bomb.|$|R
5000|$|... 4. Wile E. {{then puts}} on an ACME Batman Outfit and dives off a cliff.

The wings stick to the rock and the Coyote is left grappling in the air until <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> into the ground below. This scene was reused (with narration) in 1962s Adventures of the Road Runner.|$|R

500|$|Faced {{with intense}} {{competition}} from the other astronauts, particularly John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking, and adopted Glenn's habit of taking a morning jog, {{although he did not}} {{go so far as to}} give up the cocktails or the philandering. On January 19, 1961, Robert R. Gilruth, the director of NASA's Space Task Group, informed the seven astronauts that Shepard had been chosen for the first American manned mission into space. Shepard later recalled Louise's response when he told her that she had her arms around the man who would be the first man in space: [...] "Who let a Russian in here?" [...] During training he flew 120 simulated flights. Although his flight was originally scheduled for April 26, 1960, it was postponed several times by unplanned preparatory work, initially to December 5, 1960, then mid-January 1961, March 6, 1961, April 25, 1961, May 2, 1961, and finally to May 5, 1961. On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth. It was another body blow to American pride. When Shepard heard the news <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> his fist down on a table so hard a NASA public relation officer feared he might have broken it.|$|E

According to Hagar, the scene where he folds his arms and refuses to sing, {{and the end of the}} video where <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> the dressing room door were not staged - he was genuinely angry.|$|R
