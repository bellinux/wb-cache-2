She enjoys shopping, traveling, and giving gifts and helps support {{her mother and her}} mother's husband in Florida. Regarding her short financial disclosure reports prior to her Supreme Court nomination, she has said, [...] "When you don't have money, it's easy. There isn't anything there to report." [...] As a federal judge, she is entitled to a pension equal to her full salary upon retirement. Upon joining the Supreme Court, she took up residence in Washington but sorely missed the faster-paced life of New York. After renting in the Cleveland Park neighborhood for three years, in 2012 she purchased a condominium in the U Street Corridor. She said, [...] "I picked [...] because it's mixed. I walk out and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> kinds of people, which is the environment I grew up in and the environment I love." ...|$|E
500|$|There was no {{nationwide}} {{election day}} in 1840, and many states, {{by the time}} they held the presidential vote, had already conducted balloting in local races and for the House of Representatives. One state, South Carolina, did not have a popular vote for president, with electors chosen by the legislature. These state and federal elections, from March to October 1840, led to Whig victories in all but a few states, mainly Democratic strongholds like New Hampshire. Among the victories was that of Whig Governor-elect Corwin in Ohio. The first presidential balloting began on October 29, in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the polls ended with Rhode Island on November 23. Monday, November 2 was the largest polling day, as 12 states, including New York, voted. As those states compiled the vote, citizens scanned partisan and unreliable newspapers, trying to discern a trend. Even though Harrison led in 10 of the first 11 states to report, former president Jackson wrote to Van Buren, [...] "do not believe a word of it. Nor will I believe that you are not elected until <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> the official returns." [...] But when the Whigs took New York by 13,000 votes, it was clear that Harrison and Tyler had won the election.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on August 7, 1987, in United States to 944 theatres. Warner Bros. did not arrange for an advance screening, as they believed that Madonna's appeal would draw moviegoers {{to come to the}} film. A pre-release celebration was held on August 6, 1987, at Times Square in New York, where Madonna arrived to promote the film. A crowd of almost 10,000 people assembled to watch Madonna. As an introduction to the day, the radio jockeys from New York's WHTZ radio station played Madonna's popular songs in the Square, atop a platform created for the event. The police closed off 43rd and 44th streets, but allowing the traffic to pass through Broadway and Seventh Avenue of Manhattan. Around 6 PM, limousines started to arrive at the Square, with celebrities and the actors of the film entering the fanfare. Madonna arrived in a low-cut, low-backed sequined evening gown and the short hair she had adopted for the film. Although she was late by about an hour, the crowd number continued increasing. Asking her fans good-naturedly to [...] "Shut up, so I can talk", Madonna thanked everybody for coming to the opening of Who's That Girl. She talked about her experience of arriving in Times Square eight years before, and said, [...] "I was completely awestruck. Ten years later, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> of you who have come to see me, and I'm completely awestruck. Thank you, and I hope you like the movie." [...] Saying this Madonna departed from the platform, and walked to the National Theatre. Joseph A. Cincotti from The New York Times noted that most of the crowd were in their [...] late teenage years and early 20's. Some held up signs and photographs but he noticed the Madonna wannabes were absent, the adolescent girls who had imitated Madonna's early lace-and-leather look. This was a result of Madonna's more mature image from True Blue.|$|E
