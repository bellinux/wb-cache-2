While honing their pitch to Vestron, Gottlieb and Bergstein chose Emile Ardolino as the film's director, who had won the 1983 Academy Award for the documentary, <b>He</b> <b>Makes</b> <b>Me</b> Feel Like Dancin'. Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely passionate about the project; he even sent a message {{from where he was}} sequestered on jury duty, insisting that he was the best choice as director. The team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron's president, Jon Peisinger, and the company's vice president for production, Mitchell Cannold. By the end of the meeting, Peisinger had greenlighted the project to become Vestron's first feature film production. The approved film was budgeted at the relatively low amount of $5million, {{at a time when the}} average cost for a film was $12million.|$|E
500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] is a groove-laden song, {{following}} a musical setting that is beat-oriented. In {{an interview with}} Associated Press, Simpson said that [...] "Irresistible" [...] is [...] "very sexy, more grown-up. I think you're {{going to see a}} new side of Jessica Simpson." [...] Lyrically, according to Birgisson, the song carries some feminine viewpoints that Sheyne had managed to incorporate through her contribution. Ben Graham, the author of Maximum Jessica Simpson, noted that the lyrics suggest that Simpson finds it hard to keep her famous virginity image intact. This can be inferred from the lines [...] "I know that I'm supposed to make him wait / Let him think I like the chase / But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know I meant to say no." [...] Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In pointed out that the verses [...] "I can't stop fanning the fire [...] Now inescapable" [...] refer to an [...] "imminent sexual compromise". [...] "She knows she shouldn't give in, but seems past the point of no return," [...] he explained. However, Taylor stated that lyrically, the song demands for [...] "total fulfillment". The version featured on Lizzie McGuire soundtrack replaces the lyric [...] "When <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> weak with desire" [...] with [...] "When <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> want to move closer" [...] and [...] "But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know I meant to say no" [...] with [...] "But it's time to stop this emotion / Right now I'm gonna say no." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harrison {{wrote the}} slow soul ballad [...] "Ooh Baby (You Know That I Love You)" [...] {{in the spring}} of 1975, shortly before {{starting}} recording for Extra Texture. The song was Harrison's musical tribute to Robinson. In an interview held at his Los Angeles home that April, with disc jockey Dave Herman, Harrison included Smokey Robinson among his preferred artists, along with Shankar, Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton, and added: [...] "Musically, he's so sweet... he makes you feel nice – <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> feel good." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also, Torata Nanbu, {{leader of}} Tokyo Shock Boys, {{one of the}} people had been {{supporting}} Tashiro {{for the sake of his}} comeback, said sadly [...] "My heart is aching very much. I don't mean to beat him up, but <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> feel empty inside. I wonder if the drug might be more fascinating for him than the feeling of returning to the entertainment industry, [...] " [...] and concluded, [...] "I cannot take any more. Regrettably, this is the end. It is no longer possible for him to restore his reputation." [...] He had been appearing in the radio program named [...] "Tashiro Nakamura　Nanbu Akua-Chan", broadcast in Rainbowtown FM, aimed at supporting Tashiro's comeback, where nobody got paid even once before the programme was cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|The première of Il Muto {{initially}} goes well, {{until the}} voice of the Phantom suddenly cuts through the performance, enraged that Box 5 was not kept empty for him. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotta reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a [...] "little toad". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces Carlotta's voice to a frog-like croak. Firmin quickly tries to calm the situation by telling the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, moving forward the ballet to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the corpse of Joseph Buquet drops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Firmin and André plead for calm as mayhem erupts and the Phantom's diabolical laughter is heard throughout the auditorium ("Poor Fool, <b>He</b> <b>Makes</b> <b>Me</b> Laugh").|$|E
2500|$|An edited {{production}} renamed Phantom: The Las Vegas Spectacular opened 24 June 2006 at The Venetian in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a theatre built {{specifically for}} the show to resemble the Opéra Garnier in Paris. The production ran 95 minutes with no intermission, and was directed and choreographed by Harold Prince and Gillian Lynne, with scenic designs by David Rockwell. The show featured updated technology and effects, including a re-engineered chandelier capable of reassembling in midair during the overture while the entire interior of the venue (not merely the stage) returned to its 1880s halcyon days. Almost 45 minutes' worth of material was eliminated, such as the Don Juan Triumphant rehearsal. [...] "Poor Fool, <b>He</b> <b>Makes</b> <b>Me</b> Laugh" [...] and [...] "The Point of No Return" [...] were significantly shortened. Other changes resembled those in the 2004 film, such as staging the chandelier crash at the plot's climax (during performance of [...] "The Point of No Return") rather than mid-story. The Las Vegas production closed on 2 September 2012.|$|E

2500|$|A Collection: Greatest Hits...and More {{contains}} various {{songs from}} Streisand's catalog {{as far back}} as 1975's [...] "By the Way", which was noted as Streisand's first songwriting credit in her entire career. Additionally, it contains the title track from The Main Event (1979) and three tracks from 1980's Guilty ("Woman in Love", [...] "What Kind of Fool", and [...] "Guilty"). From Memories, [...] "Comin' In and Out of Your Life" [...] and [...] "Memory" [...] were included and so were [...] "The Way <b>He</b> <b>Makes</b> <b>Me</b> Feel" [...] (1983), [...] "Somewhere" [...] (1985), and [...] "All I Ask of You" [...] (1988). In addition to the ten aforementioned songs, Streisand recorded two new tracks for the album. [...] "We're Not Makin' Love Anymore" [...] was written by Michael Bolton and Diane Warren and produced by Narada Michael Walden. It was released as a single on September 14, 1989 in four different formats: 7", 12", cassette, and CD. The single peaked at number ten on Adult Contemporary chart in the United States and at number 17 on the similar chart in Canada. It also charted in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom at positions 89 and 85, respectively. An official music video was created for the single and debuted live on Entertainment Tonight on September 14; it serves as the third music video from her entire career.|$|E
