5|$|Montauran, on {{the other}} hand, is devoted wholly to the royalist cause, and chafes against the ignorant nobles {{supporting}} it. He fights for the Chouan cause because <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> it, not for the personal gain sought by the aristocrats in whose midst he works. He gives up the cause for Marie, but only {{as a result of}} an unclear series of events, the product of everyone's intertwined double-crossing.|$|E

Gülen {{has stated that}} <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> science, interfaith dialogue among the People of the Book, and multi-party democracy. He has initiated such dialogue with the Vatican and some Jewish organizations.|$|E

25|$|Alyosha (Alyoshka), a Baptist. He {{believes}} that being imprisoned {{is something that}} he has earned, since it allows him to reflect more on God and Jesus. Alyosha, surprisingly, is able to hide part of a Bible in the barracks. Shukhov responds to his beliefs by saying that <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> God but not heaven or hell, nor in spending much time on the issue.|$|E
25|$|John Turturro, as Pete Hogwallop, {{a fellow}} {{criminal}} who reveals little about his past. <b>He</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> being true to one's kin, {{even when his}} cousin Washington B.

25|$|Fired: Conor, {{for making}} a bad {{presentation}} {{in front of the}} leading drive companies as well as having a poor management style. Even though Bill admired his entrepreneurial qualities and told him that he is and would make a great role model for the youth of Ireland, he saw him as a very raw talent and ready to fight for what <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in,</b> but decided he wasn't going to go into business with him.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 20th century, Gerald Massey {{argued that}} there are {{similarities}} between the Egyptian god Horus and Jesus. Following those ideas, in the 1940s Alvin Boyd Kuhn suggested that not only Christianity, but Judaism was based on Egyptian concepts, and more recently Tom Harpur (a former Anglican priest who explained in his book The Pagan Christ that <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> a spiritual Christ, but doubts that a historical Jesus existed) has expressed similar views. Harpur acknowledges Massey and Kuhn as his intellectual predecessors and theologian Stanley E. Porter states that most of Harpur's work is directly based on quoting Massey and Kuhn.|$|E
25|$|In The New Trial of Socrates (2012), an {{international}} panel of ten judges held a mock re-trial of Socrates {{to resolve the}} matter of the charges levelled against him by Meletus, Anytos, and Lycon, that: “Socrates is a doer of evil, and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state, and <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> other new divinities of his own”; by split decision, five judges voted “Guilty” and five judges voted “Not guilty”, which acquitted Socrates of corruption of the young and of impiety against the Athenian pantheon. Limiting themselves to {{the facts of the case}} against Socrates, the judges did not consider any sentence; the judges who voted the philosopher guilty said that they would not have considered the death penalty for Socrates.|$|E

25|$|Part of the eco-socialist transition, in Kovel’s eyes, is the {{reforming}} {{money to}} retain its use in “enabling exchanges” while reducing its functions as “a commodity in its own right” and “repository of value”. He argues for directing money to “enhancement of use-values” through a “subsidization of use-values” that “preserves the functioning core of the economy while gaining time and space for rebuilding it”. Internationally, <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> the immediate cessation of speculation in currencies (“breaking down the function of money as commodity, and redirecting funds on use-values”), the cancellation of the debt of the Global South (“breaking {{the back of the}} value function” of money) and the redirecting the “vast reservoir of mainly phony value” to reparations and “ecologically sound development”. He suggests the end of military aid and other forms of support to “comprador elites in the South” will eventually “lead to their collapse”.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{believe that}} a state statute would be {{consistent}} with our constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion if it specifically denied the right to practice law to all members of one of our great religious groups, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish. Yet the Quakers have had a long and honorable part in the growth of our nation, and an amicus curiae brief filed in their behalf informs us that, under the test applied to this petitioner, not one of them, if true to the tenets of their faith, could qualify for the bar in Illinois. And {{it is obvious that the}} same disqualification would exist as to every conscientious objector to the use of force, even though the Congress of the United States should continue its practice of absolving them from military service. The conclusion seems to me inescapable that, if Illinois can bar this petitioner from the practice of law it can bar every person from every public occupation solely because <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> nonresistance, rather than in force.|$|E
25|$|With Van der Sar injured for {{the first}} two months of the 2009–10 season, Foster was given the {{opportunity}} to nail down the number one shirt in the 2009 FA Community Shield defeat to Chelsea, where his mistakes led to two Chelsea goals and made no saves in the penalty shootout. Foster continued to play in the League, starting with the opening day victory over Birmingham City. In wins against Arsenal and Manchester City, Foster received heavy criticism for massive errors that led to opposition goals. Manager Alex Ferguson stated that <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> Foster's abilities and potential; however, eight days later, Foster was again criticised for a mistake which led to a Sunderland goal in a 2–2 draw, and left out of the England squad the next day with bruised ribs. However, following Robert Green's red card in the match against Ukraine and consequent suspension, Foster was given the all-clear by doctors and recalled to the England squad for the match against Belarus on 14 October. Foster played only twice more in 2009 for Manchester United after the Sunderland match: a League Cup win against Championship team Barnsley, and a Champions League tie versus Beşiktaş, with Manchester United's progress from the group already secured. He was displaced from the first team in Van der Sar's absence by Tomasz Kuszczak, and on occasion, reserve goalkeeper Ben Amos took Foster's place on the substitutes bench. Foster started his first match for three months against West Ham in February 2010, keeping a clean sheet in a 3–0 victory.|$|E

500|$|Tang {{has participated}} in {{numerous}} community and public art projects, workshops and performances, as <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> {{the potential of the}} individual and collective to effect social changes.

His works should provoke thoughts, not to please the eyes or to entertain, much less for decoration." ...|$|E
500|$|Tang has {{expressed}} concern about environmental and social issues through his art, such as the works They Poach the Rhino, Chop Off His Horn and Make This Drink (1989) and Tiger's Whip (1991).

2500|$|Shakur never professed {{to follow}} a {{particular}} religion, but his lyrics in singles such as [...] "Ghetto Gospel" [...] and [...] "Only God Can Judge Me" [...] and poems such as The Rose That Grew from Concrete (poetry collection) suggest <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> God. Many analysts currently describe him as a deist. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> Karma but rejected a literal afterlife and organized religion.|$|R
500|$|Einstein {{spoke of}} his {{religious}} outlook in {{a wide array of}} original writings and interviews. Einstein stated that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza. <b>He</b> did not <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> a personal God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve. He clarified however that, [...] "I am not an atheist", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a [...] "deeply religious nonbeliever". When asked if <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> an afterlife, Einstein replied, [...] "No. And one life is enough for me." ...|$|R

500|$|Another {{supportive}} {{member of}} the City Council was Hiram Monserrate. Monserrate went through the program himself, and drafted official proclamations honoring both Tom Cruise and L. Ron Hubbard. Describing himself as a Christian, he distanced himself from Scientology but said <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> the Purification Rundown. Another councillor (and chair of the Public Safety Committee), Peter Vallone, Jr. vocally criticized the detoxification project and argued that public money should not be spent on it. He accused Monserrate of crossing the line between [...] "cult and state." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing the {{character}} following his October 2007 {{departure from the}} show, the BBC attested: [...] "Rebellious surgeon Abra was an anti-authoritarian and would always fight for what he believed in, even if it broke the rules. He worked hard and played hard and wasn't afraid to push the boundaries." [...] The character has often {{been referred to as}} a [...] "", with editorials also mentioning his [...] "heavy-drinking" [...] tendencies. Edmondson has described his alter-ego as [...] "a great character - he's a maverick and can do things the others {{would not be able to}} get away with.", while the Daily Mirror have discussed the personality trait whereby [...] "Abra finds it hard to conform to bureaucracy and is a risk taker. He is not afraid to fight for what <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> - which, inevitably, lands him in all sorts of trouble." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{has said}} <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> the jazz improvisational {{technique}} of never performing a song {{the same way}} twice and except for the unique rendition of the Astral Weeks songs live, doesn't perform a concert from a preconceived set list. Morrison has said he prefers to perform at smaller venues or symphony halls noted for their good acoustics. His ban against alcoholic beverages, which made entertainment news during 2008, {{was an attempt to}} prevent the disruptive and distracting movement of audience members leaving their seats during the performances. In a 2009 interview, Morrison stated: [...] "I do not consciously aim to take the listener anywhere. If anything, I aim to take myself there in my music. If the listener catches the wavelength of what I am saying or singing, or gets whatever point whatever line means to them, then I guess as a writer I may have done a day's work." ...|$|E
