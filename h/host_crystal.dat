The crystal orientation of the layer can be engineered to match that of the target, even though the exact crystal structure and lattice constant may be very different.

50|$|Similarly, {{spectra of}} weakly trapped {{molecular}} excitons are also {{strongly influenced by}} adjacent exciton bands. It is an important property of typical molecular crystals with two or more symmetrically-equivalent molecules in the elementary cell, such as benzine and naphthalene, that their exciton absorption spectra consist of doublets (or multiplets) of bands strongly polarized along the crystal axes as was demonstrated by Antonina Prikhot'ko. This splitting of strongly polarized absorption bands that originated from the same molecular level and {{is known as the}} 'Davydov splitting' is the primary manifestation of molecular excitons. If the low-frequency component of the exciton multiplet is situated {{at the bottom of the}} exciton energy spectrum, then the absorption band of an impurity exciton approaching the bottom from below is enhanced in this component of the spectrum and reduced in two other components; in the spectroscopy of molecular excitons this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the 'Rashba effect'. As a result, the polarization ratio of an impurity exciton band depends on its spectral position and becomes indicative of the energy spectrum of free excitons. In large organic molecules the energy of impurity excitons can be shifted gradually by changing the isotopic content of guest molecules. Building on this option, Vladimir Broude developed a method of studying the energy spectrum of excitons in the <b>host</b> <b>crystal</b> by changing the isotopic content of guest molecules. Interchanging the host and the guest allows studying energy spectrum of excitons from the top. The isotopic technique has been more recently applied to study the energy transport in biological systems.|$|E
