A court later awarded temporary custody of Kate to Farrar's parents, due to Green's instability and Kate's professed anger with her father.

5|$|Baba ghanoush is an {{eggplant}} or aubergine salad or dip {{with several}} variants. The {{root of all}} the variants is broiled and mashed eggplant and tahini lathered with olive oil, which can then be flavored with either garlic, onions, peppers, ground cumin seeds, mint and parsley.

5|$|Human {{eyes have}} color receptors known as cone cells, {{of which there}} are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause color blindness, {{including}} the common inability to distinguish red and yellow <b>from</b> <b>green,</b> known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness. Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Overdrive is the 19th studio album by pop punk trio Shonen Knife. It was {{released}} on April 14, 2014 in Europe, and on April 16, 2014 in Japan. According to band leader Naoko Yamano, because their album Free Time (2010) was heavily influenced by punk rock, and Pop Tune (2012) had explored a more pop-oriented sound, Overdrive was {{a chance for the}} band to explore a more hard rock sound. The album's lyrics cover a wide array of topics, <b>from</b> <b>green</b> tea, fortune cookies, and cats.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to single}} interstitials, divacancies {{do not produce}} photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900°C {{creating}} multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, {{they have not been}} detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color <b>from</b> <b>green</b> to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E

5|$|The colour of C.maenas varies greatly, <b>from</b> <b>green</b> to brown, grey or red. This {{variation}} has {{a genetic}} component, but is {{largely due to}} local environmental factors. In particular, individuals which delay moulting become red–coloured rather than green. Red individuals are stronger and more aggressive, but are less tolerant of environmental stresses, such as low salinity or hypoxia. Juvenile crabs on average display greater patterning than adults.|$|E
5|$|The older {{writing was}} first noticed by Pierre Allix, a Protestant pastor. Jean Boivin, {{supervisor}} of the Royal Library, made the first extracts of various readings of the codex (under the notation of Paris 9) to Ludolph Küster, who published Mill's New Testament in 1710. In 1834–1835 potassium ferricyanide was used to bring out faded or eradicated ink, which {{had the effect of}} defacing the vellum <b>from</b> <b>green</b> and blue to black and brown.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface {{platforms}} opened in 1868 by the District Railway (DR) {{as part of}} the company's first section of the Inner Circle route and deep level platforms opened in 1999 {{as part of the}} Jubilee line extension <b>from</b> <b>Green</b> Park to Stratford. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, but the original station was completely rebuilt in conjunction with the construction of the deep level platforms and Portcullis House, which sits above the station.|$|E

5|$|An American Idiot stage musical {{adaptation}} premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in September 2009. The musical was {{a collaboration}} between Green Day and director Michael Mayer. Green Day did {{not appear in the}} production, but the show featured an onstage band. The production transferred to Broadway at the St. James Theatre, and opened in April 2010. The show received mixed to positive reviews from critics, but received a rave review from The New York Times.

5|$|By September 20, 1928, the {{extension}} of US141 northward <b>from</b> <b>Green</b> Bay along WIS57 to the Michigan state line had been approved, and the signage was readied for installation the following month. The US102 designation was decommissioned when US141 was also extended to replace M-57 from the state line, along US2 to Crystal Falls and north to Covington. US8's eastern end was rerouted along a separate bridge over the Menominee River to a new terminus at an intersection with US2 in Norway in 1929. US141 was fully paved in Wisconsin in the early 1930s; the last segment to be completed was between Pound and Abrams.|$|E

5|$|Menominees <b>from</b> <b>Green</b> Bay, who had mobilized a {{battalion}} of nearly 300 men, arrived {{too late for the}} battle. They were upset at having missed the chance to fight their old enemies, and so on August 10, General Scott sent 100 of them after a part of the British Band that had escaped. Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not to take any scalps, but Chief Grizzly Bear insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced. The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but spared the women and children.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} 26years, the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame {{encountered}} many expansions and renovations.

As of 2017, the Packers Hall of Fame has inducted 159people, 24 of whom have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The most recent inductees were cornerback Mark Lee and Packer's all-time leading receiver Donald Driver.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism <b>from</b> <b>green</b> to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E
