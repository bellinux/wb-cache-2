5|$|After losing six tosses {{against his}} English {{opposite}} number Stanley Jackson during the summer, Darling <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> different approach before the Scarborough Festival match {{late in the}} tour.

5|$|Before {{the trial}} began, {{supporters}} of the defendants <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> campaign of letter-writing and demonstrations: the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges be dropped.

5|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was completed}} in 1923, construction having been started {{under the auspices of}} the Great Northern Railway (GNR). It was built as an A1, initially carrying the GNR number 1472, because the LNER had not yet <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> system-wide numbering scheme.|$|E
5|$|After Docter {{scrapped}} {{the initial}} {{concept of a}} 30-year-old terrified of monsters, he <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> buddy story between a monster and a child titled simply Monsters, in which the monster character of Sulley (known at this stage as Johnson) was an up-and-comer at his workplace, where the company's purpose was to scare children.

5|$|After {{two months}} of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval power was not yet strong enough to confront the British Royal Navy. He <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{military}} expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India. Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, with the ultimate dream of linking with Tipu Sultan, a Muslim enemy of the British in India.|$|E
5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not find {{anything}} suitable in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> combination of two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing {{made it look like}} all shooting was done in the same area.|$|E
5|$|For {{his next}} major action, Gandhi <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, 25 {{miles south of}} Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. Around midnight of 4 May, as Gandhi was {{sleeping}} on a cot in a mango grove, the District Magistrate of Surat drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed constables. He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near Poona (now Pune).|$|E

5|$|In April 1937, Sayn-Wittgenstein <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{military}} career {{and joined the}} 17th Cavalry Regiment in Bamberg. He transferred to the Luftwaffe {{in the summer of}} 1937 and, in October, he was accepted at the flight training school in Braunschweig. He received his officer's commission and was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) in June 1938. Sayn-Wittgenstein served on various air bases from where he flew the Junkers Ju 88 and the Heinkel He 111. In the winter of 1938–39 he served as a Kampfbeobachter (combat observer or navigator) in Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG54—54th Bomber Wing) based at Fritzlar.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the approval of the}} new five-cent coin, the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern coins in 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This {{has come to be known}} as the Shield nickel.|$|E
5|$|Jerry Goldsmith had {{composed}} {{the music for}} The Motion Picture, but {{was not an option}} for The Wrath of Khan given the reduced budget; Meyer's composer for Time After Time, Miklós Rózsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive. Bennett and Meyer wanted the music for the film to go in a different direction, but had not <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> composer by the time filming began. Meyer initially hoped to hire an associate named John Morgan, but Morgan lacked film experience, which would have troubled the studio.|$|E

5|$|Scott had <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mixed {{transport}} strategy, {{relying on}} contributions from dogs, motor sledges and ponies. He appointed Cecil Meares {{to take charge}} of the dog teams, and recruited Shackleton's former motor specialist, Bernard Day, to run the motor sledges. Oates would {{be in charge of the}} ponies, but as he could not join the expedition until May 1910, Scott instructed Meares, who knew nothing of horses, to buy them—with unfortunate consequences for their quality and performance.|$|E
5|$|That same spring, {{however, the}} north rose up in {{rebellion}} once more, when Ralph Percy laid siege to Norham Castle. Warwick {{returned to the}} north and rescued Norham, but the Lancastrians were left in possession of Northumberland, and the government <b>decided</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> diplomatic approach instead. Separate truces were negotiated with Scotland and France, which allowed Warwick to retake the Northumbrian castles held by the Lancastrian rebels. This time no clemency was given, and around thirty of the rebel leaders were executed.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} was conceived by Edward Stratemeyer, {{founder of the}} Stratemeyer Syndicate.

While Stratemeyer believed that a woman's place was in the home, he was aware that the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.|$|E
