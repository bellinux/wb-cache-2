40|$|Study Design. An {{operator}} blinded dual modality {{trial of}} {{measurement of the}} abdominal muscles during <b>drawing-in</b> of the abdominal wall. Objectives. 1) To investigate, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), {{the function of the}} transversus abdominis muscle bilaterally during a <b>drawing-in</b> of the abdominal wall. 2) To validate the use of real-time ultrasound imaging as a measure of the deep abdominal muscle during a <b>drawing-in</b> of the abdominal wall. Summary of Background Data. Previous research has implicated the deep abdominal muscle, transversus abdominis, in the support and protection of the spine and provided evidence that training this muscle is important in the rehabilitation of low back pain. One of the most important actions of the transversus abdominis is to draw-in the abdominal wall, and this action has been shown to stiffen the sacroiliac joints. It is hypothesized that in response to a draw in, the transversus abdominis muscle forms a deep musculofascial corset and that MRI could be used to view this corset and verify its mechanism of action on the lumbopelvic region. Methods. Thirteen healthy asymptomatic male elite cricket players aged 21. 3 +/- 2. 1 years were imaged using MRI and ultrasound imaging as they drew in their abdominal walls. Measurements of the thickness of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles and the slide of the anterior abdominal fascia were measured using both MRI and ultrasound. Measurement of the whole abdominal cross-sectional area (CSA) was conducted using MRI. Results. Results of the MRI demonstrated that, as a result of draw-in, there was a significant increase in thickness of the transversus abdominis (P < 0. 001) and the internal oblique muscles (P < 0. 001). There was a significant decrease in the CSA of the trunk (P < 0. 001). The mean slide (+/- SD) of the anterior abdominal fascia was 1. 54 +/- 0. 38 cm for the left side and 1. 48 +/- 0. 35 cm for the right side. Ultrasound measurements of muscle thickness of both transversus abdominis and the internal oblique, as well as fascial slide, correlated with measures obtained using MRI (interclass correlations from 0. 78 to 0. 95). Conclusions. The MRI results demonstrated that during a <b>drawing-in</b> action, the transversus abdominis contracts bilaterally to form a musculofascial band that appears to tighten (like a corset) and most likely improves the stabilization of the lumbopelvic region. Real-time ultrasound imaging {{can also be used to}} measure changes in the transversus abdominis during the draw-in maneuver...|$|E

Methods: One hundred and forty-four female students, 13 – 17 years of age, participated in the study. Participants were divided into 2 groups based on a physical activity (PA) statement. Measurements of the thickness of the abdominal muscles at rest and during abdominal <b>drawing-in</b> manoeuvre were made in the supine and standing positions by ultrasound imaging. Results: Compared to the control group, activities of the obliquus internus and transversus abdominis muscles were higher in the regular PA group by 8. 9 % (95 %CI: 3. 1 – 14. 7) and 36 % (95 %CI: 19. 1 – 47. 5), respectively.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the test-retest intraobserver reliability of 2 -dimensional ultrasound {{measurement of the}} distance between the rectus abdominis muscles, the interrectus distance (IRD). BACKGROUND: Diastasis recti is defined as the separation of the 2 rectus abdominis muscles, with a reported prevalence of between 30 % and 70 % in women during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The condition is difficult to measure, and ultrasound imaging has been suggested as a useful method to quantify the diastasis. However, to date, no studies have investigated intratester or intertester reliability of ultrasound to measure {{the distance between the}} rectus abdominis muscles during rest and contraction. METHODS: Ultrasound images from the rectus abdominis were recorded in 24 healthy female volunteers at rest and under 2 conditions of abdominal contraction: abdominal crunch and <b>drawing-in</b> exercises. The probe was positioned at 2 locations: below and above the umbilicus. A blinded investigator measured the IRD offline from 2 different ultrasound images collected on 2 different days (test-retest). Additionally, reanalyses of the same ultrasound images were done on 2 separate occasions (intra-image). RESULTS: Test-retest measurements of IRD demonstrated good to very good reliability, with intraclass correlation coefficient values between 0. 74 and 0. 90. The only exception was for IRD measured 2 cm below the umbilicus during the abdominal crunch exercise, which had an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 50.

The definitive version is available at www. jospt. com: [URL] DESIGN: Single-group test-retest reliability study. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the test-retest intraobserver reliability of 2 -dimensional ultrasound measurement of {{the distance between the}} rectus abdominis muscles, the interrectus distance (IRD). BACKGROUND: Diastasis recti is defined as the separation of the 2 rectus abdominis muscles, with a reported prevalence of between 30 % and 70 % in women during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The condition is difficult to measure, and ultrasound imaging has been suggested as a useful method to quantify the diastasis. However, to date, no studies have investigated intratester or intertester reliability of ultrasound to measure the distance between the rectus abdominis muscles during rest and contraction. METHODS: Ultrasound images from the rectus abdominis were recorded in 24 healthy female volunteers at rest and under 2 conditions of abdominal contraction: abdominal crunch and <b>drawing-in</b> exercises. The probe was positioned at 2 locations: below and above the umbilicus. A blinded investigator measured the IRD offline from 2 different ultrasound images collected on 2 different days (test-retest). Additionally, reanalyses of the same ultrasound images were done on 2 separate occasions (intra-image). RESULTS: Test-retest measurements of IRD demonstrated good to very good reliability, with intraclass correlation coefficient values between 0. 74 and 0. 90. The only exception was for IRD measured 2 cm below the umbilicus during the abdominal crunch exercise, which had an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 50. For intratester reliability of the same images, the intraclass correlation coefficient values were all above 0. 90. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound imaging is a reliable method for measuring the IRD at rest and during abdominal crunch and <b>drawing-in</b> exercises...|$|E
40|$|All lateral {{abdominal}} muscles contract more strongly during maximum expiration {{than during the}} abdominal <b>drawing-in</b> maneuver (ADIM). However, {{little is known about}} which of the lateral {{abdominal muscles}} is activated during maximum expiration. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} is to quantify changes in the thickness of the lateral abdominal muscles immediately after the ADIM and maximum expiration. The thickness of the transverse abdominis (TrA), internal oblique (IO), and external oblique (EO) muscles was measured by ultrasound imaging in 30 healthy men before and after the ADIM and maximum expiration. After the ADIM, there was no significant change in the thickness of the lateral abdominal muscles. After maximum expiration, the thickness of the TrA muscle significantly increased, and there was no significant change in the thickness of the IO and EO muscles. Thus, maximum expiration may be an effective method for TrA, rather than IO and EO, muscle training...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the reliability of ultrasound imaging (USI) mea-surements of muscle thicknesses of patients with low back pain (LBP) performing the abdominal <b>drawing-in</b> ma-neuver (ADIM) [Subjects] Twenty patients with LBP were the subjects. [Methods] Muscle thickness measurements of transversus abdominis (Tra), internal obliques (IO), and external obliques (EO) muscles were measured using ultrasound imaging at rest and during performance of the ADIM. [Results] The intra-examiner reliability estimates ranged from 0. 55 to 0. 97 in the rest position, and from 0. 82 to 0. 95 during ADIM. The inter-examiner reliability estimates ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 98 in the rest position, and from 0. 86 to 0. 98 during ADIM. [Conclusion] ADIM thickness measurements of the TrA, IO, and EO muscles in patients with LBP based on the mean of 2 measures are highly reliable when taken by a single examiner and adequately reliable when taken by different examiners...|$|E
40|$|Doffing {{operation}} for the covering machine has been already automated by the auto <b>drawing-in</b> apparatus loaded on the autonomous vehicle. The vehicle repeats moving and stop while measuring its position and attitude {{with a pair}} of laser displacement sensors. In this report, control methods for this autonomous vehicle are investigated to approach the initial operating position rapidly, to break away {{at the end of the}} covering machine, and to turn around it. Fuzzy control was applied to the path tracking that the autonomous vehicle approaches the initial operating position of the covering machine. It obtains much rapider response than the method in which the front wheel takes on the reference path. Using this advantage of fuzzy control, it enables the vehicle to turn back over the side of the covering machine with stability. By means of this, the autonomous vehicle can directly use the machine frame as a guide way without any additions extraordinary to the covering machine...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the global manganese value chain, {{with the objective}} of understanding types and sources of project finance, and the role of development finance institutions (DFIs). We find that DFIs participation in transactions involving the iron group of metals, which encompasses manganese, was low for transactions completed between 2005 and 2010 as well as upcoming transactions between 2010 and 2015. Nonetheless, financing from local and multilateral development banks was countercyclical in nature; and in the very few transactions where multilateral development partners were involved, their participation was in the form of A-B or syndicated loans, <b>drawing-in</b> additional financing from commercial banks. Applied to the manganese mining sector specifically, these findings suggest limited need for DFIs financing. However, some features of the manganese market are assessed to have a tempering effect on private finance, in particular, the substantial and largely unmitigated market risk which improves the case for longer term DFIs financing. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{document}} the effect of a staged stabilization training program on the motor control of the anterolateral abdominal muscles in elite cricketers with and without low back pain (LBP). Changes in the cross-sectional area of the trunk, the thickness of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis (TrA) muscles and the shortening of the TrA muscle in response to an abdominal <b>drawing-in</b> task were measured at the start and completion of a 13 -week cricket training camp. Measures were performed using ultrasound imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. Participants from the group with LBP underwent a stabilization training program that involved performing voluntary contractions of the multifidus, TrA and pelvic floor muscles, while receiving feedback from ultrasound imaging. By the end of the training camp, the motor control of cricketers with LBP who received the stabilization training improved and was similar to that of the cricketers without LBP. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S...|$|E
