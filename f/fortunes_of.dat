5|$|Charles Kay, {{who played}} Pendleton, was a well {{established}} character actor who {{had appeared in}} Fall of Eagles (1974), I, Claudius (1976) and The Devil's Crown (1978). He has since acted in many television productions such as <b>Fortunes</b> <b>of</b> War (1989), The Darling Buds of May (1991–1993), Jonathan Creek (1997–2004) and Midsomer Murders (1997–present).|$|E

5|$|Following The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun, {{producer}} Harry Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions' parent company, Danjaq, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems, {{brought about by}} financial constraints following a downturn in the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> Technicolor, {{in which he had}} invested heavily. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. It appears {{that this was a}} conscious {{effort on the part of}} Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> Copán.|$|E
5|$|Not only {{credited}} with turning round the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> both Huddersfield Town and Arsenal, he {{is regarded as}} one of the game's first modernisers. He introduced new tactics and training techniques into the English game, as well as championing innovations such as floodlighting, European club competitions and numbered shirts, and has received many posthumous honours in recognition.|$|E

5|$|The Gardens {{feature in}} a number of other works of literature. They are the scene of a brief but pivotal turning point in the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> anti-heroine Becky Sharp in Thackeray's 19th-century novel Vanity Fair, as well as a setting in his novel Pendennis. Thomas Hardy sets scenes in his The Dynasts in the Gardens. In Cecilia by Frances Burney the Gardens are where the {{character}} Mr Harrell commits suicide.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{have been}} venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts, certain trees, {{especially}} the oak, ash and thorn, held special significance as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking {{the lives and}} <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> individuals to them or using them as oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads {{were believed to be}} shy nymphs who inhabited trees.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the moves}} made by Grand Met were {{successful}} in generating additional sales and growth, the company continued to experience problems. While Fortune Magazine named CEO Gibbons as its Turnaround Champion for his success in reversing the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> the company, several news outlets claimed that the changes he introduced were problematic because they deprived the company of valuable assets.|$|E
60|$|The {{superior}} workman scabs {{upon the}} inferior workman {{because he is}} so constituted and cannot help it. The one, by <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> birth and upbringing, is strong and capable; the other, by <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> birth and upbringing, is not so strong nor capable. It is {{for the same reason}} that one country scabs upon another. That country which has the good fortune to possess great natural resources, a finer sun and soil, unhampering institutions, and a deft and intelligent labor class and capitalist class is bound to scab upon a country less fortunately situated. It is the good <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> the United States that is making her the colossal scab, just as it is the good <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> one man to be born with a straight back while his brother is born with a hump.|$|R

5|$|After resigning the {{presidency}} of MAC in 1879, Clark left academia to become {{the president of a}} mining company, Clark & Bothwell. The company, in operation from 1881 to 1882, purchased several silver mines, mostly in Utah and California. Clark's partner, John R. Bothwell, proved to be corrupt and the company quickly folded, destroying Clark's reputation, his own finances and the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> many of his friends and family. The subsequent scandal ruined Clark's health. He died of heart disease at his home in Amherst in 1886.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey Stafford, 1st Earl of Devon (ca. 143917 August 1469) was a {{dominant}} magnate in south-western England in the mid-15th century, and {{a participant in}} the Wars of the Roses. A distant relative of the earls of Stafford, Humphrey Stafford became the greatest landowner in the county of Dorset through <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> inheritance. Later, Stafford was one of several men promoted rapidly through the nobility by King Edward IV, to fill the power vacuum left by dead or forfeit Lancastrians. In the West Country it was particularly the forfeitures of the Lancastrian Courtenay family that benefited Stafford. In 1469 he received the Courtenay title of earl of Devon.|$|E

5|$|In the Third Intermediate Period and the {{following}} Late Period (664–323 BC), the weakened Egyptian state fell {{to a series of}} outside powers, experiencing only occasional periods of independence. Many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen their claim to the kingship of Egypt. One such group, the Kushite pharaohs of the eighth and seventh centuriesBC, adopted Egyptian-style temple architecture for use in their native land of Nubia, beginning a long tradition of sophisticated Nubian temple building. Amid this turmoil, the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> various temples and clergies shifted and the independence of Amun's priesthood was broken, but the power of the priesthood in general remained.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been rumoured a deal was struck between Blair and Brown at the former Granita {{restaurant}} in Islington, in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the leadership election. Whether this is true or not, the relationship between Blair and Brown was central to the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> New Labour, and they mostly remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.|$|E
5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} {{took place}} in the Lower or Middle town area following a fire in 1791. In that year a Carrara marble statue of Queen Anne, sculpted by Francis Bird was presented to the town by Sir Jacob Bancks, who served as the local Member of Parliament from 1698 to 1715. It originally stood in the parish church but was moved to Wellington Square in 1893, when the marble pedestal and canopy by H. Dare Bryan were added. Lower town and the quay area were rebuilt and the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> the town revived with the growth in sea bathing, and by 1851 was becoming a retirement centre.|$|E

5|$|Manning was {{selected}} by the Indianapolis Colts as the first overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft. From 1998 to 2010, he improved the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> the struggling Colts franchise and helped transform them into consistent playoff contenders. During his tenure as starting quarterback, Manning led the team to eight division championships, two AFC championships, and one Super Bowl title, the franchise's first in over three decades, {{as well as their}} first since relocating to Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{as he did}} {{incidents}} {{in the order of}} their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past. Nor did his devotion to the justification and glorification of Florence permit him to see in the altered <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> his city a repetition of the pattern of decline he had illustrated in the histories of the great dynasties of his age.|$|E
5|$|The Hoops' defeat to Shelbourne in {{the first}} round of the FAI Cup in 1970, their first defeat in 32 Cup games over seven years, marked the start of the decline in the <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> the club. Despite only {{narrowly}} missing out on the League title in the 1970–71 season in controversial circumstances, the next twelve years proved to be a disaster for the club both on and off the field. On 25 April 1971, Rovers met Cork Hibs in Dalymount in a League play-off watched by 28,000 people. Their pre-match buildup was thrown into disarray when players and directors clashed over win bonuses. Hibs won the play-off 3–1. The next season, the Cunninghams, now under the control of sons Arthur and Des, sold the club to three brothers from Dublin; Paddy, Barton and Louis Kilcoyne. The Kilcoynes had witnessed decades of huge attendances at Irish football games and sought to take over the club primarily for business reasons. However, within the space of five years, the large crowds disappeared from Irish football stadia and combined with the demise of Drumcondra and Cork Hibs, the decline in <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> a number of top clubs and the lack of action by the FAI, the League of Ireland was plunged into a drastic decline.|$|E
