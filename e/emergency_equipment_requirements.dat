A validated questionnaire and a checklist were used as the research instruments and 37 fitness centres were randomly selected from four major towns in the two states. The findings of the study helped to throw more light on the current state of play regarding safety and <b>emergency</b> <b>equipment</b> and measures. It revealed that fitness centres in Edo and Delta States are far from meeting the required recommendations for safety and <b>emergency</b> <b>equipment</b> and measures...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Trauma and {{emergencies}} {{contribute to}} the quadruple burden of disease in South Africa and being prepared for an emergency requires rapid access to <b>emergency</b> <b>equipment,</b> drugs and <b>emergency</b> trolleys to optimally manage an emergency. This is the first descriptive study looking specifically at essential <b>emergency</b> <b>equipment,</b> drugs and the emergency trolley required {{for the provision of}} optimal emergency care at Community Health Centres (CHCs) in the Western Cape Metropole. Aims and Objectives The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate whether eight 24 hour emergency units at CHCs in the Western Cape Metropole had the appropriate and essential <b>emergency</b> <b>equipment,</b> drugs and <b>emergency</b> trolleys necessary for the delivery of optimal emergency care, using the Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa (EMSSA) guidelines as the audit tool. Objectives included: 1. 	To assess availability of essential <b>emergency</b> <b>equipment</b> 2. 	To assess availability of essential emergency drugs 3. 	To assess the functionality of existing emergency trolleys Methodology EMSSA guidelines were used as the evaluation audit tool to perform a survey of <b>emergency</b> <b>equipment,</b> drugs and <b>emergency</b> trolleys at eight 24 hour CHCs in the Western Cape Metro pole. Data collection for the study was conducted at the eight 24 hour CHCs over a 3 month period during the months of June 2012 to August 2012. The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Health Sciences (Statistica, version 10 of 2012) and Microsoft Excel. Results A total of 81 <b>emergency</b> <b>equipment</b> items, 43 <b>emergency</b> drug items (37 emergency drugs, 6 intravenous fluids) and 78 emergency trolley items were required to be in each emergency unit. An average of 62 % of all recommended <b>emergency</b> <b>equipment</b> items, 80 % of all emergency drugs and 52. 4 % of all emergency trolley items were found to be present in this survey. Essential <b>emergency</b> paediatric <b>equipment</b> including bag ventilation devices, Magillâ€™s forceps, masks, intraosseous needles and appropriate blood pressure cuffs were found to be absent at 2 CHCs. All CHCs had access to a defibrillator and ECG machine but these were found to be dysfunctional at 2 CHCs due to expired batteries and no tracing paper being available. Expired first line emergency drugs (adrenaline and atropine) were found at certain CHCs. The recording of emergency trolley checklists and stocking of essential emergency items were found to be incongruent, inconsistent and not up to the recommended standard. Conclusion Essential <b>emergency</b> <b>equipment</b> and drugs and the functionality of emergency trolleys were found to be generally inadequate. Considerable deficiencies of essential emergency items were found, particularly paediatric equipment and drugs and this may negatively impact on resuscitative efforts and outcome in both paediatric and adult emergency care at CHCs in the Western Cape Metropole...|$|R
