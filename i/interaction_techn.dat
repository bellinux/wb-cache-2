The ubiquity of pen/pencil and paper {{as a way of}} recording many types of data shows the promise of PUIs. A significant advantage of PUIs over paper is the ability to easily edit data. Editing commands in PUIs are often invoked through the use of special marks called gestures. A PUI typically has many gestures available for use at the same time. The set of gestures available for use simultaneously is a gesture set. Unfortunately, it is difficult to design a gesture set for a PUI whose elements can be reliably recognized by the computer and easily learned and remembered by the users. This difficulty is due, at least in part, to the lack of tools for designing good gesture sets. Another challenge for PUI design is that because of its novelty there are few <b>interaction</b> <b>techn...</b>|$|E
