40|$|AbstractBackground and purpose: Patients with {{prostate}} cancer (PC) and a symptomatic pelvic tumor may be treated with palliative pelvic radiotherapy for symptom relief or to delay symptom progression. Radiotherapy <b>dose</b> and <b>fractionation</b> regimens vary. We aimed to {{provide an overview of}} the literature and to evaluate palliative pelvic radiotherapy of PC focusing on symptomatic effect, quality of life (QOL), and toxicity, and to determine the optimal radiotherapy schedule. Material and methods: Systematic literature searches of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were performed through 2011. Studies reporting symptom and QOL responses were eligible. Results: Nine studies were included, all retrospective chart reviews. There were large variations in radiotherapy <b>dose</b> and <b>fractionation.</b> Overall symptom response rate was 75 % and positive responses were reported for hemorrhage (73 %), pain (80 %), bladder outlet obstruction (63 %), rectal symptoms (78 %) and ureteric obstruction (62 %).

Materials and methods: We collected data on diagnosis, <b>dose</b> <b>fractionation</b> and waiting times on all patients in the UK starting a course of radiotherapy in the week commencing 26 September 2005. Excluding skin cancer, 2610 patients were prescribed 34194 fractions. Results: Radiotherapy access rates were 38 % in England, 43 % in Scotland and 37 % in Wales. These are all lower than the 52 % of cancer patients recommended by modelling. To increase access to the recommended level, a 33 % increase in activity is required across the UK. For each of 13 cancer diagnoses, we modelled optimum fractionation and compared it with current practice.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the potential in substantially improving Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) radiotherapy outcome through personalized spatial dose distributions with 4 π radiotherapy and temporal <b>dose</b> <b>fractionation</b> schedule optimization with patient-specific biological models. Methods: An ordinary differential equation (ODE) model with consideration of {{cancer stem cell}} (CSC) dynamics that incorporates the distinct radiosensitivity between CSC and its non-stem counterpart, differentiated cancer cells (DCC) has been developed and shown {{to be capable of}} reflecting the definitive treatment failure of GBM was developed. Seven patient-specific models were fitted to match the known times to GBM recurrence of these patients. Recurrence volume of each patient was transferred to generate hypothetical subvolumes with higher tumor aggressiveness on the original clinical plan to receive simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to study the compound effect in outcome improvement arising from spatial and temporal dose optimization. For each patient, the boost dose is maximized subject to the constraints maintaining acceptable dose to surrounding OARs and coverage to the original planning target volume. With the patient-specific biological models and boost dose, a <b>dose</b> <b>fractionation</b> schedule optimization (FSO) problem with the time interval between fractions and the dose to both the non-boost and boost volumes as variables was formulated and solved with a paired simulated annealing algorithm for boost volumes {{with a wide range of}} CSC concentrations. Results:Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dosage of up to 245 Gy within a 60 Gy PTV was shown to be feasible with the 4 π SIB optimization formulation. Statistically significant OAR sparing was still achieved with 4 π SIB compared with the originally delivered clinical plan with no boost. FSO resulted in high dose fractions in the beginning of the treatment course, followed by relatively constant dose fractions. Scenarios with lower CSC concentration within the boost volume resulted in fractionation schedules with dense once per day fractions in the beginning followed by a long time interval in the end with no treatment. With boost volume CSC concentration increased by 100 fold, maximum recurrence delay of up to 392 days was observed for a patient with the slowest growing disease. Conclusions: By combining the spatial dose sparing power of 4 π radiotherapy and temporal <b>dose</b> <b>fractionation</b> optimization with a CSC dynamics biological model in a personalized manner, significant potential in GBM disease recurrence delay was demonstrated across a cohort with differing disease characteristics.

However, to date, the appropriate total radiation <b>dose</b> and <b>fractionation</b> have not yet been confirmed. The authors performed a retrospective analysis to identify the appropriate radiation <b>dose</b> and <b>fractionation</b> in post-keloidectomy radiotherapy. MethodsFrom May 2000 to February 2011, postoperative radiotherapy was performed on 39 lesions in 28 patients after total keloidectomy. The keloid lesions were confined to the ear lobes. Between May 2000 and May 2004, 14 keloids were treated with surgical excision, followed by a total radiation dose of 1, 200 cGy in three fractions over four to five days (group 1). Between June 2004 to February 2011, 25 keloids were treated with surgical excision, followed by a total radiation dose of 1, 500 cGy in three fractions over four to five days (group 2). Patients were given a survey asking them to report their experiences regarding reoperation, recurrence of symptoms, recurrence of the lesion, and satisfaction with the operation. ResultsOf the 28 patients who were treated, 20 underwent follow-up. Group 2 had more cases showing elevation with erythematous changes, whereas group 1 had more cases showing progressive stages of elevation than group 2.

40|$|Background: Stereotactic body {{radiotherapy}} (SBRT) is {{an emerging}} treatment option for spinal metastases with demonstrated efficacy in the upfront, postoperative, and re-treatment settings, {{as well as}} for tumor histologies considered radioresistant. Uncertainty exists regarding the optimal <b>dose</b> and <b>fractionation</b> schedule, with single and multifraction regimens commonly utilized. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed and Medline databases was conducted to identify papers specific to spine SBRT and the effect of varying dose/fractionation regimens on outcomes. Bibliographies of relevant papers were searched for further references, and international spine SBRT experts were consulted. Results: Local control rates generally exceed 80 % at 1 year, while high rates of pain control have been attained. There is insufficient evidence to suggest superiority of either single or multiple fraction regimens with respect to local control and pain control. Low rates of toxicity have been reported, assuming strict dose constraints are respected. Radiation myelopathy may be the most morbid toxicity, although the rates are low. The risk of vertebral compression fracture appears to be associated with higher doses per fraction such as those used in single-fraction regimens. The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score should be considered when evaluating patients for spine SBRT, and prophylactic stabilisation may be warranted. Pain flare is a relatively common toxicity which may be mediated with prophylactic dexamethasone. Because of the treatment complexity and potentially serious toxicities, strict quality assurance should occur at the organizational, planning, dosimetric, and treatment delivery levels. Conclusion: Both single and multifraction regimens are safe and efficacious in spine SBRT for spinal metastases. There may be advantages to hypofractionated treatment over single-fraction regimens with respect to toxicity.

40|$|International audienceThe {{limits of}} TDF (time, <b>dose,</b> and <b>fractionation)</b> and linear {{quadratic}} {{models have been}} {{known for a long}} time. Medical physicists and physicians are required to provide fast and reliable interpretations regarding the delivered doses or any future prescriptions relating to treatment changes. We therefore propose a calculation interface under the GNU license to be used for equivalent doses, biological doses, and normal tumor complication probability (Lyman model). The methodology used draws from several sources: the linear-quadratic-linear model of Astrahan, the repopulation effects of Dale, and the prediction of multi-fractionated treatments of Thames. The results are obtained from an algorithm that minimizes an ad-hoc cost function, and then compared to the equivalent dose computed using standard calculators in seven French radiotherapy centers...|$|R
40|$|Rat thymic {{epithelial}} cells were cultured for 39 {{days in the}} presence of various concentrations of oestradiol, testosterone, progesterone and corticosterone and the supernatants assessed for effects on the stimulation of cells from the thymus, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen, with several agents. All the steroids, except progesterone, were found to significantly regulate the secretion of immunoregulatory factors by the {{epithelial cells}} at physiological levels but the effects were <b>dose</b> dependent. <b>Fractionation</b> of active supernatants indicated that the capacity to enhance or depress cellular proliferation was mainly associated with substances having molecular weights greater than 30, 000 or less than 1000, respectively. This study supports the idea that certain steroids can influence the immune response indirectly through the thymus...|$|R
