5|$|Group G {{lies just}} south of the Mendez Causeway. The complex dates to the Late Classic and {{consists}} of palace-type structures {{and is one of the}} largest groups of its type at Tikal. It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor, a total of 29 vaulted chambers. The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey. One of the entrances to the group was <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> gigantic mask.|$|E
5|$|The {{house at}} Valley View is a two-story brick Greek Revival-style {{structure}} with a rectangular architectural plan. The front entrance {{is covered by}} a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. The rear of the house, with a two-story (double) wood porch stretching across it, faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> wooden trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The original windows, wooden trim, and materials in the main section of the house are intact. In 2012, Valley View was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its locally significant architecture.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> set of monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of}} the shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Ben Youssef Mosque, {{distinguished}} by its green tiled roof and minaret, {{is located in}} the medina and is Marrakesh's oldest mosque. It was originally built in the 12th century by the Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf in honor of Yusuf ibn Ali al-Sanhaji. When built it was the city's largest mosque but today it is half its original size. It was rebuilt in the 1560s by Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib, as the original had fallen into ruin. He also built a madrasa with a large library beside the mosque, but this also deteriorated over time, leaving only the 19th-century mosque intact. The Almoravid Koubba Ba’adiyn, a two-storied kiosk, was discovered in a sunken location on the mosque site in 1948. In the Moroccan architectural style, its arches are scalloped on the first floor, while those on the second floor bear a twin horseshoe shape embellished with a turban motif. The dome of the kiosk is <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> battlement decorated with arches and seven-pointed stars. The interior of the octagonally arched dome is decorated with distinctive carvings bordered by a Kufic frieze inscribed with the name of its patron, Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf. The quinches at the corners of the dome are covered with muqarnas. The kiosk has motifs of pine cones, palms and acanthus leaves which are also replicated in the Ben Youssef Madrasa.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} slavery was finally {{confronted by the}} new Maryland Constitution of 1864 which the state adopted late in that year. The document, which {{replaced}} the Maryland Constitution of 1851, was pressed by Unionists who had secured control of the state, and was <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Convention which met at Annapolis in April 1864. Article 24 of the constitution at last outlawed the practice of slavery.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} memorial {{walls are}} made from the community's salvaged bricks, which are inscribed with messages of grief and gratitude. Beyond the walls, a site <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> grove of casuarinas contains red glass and metal forms, referring to {{the force of the}} firestorm and to the lightning strikes that sparked the main fires. An avenue leads to an amphitheatre enclosing a pond and bubbling spring. Glass columns bordering the pond contain details from photos provided by the community which speak of memory and human resilience.|$|E
25|$|A {{network of}} paved roads, many named after trees and shrubs, {{runs through the}} {{cemetery}}. The rises in the terrain are terraced to allow for level gravesites. There are three entrances from Route 31; the central one across from the cemetery offices is the main entrance. It is <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> carved Medina sandstone arch with a slate roof and iron gates. A short distance south is a small parking lot and sandstone chapel, a Gothic building with steep gabled roof shingled in slate.|$|E

50|$|The {{church of}} San Tommaso is of note for its 15th-century belfry, with three orders. It has windows <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> agile full-centered archivolt. The church {{contains}} a marble icon (1515) attributed to Giuliano Mancino and precious frescoes by Borremans.|$|R
25|$|In some depictions, {{the central}} tauroctony is <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of {{subsidiary}} scenes to the left, top and right, illustrating {{events in the}} Mithras narrative; Mithras being born from the rock, the water miracle, the hunting and riding of the bull, meeting Sol who kneels to him, shaking hands with Sol and sharing a meal of bull-parts with him, and ascending to the heavens in a chariot. In some instances, {{as is the case}} in the stucco icon at Santa Prisca mithraeum, the god is shown heroically nude.|$|E
25|$|The door {{giving access}} to the minaret is <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> lintel and jambs made of {{recycled}} carved friezes of antique origin. There are stone blocks from the Roman period that bear Latin inscriptions. Their use probably dates to the work done under the Umayyad governor Bishr ibn Safwan in about 725 AD, {{and they have been}} reused {{at the base of the}} tower. The greater part of the minaret dates from the time of the Aghlabid princes in the ninth century. It consists of regular layers of carefully cut rubble stone, thus giving the work a stylistically admirable homogeneity and unity.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the {{staircase}} proceeded using several cream and taupe colored marbles including Vermont Westland cream. The new Grand Staircase was <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> rectilinear archway, with the interior side walls faced with the seals of the original 13 states. Above the opening facing the Cross Hall was a plaster arch with a spread American eagle in bas relief with a corona of 13 radiating arrows. A contrasting marble string course with triglyphs and five pointed stars projected around the stairwell at the landing. Winslow designed a custom railing with cast iron balusters that incorporated the five pointed federal star within a circle he used in the carved moulding.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, Justice Chua {{said that}} due to the {{differences}} in the way the Singapore and Indian Constitutions were made, the Singapore Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is not limited in the manner the Indian Parliament's is when amending the Indian Constitution. The Indian Constitution was <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> constituent assembly, while Singapore's Constitution was put together by the Parliament out of three different documents, namely, the 1963 State Constitution, the RSIA, and provisions drawn from the Federal Constitution of Malaysia. Parliament had plenary power to enact the RSIA from the political fact of Singapore's independence and status as a sovereign nation on 9 August 1965.|$|E
25|$|Bernini's ingenious {{solution}} {{was to create a}} piazza in two sections. That part which is nearest the basilica is trapezoid, but rather than fanning out from the facade, it narrows. This gives the effect of countering the visual perspective. It means that from {{the second part of the}} piazza, the building looks nearer than it is, the breadth of the facade is minimized and its height appears greater in proportion to its width. The second section of the piazza is a huge elliptical circus which gently slopes downwards to the obelisk at its center. The two distinct areas are <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> colonnade formed by doubled pairs of columns supporting an entablature of the simple Tuscan Order.|$|E
25|$|After the {{independence}} {{of most of the}} Portuguese overseas territories in the 1974-1975 period and after 500 years of being a multi-continental country, Portugal became again mainly confined to its European territory. After the end of the political instability period that followed the Carnation Revolution and the tutelage of the Armed Forces over the new regime, the Portuguese Army returned to the barracks and began the process of changing from an oversized colonial and counter-insurgency army to a conventional European army, including drastic personnel reductions, disbanding of some units, acquisition of new arms and equipment, reorganizing units and roles and fielding new headquarters. In the late 1970s and in the 1980s, the main concern of the Army became again the possible conflict with the Warsaw Pact in Europe, in the scope of the latest period of the Cold War. The Army continued to be mainly staffed with conscripts, <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> core of professional officers and NCOs.|$|E
