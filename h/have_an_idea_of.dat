By establishing a pattern, sometimes {{with the use of}} a powerful computer, mathematicians may <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. For example, the Collatz conjecture has been verified for start values up to about 2.88√ó1018. The Riemann hypothesis has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the zeta function. Neither of these statements is considered proved.|$|E

If a particular publisher in 1977 {{were satisfied with the}} exchange-value of 60 Steloj for one year, Mee's studies concerning the Stelo predicted that the exchange value of 60 Steloj would continue to be sufficient in future years.

25|$|We can <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{the quality}} of the {{university}} in what were seeing what some of his professors. Among the most famous, who are many, just to cite Estius (1542‚Äì1613), the famous commentator of the epistles of Paul. After classical studies at Utrecht, he then spent two decades in Leuven, studying philosophy, theology and Scripture and in 1580 he received the degree of doctor of theology. In 1582 he became professor of theology at Douai, a position he held for thirty-one years, and he joined her in the last eighteen years of his life with that of Chancellor of the university, while also being the many years rector of the diocesan seminary. The works of Estius were written in Latin and for the most part, their publications were posthumous. Note also Lessius Leonardus (1554‚Äì1623), professing the philosophy, and Francois du Bois, said Franciscus Sylvius (1581‚Äì1649) , professor of theology and vice-chancellor of the university, but also Nemius Gaspard Dubois, George Colveneere, and Philippe Bossuet Cosp√©an which involved in the controversy of Douai.|$|E

500|$|DJ Hero has {{received}} positive reviews from the gaming press, who consider the title as a fresh restart {{of the music}} genre given {{the large number of}} titles based on guitar play. The turntable peripheral was considered to be well designed {{to meet the needs of}} the game. The unit's weight, size, and shape, and ability to cater to both left- and right-handed players was commended. Many reviewers noted a need to alter the action of the crossfader, either by having better physical feedback to the player to indicate the center of the knob's track, or by reducing the width of the track to better handle the rapid crossfade maneuvers. Reviewers also noted that there was a certain weight to the turntable portion of the controller which made scratching imprecise, particularly with the inner blue button where only minimal torque can be applied. The learning curve of the game across the various mixes was highly commended by reviewers for helping players to get used to the new controller. When progressing from [...] "Medium" [...] to [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] levels and encountering more complex mixes, reviewers thought the game felt transformed, bringing a difficult but more rewarding experience to the player as they begin emulating every part of a real DJ's motions. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer considered that while the learning curve is steep, with the [...] "Easy" [...] difficulty being [...] "less thrilling and engaging" [...] compared to Guitar Hero, the game was [...] "structured fabulously to nudge you gradually closer to the summit" [...] with each successive career set and difficulty mode. Cam Shae of IGN Australia felt that the changes in [...] "Hard" [...] mode over [...] "Medium" [...] were somewhat excessive, introducing both more crossfade effects and button-pressing, and felt these could have been introduced separately in [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] modes. [...] Richard Li of 1UP.com noted that the inability to fail a song is both [...] "a bane and a boon"; newer players would not feel frustration at trying to get used to the controller and would be able to quickly unlock all the sets in the game's career mode, but without knowing where they failed, they would not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> where they need to hone their skills to improve their performance at the game. The omission of a practice mode was noted by Daemon Hatfield of IGN, believing it would help in some of the more complex mixes by the DJ celebrities. Reviewers believed that the small faults in DJ Hero can be easily fixed for potential sequels.|$|E

2500|$|The Phaedrus {{also gives}} us {{much in the}} way of {{explaining}} how art should be practiced. The discussion of rhetoric, the proper practice of which is found to actually be philosophy, has many similarities with Socrates's role as a [...] "midwife of the soul" [...] in the Theaetetus; the dialectician, as described, is particularly resonant. To practice the art, one must have a grasp of the truth and a detailed understanding of the soul in order to properly persuade. Moreover, one must <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what is good or bad for the soul and, as a result, know what the soul should be persuaded towards. To have mastered the tools of an art is not to have mastered the art itself, but only its preliminaries. This is much like the person who claims to have mastered harmony after learning the highest and lowest notes of the lyre. To practice an art, one must know what that art is for and what it can help one achieve.|$|E

The Sunday Times echoed this sentiment, stating that [...] "the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit {{and those who are}} going to read them". The New York Herald Tribune also seemed to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how popular the books would become, writing in its review that they were [...] "destined to outlast our time".

2500|$|Taking on the {{functional}} approach of leadership, leaders {{have to think}} about responsibilities that are taken out in the organization. The functional approach looks at the communication behavior of the leaders. Through functional leadership, roles have to be taken for the organization to function properly. The roles help give followers classifications, so they <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what is expected of them. Roles in {{the functional}} approach are task related, group building and maintenance, and individual. These roles allow for tasks to be accomplished and also to build up the organization through positive reinforcement, but also take away conflict that occurs. The task related role gives followers a sense of direction for an assignment to be completed in the group. Group building and maintenance roles steer the organization for open, supportive and healthy relationships with other followers in the organization. This role also helps to eliminate tension between workers and allows for sides to be heard on different topics that arise. However, in an organization the [...] "me" [...] wants to come out and this creates the individual role in the organization. Even though taking on an individual role can be healthy for the self because it creates autonomy, it also can be detrimental to the organization because it reduces the amount of group effectiveness. Being a functional leader allows for the organization to run like a machine and having all the parts work together to accomplish a common goal.|$|E
