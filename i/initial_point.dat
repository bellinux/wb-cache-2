The <b>initial</b> <b>pointing</b> errors during prism exposure occur {{in the same direction}} of the visual shift.

25|$|Chaos {{theory is}} {{a branch of}} {{mathematics}} focused {{on the behavior of}} dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.

The butterfly effect describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in Texas.|$|E

25|$|At one point, {{both the}} German {{government}} and the German Air Force had been keen to relocate pilot training activities from the United States to France {{as part of the}} project. In 1971, however, this was abandoned over fears of a hostile US reaction and West Germany's offset obligations to the United States making such a move unpalatable. While the joint Franco-German training proposal was abandoned, the German government felt obligated to proceed with the aircraft program; at the time, Germany did not require a new trainer aircraft, but it did have a need for a replacement for its fleet of Fiat G.91 attack aircraft. Accordingly, Germany proposed that the aircraft be built in two distinct versions, as an inexpensive trainer for the French requirement, and as a close air support platform for the German requirement; this position was accepted by France. An <b>initial</b> <b>point</b> of contention whether to use a French or American powerplant for the aircraft was also settled, with France agreeing to solely finance the development of the French-built Larzac engine while Germany agreed to adopt the same powerplant.|$|E

Both the terrain and wind were unfavourable. Consideration {{was given to}} the stunt being done using cranes but aerial stunts arranger B. J. Worth stuck to skydiving and completed the scenes in a day. The aircraft used for the jump was a C-130 Hercules, which in the film had M's office installed in the aircraft cabin. The <b>initial</b> <b>point</b> of view for the scene shows M in what appears to be his usual London office, but the camera then zooms out to reveal that it is, in fact, inside an aircraft. Although marked as a Royal Air Force aircraft, the one in shot belonged to the Spanish Air Force and was used again later in the film for the Afghanistan sequences, this time in [...] "Russian" [...] markings. During this later chapter, a fight breaks out on the open ramp of the aircraft in flight between Bond and Necros, before Necros falls to his death. Although the plot and preceding shots suggest the aircraft is a C-130, the shot of Necros falling away from the aircraft show a twin engine cargo plane, a C-123 Provider. Worth and Lombard also doubled for Bond and Necros in the scenes where they are hanging on a bag in a plane's open cargo door.|$|E

Hence, we can make use of these characters and choose several points as the fixed <b>initial</b> <b>points.</b> However, if all the <b>initial</b> <b>points</b> are fixed, there will be a possibility for the algorithm to lose the randomness for severe motion videos.

The formulated optimal design problems are generally constrained, nonlinear, multimodal, and even without closed-form analytical expressions.
