25|$|The {{legal dispute}} between Black Flag and Unicorn tied the band up {{for almost two}} years, during which time they {{released}} Everything Went Black, a double album of pre-Rollins outtakes, under {{the names of the}} individual musicians and vocalists on the record. Unicorn ended up filing even more legal briefs, claiming that Black Flag had violated a court injunction against releasing new records. Ginn and Dukowski <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> several days in Los Angeles County Jail for contempt of court, but the case fizzled out soon afterward when Unicorn went out of business, freeing Black Flag of any further obligation to the label.|$|E

25|$|David Seltzer {{wrote the}} first draft for Punchline in 1979 after {{becoming}} fascinated by comedy clubs while {{looking for someone to}} play a psychiatrist on a television pilot that he was writing. He had a development deal with the movie division of ABC. Originally, the tone of the film was more good-natured a la Fame (1980) with more characters and less of an emphasis on Steven Gold. Bob Bookman, an executive, sponsored the script but left for Columbia Pictures. He bought the screenplay because Howard Zieff was interested in directing it. When Zieff lost interest (he <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> Unfaithfully Yours in 1984), the script was buried for years.|$|E

The band had previously scored Berg's 2004 film Friday Night Lights, and Jablonsky had previously scored Battleship. Jablonsky {{said of the}} collaboration, [...] "It was great. I didn't work directly with them because they're in Austin, Texas and I'm in L.A. I spoke {{to them on the}} phone and I think sixty, sixty‑five percent of the scores is them.

500|$|Some in the UFA {{had long}} favoured contesting {{elections}} directly {{as a political}} party instead of remaining on the sidelines as a pressure group, but Wood and other UFA leaders were implacably opposed to the idea. [...] During the war, however, the political wing began to gain momentum, and at the 1919 UFA convention, {{it was decided that}} UFA candidates would contest the next provincial election. In fact, it <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> so somewhat sooner: in 1919, Charles W. Fisher, Liberal MLA for Cochrane, {{died as a result of}} that year's influenza epidemic, and a by-election was necessitated to replace him.

500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> what they really wanted to do. I was not going to let that happen with Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|E
500|$|Kulwicki {{began his}} racing {{career as a}} 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work {{involved}} travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying {{to find someone to}} transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> most of the work himself. [...] "I showed him how", Gerry Kulwicki said. [...] "And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if you do it for a while, you can do it better.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{the scene}} in which John almost falls to his death while {{restoring}} the mosaic in San Nicolò church was also beset by problems, and resulted in Donald Sutherland's life being put in danger. [...] The scene entailed some of the scaffolding collapsing leaving John dangling by a rope, but the stuntman refused to perform the stunt because the insurance was not in order. Sutherland <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> it instead, and was attached to a kirby wire as a precaution in case he should fall. Some time after the film had come out, renowned stunt co-ordinator Vic Armstrong commented to Sutherland that the wire was not designed for that purpose, and the twirling around caused by {{holding on to the}} rope would have damaged the wire to the extent it would have snapped if Sutherland had let go.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} mixed by Bruce Swedien times—unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien {{to create a}} drum sound {{that no one had}} ever heard before. The audio {{engineer}} was also told to add a different element: [...] "sonic personality". [...] "What I <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" [...] Swedien later wrote. [...] "The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is." [...] He concluded, [...] "But I think that is the case with 'Billie Jean'—and that I attribute to sonic personality." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject {{to a lot of}} people, {{but the point is that}} Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> the rest". Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and I am so not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{once again}} {{played on the}} second stage at the 2006 Ozzfest, now {{as part of the}} {{non-rotating}} lineup along with Black Label Society, Unearth, Atreyu and Norma Jean. In addition to their own headline dates, they also filled Ozzfest [...] "off dates" [...] with shows supporting Disturbed, Avenged Sevenfold and Hatebreed. The band members were on a day off from the festival passing through Medford, Oregon, when they pulled into a Taco Bell parking lot to eat. This resulted in a fan recognizing them and then calling over a bunch of his friends. The band talked with the fans, signed autographs, posed for pictures and also asked the kids if there were any shows happening that night they could participate in. They <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> a small club concert with local bands, with roughly 150 people in attendance. The show was a benefit with all proceeds going toward cancer research.|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Wild Night", {{a hybrid of}} R, soul and country music influences, which {{utilizes}} a moderate 4/4 time signature and features the lead guitar playing of Ronnie Montrose. The song's intro was created, according to Montrose, [...] when [...] "One afternoon I was messing around with {{what is now the}} intro on the record, [...] stopped me and ... said ' ... that thing you just played ... that's the intro, don't forget it'". This guitar driven intro in Clinton Heylin's opinion made it one of Morrison's most memorable singles. [...] "Wild Night", which has been described by biographer Ken Brooks as [...] "a great start to the album", was first recorded after the Astral Weeks sessions in Autumn 1968 and was re-recorded numerous times before its eventual release on Tupelo Honey. Morrison recalled during an interview that the song was originally [...] "a much slower number, but when we got to fooling around with it in the studio, we <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> it in a faster tempo." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{buying the}} rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active {{development}} in November 1995. Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaption of the book before, when he bought {{the rights to}} the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey. In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg and had an argument with him how much should the film appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson's ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous. Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film , and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; [...] "We both <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> a lot of everything," [...] Adamson said. [...] "We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Spotnitz's {{favorite}} magician was Ricky Jay, and so, for the episode, Jay {{was brought}} in to play the part of The Amazing Maleeni. Initially, however, the episode hit a snag. The production crew discovered that Jay's production agency had not been informed and that he would be unable to guest star in the episode. The staff's back-up magician, David Blaine, was unavailable for shooting as well. Series creator Chris Carter, however, later stated that the show would not take no for an answer: [...] "We got on the phone with him. He agreed to come to our offices to talk about the script and <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> some card tricks for us that reduced Frank and I to being six-year-olds again." [...] Jay eventually agreed to do the part, but requested that he only do the tricks he was accustomed to doing. Thus, many of Jay's trademark tricks were included in the episode's script. Gilligan, in retrospect, later noted, [...] "There was no choice other than Ricky Jay as far as we were concerned. He was not looking forward to the idea of playing a magician because I think he felt that magicians were never portrayed very realistically in movies or television shows." ...|$|E
