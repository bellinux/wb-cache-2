50|$|In January 2003 Gill {{bought a}} Bakelite 1960s box camera made by Coronet for 50 pence at Hackney Wick Sunday market, near where he lived. The camera had a plastic lens, and it lacked focus and <b>exposure</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|E

40|$|Security of {{test items}} is {{paramount}} in computerized adaptive testing (CAT) where tests are shorter and given on demand {{and therefore more}} susceptible to over exposure than traditional paper-and-pencil tests. A number of algorithms {{have been developed to}} <b>control</b> <b>exposure</b> rates of items during CAT. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the accuracy of three <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> procedures using a CAT system based on the generalized partial credit model. The Sympson-Hetter, modified within. 10 logits, and randomesque procedures were investigated. For the modified within. 10 logits and randomesque procedures, either 3 or 6 items were included in the item group from which the next item to be administered was randomly selected. A no <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> condition was also included as a baseline for comparison of the <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> procedures. The results revealed that the Sympson-Hetter procedure performed better than the other <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> procedures in terms of fewer non-convergent cases and good <b>control</b> of maximum <b>exposure</b> rates. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{illuminance}} E {{is controlled}} by the f-number but also depends on the scene luminance. To avoid confusion, some authors (Ray 2000, 310) have used camera exposure to refer to combinations of camera settings. The 1964 ASA standard for automatic <b>exposure</b> <b>controls</b> for cameras, ASA PH2.15-1964, took the same approach, and also used the more descriptive term camera exposure settings.|$|E
50|$|The major {{improvements}} in the FM3A compared to the FM2N are the hybrid electro-mechanically controlled aluminium-bladed focal plane shutter, the aperture priority auto-exposure mode, the match-needle exposure control system and provision for through-the-lens (TTL) off-the-film (OTF) electronic flash automation. In other words, the FM3A merged the robust mechanical systems of the FM2N with the proven, reliable electronic <b>exposure</b> <b>controls</b> of the FE2.|$|E

50|$|The basic C3 model {{underwent}} {{only minor}} revisions from its introduction {{until it was}} discontinued in 1966. For instance, the number of shutter speeds was lowered from ten to seven to five, an accessory shoe was added, and the exposure reminder dial {{on the back of}} the camera was removed. There was a variant featuring color-coded <b>exposure</b> <b>controls</b> known as the Colormatic. A second-generation C3 with an improved lens and more comfortable controls, the Standard C3, came out in 1958, though it was otherwise nearly identical to its predecessor.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has {{proposed}} a process {{that could be used}} to apply occupational exposure banding to a broader spectrum of occupational settings. The proposed NIOSH occupational exposure banding process utilizes available, but often limited, toxicological data to determine a potential range of chemical exposure levels that can be used as targets for <b>exposure</b> <b>controls</b> to reduce risk among workers. An OEB is not meant to replace an OEL, rather it serves as a starting point to inform risk management decisions.|$|E
50|$|Hazard {{surveillance}} includes {{elements of}} hazard and exposure assessment. The hazard assessment involves reviewing {{the best available}} information concerning toxicity of materials. Such an assessment may come from databases, texts, and published literature or available regulations or guidelines. Human studies, such as epidemiologic investigations and case series or reports, and animal studies may also provide valuable information. The exposure assessment involves evaluating relevant exposure routes (inhalation, ingestion, dermal, and/or injection), amount, duration, and frequency (i.e., dose), as well as whether <b>exposure</b> <b>controls</b> are in place and how protective they are. When data are not available, {{this will be a}} qualitative process.|$|E
5000|$|The FM2 is a mechanically-controlled manual focus SLR with manual <b>exposure</b> <b>control.</b> It is {{operable}} without batteries and only needs the two S76 or A76 batteries, or one 1/3N battery {{to power the}} light meter, which consisted of an internal 60/40 percent centerweighted system linked to a center-the-LED <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> system. The <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> system used vertically arranged +/o/- light emitting diodes (LEDs) {{on the right side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the meter versus actual camera settings. This metering system can be traced back to the [...] Nikkormat FT (aka Nikomat FT) of 1965 and its center-the-needle system. The viewfinder also had Nikon’s standard interchangeable focus screen with various focusing options.|$|R

40|$|Given {{the almost}} {{limitless}} variety of nanomaterials, {{it will be}} virtually impossible to assess the possible occupational health hazard of each nanomaterial individually. The development of science-based hazard and risk categories for nanomaterials is needed for decision-making about <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> practices in the workplace. A possible strategy would be to select representative (benchmark) materials from various mode of action (MOA) classes, evaluate the hazard and develop risk estimates, and then apply a systematic comparison of new nanomaterials with the benchmark materials in the same MOA class. Poorly soluble particles are used here as an example to illustrate quantitative risk assessment methods for possible benchmark particles and occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> groups, given mode of action and relative toxicity. Linking such benchmark particles to specific <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> bands would facilitate the translation of health hazard and quantitative risk information {{to the development of}} effective <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> practices in the workplace. A key challenge is obtaining sufficient dose-response data, based on standard testing, to systematically evaluate the nanomaterials' physical-chemical factors influencing their biological activity. Categorization processes involve both science-based analyses and default assumptions in the absence of substance-specific information. Utilizing data and information from related materials may facilitate initial determinations of <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> systems for nanomaterials.

5000|$|Cameras {{made for}} dry work can also work underwater, {{protected}} by add-on housings, {{which are made}} for point and shoot cameras, compact cameras with full <b>exposure</b> <b>controls,</b> and single lens reflex cameras (SLRs). Most such housings are specific to the camera. Materials range from relatively inexpensive plastic to high-priced aluminum. Housings allow many options: users can choose housings specific to their everyday [...] "land" [...] cameras and use any lens. Underwater photographers generally use wide-angle lenses or macro lenses, both of which allow close focus and therefore a shorter distance to the subject, which reduces the loss of clarity to scattering. Digital media can hold many more shots than standard film (which rarely has more than 36 frames per roll). This gives digital cameras an advantage, since it is impractical to change film underwater. Other comparisons between digital and film photography also apply, {{and the use of}} film under water has declined, as it has on land.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an active <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> method {{to improve the}} {{robustness}} of visual odometry in HDR (high dynamic range) environments. Our method evaluates the proper exposure time by maximizing a robust gradient-based image quality metric. The optimization is achieved by exploiting the photometric response function of the camera. Our <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> method is evaluated in different real world environments and outperforms both the built-in auto-exposure function of the camera and a fixed exposure time. To validate the benefit of our approach, we test different state-of-the-art visual odometry pipelines (namely, ORB-SLAM 2, DSO, and SVO 2. 0) and demonstrate significant improved performance using our <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> method in very challenging HDR environments.
