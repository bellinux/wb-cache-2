The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E

40|$|Data on 2520 {{occupants}} of cars involved in accidents were analysed {{in relation to}} injury and {{the severity of the}} crash to investigate the effect of rear seat passengers on injury to restrained and unrestrained <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants and vice versa. Unrestrained <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants showed a higher incidence of serious injury when there were rear seat passengers. The presence of a rear seat passenger did not affect significantly the overall incidence of injury among restrained <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants within the range of crash severity considered. Unrestrained rear seat passengers behind unrestrained <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants showed a higher incidence of moderate injury and a lower incidence of no injury than those behind restrained <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants. It is concluded that legislation on seat belts has not greatly increased the risk of person to person injury...|$|R

40|$|The {{severity}} of injuries sustained by 2577 car occupants in road traffic accidents in the catchment area of one district accident service during February 1982 to January 1984 inclusive {{was assessed using}} the injury severity score system. In the first 12 months the mean injury severity score for <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants injured in a road traffic accident was 4. 94 {{and in the second}} 12 month period, after the implementation of the seat belt law, the mean injury severity score of all injured <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants was 2. 80. These figures indicated a reduction in injury {{severity of}} <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants of 53. 4 % on the previous 12 month figures. The severity of injury sustained by unbelted <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants and back seat passengers showed no significant change over the two years. The number of <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants killed or sustaining serious injuries (injury severity score greater than 12) showed a reduction of 54 % in the 12 months beginning February 1983. <b>Front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants requiring admission for injuries sustained showed a decline of 42 % in the 12 months after the introduction of the seat belt law, and deaths among <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants fell by 27 % compared with the previous 12 months. After the implementation of seat belt legislation those <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants killed or sustaining serious injuries included a significantly higher proportion of victims who were not wearing their seat belts or showed positive evidence of alcohol intake {{at the time of the}} accident. This series suggests that the incidence of serious injury or deaths among <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> occupants of cars has decreased substantially since the seat belt law became effective on 31 January 1983...|$|R

40|$|International {{research}} suggests that {{a large proportion of}} children travel in the <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of passenger vehicles even though this places them at increased risk of serious injury or death. There are no comparable figures for Australia. This study was conducted to estimate the proportion of Australian children <b>seated</b> in the <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of passenger vehicles and to explore restraint use. Trained observers noted the seating positions of children, their ages and the types of restraints used for 1295 passenger vehicles carrying child passengers (aged 12 years and under) in Brisbane during March/April 2005. Results suggest that approximately 60 % of passenger vehicles carrying children had at least 1 child <b>seated</b> in the <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b> Age was associated with greater likelihood of <b>front</b> <b>seating</b> with most child <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> passengers being aged 7 - 12 years. While over 90 % of child passengers were restrained, around 25 % wore restraints that were not optimal for their ages. These figures indicate a clear opportunity for interventions aimed at raising awareness of the risk involved in allowing children to occupy the <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> as well as encouraging parents and drivers to seat them in the rear seat whenever possible. There is also a need to explore parental knowledge of age-appropriate restraints and to encourage more widespread use...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the noise {{performance}} for the seat adjuster mechanism, noise and vibration measurements were conducted in both European and Australian cars for six and eight modes of the seat adjustment operations on the driver's seat. The six modes of the driver's seat operations are: both up for the <b>front</b> and rear <b>seat</b> ends, both down for the <b>front</b> and rear <b>seat</b> ends, <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> end up, <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> end down, rear seat end up and rear seat end down. The eight modes of the seat operations are: forward, backward, both up for the <b>front</b> and rear <b>seat</b> ends, both down for the <b>front</b> and rear <b>seat</b> ends, <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> end up, <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> end down, rear seat end up and rear seat end down. The noise and vibration levels, sound quality and the root causes for the noise problems have been analysed and discussed for the six and eight modes of the seat adjustment operations. The noise characteristics have been identified; the psychoacoustic parameters {{have been used to}} quantify the sound quality of the seat adjuster and the assessment results have been found to match well with subjective evaluation results...|$|R

25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} rear, mounted {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a gear stick between the <b>front</b> <b>seats,</b> both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the <b>front</b> <b>seats.</b> The filler neck sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The spare wheel was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971.
