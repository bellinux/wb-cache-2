It is not known what happened to Carpenter after this date, but the usual practice was to bury anchorites where they had lived and died. After an anchoress died, her cell would have been opened and a grave would be dug under her cell. Carpenter may still be in that churchyard.|$|R

5000|$|Barrel socks, also {{commonly}} called barrel sleeves or barrel condoms, are a newer form of barrel block, and {{consist of a}} cloth pouch with an adjustable elastic cord. The pouch is placed over the muzzle of the marker, and the elastic cord is stretched over the feed neck of the marker, and tightened so the pouch is <b>kept</b> <b>securely</b> on the muzzle. If a paintball is fired, it will exit the muzzle and be caught immediately by the pouch. Barrel socks have several advantages over barrel plugs. First, if a paintball is fired, it will generally break in the pouch after leaving the barrel. This generally results in less mess inside the barrel itself (though it is generally still necessary to clean the barrel afterward). Barrel socks are also easy to install and remove; a properly adjusted sock can simply be lifted off by the player against {{the force of the}} elastic; it can be completely removed from the marker, or for convenience it can be left hanging by its cord from the feed neck, allowing it to be put back in place at a moment's notice. Most importantly, a barrel sock, with the cord properly tightened, will remain in place over the barrel even after repeated shots, and thus it provides a far more reliable barrier against unintentional shots causing injury. Most fields use a product called a 'Barrel Capp' for their rental equipment.|$|E

50|$|A few {{solutions}} are: original author/developer need {{to first}} set a trust-level to sign/certify their own file-signing key. Then updated public-keys and updated file-signing public-keys {{must also have}} to be published and distributed (or made accessible) to users, via online secure and encrypted mediums, so that any user from any location in world, can get the correct and trusted and unmodified public-key. To make sure that each users are getting the correct and trusted public-keys and signed-code/file, original dev/author or original-releaser must publish their updated public-keys on their own Keyserver and force HKPS encrypted connection usage, or publish their updated and full public-keys (and signed-code/file) on their own HTTPS encrypted webpage, under their own webserver, from their own primary domain website, (not-from any sub-domains which are located in external-servers, not-from any mirror, not-from any external/shared forum/wiki etc website servers, not-from any public or external/shared cloud or hosting service servers), and must have to be located and <b>kept</b> <b>securely</b> inside their own premises: own-home, own-home-office, or own-office. In that way, those small pieces of original keys/code, will travel intact through internet and will remain unmodified during transit (because of encrypted connection) and will reach destination without being eavesdropped or modified, into user's side, and can be treated as trustworthy public-keys because of single or multi channel TTPA based verification. When a public-key is obtained (from original developer's own web-server) via more than one TTPA (trusted third party authority) based secured, verified and encrypted connection, then it is more trustworthy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Many {{organizations}} have {{great deal of}} confidential information which is stored on computers. Such information is desired to be <b>kept</b> <b>securely</b> yet giving a convenience of accessibility from {{any part of the}} world. For data security, one can use an encrypting file system such as eCryptfs [1], dmCrypt [2], File Vault [3]. However these encrypting file systems do not address the problem of accessing files over network from public computers. In this case the public host, the actual FileServer host and the network between them are vulnerable to many attacks. This paper discusses the major problems and proposes a solution for the same using TransCrypt [4] encrypting file system. It also describes how the proposed solution can be implemented on a Linux-based environment...|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} {{facet of}} software reuse is the reuse of autonomous and distributed computational services. Components or applications offering services {{stay at the}} provider's site, where they are developed, <b>kept</b> <b>securely,</b> operated, maintained, and updated. Instead of purchasing software components, the customer buys services by invoking methods provided by these remote applications over the Internet. Due to {{the autonomy of the}} services, this reuse model causes specific requirements that differ from those where one builds one's own system from components. These requirements have led to the definition of CPAM, a protocol for reusing remote and autonomous services. CPAM can be used on top of various distribution systems, and offers features like presetting of attributes, run-time estimation of costs and having several calls for setup, invocation and result extraction. The CPAM protocol has been successfully used within CHAIMS, a reuse environment that supports the generation of client appli [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|Victor Hubinon {{was born}} in Angleur (Now a part of Liège), Belgium in 1924. He studied at the Arts Academy of Liège and fled to England later during World War II, where {{he served in the}} Royal Navy. After the war ended, he {{returned}} to Belgium and when he was 22, he started working as an illustrator for the newspaper La Meuse. He got a contract with businessman and journalist Georges Troisfontaines, who started the press agency [...] "World Press". There, Hubinon met Jean-Michel Charlier, another illustrator for the agency. They first collaborated on a short comic story, but Troisfontaines created for them a new hero, Buck Danny, about a trio of fictional American pilots in World War II. Troisfontaines dropped out after he had written the first fifteen pages, whereupon Charlier and Hubinon continued it on their own. Quite soon, Charlier quit drawing and specialized in writing the stories, while Hubinon did all the artwork. The strip appeared in Spirou magazine, the comics weekly of publisher Dupuis, and became over the next thirty years {{one of the most popular}} and enduring series of the magazine. After 50 years, more than 20 million albums had been sold.

40|$|Factor B is {{the central}} {{protease}} of the complement system of immune defense. Here, we present the crystal structure of human factor B at 2. 3 -A° resolution, which reveals how the five-domain proenzyme is <b>kept</b> <b>securely</b> inactive. The canonical activation helix of the Von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain is displaced by a helix from the preceding domain linker. The two helices conformationally link the scissile-activation peptide and the metal ion–dependent adhesion site required for binding of the ligand C 3 b. The data suggest that C 3 b binding displaces the three N-terminal control domains and reshuffles the two central helices. Reshuffling of the helices releases the scissile bond for final proteolytic activation and generates a new interface between the VWA domain and the serine protease domain. This allosteric mechanism is crucial for tight regulation of the complementamplification step in the immune response...|$|E

5000|$|Each base is {{typically}} {{the size of}} a regiment, sometimes {{the size of a}} brigade, but it is usually commanded by a major-general or sometimes by a rear admiral rather than by a colonel because their importance and elevated status makes them technically equal to that of a regular infantry or other division. Many of commanding officers serving at its Moscow headquarters bear general's and admiral's ranks, since almost all of them are being promoted from among remote arsenal base commanders. That is why percentage of generals and admirals among commissioned officers in the 12th GU MO is considerably higher than in any other military organization of the Russian Armed Forces or the Russian Navy. Such nuclear arsenal bases are usually located far enough from big cities (at least 50 kilometres), but close enough to the military units that would use these nuclear warheads in case of war (primarily it is Intercontinental Ballistic Missile batteries, but also missile batteries with shorter range, theatre and tactical missile units, navy and aviation units armed with nuclear weapons, units of military saboteurs and engineers that were supposed to use portable nuclear munitions, anti-aircraft and anti-ballistic missile defences that use nuclear-tipped missiles, etc.). So the main purpose of the 12th Chief Directorate's existence is to securely separate [...] "end-users" [...] of nuclear weapons from their actual nuclear weapons during times of peace. Only in case of real necessity those who are supposed to have nuclear weapons would get them and it could only happen when authorized by the top political leadership. Presently only some small number of nuclear warheads are always issued to end-users, such as warheads attached to ballistic missiles currently at service, but most of the Russian nuclear arsenal is being <b>securely</b> <b>kept</b> by the 12th Chief Directorate units and could only be issued to others in case of emergency.|$|R
