25|$|Into this divided community, {{the mine}} owners hired spies {{to monitor and}} {{undermine}} the union. Spies supplied {{thousands of pages of}} daily reports on the internal workings of the CCMU; its divisions, its plans, its weaknesses. Although <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> there were spies in the union (the details of secret union leadership meetings were printed the following day in the Leadville Herald Democrat), they never guessed their identities. Spies were entrusted with union security responsibilities, even with the responsibility of detecting possible spies. The spies faithfully recorded information about ethnic rivalries and philosophical disputes among die-hard and disillusioned unionists, militants and pacifists, optimists and pessimists, and the spy agencies passed that information on to the mine operators. With comprehensive daily reports on secret union meetings and the union's tactical plans, mine owners were able to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlast the strikers.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Hawtrey {{had become}} a regular {{participant}} in the Carry On films series. He was in the first, Carry On Sergeant (1958), and more than 20 others. His characters ranged from the wimpish through the effete to the effeminate and would always, regardless of the historical setting, be seen wearing Hawtrey's signature round glasses. In her autobiography Barbara Windsor wrote about Hawtrey's alcoholism and his outrageous flirting with the footballer George Best. While filming Carry On Spying (1964), in which they both played secret agents, Windsor thought that Hawtrey had fainted from fright at a dramatic scene on a conveyor belt. In fact he had passed out because he was drunk. When he came on set with a crate of R. White's Lemonade <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{he had been on}} another binge.

25|$|With {{the painter}} Ary Scheffer, {{a friend of}} Louis-Philippe, he rode on horseback {{immediately}} to the Duke's residence in Neuilly, but found that the Duke had left and was in hiding at another chateau in Raincy. Thiers talked instead to the Duke's wife, Marie-Amélie, and sister-in-law, Madame Adelaide. Thiers explained that they wanted a representative monarchy and a new dynasty, and that <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Louis-Philippe was not ambitious and had not sought the crown for himself. Madame Adelaide agreed to take the proposition to the Duke. The Duke returned to Neuilly at ten {{in the evening and}} learned what had happened from his wife. He put on a tricolor ribbon, the symbol of the opposition, and rode to the Palais-Royal, where Thiers, the Marquis de Lafayette and Jacques Laffitte were waiting. Together, they persuaded him to take the throne and discussed how it would be done. That afternoon, they rode to the Hotel de Ville. Louis-Phiiippe, wrapped in a tricolor flag, was presented to the huge and cheering crowd in front of the Hotel de VIlle by LaFayette. King Charles X withdrew his proposed new government and offered to negotiate, but it was too late. He and his son departed the Chateau of Saint-Cloud and left France for exile in England.|$|E

Aim 2 is to prove avariation of no trade theorem in the model. 1 Introduction The word “knowledge ” and especialy “common knowledge ” plays avery important role in game theory. Intuitively, an event is common knowledge if <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> it, <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> it, <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> it and so on.

Omie, however, was seeing a ne'er-do-well named John Lewis, who never meant anything about anything serious, except some of his meanness. John Lewis courted the girl, seemingly until she became pregnant, and he decided that he'd get rid of her in some secret sort of way. He persuaded her to skip off with him and get married, then pushed her into the water and drowned her. <b>Everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he had been mean to Omie, and when the body was taken out of the water, there was evidence that she had been beaten quite a lot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Midrash, Rashi {{read the}} steward's {{words to the}} {{brothers}} in [...] "Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure," [...] to mean that God gave them the money in their merit, and if their merit was insufficient, the God of their father Jacob gave it {{to them in the}} merit of their father. Similarly, the 12th century Italian Rabbi Menachem ben Shlomo taught that the words [...] "your God" [...] signified that it was a reward for their fearing God, while the words [...] "the God of your fathers" [...] signified that it was a reward for Jacob's fearing God. Rashbam, however, read [...] to report that <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the brothers regularly benefitted from miracles. And David Kimhi (RaDaK) interpreted the steward to mean that if the brothers found the money in their sacks, it was a gift from heaven, comparable to if a human being had given them a treasure.|$|E

2500|$|Clarke {{was criticized}} for his {{suggestions}} in 1999 of intelligence indicating a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, despite the fact Clarke and others concluded after investigations by 2001 that no link had been established. In Against All Enemies he writes, [...] "It is certainly possible that Iraqi agents dangled the possibility of asylum in Iraq before bin Laden at some point when <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. was pressuring the Taliban to arrest him. If that dangle happened, bin Laden's accepting asylum clearly did not," [...] (p.270). In an interview on March 21, 2004, Clarke claimed that [...] "there's absolutely no evidence that Iraq was supporting al-Qaeda, ever." [...] Clarke claimed in his book that this conclusion was understood by the intelligence community {{at the time of}} 9/11 and the ensuing months, but top Bush administration officials were pre-occupied with finding a link between Iraq and 9/11 {{in the months that followed}} the attack, and thus, Clarke argued, the Iraq war distracted attention and resources from the war in Afghanistan and hunt for Osama bin Laden.|$|E
2500|$|The {{members of}} the House of Representatives balloted as states to {{determine}} whether Jefferson or Burr would become president. There were sixteen states, each with one vote; an absolute majority of nine was required for victory. It was the outgoing House of Representatives, controlled by the Federalist Party, that was charged with electing the new president. [...] While <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Republicans intended Jefferson to be their candidate for president and Burr for vice president, that did not bind the Federalists. Many were unwilling to support Jefferson, their principal political enemy since 1791. Seizing an opportunity to deny Jefferson the presidency, most Federalists voted for Burr, giving Burr six of the eight states controlled by Federalists. The seven delegations controlled by Republicans all voted for Jefferson, and Georgia's sole Federalist representative also voted for him, giving him eight states. The Vermont delegation was evenly split and cast a blank ballot. The remaining state, Maryland, had five Federalist representatives to three Republicans; one of its Federalist representatives voted for Jefferson, forcing that state delegation also to cast a blank ballot.|$|E
