40|$|Purpose Online <b>help</b> and {{tutorials}} are {{an important}} part of library services, yet they are often studied in specific contexts and disciplines like subject-specific research guides. The objective of this study was to examine users’ common preferences and expectations of library <b>help</b> channels in general and online <b>help</b> in particular. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a qualitative survey with 45 library users. The survey asked users how they seek library <b>help,</b> their preferences and expectations of online <b>help,</b> content format and general <b>help</b> channels and later, a content analysis of survey responses was performed. Findings Results showed that survey participants have different prioritizations of library <b>help</b> channels. Half of the respondents preferred conceptual <b>help</b> that emphasizes concepts and underlying principles, while the other half preferred procedural (step-by-step) <b>help</b> or mixed. The survey also indicated reliance by participants on expert <b>help,</b> even when online <b>help</b> was available. Originality/value Based on the results, the authors identified users’ behavioral preferences, attitudes and expectations toward library <b>help</b> channels and online <b>help</b> content. They also discussed the unique challenge of creating online <b>help</b> for libraries, as users have a dynamic range of help-seeking preferences and mixed expectations of <b>help</b> content depending on the context...|$|R

40|$|In social psychology, the {{attribution}} model of <b>helping</b> behavior suggests that {{beliefs of the}} <b>helping</b> target’s responsibility for the need for <b>help</b> evoke affective motivators such as feelings of pity, sympathy, or anger. The affective motivation leads to <b>helping</b> or not <b>helping</b> the target. The current emergent theory is an enhancement of this theory by incorporating other personal and situational variables. Through the use of classic grounded theory, I interviewed 80 participants from different De La Salle Schools in the Philippines. This yielded over 1300 individual incidents that were compared and contrasted to form codes, categories and subcategories. A theory on the decision making process of <b>helping</b> emerged that incorporates the helper’s personal conviction, and rational deliberations of the situation. The desire to <b>help</b> {{is based on the}} helper’s rationalemotive beliefs (philosophical ideals and values that nurture <b>helping</b> and the knowledge of the nature of risk/problem) and relational-emotive ties (with the one who needs <b>help</b> and with a social group that nurtures <b>helping).</b> The desire to <b>help</b> undergoes a process of rationalpragmatic-deliberations on the appropriateness of the recipients need of <b>help,</b> the cost of <b>helping,</b> the helper’s capability of <b>helping,</b> and the logistics of <b>helping</b> before the actual <b>helping</b> occurs. The theory has implications for current social psychological theories of <b>helping,</b> and the use of classic grounded theory research...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 49) It was expected, in general, {{that users}} who could view <b>help</b> text simultaneously with task text would outperform {{those who could}} not. Four methods for presenting <b>help</b> were compared: WINDOW (a five line <b>help</b> display was presented simultaneously with the display of task text), DUAL (two lines of <b>help</b> were presented simultaneous with the task on the first <b>help</b> request, and a full screen overlayed the task on the next request), FULL (a full screen of <b>help</b> overlayed the task), and MANUAL (<b>help</b> was available off-line in a book). Two types of tasks were assigned to users in each <b>help</b> condition: SIMPLE (all necessary information to complete the tasks was given) and COMPLEX (users were forced to find and remember information pertinent to task completion). Typical computer tasks, such as file and job management were performed. Measures were taken for each set of simple or complex tasks. Dependent measures were 1) the average time to complete each task, 2) the number of steps taken beyond the optimal number for the set, 3) the average time spent in <b>help</b> per task, 4) the average time spent in <b>help</b> per request, 5) {{the average number of}} times <b>help</b> was accessed per task, and 6) the average total time to complete each task, including <b>help</b> time.
