5|$|Many {{vegetarian}} {{restaurants and}} producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for <b>insect</b> <b>infestation</b> and steps {{have been taken}} to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of bishul Yisrael. Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be checked for <b>insect</b> <b>infestation.</b> The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.|$|E
5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} is causing tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them more vulnerable to <b>insect</b> <b>infestation</b> and disease. Since the cones of these trees require fire-touched soil to germinate, historic fire suppression has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting prescribed fires is expected to help the germination issue.|$|E
5|$|Most cowpeas {{are grown}} on the African continent, {{particularly}} in Nigeria and Niger {{which account for}} 66% of world production. A 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on , have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes and are consumed by 200 million people on a daily basis. <b>Insect</b> <b>infestation</b> is a major constraint {{to the production of}} cowpea, sometimes causing losses of over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer Maruca vitrata is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea and the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus the main post-harvest pest.|$|E

50|$|Chemical {{treatments}} {{used for}} the control or eradication of fungal infections and/or <b>insect</b> <b>infestations</b> in buildings and the residues of such treatments do not pose a proven hazard to the general population. There is, however, an apparent potential risk from such treatments and from the presence of treatment residues in treated buildings for persons who suffer from chemical sensitivity&hellip; it is concluded that further investigation and evaluation is required of alternative chemical and non chemical treatments of fungal infections and/or <b>insect</b> <b>infestations</b> in buildings.|$|R
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is edible; it {{is rated}} as choice by some, while others find it tasteless. It has an earthy flavor and meaty texture {{that has been}} {{regarded}} as suiting red meat dishes. Like many edible fungi, consumption may cause gastrointestinal distress in susceptible individuals. The flesh becomes bitter with age, and older specimens may be infested with insects. <b>Insect</b> <b>infestation</b> is unlikely {{if the weather is}} cool. G.clavatus has been used for cooking for some time—Fries included it in his 1867 book Sveriges ätliga och giftiga svampar (Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden). It is highly regarded by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca, Mexico, and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal.|$|E

25|$|While {{the heading}} {{broccoli}} variety performs poorly in hot weather, mainly due to <b>insect</b> <b>infestation,</b> the sprouting variety is more resistant, though attention {{must be paid}} to sucking insects (such as aphids), caterpillars and whiteflies. Spraying of bacillus thuringiensis can control caterpillar attacks, while a citronella vase may ward off whiteflies.|$|E
40|$|With {{properly}} exposed {{color or}} infrared color film, discolored foliage caused by <b>insect</b> <b>infestations</b> in ponderosa pine is detectable on moderately small-scale photographs with acceptable accuracies. Black and white photographs which matched the wavebands of the ERTS multispectral scanner were combined into one additive color photo. This imagery {{was not as}} useful as photographs taken on color, color infrared, or color film with a minus blue filter. Based on the high-altitude color and color infrared photos obtained, it is concluded that only <b>insect</b> <b>infestations</b> larger than 100 meters in diameter are detectable on ERTS imagery...|$|R

5000|$|Physical {{pest control}} is a method {{of getting rid of}} insects and small rodents by removing, attacking, setting up {{barriers}} that will prevent further destruction of one's plants, or forcing <b>insect</b> <b>infestations</b> to become visual.|$|R
25|$|In 1977, a new <b>insect</b> <b>infestation</b> was {{discovered}} {{in the back of}} the panel as a result of crosspieces installed to keep the painting from warping. This was treated on the spot with carbon tetrachloride, and later with an ethylene oxide treatment. In 1985, the spot was again treated with carbon tetrachloride as a preventive measure.|$|E
25|$|Forensic {{entomology}} {{deals with}} the collection of arthropodic evidence and its application, and {{through a series of}} tests and previously set of rules, general admissibility of said evidence is determined. Forensic entomology may come into play in a variety of legal cases, including crime scene investigation, abuse and neglect cases, accidents, <b>insect</b> <b>infestation,</b> and food contamination.|$|E
25|$|Toasting: A {{piece was}} broken from the tea brick and usually first toasted over a fire. This was {{probably}} done to sanitize the tea brick and destroy any mold or <b>insect</b> <b>infestation</b> {{that may have}} occurred when the bricks were stored uncovered in warehouses and storerooms or in covered jars underground. Toasting also imparted a pleasant flavor to the resulting beverage.|$|E
50|$|Quipus {{are also}} closely {{monitored}} for mold, {{as well as}} insects and their larvae. As with all textiles, these are major problems. Fumigation may not be recommended for fiber textiles displaying mold or <b>insect</b> <b>infestations,</b> although it is common practice for ridding paper of mold and insects.|$|R
40|$|Life {{in rural}} areas of {{developing}} countries is prone to many kinds of risk, such as illness or mortality of household members, crop or other income loss due to natural phenomena (weather, <b>insect</b> <b>infestations,</b> or fire, for example), and civil conflict.

5000|$|In 2007, HomeBioGas cofounder Yair Teller {{observed}} small biogas {{systems in}} Mexico. Inspired, {{he traveled to}} other developing nations to learn more. Teller, and cofounder Oshik Efrati, acquired many biogas systems from China and India. They installed them locally, quickly judging them to work poorly.Particularly, Teller and Efrati believed these systems suffered from poor efficiency, unpleasant odors and <b>insect</b> <b>infestations.</b>|$|R
25|$|Problems {{with wooden}} ties include rot, splitting, <b>insect</b> <b>infestation,</b> plate-cutting, {{also known as}} chair shuffle in the UK (abrasive damage to the tie caused by lateral motion of the tie plate) and spike-pull (where the spike is {{gradually}} loosened from the tie). For more information on wooden ties the Railway Tie Association maintains a comprehensive website devoted to wood tie research and statistics.|$|E
25|$|Among rice cultivars, {{there are}} {{differences}} in the responses to, and recovery from, pest damage. Many rice varieties have been selected for resistance to insect pests. Therefore, particular cultivars are recommended for areas prone to certain pest problems. The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance. Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite <b>insect</b> <b>infestation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{glory days}} of the Philippine coffee {{industry}} lasted until 1889 when coffee rust hit the Philippine shores. That, coupled with an <b>insect</b> <b>infestation,</b> destroyed virtually all the coffee trees in Batangas. Since Batangas was a major producer of coffee, this greatly affected national coffee production. In two years, coffee production was reduced to 1/6th its original amount. By then, Brazil had regained its position as the world's leading producer of coffee. A few of the surviving coffee seedlings were transferred from Batangas to Cavite, where they flourished. This was {{not the end of}} the Philippines' coffee growing days, but there was less area allotted to coffee because many farmers had shifted to other crops.|$|E
40|$|FHAES (Fire History Analysis and Exploration System) is a {{software}} tool to evaluate fire regime properties such as frequency, seasonality, extent, and fire/climate relationships from indicators of fire (e. g., scars) on trees.

50|$|The disease {{typically}} {{occurs in}} woodlots and forests, home landscapes, and urban settings. The geographic origin of ash yellows is unknown but currently {{the disease is}} only reported to be in North America. Some environmental factors that could contribute {{to the growth of}} the disease include mechanical damage, <b>insect</b> <b>infestations,</b> and fungi. One major environmental condition that has been shown to amplify the growth of the disease includes drought.|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{defoliation}} in corn {{was used}} to explore the usefulness of aerial photography in detecting crop <b>insect</b> <b>infestations.</b> Defoliation {{on the top of}} plants was easily detected, while that on the base was less so. Aero infrared film with Wratten 89 B filter gave the best results, and morning flights at the scale of 1 : 15840 are recommended. Row direction, plant growth stage, and time elapse since defoliation were not important factors...|$|R
25|$|Barley was {{initially}} predominant because it matured earlier and tolerated harsher conditions than wheat, growing {{in areas with}} less rainfall and poorer soils, such as the northern Negev and the hill country. It had a high yield potential and was resistant to <b>insect</b> <b>infestation.</b> It could be sown without plowing, and could therefore be grown on small plots of land that oxen or even donkeys could not reach, {{and it did not}} need artificial irrigation. It ripened a month earlier than wheat and was thus available to replenish supplies used up during the winter sooner than wheat, and also provide some food security if the more vulnerable wheat crop was poor or failed.|$|E
25|$|Despite the renovations of 1988–1989, {{within a}} decade the school {{building}} again {{was in need of}} significant repairs. During the late 1990s, several ceilings in the building had collapsed due to roof leaks, while the building suffered from a rodent and <b>insect</b> <b>infestation.</b> By 2002, the building's roof leaked into the music wing and windows were stuck open in the auditorium leading to interior problems. Supplies and money for extra rehearsals also were in short supply, and teachers complained that both the cafeteria and the theater seated only half of the 500 students at the school. The principal of the school, John Niemeyer, noted that budget cuts and paperwork problems were to blame for many issues and argued that the building was not suited for a performing arts school.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{masks are}} most {{commonly}} carved from wood, with various types used. The harvesting of this wood often falls under certain customs related to {{when and how}} the trees may be cut. The most common traditional wood is “zompantle” also called “palo bofo” or “colorín” (Erythrina coralloides) a plant of the legume family which yields a soft white wood often use for more artistic objects and {{has been associated with}} ritual since pre Hispanic times. It is never used to utilitarian items. Other common woods include red cedar and “ayacahuite” (Pinus ayacahuite), both favored for their ability to resist <b>insect</b> <b>infestation.</b> Red cedar masks are most commonly found in the Sierra de Puebla, Papantla area, Chiapa de Corzo and among the Zoques in Chiapas. Poplar wood is commonly used because it can be worked thin and does not splinter. Masks of this wood are most commonly found for the pascola dances of the Mayos and Yaquis. The hardest woods used for masks are mesquite and avocado. Mezquite masks are found in Hidalgo, Zacatecas and the northwest of the country, with avocado wood ones found in the State of Mexico. Copal wood in used mostly in Michoacán and Oaxaca but can be found in Sonora and other states.|$|E
50|$|It differs most conspicuously {{from the}} two other bristlecone pine species in that the needles usually have only one, (only rarely two) resin canals, and these are {{commonly}} interrupted and broken, leading to highly characteristic small white resin flecks appearing on the needles. This character, which looks a bit like 'dandruff' on the needles, is diagnostic of Pinus aristata; no other pine shows it (though sometimes, scale <b>insect</b> <b>infestations</b> can look superficially similar).|$|R
50|$|In each {{episode of}} 72 Hours, three new {{competing}} teams of strangers are {{dropped in the}} complete wilderness where they are given very few essential items to survive. The teams must travel through harsh environments, such as dangerous wildlife or <b>insect</b> <b>infestations</b> for 72 hours to find a hidden briefcase that contains $100,000. The team that finds the briefcase are {{the winners of the}} competition and they receive the $100,000 cash prize.|$|R
50|$|Black Knot occurs {{only on the}} {{woody parts}} of trees, {{primarily}} on twigs and branches, but can spread to larger limbs and even the trunk. Olive-green swellings from the disease are visible in the late spring; as it spreads and matures, typically by autumn, rough black knots circle and kill affected parts. The knots vary in diameter from one inch to one foot (2.5 cm - 30 cm). Older knots can kill trees by promoting <b>insect</b> <b>infestations.</b>|$|R
2500|$|All living {{conifers}} are woody plants, {{and most}} are trees, the majority having monopodial growth form (a single, straight trunk with side branches) with strong apical dominance. Many conifers have distinctly scented resin, secreted to protect the tree against <b>insect</b> <b>infestation</b> and fungal infection of wounds. Fossilized resin hardens into amber. The size of mature conifers varies from less than one meter, to over 100 meters. The world's tallest, thickest, largest, and oldest living trees are all conifers. The tallest is a Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), with a height of 115.55 meters (although one Victorian mountain ash, Eucalyptus regnans, allegedly grew to a height of 140 meters, although the exact dimensions were not confirmed). [...] The thickest, or tree with the greatest trunk diameter, is a Montezuma Cypress (Taxodium mucronatum), 11.42 meters in diameter. [...] The largest tree by three-dimensional volume is a Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), with a volume 1486.9 cubic meters. The smallest is the pygmy pine (Lepidothamnus laxifolius) of New Zealand, which is seldom taller than 30cm when mature. The oldest is a Great Basin Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva), 4,700 years old.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1940s, {{wildfires}} {{burned through}} the Little Applegate River watershed frequently. The United States Forest Service began fire suppression {{efforts in the}} 1920s, and a smokejumper station was built about 20 years later. Species that depend on fire to reproduce—such as ponderosa pine—declined in population, while Douglas-fir and white fir spread. Buckbrush and manzanita, normally chaparral plants, encroached on the oak savanna regions. The vegetation in the watershed continues to grow denser, making it more susceptible to <b>insect</b> <b>infestations</b> and disease.|$|R
25|$|After the carving, {{the figure}} is then left to dry for up to ten months, {{depending}} on its overall size and thickness. Semi tropical wood such as copal is susceptible to <b>insect</b> <b>infestations,</b> {{and for this reason}} drying pieces are often soaked in gasoline and sometimes baked to ensure that all insect eggs have been destroyed. As the figure dries, it is also susceptible to cracking. The cracks are filled with small pieces of copal wood and a sawdust resin mixture before painting.|$|R
