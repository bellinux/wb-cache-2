However, assessment of why computer applications are really implemented from the <b>end</b> <b>users</b> 2 ̆ 7 perspective has not been reported. In order to answer questions to justify expenditures {{it would be helpful}} to understand how <b>end</b> <b>users</b> perceive the reasons for implementation of computer applications in their stations. To this end a questionnaire was sent to all broadcast radio and TV stations in the State of Wisconsin. The <b>end</b> <b>users</b> (<b>station</b> managers) were requested to identify reasons for present computer application implementations and areas of implementations for future use. The results of this study compare type of computer being used and station characteristics with a checklist of reasons for computer application implementations in the broadcast industry.

This interference with the signal is known as rain fade.

For satellite Internet services in tropical areas with heavy rain, use of the C band (4/6 GHz) with a circular polarisation satellite is popular. Satellite communications on the Ka band (19/29 GHz) can use special techniques such as large rain margins, adaptive uplink power control and reduced bit rates during precipitation.|$|R
40|$|The Acoustic Buoy is {{a project}} between the Laboratory of Applied Bioacoustics (LAB) and the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). In areas that the human {{activities}} produce high noise levels, such as oil exploration or construction, {{there is a need}} to monitor the environment for the presence of cetaceans. Another need is for fishing, to prevent endangered species from being killed. This can be done with an Autonomous Acoustic Buoy (AAB). Mooring or anchoring at to the seafloor can be costly, especially in deep water, for these situations a free floating buoy is required that can monitor the environment and send an alert message when cetaceans are detected nearby or noise levels have exceeded a certain threshold. As an ongoing project different components of the overall concept have been researched and developed, a buoy has been designed, software and hardware have been developed for data acquisition, and a watchdog system has been built to ensure a safe and autonomous unattended operation of the electronics. But one of the key things the overall concept is still missing is the communication system, in short a system needed for transferring the collected data to the <b>end</b> <b>user.</b> Therefore our problem statement is as follows, how can data be transferred from a collecting buoy to the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> and be presented in an accessible and easy to use interface. In order to monitor a large area several autonomous acoustic buoys can be deployed. In order to increase the radio coverage every AAB has the capability of acting as a node in a wireless mesh network so the alarm can automatically find its way to the ship, base or shore point where the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> control <b>station</b> is located. The overall system consists of two parts, the first is the transmission of data between the buoy and the control station and second is the user-interface for displaying alert messages on a map for the <b>end</b> <b>user.</b> Both parts are going to be developed during the European Project Semester 201...|$|R
