5|$|Little is {{recorded}} of MacGregor's childhood. After his father's death in 1794, {{he and his}} two sisters were raised primarily by his mother {{with the help of}} various relatives. MacGregor's biographer David Sinclair speculates that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have spoken mainly Gaelic during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half. MacGregor would claim in later life to have studied at the University of Edinburgh between 1802 and 1803; records of this do not survive as he did not take a degree, but Sinclair considers it plausible, citing MacGregor's apparent sophistication and his mother's connections in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|The BSAC {{established}} two forts to the north-west of Algoa in 1900, then a boma at Feira in 1902, bringing Mashukulumbwe under Company control. Harrison Clark {{said that}} his concessions gave him authority over the area and demanded that the Company pay him for them. The BSAC said Clark's documents were illegal and refused to deal with him. It offered him compensation, the form of which differs by source; Brelsford {{and a man who}} knew Clark personally during the 1920s, Colonel NO Earl Spurr, say that he was given farms as compensation, while a 1920s business acquaintance, AM Bentley, writes that the Company promised grants of land and the right to reserve some mining claims. Clark reluctantly accepted the compensation when he realised that to challenge the BSAC he would have to travel a great distance, possibly to England, and invest heavily in a court case <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> lose.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg and {{his colleagues}} {{designed}} the EG Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided {{that it would be}} easier to train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, than it would be the other way around. NASA asked EG and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E

5|$|When Britten {{was three}} months old he {{contracted}} pneumonia and nearly died. The illness {{left him with a}} damaged heart, and doctors warned his parents that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> never be able to lead a normal life. He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer. To his mother's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, while his brother, though musically talented, was interested only in ragtime. Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five. He started piano lessons when he was seven years old, and three years later began to play the viola. He {{was one of the last}} composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{was awarded}} a {{scholarship}} by Santa Clara for the 1992–93 season. At that time, it had been five years since the Broncos appeared in the NCAA tournament. That changed when Nash led the Broncos to a WCC Tournament title and an upset win over the No. 2 seeded Arizona {{in the first round}} of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In that game, Nash scored six straight free throws in the last 30 seconds of the contest. Although Santa Clara was defeated by Temple in the next round, the 1992–93 campaign was considered a successful one. However, the Broncos failed to sustain the momentum the following season, and only managed a 5–7 record in the conference. The team rebounded in the 1994–95 season, with Nash being named Conference Player of the Year and the Broncos topping the WCC. Featuring the league leader for scoring and assists in Nash, the Broncos returned to the NCAA tournament, but they were defeated by Mississippi State. After the season, Nash contemplated turning professional, and decided against it when he learned that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> not be considered as a first-round pick in the 1995 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June, Monmouth's army encamped at Pensford, {{and a small}} force skirmished {{with the}} Gloucester Militia {{to take control of}} Keynsham, a vital {{crossing}} point over the River Avon. Monmouth intended to attack the city of Bristol (the largest and most important city after London at that time). However, he heard the city had been occupied by Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort. There were inconclusive skirmishes with a force of Life Guards commanded by Feversham. These attacks gave the impression that there was a much larger royalist force in the vicinity then there actually was. Several historians have speculated that if Monmouth had marched as quickly as possible for Bristol at this point, when it was only protected by the Gloucestershire militia, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have been able to take the city and the final outcome of the rebellion might have been very different. Once Bristol had been taken, more recruits would have been attracted to the Rebellion and a later march on London would have been possible.|$|E

5|$|On July 8, 2013, Rice {{signed with}} the Washington Wizards. In the 2013 NBA Summer League, he twice {{registered}} the Summer League Sprite Dunk of the Day (July 14 and 19). Rice made his professional debut in the Wizards' seventh {{game of the season}} on November 12, 2013, against the Dallas Mavericks, making his only shot (a three-pointer) and adding a rebound. After Rice's debuted by playing the final 79 seconds of a loss that caused the Wizards to fall to 25, head coach Randy Wittman said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> shuffle the lineup. In the following game against San Antonio on November 13, Rice played 13 minutes and tallied 3 rebounds while registering his first NBA steal. On December 9, with Bradley Beal injured and Martell Webster sitting out, Rice who had totaled 11 points in his first 8 games, was given his first NBA start against Denver. Rice scored 7 points to go along with 3 rebounds and 3 steals. On December 18, Rice had an outpatient procedure in New York to repair a fractured right wrist suffered two days earlier. He was expected to miss 36 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so {{could not have known}} about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have to have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E

His family moved down soon afterwards, but his council house in Hamilton was burgled about eight weeks after they moved. Jean wanted to return to Scotland, and Stein accepted her desire in light of his own disillusionment with the problems at the club. When asked what he would do by the Llanelli manager, Stein said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> quit football and become a miner again.|$|E

Later, the Devil indicates that Sam is his son, although the father who raised Sam, Mr. Oliver, tells Sam that the deal with the Devil will not allow him to tell Sam {{the truth of the}} matter.
