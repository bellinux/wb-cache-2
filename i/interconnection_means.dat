40|$|The paper {{describes}} a multistage interconnection network (MIN) with regular interconnections {{in three dimensions}} (two space dimensions and the third dimension is the frequency) and dimension-dependent switches. (Regular <b>interconnections</b> <b>mean</b> that the same interconnection principles are applied throughout the stages of the MIN.) The frequency domain is organized by introducing artificial dimensions. The architecture is interpreted as an optical frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with multidimensional interconnections and switches where the dimension is an additional design parameter. The multidimensional interconnections may be implemented {{using a combination of}} space and frequency channels. The frequency interconnections (data movements between channels) are expressed by the Kronecker product (KP) of permutation matrices. In this case the number of frequency conversion (FC) operations and the number of frequency channels crossed during the generation of interconnections and switching decreases.

Intuitively it is felt that while the application of the CGA technology to relieve thermal stresses in the solder material might be quite effective (owing to the greater interfacial compliance of the CGA in comparison with the BGA), the situation might be quite different when the PCB/package experiences dynamic loading. This is because the mass of the CGA joints exceeds considerably that of the BGA interconnections and the corresponding inertia forces might be substantially larger {{in the case of a}} CGA design.

The effect of power degradation for samples exceeding DH 1000 was studied for various ribbon coatings, rear side AlAg silver pad pastes, amount of CG and for different encapsulation materials. We show that the choice of cell and module materials {{play a significant role in}} terms of electro-chemical corrosion. Cheap ribbon materials as non-coated copper ribbon were identified which lead to very positive damp heat results if used in combination with the right encapsulation materials. Special Rcontact samples did undergo more than 3000 hours of damp heat and proved that pure Cu ribbons without any coating performed almost the same as Ag coated ribbon and significantly better compared to Sn coated ribbon which typically fails for more than 1200 hours of DH. The speed of moisture ingress strongly impacts the corrosion process, hence specifically the rear contact is prone to degradation. We show that this process is even accelerated for larger amounts of dispensed CG. A study on various encapsulant materials showed that non coated Cu ribbon showed excellent results for TPO, TPO with embedded Al and Ionomer materials and acceptable results for Tectosil and EVA whereas Sn coated ribbon requires a TPO based material. DH testing proved that the choice of AlAg paste has a measurable effect on the electro-chemical corrosion and a minor impact on the CTM losses.

40|$|The recent {{growth of}} the Internet {{in terms of both}} supply and demand sets new {{challenges}} for the Internet connectivity market and exerts strong pressure in the existing structure. A key challenge involves provision of network service quality (e. g. high network performance guarantees), which is a prerequisite for the deployment of many value-added applications (e. g. real time video, video conferencing) and consequently their commercial exploitation. This thesis contributes both to the understanding of market dynamics {{as well as to the}} key market players by proposing new pricing schemes that induce network service quality provision in interconnection agreements. By applying asymmetric information models in the form of moral hazard this thesis offers an alternative approach to the analysis of the Internet connectivity market. Network models that involve network service quality provision are depicted and analysed in order to underline and discuss the impact of asymmetric information. The ISP's hidden action, or the uncertainty generated from unknown traffic loads may affect the interconnection service outcome in terms of provision of network service quality.

Following the Internet philosophy of viewing <b>interconnection</b> as a <b>mean</b> of exploiting network externalities and sustaining collaborative spirit between ISPs, linear incentive pricing is proposed to mitigate the adverse implications of moral hazard in interconnection agreements and induce network service quality provision. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Human {{organism}} is interpenetrated by {{the world}} of microorganisms, from the conception until the death. This interpenetration involves different levels of interactions between the partners including trophic exchanges, bi-directional cell signaling and gene activation, besides genetic and epigenetic phenomena, and tends towards mutual adaptation and coevolution. Since these processes are critical {{for the survival of}} individuals and species, they rely on the existence of a complex organization of adaptive systems aiming at two apparently conflicting purposes: the maintenance of the internal coherence of each partner, and a mutually advantageous coexistence and progressive adaptation between them. Humans possess three adaptive systems: the nervous, the endocrine and the immune system, each internally organized into subsystems functionally connected by intraconnections, to maintain the internal coherence of the system. The three adaptive systems aim at the maintenance of the internal coherence of the organism and are functionally linked by interconnections, in such way that what happens to one is immediately sensed by the others. The different communities of infectious agents that live within the organism are also organized into functional networks. The members of each community are linked by intraconnections, represented by the mutual trophic, metabolic and other influences, while the different infectious communities affect each other through <b>interconnections.</b> Furthermore, by <b>means</b> of its adaptive systems, the organism influences and is influenced by the microbial communities through the existence of transconnections.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to provide a}}n improved characterization of porous scaffolds. A more focused objective is to provide a computational model simulating the cell mediated resorption process of resorbable bone substitutes. The thesis is structured in three scientific manuscripts. The first manuscript used fuzzy-based image treatment methods to analyse images generated by micro-computed tomography. From the literature, it is known that the fuzzy-based method helps to improve the accuracy of the characterization, in particular for scaffolds featuring a relatively small pore size. In addition, a new algorithm was introduced to determine both pore and interconnection sizes. The surface area of bone substitutes was quantified by using marching cube algorithm. Besides, the so-called Lattice Boltzmann method was used to characterize the permeability of the investigated scaffolds. Scaffolds made of [béta]-tricalcium phosphate ([béta]-Ca[subscript 3](PO[subscript 4]) [subscript 2]) and presenting a constant porosity and four variable pore sizes were examined. The average pore size (diameter) of the four bone substitute groups (denominated with a letter from group A to D) was measured to be 170. 3 « 1. 7, 217. 3 « 5. 2, 415. 8 « 18. 8 and 972. 3 « 10. 9 [micro]m. Despite this significant change in pore size, the pore interconnection size only increased slightly, in the range of 61. 7 to 85. 2 [micro]m. The average porosity of the four groups was 52. 3 « 1. 5 %. The surface density of scaffolds decreased from 11. 5 to 3. 3 mm[superscript - 1], when the pore size increased. The results revealed that the permeability of scaffolds is in the same order of magnitude and increased from 1. 1 ? 10 [superscript - 10] to 4. 1 ? 10 [superscript - 10] m[superscript 2] with increasing the pore size. The second manuscript was devoted to the use of subvoxelization algorithm and high-resolution scanner, in an attempt to further improve the accuracy of the results, in particular, of the small pore scaffolds. As expected, an increase of the image resolution from 15 to 7. 5 [micro]m significantly eased the segmentation process and hence improved scaffold characterization. Subvoxelization also improved the results specifically in terms of interconnection sizes. Specifically, much smaller interconnection sizes were yielded after applying the subvoxelization process. For example, the <b>mean</b> <b>interconnection</b> size of small pore size groups, group A and B, dropped from 63 to 20 and 30 [micro]m, respectively. Furthermore, due to more details obtained from subvoxelization and high-resolution scanning, additional effects so called"boundary effects" were observed. The boundary effects can yield misleading results in terms of <b>interconnection</b> sizes. The <b>means</b> to reduce these effects were proposed. The third manuscript focused on the simulation and understanding of cell mediated resorption of bone graft substitutes. A computer model was developed to simulate the resorption process of four bone substitute groups. [mu]CT data and new"image processing" tools such as labelling and skeletonization were combined in an algorithm to perform the steps of resorption simulation algorithm. The proposed algorithm was verified by comparing simulation results with the analytical results of a simple geometry and biological in vivo data of bone substitutes. A correlation coefficient between the simulation results and both analytical and experimental data, was found to be larger than 0. 9. Local resorption process revealed faster resorption in external region specifically at earlier resorption time. This finding is in agreement with the in vivo results. Two definitions were introduced to estimate the resorption rate; volume resorption rate and linear resorption rate. The volume resorption rate was proportional to accessible surface and decreased when the pore size increased, while the linear resorption rate was proportional to thickness of material and increased with increasing the pore size. In addition, the simulation results revealed no effect of resorption direction on resorption behaviour of substitutes. However, the resorption rate of small pore size samples was decreased with increasing the minimum interconnection size required for cell ingrowth, to 100 [micro]m. This thesis combined novel"image processing" tools and subvoxelization method to improve the characterization of porous bone substitutes used in the bone repair process. The improved characterization allowed a more accurate simulation process. The simulation data were consistent with previously obtained biological data of the same group and allows understanding the local resorption process.

For such systems, which we call "large scale systems", {{it is necessary to}} take a new approach in order to solve control problems in a reasonable time, as well as for being able to design controllers which can be realized in a physically implementable way. This thesis concerns a class of linear time-invariant large scale systems which we call "decomposable systems". Decomposable systems describe systems made of a set of identical subsystems (or agents) that are interacting with each other, and they can be considered as an example of homogeneous systems with arbitrary <b>interconnections.</b> This <b>means</b> that each subsystem interacts only with a limited set of the others, and the interconnection pattern does not have to stick to a special structure or lattice. This class of systems describes very well a number of physical systems of interest, such as formations of vehicles or mechanical elements made of identical subparts. Decomposable systems are interesting under {{the point of view of}} the theory as they prove to be amenable to a kind of modal decomposition that depends only on the interconnection pattern and not on the specific system; this property, or "decomposition theorem", is at the basis of all the results shown in this thesis. The first part of this work concerns the problem of synthesizing distributed controllers for decomposable systems. By "distributed", we mean that the controller can be implemented as a set of simple, local controllers interacting with each other, each of them commanding a limited set of neighboring subsystems. This approach is demanded when the number of subsystems is very high: in this case it is not feasible to implement a centralized controller that reads all the outputs and decides all the control inputs. The decomposition property is exploited to convert the problem of controller synthesis for the global decomposable system into the problem of synthesizing controllers for the "modal" systems making up its decomposed version; such modal subsystems have the same order as a single agent. Then, by using techniques from robust control as well as a few results from graph theory, it is possible to cast the distributed controller synthesis problem as an optimization problem under Linear Matrix Inequality constraints. This leads to methods allowing performance-based synthesis of controllers in a variety of cases (e. g. H- 2 or H-infinity performance, continuous or discrete time, state or output feedback). The methods only offer suboptimality results, which can be considered as the price to be paid in exchange for the distributed structure of the controller. The distributed controller methods are then used in simulation for two examples of relevant technological application. The first application is the distributed H- 2 control of a deformable mirror for adaptive optics; as future Earth-based telescopes will feature deformable mirrors with actuators and sensors in the order of the thousands, the independence of the computational complexity from the system size makes the methods of this thesis very attractive. The second application considered is satellite formation flying, for which an extension of the H-infinity methods to the time-varying case is proposed. The controller is evaluated on two examples of space missions involving non-Keplerian orbits. The last part of the thesis concerns a problem that is complementary to the one of control; namely, it investigates the possibility of identifying models of decomposable systems from data. This possibility is useful in case such models are not available from first principles. It is shown that the decomposition property can be used in this case as well. The problem is first treated for a special case, namely for the class of circulant systems, and then examined in the general case. An approach based on subspace identification is proposed.
