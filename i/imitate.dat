40|$|Social {{psychological}} and developmental research revealed that imitation serves a fundamental social function.

In the current fMRI study we aimed at exploring the neural correlates of the positive consequences of being <b>imitated</b> by means of an observation paradigm. Our results indicate that being <b>imitated</b> compared to not being <b>imitated</b> activates brain areas that have been associated with emotion and reward processing, namely medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mOFC/vmPFC, GLM whole-brain contrast). Moreover mOFC/vmPFC shows higher effective connectivity with striatum and mid-posterior insula during being <b>imitated</b> compared to not being <b>imitated...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study investigates how children, {{younger than}} one {{and up to}} age three, {{in the first stage}} of {{development}} act when they are being <b>imitated</b> by an adult. When a child perceives that it is being <b>imitated</b> by an adult, it indicates that the child is making a clear distinction between itself and another person. The child objectively compares his behavior with the adult's behavior, and the child {{needs to be able to}} perceive the adult's intention. Perception of being <b>imitated</b> is a very important concept because it demonstrates the capacity of the child to recognize another person's intentions. We constructed a controlled situation where a child is playing with toys that he/she chose, while an adult <b>imitates</b> the child using another set of identical toys. As a result, children from one and half years of age, when they are being <b>imitated</b> by an adult, react as if they perceive that they are being <b>imitated.</b> Children indicate their perception by "deliberately changing their toys' direction of movement while watching the adult move his toy" or "exhibiting strange behaviors" or by "correcting the adult's behavior". Children's reactions to being <b>imitated</b> by adults gradually become more complicated and diverse...|$|R
