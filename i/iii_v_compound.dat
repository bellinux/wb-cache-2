40|$|Unfortunately, no {{appropriate}} <b>III</b> <b>V</b> <b>compound</b> {{has been}} found yet with a band gap {{in the range of}} 1 eV and the lattice constant of Ge or GaAs. In contrast, III V semiconductors with band gaps in the range of 1 eV can be grown epitaxially on the lattice constant of InP. The materials science challenge arises here for the higher band gaps. Nevertheless, it appears worthwhile to explore the possibilities of low band gap material based on the InP lattice constant. All III V compounds were grown via MOCVD using only non gaseous, i. e. less toxic, precursors like TBP and TBAs instead of PH 3 and AsH 3. Employing TBP a InP n p solar cell was prepared as reference cell yielding a similar or even higher internal quantum efficiency IQE than the best InP cell reported in the literature. InAlGaAs was employed as a n p cell for the 1 eV band gap range. Its QE was compared with the QE of the more established <b>III</b> <b>V</b> <b>compound</b> InGaAsP.

We aim to find suitable substitutes for the cadmium sulphide buffer layer in chalcopyrite based thin film solar cells, where the buffer layer is located between the p type chalcopyrite absorber and an n type transparent window layer.

The optical analysis of these films revealed band gaps between 1. 8 and 2. 5 eV, respectively. Chemical properties of the film surface and both interfaces between the film and a Cu In,Ga Se 2 layer and between the film and an Zn,Mg O layer were investigated by in situ photoelectron spectroscopy. The valence band offsets to the Cu In,Ga Se 2 layer were estimated to be 0. 4 0. 1 eV for LiCuS Cu In,Ga Se 2 and 0. 5 0. 8 eV for LiZnP Cu In,Ga Se 2.

40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{understanding of}} the formation of polar on nonpolar interfaces is a prerequisite for well defined heteroepitaxial preparation of <b>III</b> <b>V</b> <b>compounds</b> on 100 silicon for next generation high performance devices. Energetically and kinetically driven Si 100 step formations result in majority domains of monohydride terminated Si dimers oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the step edges. Here, the intentional variation of the Si 100 surface reconstruction controls the sublattice orientation of the heteroepitaxial GaP film, as observed by in situ reflection anisotropy spectroscopy RAS in chemical vapor ambient and confirmed by benchmarking to surface science analytics in ultrahigh vacuum. Ab initio density functional calculations of both abrupt and compensated interfaces are carried out. For P rich chemical potentials at abrupt interfaces, Si P bonds are energetically favored over Si Ga bonds, in agreement with in situ RAS experiments. The energetically most favorable interface is compensated with an intermixed interfacial layer. In situ RAS reveals that the GaP sublattice orientation depends on the P chemical potential during nucleation, which agrees with a kinetically limited formation of abrupt interface...|$|R
40|$|Among {{various types}} of solar cells, MOVPE grown triple {{junction}} <b>III</b> <b>V</b> <b>compound</b> semiconductors are today s most efficient photovoltaic devices with conversion efficiencies exceeding 40. A next generation multijunction cell with four or more junctions and optimized band gaps is expected to break the present record efficiency surpassing the 50 mark. High band gap material combinations that are lattice matched to GaAs are already well established, but the required low band gap combinations containing a band gap around 1 eV are still to be improved. For this purpose, we have developed a low band gap tandem 2 junction solar cell lattice matched to InP. For {{the top and bottom}} subcells InGaAsP Eg 1. 03 eV and InGaAs Eg 0. 73 eV were utilized, respectively. A new interband tunnel junction was used to connect the subcells, including thin and highly doped layers of n type InGaAs and p type GaAsSb. The delicate MOVPE preparation of critical interfaces was monitored with in situ reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy RAS. After a contamination free transfer, the RAS signals were then benchmarked in ultrahigh vacuum UHV with surface science techniques like low energy electron diffraction LEED and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS. XPS measurements revealed that the sharpest InGaAs GaAsSb interface was achieved, when the GaAsSb layer in the tunnel junction of the solar cell was grown on III rich 2 4 or 4 2 reconstructed InGaAs 100 surfaces.

40|$|Different {{stages of}} the III V {{nucleation}} occurring during the metamorphic growth of InP on Si 100 surfaces were studied. In particular, the first stages were investigated in detail, i. e. the deoxidation and the As termination, and finally the growth of thick InP films on the nucleation layer. The heteroepitaxial growth of the MOCVD prepared <b>III</b> <b>V</b> <b>compound</b> InP on Si 100 surfaces was characterized by optical in situ spectroscopy, benchmarked with various surface science tools, and studied with transmission electron microscopy. During the MOCVD preparation C and O contaminations were removed from Si 100 as it was shown by XPS and UPS. For the first time, tertiarybutylarsine was employed as non gaseous, much less toxic precursor compared to arsine to prepare clean arsenic terminated Si 100. Cleaning and deoxidation occurred at temperatures of around 900 C, which is significantly lower than it is known for UHV MBE preparation. The thickness of the passivating As termination was about one atomic monolayer. Even and odd numbered atomic steps occurred on the surface always resulting in a 2 x 1 1 x 2 twodomain surface. The domain structure of the Si 100 surface was independent from the angle {{and the degree of}} the misorientation, also including exactly oriented Si 100. Different, non bulk like double row structures were observed on the As terminated Si 100 surface via scanning tunneling microscopy STM. These double row structures have been modeled and described theoretically as so called 5 7 5 atomic ring structures at the National Renewable Energy Lab by McMahon et al., where concomitant studies have been performed in perfect agreement. These atomic ring structures do not appear on Si 100 surfaces treated with pure arsenic. They are energetically favorable compared to MBE prepared bulk like steps and flat surfaces and occur at steps, trenches, and ridges. In situ reflectance difference RD spectroscopy signals taken of the As terminated Si 100 surface showed the same fingerprint as single domain, 2 x 1 reconstructed surfaces obtained in UHV via MBE by Kipp et al. PRL 76 1996 2810, although LEED images of samples prepared in this work displayed a 2 x 1 1 x 2 two domain surface. For the first time, temperature resolved RD spectra down to 20 K were measured and did not show any energetic shift of the RDS peaks. Thus, the origin of the RD spectra appears to be different from the attribution made by Kipp et al. in their theoretical calculations, i. e. electron phonon interaction and reduced lattice vibration has been excluded to be the origin of the RDS signals in the measurements of this thesis. The clean and well defined As terminated Si 100 substrate led to a reduction of defects for the heteroepitaxially grown InP layer. A termination of the Si 100 surface with phosphorous instead of As turned out to be unfavorable. On the two domain, As terminated Si 100 surface a 40 nm InP nucleation layer and, finally, a gt; 1 m P rich state of the art InP film was grown that displayed a 2 x 1, single domain structure. AFM displayed that the nucleation layer was formed by about 20 400 nm crystallites with orientations parallel to the crystal axis. The defect density of the InP film was dependent {{on the size of the}} crystallites. For the first time, the entire growth process was monitored with in situ RDS. Some approaches have also been made to grow GaAs on Si 100 employing a SrTiO 3 buffer layer as it was proposed by Motorola...|$|E
