Reducing number of gates will reduce the chip area, and minimizing <b>interconnect</b> <b>path</b> length will give opportunity to use highest clock frequency. In this paper quaternary to binary and binary to quaternary converter are designed. We can design the multivalve logic to binary converter which is use for conversion of ternary-valued input 0, 1, 2 and quaternary-valued input 0, 1, 2, 3 into corresponding binary-valued output 0, 1. The physical design of the circuits is simulated and tested with MICROWIND layout design tool in 50 nm technology. The conversion method is simple and compatible with the present CMOS process.

In this model, ants communicate through the deposition of a trail pheromone that attracts other ants. In addition to the trail laying/following process, several other aspects of ant behavior were modeled.

A nanocomposite consisting of titania and an amphiphilic triblock copoly-mer ((PEO) MA-PDMS-MA(PEO)) was prepared by sol–gel chemistry.

Conductive scanning force m croscopy revealed that on top of almost every grain on the surface there is an increased conductivity compared to the average value. The correlation of grains and conductivity indicated that titania particles formed <b>interconnecting</b> <b>paths</b> through the film.

50|$|Another {{definition}} of spatial network {{derives from the}} theory of space syntax. It can be notoriously difficult to decide what a spatial element should be in complex spaces involving large open areas or many <b>interconnected</b> <b>paths.</b> The originators of space syntax, Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson use axial lines and convex spaces as the spatial elements. Loosely, an axial line is the 'longest line of sight and access' through open space, and a convex space the 'maximal convex polygon' that can be drawn in open space. Each of these elements {{is defined by the}} geometry of the local boundary in different regions of the space map. Decomposition of a space map into a complete set of intersecting axial lines or overlapping convex spaces produces the axial map or overlapping convex map respectively. Algorithmic definitions of these maps exist, and this allows the mapping from an arbitrary shaped space map to a network amenable to graph mathematics to be carried out in a relatively well defined manner. Axial maps are used to analyse urban networks, where the system generally comprises linear segments, whereas convex maps are more often used to analyse building plans where space patterns are often more convexly articulated, however both convex and axial maps may be used in either situation.|$|R

Inter-processor communication is achieved through a simple yet effective reconfigurable sourcesynchronous network. <b>Interconnect</b> <b>paths</b> between processors can sustain a peak throughput of one word per cycle. A theoretical model is developed for analyzing the performance of the network. A 65 nm CMOS GALS chip utilizing this network was fabricated which contains 164 programmable processors, three accelerators and three shared memory modules. For evaluating the efficiency of this platform, a complete 802. 11 a WLAN baseband receiver was implemented.

With the chip’s dual supply voltages set at 0. 95 V and 0. 75 V, and individual processors’ oscillators operating at workload-based optimal frequencies, the receiver consumes 123. 2 mW, which is a 29. 5 % reduction in power.

The main objective of the study was the characterization of the sediments of the basin, in order to define the nature, the composition, the geometry and the spatial relationships of detected geological bodies.

To answer these questions, this dissertation travels on two <b>interconnected</b> <b>paths.</b> First, it is the backstage story of a diplomatic revolution, chronicling how initially mid-level and then upper-level Executive Branch officials sought to change first the preconceptions which supported existing China policy, and then the policy itself. Second, it details how first the informed public and then the mass public reversed their once-steadfast positions on this issue, making change not only possible but profitable. The efforts of these officials inspired pundits and academics to call for change, which in turn altered the opinions of prominent senators and congressmen, who went from enforcing the status quo to calling for its upending.

40|$|International audienceThe {{ability to}} orient and {{navigate}} in space {{is essential for}} all animals whose home range is organized around a central point. Because of their small home range compared to vertebrates, central place foraging insects such as ants have {{for a long time}} provided a choice model for the study of orientation mechanisms. In many ant species, the movement of individuals on their colony home range is achieved essentially collectively, on the chemical trails laid down by their nest mates. In the initial stage of food recruitment, these trails can cross each other and thus form a network of <b>interconnected</b> <b>paths</b> in which ants have to orient. Previous simulation studies have shown that ants can find the shortest path between their nest and a food source in such a network only if there is a bias in the branch they choose when they reach an asymmetrical bifurcation. In this paper, we studied the choice of ants when facing either a symmetrical or an asymmetrical bifurcation between two tunnels. Ants were tested either {{on their way to a}} food source or when coming back to their nest, and either in the presence or in the absence of a chemical trail.

30|$|To better {{understand}} the contribution of SEC in this work, it is worth comparing the SEC chromatograms with the MIP plot (Figs.  3, 4). One seems the {{mirror image of the}} other as gauged by the presence of two peaks, one sharper and of higher intensity than the other. This similarity is just a reflection of how tightly is linked one graph with the other. We can picture the mHA material (SEC column) as having an <b>interconnected</b> <b>path</b> of 80  μm width whereby proteins travelling through the main stream would quickly cross the column eluting first and, the proteins in contact with the material would be more or less entertained depending on the microarchitecture of the stationary phase thus eluting second. Since the size of the proteins (i.e. a few nanometers) is much inferior {{to the size of the}} interconnected macropores (10 – 200  μm), this will cause all proteins travelling through the main stream to elute at the same time. It is then not surprising to see that both columns with similar macroarchitecture have the first elution peak appearing at the same time. It is worth noting that proteins travelling this path become irrelevant to the material as they are simply excluded without allowing any kind of interaction. Depending on the type of column and protein, the amount excluded can vary from 60  % to almost 80  % of the injected amount (Table  1).|$|R

30|$|Observations on seismic {{velocity}} and electrical resistivity should be combined {{to make a}} quantitative inference on fluid distribution. It is impossible to infer the amount of fluid only from observed seismic velocity. Seismic velocity of a fluid-bearing rock depends on the elastic properties of the solid and fluid phases and the geometry and amount of the fluid (e.g., Takei 2002). Even if we know the elastic property and geometry of the fluid, we cannot estimate the amount of fluid. Since the lithology of a study region is usually unknown, elastic properties of the rock matrix must be assumed. In addition, the fluid amount cannot be inferred only from observed resistivity. Electrical resistivity of a fluid-bearing rock depends on the resistivity of solid and fluid phases and the geometry and amount of fluid (e.g., Schmeling 1986). The resistivity of fluid is usually much {{lower than that of}} the rock matrix. If the fluid phase forms an <b>interconnected</b> <b>path,</b> the electrical conduction is dominated by the conduction through the fluid phase. The bulk conductivity hardly depends on the conductivity of the rock matrix. The estimation of the amount of fluid requires the knowledge of fluid resistivity, which is usually unknown. Owing to the uncertainty in fluid resistivity, the estimated amount of fluid must thus have large uncertainty. However, the fluid amount estimated from observed resistivity must be identical to that estimated from observed seismic velocity. This can be a constraint to reduce uncertainty in the interpretation of {{velocity and}} resistivity.|$|R
