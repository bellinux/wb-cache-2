TV programme first broadcast on 6 July 2017, in which he discovered his father was actually some 25 years older when he died.|$|E

500|$|Gimmick! was {{conceived}} by lead designer Tomomi Sakai, who put {{a variety of}} ideas into the programming of the game. The game may have been developed with a MicroVAX minicomputer, but Sakai claims he could have made the game how he wanted regardless of what equipment was used. In order to rival {{with the quality of}} Super NES games, a large staff was required. He <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> about developing his own game with Yoshiaki Iwata and Hiroyuki Kagoya, who were involved in designing Blaster Master, a previous Sunsoft title. The two, however, were paid very little for their involvement in making Gimmick!. Sound programmer Naohisa Morota, who had left Sunsoft shortly before development of Gimmick!, would work for Sakai as an [...] "outsourcer".|$|E

500|$|The {{mouth of}} the triptych's central figure was also {{inspired}} by the nurse's scream in film director Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in The Battleship Potemkin (1925). In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg confronted Bacon with a reproduction of the centre panel during the filming of a South Bank Show documentary, and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that I {{would be able to}} make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so." [...] When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed, Bacon admitted, [...] "It should be all much more colour, should have got more of the interior of the mouth, with all the colours of the interior of the mouth, but I didn't happen to get it." ...|$|E
500|$|The same year, Wilberforce {{moved his}} family from Clapham to a {{sizeable}} mansion with a large garden in Kensington Gore, closer to the Houses of Parliament. Never strong, and by 1812 in worsening health, Wilberforce resigned his Yorkshire seat, and became MP for the rotten borough of Bramber in Sussex, a seat {{with little or no}} constituency obligations, thus allowing him more time for his family and the causes that interested him. From 1816 Wilberforce introduced a series of bills which would require the compulsory registration of slaves, together with details of their country of origin, permitting the illegal importation of foreign slaves to be detected. Later in the same year he began publicly to denounce slavery itself, though he did not demand immediate emancipation, as [...] "They <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> the slaves incapable of liberty at present, but hoped that by degrees a change might take place as the natural result of the abolition." ...|$|E
500|$|The figure's {{mouth is}} opened wide as if screaming, an {{expression}} Bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin. In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg asked Bacon about the still, and observed {{that in his}} earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that I {{would be able to}} make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so." [...] When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed, Bacon said, [...] "It should be all much more colour, should have got more of the interior of the mouth, with all the colours of the interior of the mouth, but I didn't happen to get it." [...] His interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of diseased oral cavities bought in a second-hand bookshop, which he kept in his studio and to which he often referred.|$|E

500|$|The act was {{something}} that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as {{no one else will}} provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: [...] "It was such an epiphany that someone would want to give me her favorite thing. That stuck with me forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [...] meetings, one of the principles I had learned was that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in." [...] Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.|$|E
500|$|... "You Don't Love Me Anymore" [...] {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{original}} songs recorded during the 1990 sessions. The song is written as a soft acoustic ballad. However, the lyrics are of a—literally—destructive relationship between Yankovic and an unnamed girl. Although they were formerly in love, the [...] "flames died down" [...] and they are no longer passionate - in fact the girl hates Yankovic to such an extent that she repeatedly attempts to kill him. In 1992, when the album was finally released, Yankovic desired to release the song as a single. His record label, Scotti Brothers, allowed it under the stipulation that the music video be a parody of another music video. [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore" [...] was subsequently released to radio on June 19, 1992. While the song was an original composition, the video was a parody of [...] "More Than Words" [...] by Extreme. Yankovic later explained that when the song was released, many people erroneously believed it was a parody of [...] "More Than Words", and thus, Yankovic crafted the music video to be a parody of [...] "More Than Words." [...] The single received moderate radio attention, which surprised Yankovic, because he <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that radio stations [...] "usually just go for the parodies." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{biggest problem}} Mueller still faced was Apollo's {{slipping}} schedule and huge cost overruns. He <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> {{the only way}} to resolve this, and achieve a lunar landing before 1970, was {{to reduce the number of}} test flights. Mueller wanted to use his [...] "all-up testing" [...] concept with each flight using the full number of live stages. This approach had been used successfully on the Titan II and Minuteman programs but violated von Braun's engineering concepts. The von Braun test plan called for the first live test to use the Saturn's first stage with dummy upper stages. If the first stage worked correctly then the first two stages would be live with a dummy third stage and so on, with at least ten test flights before a manned version was put into low earth orbit.|$|E

2500|$|Churchill {{wrote to}} a friend: [...] "I have never heard such a squalid {{confession}} from a public man as Baldwin offered us yesterday". In 1935 Baldwin wrote to J. C. C. Davidson (in a letter now lost) saying of Churchill: [...] "If {{there is going to}} be a war – and no one can say that there is not – we must keep him fresh to be our war Prime Minister". Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: [...] "If we do have a war, Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [...] now we shan't be able to engage in that war as a united nation". The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: [...] "Baldwin thought his [...] political recovery was marvellous. He, personally, <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that if war came Winston would be the right man for the job".|$|E
2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{literary}} efforts originated {{after the}} experience, according to her, of a life-defining moment on 29 December 2000. She, her son Benjamin, daughter Jemima {{and her two}} sons, plus her niece Lady Cosima Somerset and her two children were travelling to Kenya, when a passenger on their British Airways plane stormed into the cockpit and tried to seize the controls. The autopilot on the flight to Nairobi became temporarily disengaged and the jumbo was knocked off course, abruptly diving and plunging [...] below. [...] "Nobody on that plane thought, 'am I going to die?'" [...] she later recalled. [...] "They all thought, 'we are going to die'. It was horrible, horrible." [...] This near-death incident has been credited by Lady Annabel as the catalyst for her writings. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that I would write a book", she claimed, [...] "but writing my memoirs didn't really come into my head until after that flight." [...] In the introduction to Annabel, she wrote: ...|$|E
