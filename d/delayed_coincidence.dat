50|$|Photoelectron photoion {{coincidence}} spectroscopy (PEPICO) is {{a combination}} of photoionization mass spectrometry and photoelectron spectroscopy. Free molecules from a gas-phase sample are ionized by incident vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation. In the ensuing photoionization, a cation and a photoelectron are formed for each sample molecule. The mass of the photoion is determined by time-of-flight mass spectrometry, whereas, in current setups, photoelectrons are typically detected by velocity map imaging. Electron times-of-flight are three orders of magnitude smaller than ion ones, which means that the electron detection {{can be used as a}} time stamp for the ionization event, starting the clock for the ion time-of-flight analysis. In contrast with pulsed experiments, such as REMPI, in which the light pulse must act as the time stamp, this allows to use continuous light sources, e.g. a discharge lamp or a synchrotron light source. No more than several ion-electron pairs are present simultaneously in the instrument, and the electron-ion pairs belonging to a single photoionization event can be identified and detected in <b>delayed</b> <b>coincidence.</b>|$|E

40|$|LENA (Low Energy Neutrino Astronomy) is a {{proposed}} next generation liquid-scintillator detector with about 50 kt target mass. Its main physics goals are {{the detection of}} solar neutrinos, supernova neu-trinos, geoneutrinos {{and the search for}} proton decay. Besides the direct observation of a supernova, LENA will also search for the so called diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) that was generated by core-collapse supernovae throughout the universe. Up to now the DSNB has not been detected, due to the low flux. As only 6 to 13 DSNB events per year are expected in LENA, background is a crucial issue for DSNB detection.
