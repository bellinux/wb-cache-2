40|$|In Hong Kong, the {{vibration}} effect of blasting from construction of rock tunnels is often {{limited to a}} defined peak particle velocity (PPV) value for each sensitive receiver affected by the blasting. Slope is considered as a sensitive receiver in Hong Kong whereby the PPV limits {{will continue to be}} the default-controlling factor over explosive charge weight and thus rates of tunnel advancement. The blast-induced vibration limits generally used in Hong Kong or issued by facility owners are prescriptive only. The adopted empirical attenuation equation was based on surface blast vibration monitoring data collected territory wide by the Mines and Quarries Division of the Hong Kong Government. It is unduly overly conservative in many cases as observed in the industry. The Department of Civil Engineering of The University of Hong Kong has collected and analyzed the blasting data from the construction of the Eagle’s Nest Tunnel, which is 2. 1 km long connecting traffic between Sha Tin and the Kowloon area. The tunnel has an arch-shaped profile with a <b>finished</b> <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> of 15 m in span and 10 m in height. Assessment has been made on {{the vibration}} effects to nearby slope stability with the use of an advance finite element program that considers the dynamic properties of the soil material and the propagation of dynamic waves. Attenuation constants derived from the blasts in certain sections of the tunnel are reviewed, using square root scaling, along with the statistical goodness of fit tests, to determine the reliability of empirical predictor equations. From the basis of the field data and numerical simulation, it is found that vibration data from blasting must be scrutinized {{to take into account the}} geology, and the free surfaces between the source and the receivers. The attenuation law changes rapidly when data is recorded close to the source and therefore monitoring of vibration close to the blasting source is needed to better define the attenuation constants. With proper calibration of field data, a very good match can be found between the measured attenuation constant and that generated by the finite element program. Using the dynamic stresses generated by blasting at each stage of tunnel advances; finite element analysis on slope stability has been carried out using the stability factor approach. The reduction of factor of safety for slope due to tunnel blasting is small when compared to the analysis assumed in simple closed form solution that is based on greatly simplified boundary condition and elastic theory. There is a great potential to relax the vibration limits currently adopted for slope in Hong Kong, thus improving the efficiency of blasting and shortening the construction time...|$|E

40|$|In {{idiopathic}} pulmonary {{arterial hypertension}} (PAH), increased pulmonary vascular resistance is associated with structural narrowing of small (resistance) vessels and increased vascular tone. Current information on pulmonary vascular remodeling is mostly limited to averaged increases in wall thickness, but information on number of vessels affected and <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> decreases for vessels of different sizes is limited. Our aim was to quantify numbers of affected vessels and their <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> decrease for differently sized vessels in PAH in comparison with non-PAH patients. <b>Internal</b> and external <b>diameters</b> of transversally cut vessels were measured in five control subjects and six PAH patients. Resistance vessels were classified in Strahler orders, <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> 13 mum (order 1) to 500 mum (order 8). The number fraction, that is, percentage of affected vessels, and the <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> fraction, that is, percentage diameter of normal diameter, were calculated. In PAH, not all resistance vessels are affected. The number fraction is about 30 %, that is, 70 % of vessels have diameters not different from vessels of control subjects. Within each order, the decrease in diameter of affected vessels is variable with an averaged diameter fraction of 50 - 70 %. Narrowing of resistance vessels is heterogeneous: not all vessels are narrowed, and the decrease in <b>internal</b> <b>diameters,</b> even within a single order, vary largely.

40|$|Some {{electrical}} applications have {{a number}} of heat sources. The closed-loop pulsating heat pipe (CLPHP) is applied to transfer heat from these devices. Since the CLPHP primarily transfers heat by means of the working fluid’s phase change in a capillary tube, the thermal performance of the CLPHP significantly depends on the working fluid type and the tube’s <b>internal</b> <b>diameter.</b> In order to provide the fundamental information for manufacturers of heat exchangers, this study on the effect of working fluids and <b>internal</b> <b>diameters</b> has been conducted. Three electrical plate heaters were installed on the CLPHP as the heat sources.

For each set of the same working fluid and <b>internal</b> <b>diameter,</b> the input heat fluxes of the heat sources were also made to vary within six different patterns. It can be concluded that when the latent heat of evaporation increases - in the case of vertical CLPHP - and when the dynamic viscosity of the liquid increases - in the case of horizontal CLPHP - the thermal performance decreases. Moreover, when the <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> increases, the thermal performance increases for both of vertical and horizontal CLPHPs...|$|R
