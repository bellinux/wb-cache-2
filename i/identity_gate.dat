50|$|Any {{reversible}} {{gate that}} consumes its inputs and allows all input computations must {{have no more}} input bits than output bits, by the pigeonhole principle. For one input bit, there are two possible reversible gates. One of them is NOT. The other is the <b>identity</b> <b>gate,</b> which maps its input to the output unchanged. For two input bits, the only non-trivial gate is the controlled NOT gate, which XORs the first bit to the second bit and leaves the first bit unchanged.|$|E
40|$|To the two {{classical}} reversible 1 -bit logic gates, i. e. the <b>identity</b> <b>gate</b> (a. k. a. the follower) and the NOT gate (a. k. a. the inverter), we add {{an extra}} gate, the square root of NOT. Similarly, we {{add to the}} 24 classical reversible 2 -bit circuits, both the square root of NOT and the controlled square root of NOT. This leads to {{a new kind of}} calculus, situated between classical reversible computing and quantum computing...|$|E
40|$|Resource {{states that}} contain nontrivial symmetry-protected topological order are {{identified}} for universal single-qudit measurement-based quantum computation. Our resource states {{fall into two}} classes: one as the qudit generalizations of the 1 D qubit cluster state, and the other as the higher-symmetry generalizations of the spin- 1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state, namely, with unitary, orthogonal, or symplectic symmetry. The symmetry in cluster states protects information propagation (<b>identity</b> <b>gate),</b> while the higher symmetry in AKLT-type states enables nontrivial gate computation.

40|$|An {{efficient}} optimal-control theory {{based on}} the Krotov method is introduced for a non-Markovian open quantum system with a time-nonlocal master equation in which the control parameter and the bath correlation function are correlated. This optimal-control method is developed via a quantum dissipation formulation that transforms the time-nonlocal master equation {{to a set of}} coupled linear time-local equations of motion in an extended auxiliary Liouville space. As an illustration, the optimal-control method is applied to find the control sequences for high-fidelity Z <b>gates</b> and <b>identity</b> <b>gates</b> of a qubit embedded in a non-Markovian bath. Z <b>gates</b> and <b>identity</b> <b>gates</b> with errors less than 10 ^- 5 {{for a wide range of}} bath decoherence parameters can be achieved for the non-Markovian open qubit system with control over only the σz term. The control-dissipation correlation and the memory effect of the bath are crucial in achieving the high-fidelity gates. Comment: two-column, 7 page...|$|R

40|$|The {{program of}} {{classifying}} symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases in 1 D has been recently completed and {{has opened the}} doors to study closely the properties of systems belonging to these phases. It was recently found that being able to constrain the form of ground states of SPT order based on symmetry properties also allows to explore novel resource states for processing of quantum information. In this paper, we generalize the consideration of Else et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 240505 (2012) ] where it was shown that the ground-state form of spin- 1 chains protected by Z_ 2 ×Z_ 2 symmetry supports perfect operation of the <b>identity</b> <b>gate,</b> important also for long-distance transmission of quantum information. We develop a formalism to constrain the ground-state form of SPT phases protected by any arbitrary finite symmetry group {{and use it to}} examine examples of ground states of SPT phases protected by various finite groups for similar gate protections. We construct a particular Hamiltonian invariant under A_ 4 symmetry transformation {{which is one of the}} groups that allows protected identity operation and examine its ground states. We find that there is an extended region where the ground state is the AKLT state, which not only supports the <b>identity</b> <b>gate</b> but also arbitrary single-qubit gates.

40|$|Ground {{states of}} spin lattices {{can serve as}} a {{resource}} for measurement-based quantum computation. Ideally, the ability to perform quantum gates via measurements on such states would be insensitive to small variations in the Hamiltonian. Here, we describe a class of symmetry-protected topological orders in one-dimensional systems, any one of which ensures the perfect operation of the <b>identity</b> <b>gate.</b> As a result, measurement-based quantum gates can be a robust property of an entire phase in a quantum spin lattice, when protected by an appropriate symmetry.

The watchman is named Fjölsviðr, a name of Odin in Grímnismál 47. He is accompanied by his wolf-hounds Geri and Gifr.

40|$|Large-scale data {{breaches}} exposing sensitive {{personal information}} are becoming commonplace. For numerous reasons, conventional personal (identification) information leaks from databases that store online and/or on-site user transaction data. Collected ID numbers and supporting personal information enable malicious parties to commit large-scale <b>identity</b> fraud. <b>Gates</b> and Slonim (NSPW 2003) proposed the owner-controlled information paradigm to address privacy violations of personal information where users {{are expected to}} maintain all their information using a personal device. Rubin and Wright (FC 2001), Molloy et al. (FC 2007), and others explored the use of one-time numbers to address credit card fraud (mostly for online use). However, several other types of ID number {{are at least as}} sensitive as credit card numbers. Our fundamental assumption is that collected personal information will eventually be breached. To combat identity fraud under this new environmental attack paradigm, we introduce a more general approach involving localized or customized ID numbers for both cardpresent and card-not-present transactions. We also explore four variants of the general idea to spark more discussion and further research in this area...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{memory is}} {{important}} to quantum information processing in many ways: a synchronization device to match various processes within a quantum computer, an <b>identity</b> quantum <b>gate</b> that leaves any state unchanged, and a tool to convert heralded photons to photons-on-demand. In addition to quantum computing, quantum memory would be instrumental {{for the implementation of}} long-distance quantum communication using quantum repeaters. The importance of this basic quantum gate is exemplified by the multitude of optical quantum memory mechanisms being studied: optical delay lines, cavities, electromagnetically-induced transparency, photon-echo, and off-resonant Faraday interaction. Here we report on the state-of-the-art in the field of optical quantum memory, including criteria for successful quantum memory and current performance levels. Comment: This is the original version of the review paper published in Nature Photonics. The review reflects {{the state of the art}} in the field as of September 2009.

40|$|The {{generation}} {{and maintenance of}} a plethora of neuronal subtypes is essential for normal brain function. Nevertheless, {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms that maintain the defining characteristics of neurons following their initial postmitotic specification. Using conditional gene ablation in mice, we demonstrate here that the homeodomain protein LIM homeobox (Lhx) 7 is essential for maintaining the morphological and molecular characteristics of cholinergic interneurons of the striatum. Lhx 7 -depleted cholinergic interneurons extinguish expression of several subtype-specific markers, including choline acetyl transferase and Isl 1, and are respecified into Lhx 6 -expressing mature GABAergic interneurons. Additional expression studies support a model where Lhx 7 controls the choice between cholinergic or GABAergic <b>identity</b> by <b>gating</b> a cross inhibitory regulation between Isl 1 and Lhx 6. By demonstrating that the switch between alternative striatal interneuron fates depends on persistent activity of a single transcription factor, we provide evidence that the intrinsic plasticity of mammalian forebrain neuronal subtypes is maintained after the initial specification and lineage commitment and possibly throughout life...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{explore the}} effects of various kinds of skip {{connections}} in stacked bidirectional LSTMs for sequential tagging. We investigate three kinds of skip connections connecting to LSTM cells: (a) skip connections to the gates, (b) skip connections to the internal states and (c) skip connections to the cell outputs. We present comprehensive experiments showing that skip connections to cell outputs outperform the remaining two. Furthermore, we observe that using <b>gated</b> <b>identity</b> functions as skip mappings works pretty well. Based on this novel skip connections, we successfully train deep stacked bidirectional LSTM models and obtain state-of-the-art results on CCG supertagging and comparable results on POS tagging.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{unresolved}} {{issues regarding}} proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the <b>identity</b> of the <b>gating</b> element that prevents the backflow of protons. In this study, we analyze two popular proposals for this element: isomerization of the key branching residue (Glu- 286) and (re) orientation of water molecules in the hydrophobic cavity. Using a multifaceted set of computational analyses that involve CcO embedded in either an implicit or explicit treatment of lipid membrane, we show that neither Glu- 286 nor active-site water likely constitutes the gating element. Detailed energetic and structural analyses of the simulation {{results indicate that the}} gating-relevant properties of these structural motifs observed in previous work are likely a result of the simplified computational models employed in those studies...|$|R
40|$|This study explores how class, {{location}} (space) {{and consumption}} interact {{in the making}} of a middle class <b>identity</b> in a <b>gated</b> community in Shanghai. It argues that the middle class homeowner’s class identity is created and reinforced through three levels of identification. Firstly, the symbolic meaning of a middle-class way of life is embedded in the social space of the gated community that creates a privileged lifestyle there. Secondly, the homeowners’ class identity is reinforced and expressed through similar modes of consumption and lifestyle in their everyday life. Thirdly, based on living in the same residential area and similar consumption patterns and lifestyles, the middle class group identity is formed and enhanced through community interaction and participation. Their class identity has become the basis for social networking and collective claims within the gated community. In the process, their class identity is further reinforced through a sense of distinction vis-à-vis the working-class migrant workers who live in the same community as group tenants. Although the middle class homeowners can be considered a unified social group within the <b>gated</b> community, their <b>identity</b> is not homogeneous. Social origins and personal life experiences also affect the middle class identity...|$|R
40|$|As {{the sole}} Ca 2 + entry {{mechanism}} {{in a variety}} of non-excitable cells, store-operated calcium (SOC) influx {{plays an important role in}} Ca 2 + signaling and many other cellular processes 1 – 3. A calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel in T lymphocytes is the best characterized SOC influx channel 4 – 6 and is essential to the immune response, sustained activity of CRAC channels being required for gene expression and proliferation 7 – 10. The molecular <b>identity</b> and the <b>gating</b> mechanism of SOC and CRAC channels have remained elusive. Previously, we identified Stim and the mammalian homolog STIM 1 as essential components of CRAC channel activation in Drosophila S 2 cells and human T lymphocytes 11. Here, we show that expression of EF hand mutants of Stim or STIM 1 activates CRAC channels constitutively without changing Ca 2 + store content. By immunofluorescence, EM localization, and surface biotinylation we demonstrate that STIM 1 migrates from ER-like sites to the plasma membrane upon depletion of the Ca 2 + store. We propose that STIM 1 functions as the missing link between Ca 2 + store depletion and SOC influx, serving as a Ca 2 + sensor that translocates upon store depletion to the plasma membrane to activate CRAC channels...|$|R

He thinks that Mangan is at the school and plans to leave with the tour, and decides to send Gates, undercover, along on the tour as an interpreter.

40|$|On Thursday, July 16, 2009, {{white male}} police officer James Crowley {{was called to}} the home of {{prominent}} black male scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr. on a report of a potential break-in. After confirming that no break-in had occurred and Gates’s <b>identity,</b> Crowley arrested <b>Gates</b> for disorderly conduct. Gates was promptly released without charges, and claimed he had been racially profiled. After the event became a national controversy, some people said that Gates was the true racist for assuming Crowley was racist. Only the parties “beer summit” with the President and Vice-president cooled the controversy. This article asks why Crowley arrested Gates and why some view Gates as the culprit. The answer to the first question is that this was not just racial profiling, but also a masculinity contest. The arrest can be conceived of as resulting from the ways the parties challenged each others’ masculinities, which resulted in a masculinity contest. Specifically, Gates’s violation of the unofficial rule of deference to the badge created a masculinity challenge for Crowley and resulted in a masculinity contest between the parties that Crowley resolved by arresting Gates. The answer to the second question is that race was indeed the dominant factor, but because of post-racialism, not traditional racism. Whereas colorblind ideology presumed the best way to reach an egalitarian society was to pretend race does not matter, post-racial ideology assumes we have reached that state. The ironic result of Obama’s election was to make it harder for the mainstream to see Crowley as implicitly biased and easier for them to see Gates as the true racist for having called Crowley racist. The complicated nature of the Gates arrest and controversy reveals the need for a scholarly program demonstrating that norms of masculinity, while invisible, strongly influence behavior and that post-racialism, while explicitly progressive, hides implicit bias from view...|$|R
40|$|Appendix 5 removed due to {{copyright}} restrictions. Spagnuolo, J., Opalka, N., Wen, W. X., Gagic, D., Chabaud, E., Bellini, P., [...] . Rakonjac, J. (2010). Identification of {{the gate}} regions in the primary structure of the secretin pIV. Molecular microbiology, 76 (1), 133 - 150. doi: 10. 1111 /j. 1365 - 2958. 2010. 07085. xSecretins are a family of large outer membrane proteins with large-diameter lumens (5 - 10 nm). This allows them to transport bulky substrates, including folded proteins, or assembled macromolecular structures – filamentous phages and type IV pili. Many proteins exported by secretins are essential for virulence of Gram-negative pathogens. Such a large channel would ordinarily sensitize the bacterial cell to noxious agents. However, secretins do not - {{the presence of a}} mobile septum, or gate, across the lumen of the channel prevents access by noxious agents. Despite the importance {{of the gate}} in secretin function, the sequence <b>identity</b> of the <b>gate</b> residues is unknown. In this study, in vivo random mutagenesis was used to map amino acid residues involved in gating the filamentous phage secretin - pIV. This approach has identified 34 residues that are involved in the gating mechanism. These residues are predominantly located within the secretin homology domain and organised into two clusters; GATE 1 (39 residues) and GATE 2 (14 residues). A number of isolated point mutants sensitised Escherichia coli to bile salts and antibiotics. These findings allowed the construction of a site-directed deletion mutant of GATE 2, confirming the gate function. This thesis mapped, for the first time, a secretin gate. Given the success of the mutagenesis approach used in this thesis, the method here will be applicable to secretins of pathogenic bacteria and other outer membrane channels whose gate regions have not been determined as yet. Knowing the gate regions of “pathogenic” secretins in turn will help design secretin-targeting antimicrobials...|$|R
