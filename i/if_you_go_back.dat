500|$|For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes [...] "sound {{like they}} were made in a {{cardboard}} box. I think [...] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if they sound like real folk songs—because <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, Love's {{work with}} Hole and her solo {{efforts have been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock. Spins October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had [...] "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I always talked about it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back...</b> what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework".|$|E
500|$|... "Rock Show", {{the first}} season finale of Parks and Recreation was written by Norm Hiscock and {{directed}} by series co-founder Michael Schur. Schur said he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked a change in tone for the series and struck a better balance between personal and professional stories {{than any of the}} other episodes from the season. Schur said: [...] "We treated that whole six-episode season like a pilot. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and watch those episodes now, you can see us making changes. The sixth episode is different in tone than the first. And we made some character tweaks, like every show ever does". Amy Poehler said she believed [...] "Rock Show" [...] would end what she described as the inevitable comparisons between Parks and Recreation and The Office, which is also produced by Parks creators Schur and Greg Daniels. Poehler said, [...] "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re on the other side of that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style.” Schur made his directorial debut with [...] "Rock Show", and had only one day of preparation before directing the episode. While preparing to direct the episode, Schur was asked to make an appearance on The Office as Mose Schrute, the cousin of Dwight Schrute and a popular minor character, in the fifth season finale episode, [...] "Company Picnic". Schur regretfully declined because he needed the time to work on [...] "Rock Show", leading Office episode writers Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta to create the character Rolf, Dwight's friend played by James Urbaniak, as an alternative.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Milray {{did not say}} {{anything}} to this. She asked, [...] "And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> what would <b>you</b> do there? Labor in the fields, as poor little Belsky advised?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] said Mrs. Almayer, violently. [...] "No, {{he sleeps}} now the sleep of gin; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> he might awake and see you. No, he shall never see you. When the terrible old man took {{you away from}} me when you were little, you remember--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Breckenridge quietly, [...] "it is just this. You {{have done}} {{a good deal for}} me already, and I almost dare to fancy I could be a credit to <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would do a little more, while it would carry {{conviction}} to my most doubting relatives <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the old country with me. They would only have to see you." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It {{had nothing to do with}} my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In another interview, Amos explained, [...] " [...] {{said to me}} in March when I {{was visiting}} him in New York, 'I’ve {{always wanted to know}} what you would do with a {{seasonal}} album. You’re a minister’s daughter so you grew up with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{television}} show Roger Ebert & the Movies, director Martin Scorsese named Eyes Wide Shut his fourth-favorite film of the 1990s. For the introduction to Michel Ciment's Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, Scorsese wrote: [...] "When Eyes Wide Shut came out {{a few months after}} Stanley Kubrick's death in 1999, it was severely misunderstood, which came as no surprise. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and look at the contemporary reactions to any Kubrick picture (except the earliest ones), you'll see that all his films were initially misunderstood. Then, after five or ten years came the realization that [...] or Barry Lyndon or The Shining was like nothing else before or since." [...] Mystery writer and commentator Jon Breen agreed. In 2012, Slant Magazine ranked the film as the second greatest of the 1990s. The BBC listed it number 61 in its list of the 100 greatest American films of all time.|$|E

5000|$|I {{will say}} I think, you know, colonel, I {{have to tell}} you that there are cases where a long course of history in fact does change the Constitution, and I can think of one instance. I believe I'm correct on this. I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and try to find and review the {{ratification}} of the 16th amendment, which was the internal revenue, income tax, I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and examined that carefully, you would find that a sufficient number of states never ratified that amendment ... And nonetheless, I think it's fair to say that it is part of the Constitution of the United States, and I don't think any court would ever...set it aside.|$|R

But no one believes what he has to say. Even worse, a group of CIA officers are tracking his every move, trying to stop him at every possible turn. With no one in the past he can trust, Joshua must take fate into his own hands—from Chicago, Washington, and West Berlin…to the battlefields of Soviet-occupied Afghanistan...|$|R

He also survived and was convicted in 2005 of aggravated {{attempted}} murder with a seven-year prison sentence. Culp forgave her husband at the sentencing and said she would be waiting when he gets out of prison, but on September 22, 2009, Culp said on an episode of Oprah that she no longer plans to wait for her former husband after her daughter asked her, [...] "Mom, what kind of example would you be setting for me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the man who shot your face off?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Crystal Fighters' {{style is}} {{a fusion of}} genres - fast {{progressive}} dance music joined by the melodies and dances of traditional Basque folk, alongside synthesisers, bass-driven wonk-funk, with beats fuelled by early 1980s Spanish punk and experimental electronica from bands such as Aviador Dro, Las Vulpes and Dulce Venganza. Basque music informs much of their songwriting: the riff on [...] "Champion Sound" [...] is lifted from the Basque folk piece [...] "Sagar Dantza" [...] and [...] "In The Summer" [...] draws upon music heard at the Carnival of Lantz in Navarra. Paul Lester of The Guardian has described their style as [...] "what would happen <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> 100 years, dropped a load of recording equipment into a remote Basque village and left the villagers, steeped in folk music, to their own devices." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2012 the PVV party {{launched}} a website named Reporting Centre on Central and East Europeans to receive complaints about Central and East European {{immigrants in the}} Netherlands. 'Do you have problems with people from Central and Eastern Europe? Have you lost your job to a Pole, a Bulgarian, a Romanian or another East European? We want to know,' the website states. It displays newspaper headlines such as 'Wouldn't it be better <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> home?' and 'East Europeans, increasingly criminal'. The European Commission has condemned the website, and EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding declared, [...] "We call on all citizens of the Netherlands not to join in this intolerance.

5000|$|Understanding a site {{in modern}} {{archaeology}} {{is a process of}} grouping single contexts together in ever larger groups by virtue of their relationships. The terminology of these larger clusters varies depending on the practitioner, but the terms interface, sub-group, and group are common. An example of a sub-group could be the three contexts that make up a burial; the grave cut, the body, and the back-filled earth on top of the body. Sub-groups can then be clustered together with other sub-groups by virtue of their stratigraphic relationship to form groups, which in turn form [...] "phases." [...] A sub-group burial could cluster with other sub-group burials to form a cemetery, which in turn could be grouped with a building, such as a church, to produce a [...] "phase". Phase implies a nearly contemporaneous Archaeological horizon, representing [...] "what <b>you</b> would see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to time X".The production of phase interpretations is the first goal of stratigraphic interpretation and excavation.|$|R
