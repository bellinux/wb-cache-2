6000|$|She {{had been}} placed for her education, {{fourteen}} years before, in a Parisian convent, by a widowed mammma who was fonder of Homburg and Nice than of letting out tucks in the frocks of a vigorously growing daughter. Here, besides various elegant accomplishments--the art of wearing a train, of composing a bouquet, of presenting a cup of tea--she acquired a certain turn of the imagination which might have passed for a sign of precocious worldliness. She dreamed of marrying a man of hierarchical [...] "rank"--not {{for the pleasure of}} hearing herself called Madame la Vicomtesse, for which it seemed to her she should never greatly care, but because she had a romantic belief that the enjoyment of inherited and transmitted consideration, consideration attached to the fact of birth, would be the <b>direct</b> <b>guarantee</b> of an ideal delicacy of feeling. She supposed it would be found that the state of being noble does actually enforce the famous obligation. Romances are rarely worked out in such transcendent good faith, and Euphemia's excuse was the prime purity of her moral vision. She was essentially incorruptible, and she took this pernicious conceit to her bosom very much {{as if it had been}} a dogma revealed by a white-winged angel. Even after experience had given her a hundred rude hints she found it easier to believe in fables, when they had a certain nobleness of meaning, than in well-attested but sordid facts. She believed that a gentleman with a long pedigree must be of necessity a very fine fellow, and enjoyment of a chance to carry further a family chronicle begun ever so far back must be, as a consciousness, a source of the most beautiful impulses. It wasn't therefore only that noblesse oblige, she thought, as regards yourself, but that it ensures as nothing else does in respect to your wife. She had never, at the start, spoken to a nobleman in her life, and these convictions were but a matter of extravagant theory. They were the fruit, in part, of the perusal of various Ultramontane works of fiction--the only ones admitted to the convent library--in which the hero was always a Legitimist vicomte who fought duels by the dozen but went twice a month to confession; and in part of the strong social scent of the gossip of her companions, many of them filles de haut lieu who, in the convent-garden, after Sundays at home, depicted their brothers and cousins as Prince Charmings and young Paladins. Euphemia listened and said nothing; she shrouded her visions of matrimony under a coronet in the silence that mostly surrounds all ecstatic faith. She was not of that type of young lady who is easily induced to declare that her husband must be six feet high and a little near-sighted, part his hair in the middle and have amber lights in his beard. To her companions her flights of fancy seemed short, rather, and poor and untutored; and even the fact that she was a sprig of the transatlantic democracy never sufficiently explained her apathy on social questions. She had a mental image of that son of the Crusaders who was to suffer her to adore him, but like many an artist who has produced a masterpiece of idealisation she shrank from exposing it to public criticism. It was the portrait of a gentleman rather ugly than handsome and rather poor than rich. But his ugliness was to be nobly expressive and his poverty delicately proud. She had a fortune of her own which, at the proper time, after fixing on her in eloquent silence those fine eyes that were to soften the feudal severity of his visage, he was to accept with a world of stifled protestations. One condition alone she was to make--that he should have [...] "race" [...] in a state as documented as it was possible to have it. On this she would stake her happiness; and it was so to happen that several accidents conspired to give convincing colour to this artless philosophy.|$|E

5000|$|In July 1936, Zinoviev and Kamenev {{were brought}} to Moscow from an {{unspecified}} prison. They were interrogated and denied being part of any Trotsky-led conspiracy. Yezhov appealed to Zinoviev's and Kamenev's devotion to the Soviet Union as old Bolsheviks and advised them that Trotsky was fomenting anti-Soviet sentiment amongst the proletariat in the world. Throughout {{spring and summer of}} 1936 the investigators were requesting from the arrested [...] "to lay down arms in front the party" [...] exerting a continuous pressure on them. Furthermore, this loss of support, {{in the event of a}} war with Germany or Japan, could have disastrous ramifications for the Soviet Union. To Kamenev specifically, Yezhov showed him evidence that his son was subject to an investigation that could result in his son's execution. According to one witness, with the beginning of summer in the Zinoviev's and Kamenev's cells were turned on central heating. Zinoviev who was struggling with asthma especially badly tolerated heat. Finally exhausted prisoners went on a deal with Stalin who promised them on the behalf of Politburo their lives in exchange to participate in the anti-Trotskyist spectacle. Kamenev and Zinoviev agreed to confess on condition that they receive a <b>direct</b> <b>guarantee</b> from the entire Politburo that their lives and those of their families and followers would be spared.

The agreement allowed the station to be located in Ny-Ålesund in exchange for Norwegian authorities building and operating the facility.

Each case serves as a distinct experiment that stands on its own as an analytic unit. The six cases thus are discrete experiments that serve as replications and contrasts.

Moreover, the coordination modes and the use of hard conflict resolution mechanisms vary with the type of conflict (i. e., project or behavioural).
