5|$|Although Salinger {{tried to}} escape public {{exposure}} as much as possible, he continued to struggle with unwanted attention from both {{the media and the}} public. Readers of his work and students from nearby Dartmouth College often came to Cornish in groups, hoping {{to catch a glimpse of}} him. In May 1986 Salinger learned that the British writer Ian Hamilton intended to publish a biography that made <b>extensive</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> letters Salinger had written to other authors and friends. Salinger sued to stop the book's publication. The court in Salinger v. Random House ruled that Hamilton's <b>extensive</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the letters, including quotation and paraphrasing, was not acceptable since the author's right to control publication overrode the right of fair use.|$|E

5|$|According to an anecdote, {{the idea}} arose after {{a group of}} Royal Navy {{officers}} saw a similar, but fictional, bomb depicted in the 1943 Walt Disney animated propaganda film Victory Through Air Power, and the name Disney was consequently given to the weapon. The Royal Navy developed the bomb even though the Fleet Air Arm operated no aircraft capable of carrying it. The navy was interested in a concrete-penetrating weapon due to the German navy's <b>extensive</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> fortified submarine pens to protect their U-boats and E-boats from air attack while docked.|$|E

This wave of research culminated in Sir Maurice Powicke's two major biographical works on Henry, published in 1948 and 1953, which formed the established history of the King {{for the next three}} decades.|$|E
