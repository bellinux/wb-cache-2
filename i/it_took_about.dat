5|$|Pioneers 10 and 11 {{and both}} Voyager probes carry {{messages}} from the Earth to extraterrestrial life. Communication can be difficult with deep space travel. For instance, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> three hours for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft when {{it was more than}} halfway to Pluto. Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who walked on the towpaths pulling the barge with a harness over their shoulder. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 18 hours to pull a barge through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the barge {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped manoeuver the barges using a boat hook. Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E

5|$|Following {{training}} exercises {{with the}} 32nd U-boat Flotilla from 30 September 1944 to 15 February 1945, U-2336 began her first voyages as a front boat of the 4th U-boat Flotilla on 16 February 1945. However, on 18 February 1945 {{she was involved}} in a collision with , another Type XXIII U-boat, off Heiligendamm on the Baltic coast. U-2344 was sunk, with the loss of 11 of her crew. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> two months for U-2336 to actually leave her home port of Kiel, which she finally did on 18 April 1945 under a new commander, Kapitänleutnant Emil Klusmeier. Following five days of traveling across the straits of Kattegat and Skagerrak, U-2336 reached Larvik, Norway on 24 April 1945; which was to be her new home port {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Rescue efforts began {{immediately}} after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within {{half an hour of}} the impact. Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building. Within minutes, the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site. The firemen ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards. The Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD) assumed command of the immediate rescue operation within 10minutes of the crash. ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an incident command system (ICS) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational. Firefighters from Fort Myer and Reagan National Airport arrived within minutes. Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes. Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E

25|$|The {{next major}} {{findings}} {{occurred during the}} expeditions led by the American paleontologist Paul Sereno in 1995 (Aoufous Formation, Morocco), 1997 and the follow-up trip in 2000. Partial skeletons, numerous skulls and 20 tons of assorted other fossils were recovered from the deposits of the Elrhaz Formation, which has been dated as late Aptian or early Albian stages of the Late Cretaceous. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> a year to prepare the Sarcosuchus remains.|$|E
25|$|The firing table {{calculations}} were {{accomplished by}} about one hundred women operating mechanical desk calculators. Each combination of gun, round and geographical region required a {{unique set of}} firing tables. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 750 calculations to compute a single trajectory and each table had about 3,000 trajectories. It took human computer at least 7 hours to calculate one trajectory. To increase production, BRL enlisted the computing facilities of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and Goldstine was the liaison between BRL and the university.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the 14 killed, 22 others were seriously injured, either by bullets or other causes. Once the injured were extracted from the building, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 15 minutes {{for them to get}} to the hospital. Five patients were transported to nearby Loma Linda University Medical Center and six were transported to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center. The last of those hospitalized for injuries sustained in the attack was discharged from Loma Linda University Medical Center on March 3, 2016, over three months after the event.|$|E

25|$|From the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union until May 1992, the Soviet ruble circulated in Belarus alongside the Belarusian ruble. New Russian banknotes also circulated in Belarus, but they were replaced by notes issued by the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus in May 1992. The first post-Soviet Belarusian ruble was assigned the ISO code BYB and replaced the Soviet currency at the rate of 1 Belarusian ruble = 10 Soviet rubles. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> two years before the ruble became the official currency of the country.|$|E
25|$|After the Replacements {{signed with}} Twin/Tone, Westerberg {{began to write}} new songs and soon had a whole album's worth of material. Mere weeks after their live debut, the band felt ready to record the album. Jesperson chose Blackberry Way, an eight-track home studio in Minneapolis. However, as the band had no clout there, {{time spent in the}} studio was intermittent, and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> six months to record the album. Although not {{important}} at the time, Twin/Tone could not afford to release the album until August 1981. Because they were suspicious of the music business in general, the Replacements had not signed a written contract with Twin/Tone Records.|$|E
25|$|The most {{reliable}} {{information about the}} Bible's date comes from a letter. In March 1455, the future Pope Pius II wrote {{that he had seen}} pages from the Gutenberg Bible, being displayed to promote the edition, in Frankfurt. It is not known how many copies were printed, with the 1455 letter citing sources for both 158 and 180 copies. Scholars today think that examination of surviving copies suggests that somewhere between 160 and 185 copies were printed, with about three-quarters on paper and the others on vellum. However, some books say that about 180 copies were printed and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> three years to produce them.|$|E

25|$|As well {{as being}} a water and {{recreation}} resource, the river was historically a critical communications and transport link for the communities along it. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 3 days to paddle a waka from Waiuku to the Cambridge/Te Awamutu area. Taupo, Mangakino, Cambridge, Hamilton, Horotiu, Ngaruawahia, Huntly, Hampton Downs, Meremere, Waiuku and Port Waikato are on or close to it. The Waikato River in Hamilton is frequently used by rowers, kayakers and powered pleasure craft. Water-skiers and jet skis have zones outside the city limits {{where they can be}} used. There are two ramps for launching boats – one in Pukete and the other just north of the traffic (Bridge St) bridge.|$|E
25|$|According to the Taliban, four of {{the attackers}} had served as soldiers, who had been {{stationed}} at the base, and knew its layout. Two of the attackers detonated their suicide vests in the mosque and eight others {{were killed in the}} ensuing gun battle. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> five hours for security forces, who responded to the attack, to kill the militants and secure the base. 140 soldiers were killed and 160 wounded in the massacre, according to provincial official Mohammad Ibrahim Khair Andesh. On 25 April, Afghan news agency TOLOnews reported 256 soldiers had been killed, and that the government was withholding the higher death toll. A Taliban statement released after the attack said at least 500 Afghan soldiers had been injured or killed.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1939, Dr. Peter Goldmark and {{his staff}} at Columbia Records and at CBS Laboratories {{undertook}} efforts to address problems of recording and playing back narrow grooves and developing an inexpensive, reliable consumer playback system. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>about</b> eight years of study, except when it was suspended because of World War II. Finally, the 12-inch (30cm) Long Play (LP) rpm microgroove record album was introduced by the Columbia Record Company at a New York press conference on June 18, 1948. At the same time, Columbia introduced a vinyl 7-inch rpm microgroove single, calling it ZLP, but it was short-lived and is very rare today, because RCA Victor introduced a 45rpm single a few months later, which became the standard.|$|E
