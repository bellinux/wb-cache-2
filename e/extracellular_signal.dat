25|$|In the phosphatidylinositol signal pathway, the <b>extracellular</b> <b>signal</b> {{molecule}} binds {{with the}} G-protein receptor (Gq) {{on the cell}} surface and activates phospholipase C, which {{is located on the}} plasma membrane. The lipase hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds with the IP3 receptor in the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to open Ca2+ channels. DAG helps activate protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates many other proteins, changing their catalytic activities, leading to cellular responses.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{receiving}} a pro-mitotic <b>extracellular</b> <b>signal,</b> G1 cyclin-CDK complexes become active {{to prepare the}} cell for S phase, promoting the expression of transcription factors that in turn promote the expression of S cyclins and of enzymes required for DNA replication. The G1 cyclin-CDK complexes also promote the degradation of molecules that function as S phase inhibitors by targeting them for ubiquitination. Once a protein has been ubiquitinated, it is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. However, results from {{a recent study of}} E2F transcriptional dynamics at the single-cell level argue that the role of G1 cyclin-CDK activities, in particular cyclin D-CDK4/6, is to tune the timing rather than the commitment of cell cycle entry.|$|E

The tubulin production dynamics were supplied by a function describing the influence of <b>extracellular</b> <b>signalling,</b> which can promote or depress neurite elongation.

40|$|Cell growth, {{differentiation}} {{and death}} are directed {{in large part}} by <b>extracellular</b> <b>signaling</b> through the interactions of cells with other cells and with the extracellular matrix; these interactions are in turn modulated by cytokines and growth factors, i. e. the microenvironment. Here we discuss the idea that <b>extracellular</b> <b>signaling</b> integrates multicellular damage responses that are important deterrents to the development of cancer through mechanisms that eliminate abnormal cells and inhibit neoplastic behavior. As an example, we discuss the action of transforming growth factor beta (TGFB 1) as an extracellular sensor of damage. We propose that radiation-induced bystander effects and genomic instability are, respectively, positive and negative manifestations of this homeostatic process. Bystander effects exhibited predominantly after a low-dose or a nonhomogeneous radiation exposure are <b>extracellular</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways that modulate cellular repair and death programs. Persistent disruption of <b>extracellular</b> <b>signaling</b> after exposure to relatively high doses of ionizing radiation may lead to the accumulation of aberrant cells that are genomically unstable.

50|$|EPSPs {{are usually}} {{recorded}} using intracellular electrodes. The <b>extracellular</b> <b>signal</b> {{from a single}} neuron is extremely small and thus next to impossible to record in the human brain. However, {{in some areas of}} the brain, such as the hippocampus, neurons are arranged {{in such a way that}} they all receive synaptic inputs in the same area. Because these neurons are in the same orientation, the extracellular signals from synaptic excitation don't cancel out, but rather add up to give a signal that can easily be recorded with a field electrode. This <b>extracellular</b> <b>signal</b> recorded from a population of neurons is the field potential. In studies of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), figures are often given showing the field EPSP (fEPSP) in stratum radiatum of CA1 in response to Schaffer collateral stimulation. This is the signal seen by an extracellular electrode placed in the layer of apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. The Schaffer collaterals make excitatory synapses onto these dendrites, and so when they are activated, there is a current sink in stratum radiatum: the field EPSP. The voltage deflection recorded during a field EPSP is negative-going, while an intracellularly recorded EPSP is positive-going. This difference is due to the relative flow of ions (primarily the sodium ion) into the cell, which, in the case of the field EPSP is away from the electrode, while for an intracellular EPSPs it is towards the electrode. After a field EPSP, the extracellular electrode may record another change in electrical potential named the population spike which corresponds to the population of cells firing action potentials (spiking). In other regions than CA1 of the hippocampus, the field EPSP may be far more complex and harder to interpret as the source and sinks are far less defined. In regions such as the striatum, neurotransmitters such as dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA and others may also be released and further complicate the interpretation.|$|E
