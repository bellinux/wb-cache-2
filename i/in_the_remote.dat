5|$|Banksia epica is a shrub {{that grows}} {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia. A {{spreading}} bush with wedge-shaped serrated leaves and large creamy-yellow flower spikes, it grows up to 3½metres (11½ft) high. It is known only from two isolated populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> south east of the state, near {{the western edge of}} the Great Australian Bight. Both populations occur among coastal heath on cliff-top dunes of siliceous sand.|$|E
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, in the 19th century, Kanaks were {{recruited}} or enslaved, to perform unfree labour {{in places such}} as Australia, California, Canada, Chile and Fiji (with the inter-Asian slave trade to India, Japan, South Africa, and what is now Malaysia). During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> islands, they were unprepared for the arrival of European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works.|$|E

By late 2010 the FDLR's strength however was estimated at 2,500. The other groups are smaller: the Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army, the Ugandan rebel group the Allied Democratic Forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> area of Mt Rwenzori, and the Burundian Parti pour la Libération du Peuple Hutu—Forces Nationales de Liberation (PALIPEHUTU-FNL).|$|E

5|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding {{the origins of}} Raelian beliefs centers on the writings of several authors in the late 1960s. , a French writer, translator, and author of books on the esoteric and UFOs wrote several novels detailing the creation of Earth by extraterrestrials. One {{of the best known}} researchers in this field is Erich von Däniken, the 'father' of the Ancient Astronauts theory, which postulates that Earth might have been visited by extraterrestrials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> past.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} vigilante {{justice and the}} Montana Vigilantes began in 1863 in what {{was at the time}} a remote part of eastern Idaho Territory. Vigilante {{activities}} continued, although somewhat sporadically, through the Montana Territorial period until the territory became the state of Montana on November 8, 1889. Vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts had very little power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> mining camps during the territorial period.|$|E
5|$|A young peasant named Diermot is {{employed}} as a beater for the king's hunting party. One night the king receives a note from a messenger, requesting his services to help quell a rebellion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> village of Turnvale. As the king's party departs, Diermot’s pony follows them, unwittingly carrying him to the battle. When the party arrives at Turnvale they are not confronted by a peasant revolt. Instead they find a band of man-eating Skorl, led by an enchantress named Selena, the titular temptress. The king's men are defeated and the king is killed. In the process, Diermot is thrown from his saddle and is knocked unconscious. The Skorl take Diermot prisoner and imprison him in the local dungeon.|$|E
5|$|Amid PCC/ZAPU's {{calls for}} various strikes and protests, {{including}} an appeal for black children to boycott state schools, Smith's Justice Minister Clifford Dupont had Nkomo and other PCC/ZAPU leaders restricted at Gonakudzingwa <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> south-east {{two days after}} Smith took office. The politically motivated killing of a white man, Petrus Oberholzer, near Melsetter by ZANU insurgents on 4 July 1964 marked the start of intensified black nationalist violence and police counteraction that culminated in the banning of ZANU and PCC/ZAPU on 26 August, {{with most of the}} two movements' respective leaders concurrently jailed or restricted. ZANU, ZAPU and their respective guerrilla armies—the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)—thereafter operated from abroad.|$|E

5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> border regions.|$|E
5|$|Jarrow, {{situated}} on the River Tyne in County Durham, northern England, entered British history in the 8th century, {{as the home of}} Bede, the early Christian monk and scholar. After Bede, little changed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> rural community for a thousand years, although his monastery was dissolved under Henry VIII in the 16th century. The discovery of coal in the 17th century led to major changes. Mining on an industrial scale began in the early 1800s, resulting in the population of Jarrow more than doubling between 1801 and 1821 to around 3,500, largely from the influx of mineworkers.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826, {{and soon}} {{thereafter}} his parents acquired a farm {{of their own}} to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother {{died when he was}} eight; Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (née du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, Kruger's only education was three months under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious instruction from his father. In adulthood Kruger would claim to have never read any book apart from the Bible.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} the empire was largely {{dependent}} on agriculture. Sorghum (jowar), cotton, and pulse legumes grew in semi-arid regions, while sugarcane, rice, and wheat thrived in rainy areas. Betel leaves, areca (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as turmeric, pepper, cardamom, and ginger grew <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> Malnad hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of masons, sculptors, and other skilled artisans.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} region bordering Spanish and Portuguese territories in South America {{was largely}} unexplored {{at the end}} of the 17th century. Dispatched by the Spanish Crown, Jesuits explored and founded eleven settlements in 76 years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> Chiquitania – then known as Chiquitos – on the frontier of Spanish America. They built churches (templos) in a unique and distinct style that combined elements of native and European architecture. The indigenous inhabitants of the missions were taught European music as a means of conversion. The missions were self-sufficient, with thriving economies, and virtually autonomous from the Spanish crown.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Khmer speakers speak Central Khmer, the dialect of the central plain where the Khmer are most heavily concentrated. Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, {{and that of the}} Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the Khmer Empire. The Northern Khmer dialect is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of Northeast Thailand and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the Khmer of Vietnam while the Khmer living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> Cardamom mountains speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the Middle Khmer language.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> Klondike, {{there was}} great demand for news and contact with the world outside. During {{the first months of}} the stampede in 1897, it was said that no news was too old to be read. In the lack of newspapers, some prospectors would read can labels until they knew them by heart. The {{following}} year, two teams fought their way over the passes to reach Dawson City first, complete with printing-presses, with the aim of gaining control of the newspaper market. Gene Kelly, the editor of the Klondike Nugget arrived first, but without his equipment, and it was the team behind the Midnight Sun who produced the first daily newspaper in Dawson. The Dawson Miner followed shortly after, bringing the number of daily newspapers in the town during the gold rush up to three. The Nugget sold for $24 ($680) as an annual subscription, and became well known for championing popular causes associated with miners and for its lucid coverage of scandals. Paper was often hard to find and during the winter of 1898–99, the Nugget had to be printed on butcher's wrapping paper. In the lack of paper, news could be told. In June, 1898, a prospector bought an edition of the Seattle Post-Intellinger at an auction and charged spectators a dollar each to have it read aloud in one of Dawson's halls.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{imprisonment}} transformed {{him into}} a political martyr for many Kenyans, further enhancing his status. A Luo anti-colonial activist, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, {{was the first to}} publicly call for Kenyatta's release, an issue that gained growing support among Kenya's anti-colonialists. In 1955, the British writer Montagu Slater—a socialist sympathetic to Kenyatta's plight—released The Trial of Jomo Kenyatta, a book which raised the profile of the case. By the late 1950s, the imprisoned Kenyatta had become a symbol of African nationalism across the continent. Calls for his release were being made outside Kenya: resolutions to that effect were produced at the All-African Peoples' Conferences held in Tunis in 1960 and Cairo in 1961. Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere also did so. Activists in the Kenyan Asian community also backed him, with the Kenya Indian Congress calling for his release. In April 1959, Kenyatta was released from Lokitaung. The administration then placed a restricting order on Kenyatta, forcing him to reside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> area of Lodwar, where he had to report to the district commissioner twice a day. There, he was joined by his wife Ngina. In October 1961 she bore him another son, Uhuru, and later on another daughter, Nyokabi, and a further son, Muhoho. Kenyatta spent two years in Lodwar.|$|E
5|$|The Vandals had {{occupied}} Roman North Africa {{in the early}} 5th century, and established an independent kingdom there. Under their first king, Geiseric, the formidable Vandal navy carried out pirate attacks across the Mediterranean, sacked Rome and defeated a massive Roman invasion in 468. After Geiseric's death, relations with the surviving Eastern Roman Empire normalized, although tensions flared up occasionally due to the Vandals' militant adherence to Arianism and their persecution of the Catholic native population. In 530, a palace coup in Carthage overthrew the pro-Roman Hilderic and replaced him with his cousin Gelimer. The Eastern Roman emperor Justinian took this as a pretext to interfere in Vandal affairs, and after he secured his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, he began preparing an expedition under general Belisarius, whose secretary Procopius wrote the main historical narrative of the war. Justinian took advantage of, or even instigated, rebellions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> Vandal provinces of Sardinia and Tripolitania. These not only distracted Gelimer from the Emperor's preparations, but also weakened Vandal defences through the dispatch of {{the bulk of the}} Vandal navy and a large portion of their army under Gelimer's brother Tzazon to Sardinia.|$|E
