40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business AdministrationThe {{objective}} of this dissertation is to empirically investigate the effect of professional credentials on personal financial planning practitioner’s income in Hong Kong. Financial planning in Hong Kong is relatively new among financial services, dating back only to the early 2000 s. The financial planning industry in Hong Kong is largely unregulated, and professional certification {{is not required to}} act as a <b>financial</b> <b>planner.</b> Regardless, many individuals working in the financial planning field choose to undertake one or more professional certifications, such as a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERCM (the most common and most highly regarded) and others. There are currently over 66, 000 CFPcertified <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> <b>in</b> Hong Kong, along with an unknown number of other certifications. This study seeks to investigate why individuals undergo certification in the absence of external regulatory requirements. We employ human capital and inequality theories to describe the process of certification as a voluntary investment in knowledge and skill building, and then posit that this would only be justified if there were an expected financial return in the form of higher income. Utilising data from a sample of 5, 019 financial planning professionals from a single Hong Kong insurance firm, we examine the relationship between earnings and certification, human capital factors (education and experience), and demographic factors (age and sex). The empirical results indicate that certification, level of education, experience, gender and age do impact on the earnings of <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> <b>in</b> Hong Kong. The results also reveal that a cluster of certifications do impact on earnings of financial practitioners with four certifications (CFP, LUTCF, FCHCP, and RFC) all of which are highly associated with higher incomes, while only one, the RFP, was not. The RFP was also the least popular certification among <b>financial</b> <b>planners.</b> These findings, taken together, have two implications. First, certification is a path to increased income. Second, certifications do have different market values, thus offering an insight into why individuals choose one form of certification over another. Finally, company policy makers as well as regulators should take cognizance of the rewards associated with certification in order to determine whether it is worthwhile to mandate professional certification of <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> <b>in</b> the <b>financial</b> services industry in Hong Kong...|$|R

40|$|As <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> operate <b>in</b> a {{competitive}} business environment, {{it is important}} to identify how <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> can apply relevant industry aspects to positively influence their customer satisfaction and customer retention levels. Although models of customer satisfaction and subsequently customer retention have been well researched for consumer products and services, there has been limited research in regards to financial planning. Previous research in the financial planning industry focussed on specific elements of financial planner-client relationships, for example trust, integrity and ethics. This research study reviews existing literature on customer satisfaction and customer retention, as relevant to the financial planning industry. Thus the primary objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the extent to which the four predetermined independent variables; namely, two-way communication, ethical responsibility, clients’ financial knowledge and commission fees can possibly influence the intervening variable customer satisfaction and ultimately the dependent variable customer retention in the financial planning industry. An empirical investigation was undertaken to establish whether the independent variables; namely, two-way communication, ethical responsibility, clients’ financial knowledge and commission fees can possibly influence customer satisfaction and ultimately customer retention in the financial planning industry. A positivistic research paradigm was followed for this study. Quantitative data was gathered by distributing questionnaires to a sample of financial planning clients. The sample size consisted of 250 financial planning clients in the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan area. A response rate of 76. 40 percent was achieved. The usable questionnaires were statistically analysed using the computer programmes Microsoft Excel and Statistica Version 10. The validity of the study was confirmed by utilising EFA. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were calculated to confirm the reliability and the internal consistency of the measurement instrument of this study. Data was analysed in four phases. Descriptive statistics were calculated for this study. The validity of the measuring instrument was tested by performing EFA to consider construct validity. Thereafter the internal reliability of the data was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficients. Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficients and multiple regression calculations were calculated and discussed. Through multiple regression calculations, the factors that emerged were used to analyse the relationships predicted by the five hypotheses. Finally t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were conducted and discussed. The empirical investigation revealed that significant relationships exist between the independent variables two-way communication, ethical responsibility, commission fees and the intervening variable customer satisfaction as well as the dependent variable customer retention. The empirical investigation revealed that if a <b>financial</b> <b>planner</b> communicates <b>financial</b> information accurately and understandably to clients while acting in an ethical manner, clients are likely to be satisfied with the products/services of the <b>financial</b> <b>planner</b> and be retained by the <b>financial</b> <b>planner.</b> This study established and confirmed the significant positive relationship that exists between customer satisfaction and customer retention in the financial planning industry. Recommendations have been provided based on the main empirical findings. All <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> <b>in</b> South Africa, including all the regulatory bodies, will benefit from the empirical findings as well as the recommendations of this study on how to improve customer satisfaction and customer retention which will ultimately increase service delivery of <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> <b>in</b> the <b>financial</b> planning industr...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Job {{satisfaction}} {{has been}} the subject of a considerable body of research. In this study, the authors examine job satisfaction among <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> <b>in</b> Australia, a relatively new profession which {{has been the}} subject of very little research. Method/Approach - A national survey of <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> was conducted, using a sample of convenience drawn from websites of two large organisations in the financial and insurance industry employing, or having agency agreements with, <b>financial</b> <b>planners.</b> A job satisfaction questionnaire designed for Australian conditions was used. Findings - Based on a literature review, hypotheses were examined regarding the relationship between job satisfaction and age, job tenure, gender and type of employing organisation, and between job satisfaction and motivation. Results of this survey indicated little correlation between job satisfaction and age, gender, tenure or type of employing organisation. On the other hand, a positive relationship between job satisfaction and motivation was evident. Practical implications – Respondents comments helped elucidate reasons for <b>financial</b> <b>planner’s</b> job satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Observations provided indicators that may help management nurture a positive job response among employees. Value of this paper – Practically, this paper contributes to an underdeveloped area of research. It highlights scope for future research in two particular fields. Firstly, in-depth case studies to explore more thoroughly issues of job satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Secondly, with access to a larger number of employed <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> a comparative study between those and self-employed <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> on the subject of job satisfaction may enlighten managers and the profession generally. <br /...|$|R
