5|$|The lone {{surviving}} Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, {{has been}} a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include Judith Green's search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites. Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, {{as well as on}} the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign. The historian C. Warren Hollister used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.|$|E

25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds {{are the most}} intelligent. While parrots have the {{distinction}} of being able to mimic human speech, studies with the African grey parrot have shown that some are able to associate words with their meanings and form simple sentences (see Alex). Parrots and the corvid family of crows, ravens, and jays are considered the most intelligent of birds. Not surprisingly, research has shown that these species tend to have the largest HVCs. Dr. Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at UCSD who <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> physiology of birds, has discovered that the lower parts of avian brains {{are similar to those of}} humans.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{randomized}} {{study in}} medical literature that <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> response with amputation {{of patients who}} have failed the above-mentioned therapies and who continue to be miserable. Nonetheless, {{there are reports that}} on average cite about half of the patients will have resolution of their pain, while half will develop phantom limb pain and/or pain at the amputation site. It is likely that as in any other chronic pain syndrome, the brain becomes chronically stimulated with pain, and late amputation may not work as well as it might be expected. In a survey of fifteen patients with CRPS Type 1, eleven responded that their life was better after amputation. Since this is the ultimate treatment of a painful extremity, it should be left as a last resort.|$|E

25|$|The {{main road}} in Embrun is Notre-Dame Street (County Road 3). This busy street travels east–west across Embrun, linking its neighbourhoods together. At its western end it connects to Castor Street in {{neighbouring}} Russell, while its eastern end {{travels to the}} nearby village of Casselman, located 12km to the east. As Embrun grows, the street has experienced significant congestion. Part of this is aggravated by the fact that, {{with the exception of}} a 1km section in western Embrun which has a centre turning lane, the street is still a conventional two lane street. The municipality <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> possibility of widening the entire stretch of the street to two lanes in each direction with a centre turning lane, however the cost of this is seen as prohibitive, so instead, the municipality has focused on projects to make traffic flow more efficient. This included the upgrading of intersections, including the installation of new left-turn signals at two intersections (completed in 2011) and the replacement of another intersection with a roundabout (completed in 2012).|$|E

This view is shared by Mike Kropveld—the executive director of an anti-cult organization with the name Info-Cult—who says the controversy leads to criticism by both religious and non-religious people.|$|E

500|$|Leading {{up to the}} couple's marriage, Dain cynically makes many {{assurances that}} he will provide for Jessica financially. At one point, Jessica brings a {{defamation}} lawsuit against Dain before they agree to convert it into a prenuptial agreement, leading English professor Jayashree Kamblé to liken their relationship to [...] "a take-over bid". Kamblé <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> presence of capitalism and modern economics on storylines in the contemporary romance genre. To her, while Lord of Scoundrels is a Regency romance novel and thus less apt to depict the types of economic pairings seen in many contemporary romances, Kamblé argues that Dain's repeated monetary promises still contain [...] "echoes {{of the kind of}} wealth, monetary security, and financial reward that the heroes of Harlequin Mills and Boon promise as husbands". The couple is physically attracted to each other, while financial considerations also play a factor.|$|E
500|$|A newly {{emergent}} threat {{facing the}} golden-crowned sifaka is hunting by the gold miners {{moving into the}} region's forests. [...] Although mining operations are small scale, the practice of gold mining takes a toll on the forested regions because deep mining pits are often dug near or underneath large trees, disturbing the extensive root systems and ultimately killing {{the trees in the}} area. The influx of gold miners has also increased poaching pressure. Although the species is protected from hunting by local fady (taboo) around Daraina, due to their likeness to humans, and by Malagasy law, the gold miners who have immigrated to the area have begun to hunt the golden-crowned sifaka as a source of bushmeat. In 1993, David M. Meyers, a researcher who <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> golden-crowned sifaka, speculated that if bushmeat hunting were to escalate, the species would go extinct in less than ten years since it is easy to find and not fearful of humans. [...] Indeed, bushmeat hunting by people from nearby Ambilobe has already extirpated at least one isolated population.|$|E

500|$|Oberhausen, who <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> {{source of}} the mosaics and windows, states that at least four stained glass windows were {{inspired}} by the paintings of Pre-Raphaelite artists that were enjoying a resurgence in popularity at the time. [...] These windows are: [...] "Christ in the Temple" [...] in the east transept, based upon a painting by William Holman Hunt; [...] "The Annunciation" [...] in the east nave, inspired by a work by Frederic Shields; [...] "The Nativity" [...] in the chancel, based upon a painting by Edward Fellowes-Prynne; and [...] "The Good Shepherd" [...] in the west transept, inspired by a painting by Sibyl C. Parker, the only female artist represented in the artwork of the church. [...] None of the windows of Stanford Memorial Church required replacement after the 1906 quake, except for [...] "the famous rose window of the original structure" [...] in the organ loft which {{was replaced by the}} current large, central arch window. [...] This window, entitled [...] "Lilies of the Field", is the only window in the church that cannot be viewed from the inside because it is blocked off by the central organ. [...] There is a cross in the center of this window made of [...] "faceted pieces of glass that are inset like gems", which sparkle when light strikes it.|$|E
