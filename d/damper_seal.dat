Rotating shaft seals, such as labyrinth seals, are used in high speed turbomachinery including aircraft gas turbine engines and industrial centrifugal compressors. Analysis, design, and testing of a non-rotating cantilever beam style shaft seal test rig is described. The test rig is used to evaluate the direct damping characteristics of conventional two bladed, teeth on stator labyrinth seals with converging and diverging clearances. Pertinence of data from non rotating tests used for rotating applications is discussed. The direct damping coefficients of the shaft seals are determined experimentally by processing measured displacement vibration impact response data with an equivalent single degree of freedom model of the cantilever beam test rig.

40|$|LecturePg. 55 - 64 The rotordynamic and leaking {{characteristics}} of {{two types of}} gas damper seals, honeycomb seal and pocket <b>damper</b> <b>seal,</b> were experimentally evaluated on a rotating test rig. The effect of supply pressure, preswirl, and seal eccentricity on seal dynamic performance was investigated in the tests. The pressurized working gas flowed through the seal and exhausted to atmospheric conditions. The maximum seal supply pressure was limited to 500 psia. By simulating the rotor experimental unbalance response and amplification factors based on a well-established rotor model, the equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients were estimated for tested gas damper seals. Experimental results confirm that both honeycomb and pocket damper seals provide high positive effective damping. On the other hand, the pocket <b>damper</b> <b>seal</b> increases the first critical speed. A correlation study was performed between the identified rotordynamic coefficients and predictions obtained from existing theoretical models for both honeycomb and pocket damper seals.

Experiments to identify stiffness and damping force coefficients of a two bladed teeth-on-stator labyrinth seal and a gas <b>damper</b> <b>seal,</b> both of diverging clearance, are presented. Calibrated impact guns excite a housing holding the test seal, and the seal displacement and acceleration time responses in two orthogonal directions are measured. A frequency domain parameter identification procedure allows the determination of the seals' dynamic force coefficients over a frequency range. Tests are made for a centered seal condition without journal rotation and with rotation at 1, 500 and 3, 000 rpm. The pressure drop across the seal is controlled by increments in the inlet supply pressure to values three times the exit (ambient) pressure. The two bladed labyrinth seal becomes less stable with increasing pressure ratio across the seal. This seal exhibits positive direct stiffness and negative direct damping. Cross-coupling is observed but identification of cross-coupled stiffnesses is poor. Comparison with analytical predictions is good for mass flow and direct damping coefficients. Predicted values for direct stiffness are negative, contrary to identified values. The same labyrinth'seal is transformed into a four pocket <b>damper</b> <b>seal</b> and tested under identical conditions. The <b>damper</b> <b>seal</b> is shown to be more stable dynamically but can create a static instability due to excessive negative direct stiffness. In the test facility used, the seal housing does not have enough direct stiffness to support the <b>damper</b> <b>seal</b> at pressure ratios greater than 2. 0.

The objective of the tests {{was to determine the}} rotordynamic force coefficients and leakage for the different PDS while varying parameters such as: (1) clearance ratio, (2) rotor surface speed, (3) PDS pressure differential, and (4) excitation frequency. Two different methods were used to determine frequency dependent force coefficients: (1) the impedance method, which involved using a baseline subtraction and (2) the dynamic pressure response method, which comprised of measuring seal cavity dynamic pressure and phase relationship to vibration. Both methods were used to determine coefficients, but the dynamic pressure response method revealed insights to the dynamics of the PDS that were {{the first of its kind}} and allowed the comparison to the <b>damper</b> <b>seal</b> theory at the most fundamental of levels.

The brush hybrid pocket <b>damper</b> <b>seal</b> (BHS) has been proposed to replace a labyrinth seal or pocket <b>damper</b> <b>seal</b> (PDS) in a turbomachine when damping is desired without increased leakage. The BHS and brush-only seal are evaluated experimentally in both rotating and non-rotating tests. The primary objective is to determine if the BHS leaks less than a PDS while retaining or improving the PDS damping characteristics. Additionally, since the brush seals contact the shah, the effect of wear is investigated by testing journals of two different diameters. The rotating tests showed that the BHS and brush-only seal are potentially destabilizing through dry fiction whip. Methods of alleviating this instability are shown experimentally and analytically. Other tested characteristics include leakage, starting torque and dynamic coefficients. The worn BHS leaks half as much as a PDS at all test pressures. The starting torque of a brush seal increases strongly with pressure, however, the power dissipated at 6, 000 R. P. M. never exceeds 1. 5 horsepower.

This seal design is a combination of the pocket <b>damper</b> <b>seal</b> and a metal mesh element. The metal mesh element not only reduces the leakage but it also provides damping. Early in its development, the tested metal mesh hybrid pocket <b>damper</b> <b>seal</b> induced a gripping force on the shaft that increased with upstream pressure. The resulting friction torque was beyond acceptable limits. The target after that was to develop an experimentally verified design of a metal mesh hybrid seal that has low leakage and positive damping, and to determine rotordynamic effects and leakage. The hybrid seal design was revised to eliminate the gripping effect. The inner diameter of the retaining ring was increased and holes were provided at the periphery of the ring. With this revised design, tests were carried out on the non-rotating rig. Results showed a considerable decrease in stiffness of the seal. This indicated that the stiffness of the seal is dependent on the press fit interference of the metal mesh doughnut. Tests were carried out on the rotating rig using a grooved journal, which allowed a low press fit interference. Metal mesh was placed at the exit blade in these experiments. The results showed negative damping and positive stiffness. Results also showed appearance of instability at 58 Psig, which increased with increase of pressure. Next, the metal mesh was moved to the inlet blade. This modification required design and fabrication of a complete new seal. The experiments were repeated on the rotating rig. This time positive damping and positive stiffness was achieved with no sign of instability. The pocket depth of the hybrid seal was decreased to achieve more damping as predicted by the pocket <b>damper</b> <b>seal</b> code. However experimental results did not show any improvement in damping from this modification. Finally, the Bode plots from rotating tests were curve fitted using XLTRC to obtain damping, stiffness and force coefficients...|$|E
40|$|The {{limits of}} rotordynamic {{stability}} {{continue to be}} pushed by the high power densities and rotational speeds of modern rocket engine turbomachinery. Destabilizing forces increase dramatically with rotor speed. Rotordynamic stability is lost when these destabilizing forces overwhelm the stabilizing forces. The vibration from the unstable rotor grows until it is limited by some nonlinearity. For example, a rolling element bearing with a stiffness characteristic that increases with deflection may limit the vibration amplitude. The loads and deflections resulting from this limit cycle vibration (LCV) can lead to bearing and seal damage which promotes ever increasing levels of subsynchronous vibration. Engineers combat LCV by introducing rotordynamic elements that generate increased stabilizing forces and reduced destabilizing forces. For example, replacing a labyrinth <b>seal</b> with a <b>damping</b> <b>seal</b> results in substantial increases in the damping and stiffness rotordynamic coefficients. Adding a swirl brake to the <b>damping</b> <b>seal</b> greatly reduces the destabilizing cross-coupled forces generated by the <b>damping</b> <b>seal</b> for even further increases in the stabilizing capacity. Marshall?s Annular Seal Test (MAST) rig is designed to experimentally measure the stabilizing capacity of new annular seal designs. The rig has been {{moved to a new}} facility and outfitted with a new slave bearing to allow increased test durations and to enable the testing of fluid film bearings.

The objective of these experiments is to measure damping coefficients, stiffness coefficients and leakage rates at higher frequencies than tested previously. The seal coefficients are determined by measuring the logarithmic decrement and damped natural frequency in non-rotating free vibration tests and by computer simulations of these results using a computer program called XLTRC. Rotating tests, which consist of coastdown tests from 14000 rpm to 0 rpm were also conducted to corroborate the effectiveness of the PDS in suppressing the vibration amplitudes at the critical speeds. The initial rotating tests on the originally designed PDS were discouraging, and highlight the importance of the optimum design of the inlet plenum chamber of the PDS in producing damping. Suitable modifications are carried out in the PDS inlet plenum design and the non-rotating tests were repeated on the modified PDS. These tests show positive damping and negative stiffness in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The tests also show that the magnitude of both the damping and the stiffness coefficients increase with the inlet pressure. The rotating tests corroborate the effectiveness of the PDS in suppressing the vibration at critical speeds around 13, 000 cpm, which is about twice the frequencies tested previously.

Coastdown tests are conducted on a four bladed eight pocket PDS with a partial arc notch of large radius across the exit blades.

40|$|LecturePg. 35 - 44 To {{cover the}} {{remaining}} operation {{life of an}} offshore platform, {{it was necessary to}} go from a single stage compressor to a two-stage compressor. The design of the new two-stage compressor required two different impeller arrangements to cover the range of suction/discharge pressures anticipated. One rotor has nine wheels and another one has 11 by adding one impeller at the outboard ends of both compression sections. With a rotor flexibility ratio around of 2. 5, the new replacement compressor is a borderline machine on the API 617 (2002) stability screening map. The stability study indicated that the compressor failed to meet the Level-I stability criteria at the design conditions. A detailed stability investigation became necessary though the machine was predicted to be stable based on an original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) empirical method. An independent party was contracted to conduct a full stability audit on both rotors. Compressor cross-coupling was evaluated uniquely and lumped at each impeller location in the analysis model. Additionally, the destabilizing force from all labyrinth seals in the compressor were calculated and included in the detailed stability analysis. The study results indicated that both rotors would most likely be susceptible to severe instability problems even using a modified center labyrinth seal with a shunt-injection and swirl brakes. Consequently, the effect of damper seals on the rotor stability was further investigated independently. It was concluded that a honeycomb seal could bring the log-decrement to a distinctively positive value for the nine-wheel rotor, but not succeed in raising the log-decrement to positive for the 11 -wheel rotor. Because of faster than anticipated declines in well deliverability, it was decided to bypass the nine-wheel configuration and install the 11 -wheel configuration. The 11 -wheel rotor used a modified center labyrinth seal with a shunt/brake deswirl system. As a backup, the nine-wheel rotor and the inner casing were modified to fit with a pocket <b>damper</b> <b>seal.</b> The 11 -stage compressor was successfully commissioned and has run well in the field for more than one year. Overall shaft vibration level was low and the predicted subsynchronous vibration was not observed. In this paper, a correlation study was carried out and a comparison was made to discuss how to calculate the Wachel number, and how to practically evaluate the contribution of the labyrinth seals and the gas deswirl devices in a detailed (API Level-II) rotor stability analysis...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is presented to}} calculate <b>damping</b> in ring <b>seals</b> for a compressible fluid. Results show that damping in tapered ring seals (optimized for stiffness) is less than that in straight bore ring seals for the same minimum clearance. <b>Damping</b> in ring <b>seals</b> can promote fractional frequency whirl and can, thus, be detrimental. Thus, tapered seals can benefit rotor and seal stability by having lower damping as well as higher stiffness. Use of incompressible results leads to large errors...|$|R
40|$|Test {{results are}} {{presented}} for short floating ring seals (D = 53. 0 mm, L/D = 0. 15) using a smooth surface and a round-hole pattern defined as a <b>damper</b> floating ring <b>seal</b> (h/Cr = 3,γ = 0. 34 : the ratio of hole area to surface area) for supplied pressures of 3. 0, 5. 0, and 7. 0 MPa, respectively, with the shaft operating speed up to 24, 800 rpm. The measured data includes leakage, attitude angle, eccentricity ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness, damping, and inertia. When the floating ring seals are locked up, the eccentricity ratio of the smooth surface floating ring seal is {{lower than that of}} the <b>damper</b> floating ring <b>seal.</b> The attitude angle increases linearly with the operating speeds. The damping coefficients of the <b>damper</b> floating ring <b>seal</b> are higher than those of the floating ring seal. Whirl frequency ratios of the floating ring seal are lower than the <b>damper</b> floating ring <b>seal</b> with high eccentricity ratio at low operating speed range. The design parameters determined from these test results will be used for high-pressure and high-speed turbopump seals in a liquid rocket engine system...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 31 - 42 This paper {{presents}} the rotordynamic stability testing of a nine-stage centrifugal compressor used for hydrogen recycle service. The machine tested {{was of a}} basic design and employed no <b>damper</b> bearings, <b>damper</b> <b>seals,</b> shunts or swirl brakes to generate very high logarithmic (log) decrements as in previous papers. The test was performed using an electromagnetic shaker {{as part of the}} shop order. Results include the forward and backward mode?s stability and frequencies. Two log decrement estimation techniques were employed: One based in the time domain that does not require measurement of the shaker force and the classic ones based in the frequency domain. Examination of the results benchmarks the original equipment manufacturer?s (OEM?s) stability analysis methods versus the measurements. It also provides benchmarking of purchaser?s acceptance criteria, which can be tailored to each specific OEM...|$|R
