50|$|A major {{product of}} the factory was {{decorative}} quarry glass which was mass-produced by moulding and printing, rather than <b>hand-cutting</b> and painting. This product {{could be used in}} church windows as a cheap substitute for stained glass. It was often installed in new churches, to be later replaced by pictorial windows. Most of this quarry glass was clear, printed in black and detailed in bright yellow silver stain. Occasionally the quarries were produced in red, blue or pink glass, but these are rare. Surprisingly few entire windows of Powell quarries are to be seen in English churches, although they survive in little-seen locations such as vestries, ringing chambers and behind pipe organs. St Philip's Church, Sydney, retains a full set of Powell quarry windows. Powell also produced many windows in which pictorial mandorlas or roundels are set against a background of quarries.|$|E
50|$|The clicker's knife {{regularly}} needed sharpening, {{which was}} done with an implement called a rap stick.To use a rap stick, a right-handed operator would hold it in the left hand, resting the stick on the workbench for support, stroking the blade rapidly but gently {{back and forth on}} the abrasive surface to maintain a sharp edge whilst <b>hand-cutting,</b> in a similar fashion to a butcher's knife and sharpening steel. The knife blade shown is a lighter medical item but approximates the shape of a clicker's knife blade, fitting into a comfortable wooden handle with screw-activated jaws. The main surface is emery cloth wrapped over the edge to form a round section where the curved blade can nestle and be sharpened; the top edge is sharper and square in cross-section, with a fine-grain aluminium oxide abrasive strip used for tip-sharpening. On the reverse side is a heavy-leather smooth strop, to address any metal burrs left by the abrasive process.|$|E

30|$|Lastly, {{there is}} concern that {{prescribed}} fires are rarely given adequate consideration by land managers {{even though there is}} ample support among fire scientists and managers for prescribed burning as a proven hazard reduction and restoration tool in many forest types and conditions (Biswell 1989). Indeed, fire scientists have recommended a “a band of prescribed burns” (i.e. a fuelbreak) facilitated by felling of small trees in Protected Activity Centers (PACs) for the California Spotted Owl, where commercial logging was restricted (Weatherspoon et al 1992). These kind of methods using non-commercial <b>hand-cutting</b> and prescribed burning rather than commercial logging could theoretically meet fire managers’ needs while also addressing the concerns of citizens who are opposed to using timber sales as a means for fuelbreak construction or fuels reduction.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a combination of}} Confocal Raman Imaging (CRI) and quantitative image analysis to characterise biocomposite material microstructures. Both techniques offer lateral resolutions close to 1. 3 ism and axial resolution of 13 gm, while simplifying sample preparation to <b>hand-cutting</b> without any surface preparation. Extruded and injected polycaprolactoneihemp fibre composites were used as demonstration biocomposites. A green macrobisphenol additive (bis-O-dihydroferuloy 1 - 1, 4 -butanediol) was also used as a chemical probe to characterise the dispersion efficiency of additives, with a detection threshold of 2. 3 wt% above which very local heterogeneity can be determined by this technique. CRI provided microstructure information for the entire binary structure formed by the fibre network. The fibre dispersion and orientation depend on their location in the matrix, and the specific surface of the fibres increases with the fibre content as aggregates start to develop. The technique also highlighted a possible core-skin effect in the injected composite...|$|E
40|$|Over time, fire {{exclusion}} {{has caused}} the accumulation of fuels and changes in vegetation structure and composition in many western ecosystems. This is commonly assumed to have also occurred in the oak woodlands, shrub lands and grasslands of southwestern Oregon. As a result, land managers of the Medford District of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have sought to reduce fuel-loads {{using a variety of}} thinning methods including mechanical mastication and <b>hand-cutting,</b> piling and burning. As of the mid- 1990 s, these treatments have been used on thousands of acres annually of the Ashland Resource Area (ARA) of the BLM. Since non-coniferous ecosystems of southwest Oregon were seldom studied, researchers hoped to achieve a greater understanding of the ecosystems by studying the plant communities and their relation with the environment such as slope, elevation and soils. Researchers also needed to gather information about the region’s historical condition as well as observe how plant communities in the chaparral components of the area responded to thinning treatments. Above all, researchers sought to determine the effectiveness and consequences of these treatments—not only for the native and non-native plant species, but for ecosystem preservation and restoration...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 91 - 95) Lumbering {{has been}} carried out in the coniferous forests of Southern California since the late 1700 's, primarily in the Yellow Pine Forest (5, 000 to 8, 000 feet) of the San Bernardino Mountains. There have been definite periods of lumbering. The size of the operations has generally increased, and the lumbering methods used have been greatly improved. From the Spanish-Mexican Period through the Brookings Period (1770 's - middle 1910 's), lumbering operations developed from small <b>hand-cutting</b> operations to large steam-powered mills. In the Small Mill Period (middle 19101 s - early 1950 's), the size of the operations declined sharply. The mills of this period were steam-powered at first, and later electrically powered. During the Recent Period, a large operation, using modern lumbering methods and facilities, has dominated the lumbering industry of the region. The Southern California lumbering industry has been especially important during the Spanish-Mexican, Mormon, and Recent Periods. In the Spanish-Mexican and Mormon Periods, it produced most of the lumber that was used in the region. During the Recent Period, the lumbering industry has bean revitalized because of the need to save the forests from possible bark beetle devastation...|$|E
40|$|Rhododendrons (Rhododendron ponticum L. and Rhododendron luteum Sweet) {{dominate}} the understories of the mesic {{forests of the}} Black Sea Region (BSR) of Turkey. They dramatically reduce forest growth and regeneration and local plant diversity. This paper reports {{the results of a}} large rhododendron control experiment established on two different sites in the western and eastern BSR of Turkey 5 years after treatments (YAT). The paper also presents the second-year results of a second experiment in which the foliar herbicides of the previous experiment were tested on rhododendron at much lower rates on a western BSR site. Five YAT, grubbing and foliar spraying were still the best rhododendron control methods in the fi rst experiment. Cut-stump spraying provided an intermediate level of woody control. <b>Hand-cutting</b> was ineffective on R. ponticum and did not signifi cantly differ from the control treatment in rhododendron basal area 5 YAT. The performance ratings of foliar triclopyr ester and imazapyr for woody control in both experiments were rate dependent. At high rates ranging between 2. 6 and 5. 8 kg ae ha − 1, foliar imazapyr controlled both rhododendron species signifi cantly better than foliar triclopyr ester in the fi rst experiment, suggesting enhanced imazapyr translocation to the roots. Some off-target damage was observed in the beech overstory for imazapyr at high rates. The performance ratings of these folia...|$|E
30|$|A freshly felled Raj koroi log (Albizia richardiana King & Prain) having 30  cm {{diameter}} and 14  m height was collected from Khulna, Bangladesh. The log was debarked and converted into wood chips using a traditional sharp <b>hand-cutting</b> tool. Afterwards, a laboratory scale grinder {{was used to}} convert the wood chips into particles. The particles were screened to remove smaller (<[*] 0.5  mm) with mesh no. 35 and oversized (>[*] 2  mm) particles with mesh no. 10. Subsequently, the particles were classified into small particle (A) and large particle (B) screening through mesh no. 18. The size of small and large particles was 0.5 – 1.0 (mesh no. 35 and 18) and 1.01 – 2.0  mm (mesh no. 18 and 10), respectively, according to ASTM E 11 - 17 standard [14]. Consequently, wood particles were dried in a laboratory oven for 24  h at 103 [*]±[*] 2  °C for reducing the moisture content to 2 %. Besides, the post-consumer drinking water bottles (plastic grade 1) were collected locally and cleaned. A rotary grinder was used to produce PET powder.

40|$|This paper explores some of {{the laser}} cutting methods used by artists, in {{particular}} from an Arts and Humanities Research Council funded project (Paper Models: investigating laser-cutting technology to develop new artists' books and paper-based creative practice for arts, crafts and design, March 2010 -October 2010). The project explored and demonstrated {{the potential of the}} laser cutter as a creative tool in terms of design, structure and construction for the produciton of artists' books and paper-based works. As the technology has become more affordable, laser cutters are now a regular feature within education establishments in the Western world and becomming readily available to artists wishing to explore the subject futher. One major potential of the laser cutter as a tool for artists working with the book form and paper-based artworks is that it can replace the need for labour-intensive manipulation of paper and card by hand. Artists have throughout history adapted industrial and/or digital technologies to work with creatively, as evidenced by the relatively recent use of digital printing to create artists' books and prints, but cn they see the longer term potential of laser cutting as part of their armoury? The possibility of using the laser as a tool for cutting, scoring, perforating and engraving paper is as yet under-utilised by many book and paper artists. Many of these aritsts use <b>hand-cutting</b> and scoring in their work, unawarre that laser cutters can assist. Not that the laser need replace the handcrafted element; rather, it can run alongside it. The laser burns or melts its way through materials, so it leaves evidence of its involvement, often through a scorch mark, and this is not always to everyone's taste. The project's aim was to show artists and designers how the laser {{can be used as a}} creative tool...|$|E
40|$|Reducing brush {{has been}} a major goal of {{rangeland}} restoration because of increases in densities of native woody plants in recent decades. However, land managers attempting restoration are faced with diverse socio-economic and biophysical variables that interact to drive community shifts following interventions in encroached rangelands. I implemented a complementary set of studies to explore the drivers of vegetation response to disturbance. I designed an experiment to determine the relative resilience, or capacity to absorb disturbance without switching to an alternate state, of the woody dominated state in a brush encroached rangeland across soils with different textures: fine clays to coarse sands. I exposed plots on each soil type to one of three brush removal treatments: untreated control, <b>hand-cutting</b> with herbicide application, and roller-chopping. In addition, I mapped grass basal areas to determine differences in mortality, recruitment, and species turnover resulting from brush removal treatments. Despite widespread application in the study region, the two brush reduction methods assessed in this study were not ubiquitously effective at overcoming the resilience of the woody plant dominated state. On sandy soils woody plants quickly regained pretreatment levels of dominance. However, on clay soils, grass remained dominant {{for the duration of the}} study, suggesting that, both cut-herbicide and mechanical treatments overcame shrubland resilience. This finding provides a baseline for prioritizing restoration strategies, allowing managers to target underlying conditions that are more conducive to restoration with lower levels of intervention. In addition, I found perennial grass mortality to be higher in mechanically treated plots on all soil types than in chemically treated plots, suggesting cut-herbicide might be favorable to mechanical brush control for avoiding undesirable herbaceous community compositional shifts. Finally, recognizing the potential for social barriers to prevent adoption of ecologically effective interventions, I analyzed the effect of prescribed burning regulations and liability standards on prescribed fire use on private lands. Limited liability standards coupled with strict regulatory requirements increased the use of prescribed fire. This information can be used to formulate prescribed burning legislation that will promote the safe and effective use of prescribed fire for restoration and conservation of fire-dependent ecosystems...|$|E
