40|$|This paper {{presents}} a federated <b>directory</b> <b>system,</b> which allows registration and discovery of semantic web services. The typical {{use of this}} <b>directory</b> <b>system</b> is in a context where pervasive ubiquitous business applica-tion services should be flexibly coordinated and pervasively provided to the mobile user by intelligent agents in dynamically changing environments. The system has been modeled, designed and implemented as a backbone <b>directory</b> <b>system</b> to be searched by an infrastructure made up by such kind of agents coordinating semantic web services. The system is modeled as a federation: directory services form its atomic units, and the federation emerges from the registration of directory services in other directory services. Directories are virtual clusters of service entries stored {{in one or more}} directory services. To create the topology, policies are defined on all possi-ble operations to be called on directories. For instance, they allow for routed registration and selective access to directories. WSDir has been applied as a backbone in the trials of an ehealth emergency application...|$|R
40|$|The OSI <b>directory</b> <b>system</b> is a {{distributed}} {{directory information}} database which incorporates distributed algorithms for name resolution and search to support {{applications such as}} electronic mail, White Pages, authentication services, etc. To improve the performance of requests for name resolution and search, {{it is necessary to}} lower the cost of name lookups for nonlocal names. The OSI <b>directory</b> <b>system</b> and other distributed naming systems use name caching to minimize such costs. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of name caching on the performance of the OSI <b>directory</b> <b>system.</b> We consider the issues of cache sizing and cache replacement policies. We find that a locality of reference property holds in name resolution requests, and hence name caching does increase performance significantly. Using trace-driven simulation, we show that small caches (smaller than 30 items) yield hit ratios up to 60 % and decrease the average name resolution time by 60 %. For small caches, the LRU (Least Recen [...] ...|$|R
