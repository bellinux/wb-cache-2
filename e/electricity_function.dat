40|$|Purpose – This study {{attempts}} to re-investigate the <b>electricity</b> consumption <b>function</b> for Malaysia through the cointegration and causality analyses {{over the period}} 1970 to 2005. Design/methodology/approach – The study employed the bounds-testing procedure for cointegration to examine the potential long-run relationship, while an autoregressive distributed lag model is used to derive the short- and long-run coefficients. The Granger causality test is applied to determine the causality direction between electricity consumption and its determinants. Findings – New evidence is found in this study: first, electricity consumption, income, foreign direct investment, and population in Malaysia are cointegrated. Second, the influx of foreign direct investment and population growth are positively related to electricity consumption in Malaysia and the Granger causality evidence indicates that electricity consumption, income, and foreign direct investment are of bilateral causality. Originality/value – The estimated multivariate <b>electricity</b> consumption <b>function</b> for Malaysia implies that Malaysia is an energy-dependent country; thus energy-saving policies may have an inverse effect on current and also future economic development in Malaysia.

40|$|Classical {{univariate}} {{and multivariate}} time series models have problems {{to deal with the}} high variability of hourly electricity spot prices. We propose to model alternatively the daily mean <b>electricity</b> supply <b>functions</b> using a dynamic factor model. And to derive, subsequently, the hourly electricity spot prices by the evaluation of the estimated supply functions at the corresponding hourly values of demand for <b>electricity.</b> Supply <b>functions</b> are price (EUR/MWh) functions, that increase monotonically with demand for electricity (MW). Apart from this new conceptual approach, that allows us to represent the auction design of energy exchanges in a most natural way, our main contribution is an extraordinary simple algorithm to estimate the factor structure of the dynamic factor model. We decompose the time series into a functional spherical component and an univariate scaling component. The elements of the spherical component are all standardized having unit size such that we can robustly estimate the factor structure. This algorithm is much simpler than procedures suggested in the literature. In order to use a parsimonious labeling we will refer to the daily mean supply curves simply as price curves. ...|$|R

Japan’s Cabinet Office (2001, 2003, 2007) estimated overall <b>electricity</b> demand <b>functions</b> (residential {{as well as}} industrial and commercial) for nine regions (excluding Okinawa) and obtained price elasticity values of − 0.44, − 0.47, and − 0.37, respectively, for the fiscal years 1981 – 1998, 1986 – 2002, and 1986 – 2005. Estimating <b>electricity</b> demand <b>functions</b> for non-residential <b>electricity</b> demand by region, Hosoe and Akiyama (2009) reported low price elasticities between − 0.1 and − 0.3 {{in the short run}} and between − 0.13 and − 0.56 in the long run. However, they found price elasticity to be greater in rural areas than in urban areas. Clearly, the price elasticity of electricity demand in the industrial and commercial sectors is inelastic in the short run but relatively elastic in the long run.|$|R

However, most previous studies using a partial adjustment approach have failed to recognize the possibility of an endogenous lagged dependent variable in the regressors (Hosoe and Akiyama 2009). By contrast, this study accounts for this endogeneity to avoid any bias.|$|R

While the wholesale electricity price becomes almost constant because of its flat supply function, marginal retail service cost diminished significantly after the system reform. The default retail electricity price could become higher for the remaining retail service cost. This is why the peak-time price becomes lower than the default price.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Integrating {{residential}} photovoltaic (PV) {{power generation}} and energy storage systems into the Smart Grid {{is an effective}} way of utilizing renewable power and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. This has become a particularly interesting problem {{with the introduction of}} dynamic electricity energy pricing models since electricity consumers can use their PV-based energy generation and controllable energy storage devices for peak shaving on their power demand profile from the grid, and thereby, minimize their electricity bill cost. A realistic <b>electricity</b> price <b>function</b> is considered in this paper with billing period of a month, comprised of both the energy price component and the demand price component. Due to the characteristics of the realistic <b>electricity</b> price <b>function</b> and the energy storage capacity limitation, the residential storage control algorithm should properly account for various energy loss components during system operation, including the energy loss components due to rate capacity effect in the storage system as well as power dissipation in the power conversion circuitries. A near-optimal storage control algorithm is proposed accounting for these aspects, based on the PV power generation and load power consumption prediction results in the previous papers. The near-optimal control algorithm, which controls charging/discharging schemes of the storage system, is effectively implemented by solving a convex optimization problem {{at the beginning of each}} day with polynomial time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed near-optimal residential storage control algorithm achieves up to 36. 0 % enhancement in electricity cost reduction than the baseline control algorithm.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how electrification has been received in rural villages in Lao People's Democratic Republic and how electricity has been integrated into living conditions and daily activities. The {{aim of the}} thesis is to highlight the active role of rural inhabitants in the electrification process.

The empirical data for the thesis consists of semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and observations made in five rural villages in the Vientiane province. In analysis of the data, the domestication framework is utilised. The study in hand shows that since its introduction electricity has transformed from a new technology into {{an integral part of}} everyday life in the villages. In the process, homes and the village environment, {{as well as some of}} the villagers' routines, have been changed permanently. Electricity has not, however, been integrated into all aspects of the villagers’ routines, but has been integrated only into those activities in which it is seen as providing the greatest benefit; that is, in women’s income earning and domestic tasks.
