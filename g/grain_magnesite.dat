40|$|ABSTRACT: The process {{developed}} in the U K to produce magnesium hydroxide from seawater is described, together with the heat reatment that he hydroxide r ceives toproduce the active oxide. Some of the characteristics required of the dolomite used in the process are also discussed. Impurities introduced by the seawater a e noted and {{the means by which}} they can be reduced explained. Magnesium oxide has long been an important industrial material. The major tonnage outlet for magnesia has been the refractories industry in which it is employed as 'dead-burned' <b>grain</b> <b>magnesite</b> for the construction and maintenance of the hearths or bottoms of open-hearth steel furnaces. Magnesia also is used in the form of calcined refractory magnesite brick and as a chemical addition in the manufacture of chrome, olivine and other refractories. The industrial importance of magnesia is due to its chemical behaviour and this is largely determined by the position of magnesium in the periodic table. Magnesium oxide is a weak base, particularly at high temperatures, and therefore magnesium oxide is barely attacked by alkalis but readily by acids. All strong mineral acids dissolve or corrode magnesiu...|$|E
40|$|On {{the west}} of Chalkidiki {{peninsula}} and on the north of Evia Island, large magnesite deposits occur in dunite and its altered equivalent, brown serpentinite. In the Vavdos district on {{the west of}} Chalkidiki peninsula, magnesite veins up to 2 m thick and with a lateral and almost uniform extent of more than 100 m continue prominently at depths of about 100 m. Most of the substantial magnesite veins in brown serpentinite are surrounded by stockworks of smaller veins. In the Troupi area on Evia Island magnesite occurs as thin veins forming a stock- work-type of mineralisation in brown serpentinite and as the major component of a strong 2 to 3 metres thick, magnesite-serpentine breccia zone. The magnesite is cryptocrystalline, rarely microcrystalline, snow- white in colour, massive or nodular with porcelaneous lustre and conchoidal fracture. It is very pure and the small but variable amounts of Ca and Si and the traces of Fe and Mn shown in microprobe analyses are due to impuritie that occur between cryptocrystalline <b>magnesite</b> <b>grains.</b> The veins are filled with massive magnesite or with magnesite which exhibits smooth, irregular or rounded surfaces (nodular magnesite) with the internodular spaces being saturated with hydrous magnesium silicates. Tremolite, edenite, chlorite, antigorite, and talc are common in the selvages of veins filled with nodular magnesite {{but they are not}} genetically related to magnesite mineralisation. Talc {{is the only one of}} these minerals that suffered alteration during or shortly after magnesite mineralisation. Talc remnants and its alteration product, lizardite, together with chlorite and minor sepiolite fill the spaces between the magnesite nodules. Pre-existing talc-free, fractures or new structures created by the mineralising fluids were the sites of massive magnesite deposition. Field and laboratory evidence suggest that the deposits were formed from ascending, CO 2 -bearing fluids, that derived their magnesium content not from the immediately-surrounding country rocks, but from elsewhere and most probably from interaction with ultramafics at depth well below the observable zone of deposition. Experimental work on forsterite interaction with H 2 O-CO 2 - 0. 5 mNaCl solutions together with published data on the solubility of carbonates and silica suggest that ascending CO 2 -rich fluids that reacted with dunite at depth were able to fill open(ing) fractures with pure magnesite at a later stage in a high pressure-low temperature environment. Strontium isotope analyses indicate that the strontium in the magnesite came largely from carbonate sediments, and this in turn points to connate water or to any ground water isotopically equilibrated with carbonate sediments as the initial source of the mineralising fluids. The spatial relationship betweem the wall rocks of the magnesite and their plate tectonic environment suggest that it is likely that the deposits were formed during the final stages of the emplacement of the ultramafics in their present setting (Late Cretaceous-Eocene?) ...|$|R
