40|$|Seven Chlorella strains {{representing}} {{three species}} obtained from culture collections and research laboratories were screened for their potential of heterotrophic production of lutein {{on two different}} media (Basal and Kuhl) containing glucose. While both media supported good growth and lutein formation of the seven strains in darkness, higher biomass concentrations and lutein content were achieved on Basal medium. Chlorella protothecoides CS- 41 was chosen from the seven strains for further investigation due to its higher productivities of both biomass and lutein. The maximal biomass concentration and lutein content of C. protothecoides cultivated heterotrophically with 9 g L- 1 glucose in a 3. 7 -L fermentor were respectively 4. 6 g <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> L- 1 and 4. 60 mg lutein g- 1 <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> on Basal medium, and 4. 0 g <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> L- 1 and 4. 36 mg lutein g- 1 <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> on Kuhl medium. The heterotrophic cultivation process was scaled up successfully to 30 L using a fermentor, in which the Basal medium containing 36 g L- 1 glucose was used; the maximal biomass concentration of 16. 4 g <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> L- 1, specific growth rate of 0. 92 d- 1, lutein content of 4. 85 mg lutein g- 1 <b>dry</b> <b>cells,</b> growth yield of 0. 47 g <b>dry</b> <b>cells</b> g- 1 glucose and lutein yield of 1. 93 mg lutein g- 1 glucose were respectively achieved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>cell</b> uses a paste electrolyte, {{with only}} enough {{moisture}} to allow current to flow. Unlike a wet <b>cell,</b> a <b>dry</b> <b>cell</b> can operate in any orientation without spilling, as it contains no free liquid, making it suitable for portable equipment. By comparison, the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods {{hanging from the}} open top and needed careful handling to avoid spillage.

40|$|Production of uricase (urate oxidase, EC 1. 7. 3. 3) by n-alkane-utilizing Candida tropicalis pK 233 was studied. Although {{the yeast}} showed very low enzyme {{productivity}} under growing conditions on glucose or an n-alkane mixture (C 10 to C 13) (less than 2 U/g of <b>dry</b> <b>cells),</b> enzyme formation was enhanced markedly in an induction medium consisting of potassium phosphate buffer, MgSO 4, uric acid, and an n-alkane mixture (47 U/g of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> or glucose (21 U/g of <b>dry</b> <b>cells).</b> Of the carbon sources tested, the n-alkane mixture {{was the most}} suitable for enzyme production. Appropriate aeration also stimulated uricase formation. In addition to uric acid, xanthine, guanine, adenine, and hypoxanthine were also effective for inducing uricase.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} the alteration of cell permeability toward fluoroquinolones in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, {{which is a}} major quinolone-resistance mechanism along with the alteration of DNA gyrase in gram-negative bacteria. The prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant N gonorrhoeae strains is rapidly increasing in Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS [...] The uptake and accumulation of norfloxacin by gonococcal cells, including six clinical and five World Health Organization (WHO) reference strains, were measured. Of the six clinical strains, two were highly resistant to norfloxacin (MIC 8. 0 and 4. 0 micrograms/ml), two were moderately resistant (MIC 1. 0 and 0. 5 microgram/ml), and two were sensitive (MIC 0. 063 and 0. 004 microgram/ml). All five WHO reference strains were sensitive to norfloxacin (MIC < or = 0. 001 to 0. 063 microgram/ml). RESULTS [...] Mean initial norfloxacin uptake in the four resistant strains (104 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> was significantly lower than that in the seven sensitive strains (158 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> (p < 0. 05). The mean uptake after 20 minutes was also significantly lower in the four resistant strains (130 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> than in the seven sensitive strains (194 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> (p < 0. 05). However, {{there was no significant}} difference in mean norfloxacin accumulation after 20 minutes between the four resistant strains (26 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells)</b> and the seven sensitive strains (36 ng/mg of <b>dry</b> <b>cells).</b> The accumulation of norfloxacin after 20 minutes was almost zero in two of the four resistant strains, while the remaining two strains accumulated norfloxacin as well as the sensitive strains. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings suggest that alteration of bacterial cell permeability is a quinolone-resistance mechanism in N gonorrhoeae isolated in Japan, and that this bacteria may exhibit other mechanisms such as alteration of DNA gyrase...|$|R
