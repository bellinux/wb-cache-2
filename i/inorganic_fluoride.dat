40|$|Nephrotoxicity {{following}} {{administration of}} methoxyflurane {{has been shown}} to be directly related to anesthetic metabolism to <b>inorganic</b> <b>fluoride.</b> Enzyme induction should increase metabolic rate and the amount of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fluoride</b> that is released. In vivo studies in Fischer 344 rats show that enzyme induction with phenobarbital or phenytoin increases defluorination following methoxyflurane anesthesia but not after enflurane or isoflurane. In vitro, methoxyflurane defluorinase activity was increased far more than that of any of the other anesthetics. These data suggest that treatment with enzyme inducing drugs increases the risk of nephrotoxicity only if methoxyflurane is the anesthetic agent. For purposes of this discussion, the potent, fluorinated, inhalational anesthetics are considered halothane-related compounds. They differ from halothane in that they are aliphatic ethers which when biotransformed liberate <b>inorganic</b> <b>fluoride.</b> Halothane is a fluorinated ethane which, except under conditions of extreme hypoxia, does not breakdown to <b>inorganic</b> <b>fluoride</b> (1). Since postanesthetic nephrotoxicity is directly related to <b>inorganic</b> <b>fluoride</b> concentration in the serum, halothane should not be considered a nephrotoxin. Nephrotoxicity associated with anesthetic administration was first reported by Crandell et al. (2) in a study of patients anesthetized with methoxyflurane (CHC 12 -CF 2 - 0 -CH). Thirteen of 41 patients had polyuria with negative fluid balance, increased serum sodium and blood urea nitrogen concentrations and fixed urinary osmolality, close to that of serum. Polyuria was resistant to fluid deprivation and vasopressin administration. These findings were later confirmed in both man and animals (3, 4).
