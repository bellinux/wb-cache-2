500|$|In {{the preface}} to the book, Villas states that vegetarians {{and those that do}} not eat pork for {{religious}} reasons are [...] "haunted instinctively by the sensuous, irresistible enticement". He asserts, [...] "There's no one who doesn't love bacon. It's the greatest food God has ever created." [...] Villas asks, [...] "Who, under any circumstances, is not rendered almost helpless by the tantalizing sound of bacon sizzling slowly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>skillet,</b> by the taunting backwoods aroma that permeates the air ...?" [...] He notes that [...] "the greatest and most beloved food on earth" [...] is one of the worlds oldest forms of cooked meat. The author comments on the surge in interest in bacon products in the years prior to the book's publication, [...] "Just the 40 percent increase in bacon consumption in the United States {{over the past five years}} might have justified my writing this book." [...] The book includes photographs by Andrea Grablewski.|$|E
500|$|Summed up by James Dinh of MTV News, [...] " [...] 'Party' takes viewers {{back to an}} old-school {{backyard}} celebration full {{of colorful}} bikinis, freestyle dancing and a few familiar faces. Throughout the video, [...] lets loose, playing a sort of party host. If she is not lounging in beach chairs, she is dancing among her friends or mowing the lawn." [...] The clip is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and a saucepan caught in fire. Then, Beyoncé appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy garments, sporting neon-colored oval shaped nails, and bright-colored lipstick. She is cooking <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>skillet</b> while one of her neighbors drinks from a hose. As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard barbecue, where Beyoncé and her friends dance as Solange is deejaying. This is followed by scenes of Beyoncé, floating in an above ground pool while singing and entertaining her guests. She is wearing a pink one-piece swimsuit, dropping earrings and her hair looks crimped. Other girls bask {{in the sun and}} splash in the pool as Solange works the turntables.|$|E

2500|$|Guy Kibbee eggs is {{the name}} for a breakfast dish which {{consists}} of a hole {{cut out of the}} center of a slice of bread, and an egg cracked into it, all of which is fried <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>skillet.</b> [...] The actor prepared this dish in the 1935 Warner Bros. film Mary Jane's Pa, hence the eponym. This dish is also known by other names, such as [...] "egg in a basket".|$|E
60|$|The cabin faced a level plain with no tree in sight. A {{mile away}} to the west stood a low stone house and {{immediately}} {{in front of us}} opened a half-section of unfenced sod. To the north, as far as I could see, the land billowed like a russet ocean, with scarcely a roof to fleck its lonely spread.--I cannot say that I liked or disliked it. I merely marvelled at it, and while I wandered about the yard, the hired man scorched some cornmeal mush <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>skillet</b> and this with some butter and gingerbread, made up my first breakfast in Mitchell County.|$|E
50|$|No {{matter which}} cereals are used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> kokkoh recipe, {{preparation}} is similar and simple. The cereals are soaked {{in water for}} two to three hours.

50|$|Alternatively, {{the noodles}} can be drained and dry roasted. This {{gets rid of}} the bitterness. It also makes the noodles have a more pasta-like consistency. Dry {{roasting}} is done by placing noodles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-stick <b>skillet</b> on high {{for a minute or}} until you hear a slight squeaking noise when moving them around. After that they are ready to be added to soup stock or have a sauce added to them.|$|R

50|$|Heavy snows trap Sylvester the Cat and Tweety (friends at the cartoon's beginning) {{alone in}} Granny's {{mountain}} cabin. The standard expository radio report announces that the roads will be blocked for six weeks. Panicked, Sylvester looks for food everywhere finding nothing but boxes {{and boxes of}} bird seed. He quickly seizes upon the idea of coaxing Tweety into being cooked, proposing sailboat play (<b>in</b> <b>a</b> stock pot) and skating (<b>in</b> <b>an</b> oil-lined <b>skillet).</b>|$|R
50|$|The peppercorn crust {{itself is}} made by placing the steak <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bed of cracked black (or mixed) peppercorns. Typically, the steak is seared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hot <b>skillet</b> with <b>a</b> small amount of butter and oil. The steak is seared at a high {{temperature}} to cook the outside quickly and form the crust while leaving the interior rare to medium-rare. The steak is then left to rest for several minutes and then served.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} New England/Northeastern United States preparation uses ham, usually of the maple-cured variety, {{along with}} cooked mashed potato (often mixed with some mild seasonings and milk or butter for a smoother consistency) for the outer roll.

5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking <b>in</b> <b>an</b> iron <b>skillet.</b> Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are red meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|R
50|$|Several {{properties}} distinguish wats from stews {{of other}} cultures. Perhaps {{the most obvious}} is an unusual cooking technique: the preparation of a wat begins with chopped onions slow cooked, without any fat or oil, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dry <b>skillet</b> or pot until much of their moisture has been driven away. Fat (usually niter kibbeh) is then added, often in quantities that might seem excessive by modern Western standards, and the onions and other aromatics are sautéed before the addition of other ingredients. This method causes the onions to break down and thicken the stew.|$|R
50|$|The effect Leidenfrost {{described}} is {{a phenomenon}} in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than its boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer which keeps that liquid from boiling rapidly. It is most commonly seen when cooking; one sprinkles drops of water <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>skillet</b> to gauge its temperature. If the skillet's temperature is {{at or above the}} Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the metal and takes longer to evaporate than it would <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>skillet</b> that is hot, but at a temperature below the Leidenfrost point. It has also been used in some dangerous demonstrations, such as dipping a wet finger in molten lead or blowing out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen, both enacted without injury to the demonstrator.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between johnnycake and hoecake originally {{lay in the}} method of preparation, though today both are often cooked on a griddle or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>skillet.</b> Some recipes call for baking johnnycakes in an oven, similar to corn pones, which are still baked in the oven as they were traditionally.|$|E

50|$|The Hamburger Wagon {{is a small}} wagon, {{large enough}} for only two people to work side by side; one cooks while the other one prepares the buns and handles the money. The wagon, still at {{approximately}} the same location where it originated, is rolled away and stored indoors nightly. The establishment has changed ownership hands several times throughout the years, most recently bought by Jack Sperry in September 2008 from Michelle Lyons. Unchanged, however, is the flagship product: small hamburgers cooked by oil <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large <b>skillet</b> and served on a roll with an onion, pickle, salt and pepper. The burgers have a crispness on the outside due to being deep fried.|$|R
