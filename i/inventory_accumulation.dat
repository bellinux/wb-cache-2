Both pre- and postchoice characteristics are ex- amined. Because the LIFO-FIFO choice is voluntary, a postchoice association {{would be consistent with}} managers both anticipating future inventory characteristics when making a LIFO-FIFO choice and changing inventory management policies in response to that choice. Evidence consistent with the hypothesis that LIFO adoptions are associated with changes in inventory management policies would have important macroeconomic implications. Zarnowitz and Moore [1977] have argued that a failure to recognize the major shift in inventory costing methods which occurred in 1973 and 1974 (primarily FIFO to LIFO) resulted in an underestimation of <b>inventory</b> <b>accumulations</b> by the U. S. Department of Commerce. This underestimation resulted from the different procedures used under LIFO and FIFO to assign costs to inventory units. While this effect of LIFO-FIFO choices can bias macroeconomic measurements and forecasts, an associated change in inventory management policies by a large number of firms could directly affect underlying macroeconomic stocks and flows. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the challenges of}} improving the on-time delivery performance of a high-volume critical part type in a high-product-mix manufacturing facility of valves. Preliminary analysis on the push-type production system of the valve manufacturing cell shows that long production lead time caused by excessive <b>inventory</b> queuing and <b>accumulation</b> as well as lack of standardized finished goods inventory management policy are the major factors that limit the on-time delivery performance. A new pull-type production system is developed with {{the design of a}} highly responsive fabrication line which enables faster material movement and an efficient inventory review framework for real-time monitoring of inventory positions. A dedicated production line with the placement of effectively controlled Work-In-Process (WIP) buffers is constructed, which is capable of reducing the production lead time by more than 80 %, along with a 40 % reduction in overall WIP volume. Moreover, a finished goods inventory review policy is proposed based on the (s, S) policy which significantly eliminates the possibilities of backlog and inventory explosion by the setup of both lower and upper control limits on inventory positions. The suggested policy is expected to ensure a service level of at least 95 % during peak demand period, with up to 50 % potential reduction in average inventory level held by the system. A Kanban system is also established to coordinate operations in the proposed pull-type production system. by Bingxin Yao. Thesis: M.

40|$|The Blake Ridge region lies on {{the passive}} margin of southeastern North America and {{contains}} {{a large amount of}} methane gas hydrate. The methane and methane gas hydrate are predominantly biogenic, apparently produced by CO 2 reduction. Reflection seismics indicate that bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) enclose ~ 55, 000 sq. km, with high-amplitude BSRs covering ~ 26, 000 sq. km. Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 164 drilled three deep holes on a 10 -km-long transect (Sites 994, 995, and 997; water depth 2770 - 2798 m). Based on sampling and geochemical, thermal, seismic, and borehole geophysical measurements, gas hydrates are most likely present between ~ 190 and 450 m in sediment column. Gas hydrate is most often disseminated throughout the sediment column, although concentrations occur within specific sedimentary horizons, within supposed fault zones, and at the base of gas hydrate stability (BGHS) where methane recycling produces more pervasive concentrations of gas hydrate. Estimates of gas hydrate inventory are based on a variety of methods including geochemical proxies, vertical seismic profiling, electric logging, and measurements of in situ methane. Over the entire sediment column, at least ~ 2 - 4 % of pore space volume (1 - 2 % sediment volume) is occupied by methane gas hydrates, but average and maximum estimates are 5. 4 % and 12 %, respectively. Extrapolation of vertical gas hydrate and methane inventory over the area containing high-amplitude BSRs yields estimates of 67 - 406 Gt (gigatons, 10 ** 15 g) of methane gas hydrate (or 9 - 52 Gt of methane) and 2. 6 - 27 Gt of methane occurring as gas bubbles below the BGHS. Average values are 185 Gt of gas hydrate and 24 Gt of methane as gas hydrate. Any gas hydrate occurring outside the area underlain by BSRs (as suggested by geochemical evidence) or that associated with low-amplitude BSRs may increase these estimates by an unknown factor. Various data give conflicting pictures of mass transport with Blake Ridge sediments. The data can be reconciled by viewing the upper sedimentary section (<~ 150 m) as dominated by diffusion, and the lower section characterized by buoyant advection (migration) of gaseous methane with both modes of transport overprinting generally low rates of pore-fluid movement (~ 20 cm/ky). Methane migration seems necessary to produce observed gas hydrate distribution and <b>inventory</b> estimates. <b>Accumulation</b> of gas hydrate in the Blake Ridge sediments depends on the amount of methane leaving the system versus the amount of methane entering the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) over geologic time. Although there are some point sources of methane loss from the sediments (e. g., seafloor seeps, ODP Site 996) of unknown magnitude, most of the documented methane loss occurs through diffusion and consumption at the sulfate-methane interface (SMI) by anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO; ~ 2 ? 10 ** 8 mol/year). Methane entering the GHSZ at a rate of ~ 1. 3 ? 10 ** 9 mol/year indicates a methane-trapping efficiency of ~ 85 %. 129 I measurements suggest that the Blake Ridge system has accumulated gas hydrate over as much as 55 million years...|$|R
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of the air quality by mosses provides qualitative and quantitative data using economic, easy-to-manage and eco-friendly methods. Due to peculiar morphological and physiological characteristics, mosses are very suitable adsorbents {{for a wide variety}} of pollutants (i. e. metals and metalloids, PAHs, radionuclides) and, when used as transplants in nylon bags, they allow an easy monitoring potentially of any site, with a highly dense sampling network. Nevertheless, the moss-bag technique, although widely applied, is still not based on standardized protocols. It follows that the data collected from biomonitoring surveys are not comparable, thus relegating the active biomonitoring exclusively to academic field or to scientific purposes. Moreover, there are not enough studies comparing bioaccumulation data with those obtained by estimation models or traditional monitoring approaches, neither it is clear how the moss-bag technique can discriminate pollution inputs on a very small scale and within areas relatively close to each other or characterized by different land uses. Another important issue is that the mosses employed as biomonitors are naturally grown species. The collection in nature implies an intrinsic variability of mosses in terms of elemental and chemical composition and, as a consequence, it poses a high degree of uncertainty in the interpretation of the results. Moreover, an uncontrolled harvesting of mosses could lead to a severe environmental impact. In this context, aims of this Doctoral Thesis are: 1) to test the variables affecting the exposure protocol in the view of a standard moss-bag method for the bio{{monitoring of}} air pollution; 2) to integrate biomonitoring results with emission data provided by inventories for the evaluation of the atmospheric pollution; 3) to characterize a novel moss biomaterial for biomonitoring purposes. For the standardization assay, more than one thousand moss bags were exposed contemporary in three European territories (Austria, Italy, Spain) belonging to three different climatic areas (Mediterranean, continental and oceanic). For each area, four distinct scenarios (background, urban, agricultural, industrial) were selected for the exposure, on the basis of their level and type of contamination. The moss included in bags was the Pseudoscleropodium purum (Hedw.) M. Fleisch, collected in a pristine area of the Galicia (NE Spain). Shoot apical parts were selected, EDTA-washed and finally devitalized by oven drying at 100 °C. For the first time, all the variables affecting the air pollutant uptake by moss exposed in bags were considered: 1) the moss bags characteristics (round, spherical and flat shapes; nylon net mesh size of 1, 2 and 4 mm; moss amount and moss weight/bag surface area ratio of 15, 30, 45 mg cm- 2); 2) the exposure criteria (exposure time of 3, 6, 12 weeks; exposure heights of 4, 7, 10 m above ground); 3) the climatic conditions of the exposure area. The concentrations of metals and metalloids were determined by ICP mass spectrometry and the results were evaluated comparing pre- and post-exposure moss samples. Results showed that the amount of moss included in bags was the most important factor affecting the pollutant accumulation by mosses: the more the moss density inside bags increases, the less metal uptake occurs. The other variables (climate, bag size and shape, exposure time and height) had low or no influence at all. As consequence of the obtained results, the project Mossclone proposed the use of a standard moss bag, spherical-shaped, with a mesh size of 2 mm and filled with a moss amount less than 15 mg per cm 2 of bag surface area. In addition, it was suggested to expose the moss-bags for not less than six weeks (to increase the detectability of metal concentrations in moss) and, for practical reasons, at 4 m above the ground. The proposed standardized protocol for moss-bag exposure was then tested in a biomonitoring campaign carried out in the framework of the LIFE-Ecoremed project, in order to assess the air quality of five municipalities belonging to the Italian RIPS “Litorale Domizio-Agro Aversano” (Campania Region, south Italy). In each municipality, two scenarios (urban and agricultural) and two sub-scenarios (a street side and a corresponding green area) were selected, in order to evaluate the anthropogenic pollution, with a particular attention to the vehicular traffic impact on the surrounding areas. The concentrations of twenty PAHs and of thirty-nine elements including rare earths were determined by ICP mass spectrometry in pre- and post-exposure samples of Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw. moss, treated and exposed following the standardized method. After exposure, the concentration of most of the elements and PAHs (in particular the 4 - and 5 -ringed PAHs) was significantly increased in moss material. The pollutants had a similar spatial distribution pattern over the entire study area, with road traffic and agricultural practices as the major diffuse pollution sources. Hypnum cupressiforme moss bags was able to detect airborne element and PAH inputs and to discriminate different pollution levels in a landscape characterized by a jeopardized structure in which agricultural and urban/residential sites are strictly mixed together. The data obtained in the Italian biomonitoring campaign were combined with those provided by emission inventories, which are a collection of estimations, recorded with spatial disaggregation, on the type, amount and emission sources of pollutants. As a result, it was observed that both approaches (biomonitoring and emission inventory) indicated the same most polluted municipality and a similar spatial pattern, in particular for lead. This suggests that the joint use of emission <b>inventory</b> and moss <b>accumulation</b> could be a valuable resource to reveal contaminants better than the use of a single approach, allowing a more deep investigation on the pollutant emission sources, especially for those contaminants not routinely monitored. To overcome the limits of the use of native mosses, the last part of the PhD thesis is focused on the characterization of a new moss biomaterial, provided by the cloning inside bioreactors. The cloned moss specie in question is the Sphagnum palustre L., whose elemental composition (pre- and post- treatments with EDTA and by devitalization) and molecular profile were given, in comparison with the conspecific field moss, in order to outline a defined fingerprint of the new biomaterial. The morphological and physico-chemical properties of the moss adsorbing surfaces were also examined by electron microscopy, in vitro experiments on metal adsorption and by the chemical analysis of the surface exchange sites. A field exposure test with moss-bags was performed, comparing the clone and the naturally grown P. purum. The clones exhibited a much lower metal concentration (from 10 to 100 times) in their tissues than the native samples, thus making the former better indicators of low metal loading. New DNA markers, also useful for systematic analyses of the Sphagnum genus, were provided in order to characterize and label the clone. The S. palustre clone exhibited acid base properties similar to those of naturally grown Sphagnum samples and showed a significantly higher metal uptake performance. Therefore, the use of this biomaterial, with very homogenous morphological and chemical characteristics and a remarkable metal uptake capability, is strongly recommended in the view of a rigorously standardized moss-bag protocol for the active monitoring of persistent atmospheric pollutants...|$|R

Calibrating their model to reproduce the average inventory-to-sales ratio in postwar U. S. data, the authors find that it explains half of the cyclical variability of inventory investment. Moreover, <b>inventory</b> <b>accumulation</b> is strongly procyclical, and production is more volatile than sales, as in the data. The comovement between inventory investment and final sales is often interpreted as evidence that inventories amplify aggregate fluctuations. However, the authors' model economy exhibits a business cycle {{similar to that of}} a comparable benchmark without inventories. Inventories; Business cycles...|$|E
40|$|Labor {{hoarding}} is {{a widely}} believed empirical behavior of firms and a prominent explanation for procyclical labor productivity. Conventional wisdom attributes labor hoarding to labor adjustment costs. This paper argues that {{the conventional wisdom is}} inadequate for understanding labor hoarding because it ignores the role of inventories. Since idle labor can be used to produce inventories, why do firms hoard labor when inventory is an option? Using a dynamic rational expectations model of profit-maximizing firms facing demand uncertainty, this paper studies the dynamic interactions between labor hoarding and <b>inventory</b> <b>accumulation.</b> Closed-form decision rules for labor and inventory decisions are derived. The analysis shows that labor adjustment costs alone are far from sufficient for explaining labor hoarding.; Earlier title: On the optimal volume of labor hoardingProductivity; Labor supply...|$|E
