5|$|A metal-surfaced {{road from}} US 20 in Rushville to {{north of the}} Niobrara River was {{constructed}} between 1940 and 1948. It was extended south to north of Cravath Lake by 1953.

5|$|MD410 was {{originally}} built along mostly new alignment between Bethesda and Silver Spring {{in the late}} 1920s. The highway was extended east to Hyattsville in the mid-1930s. While the Montgomery County portion <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> much in the ensuing decades, MD 410 has been realigned and extended multiple times within Prince George's County. These changes include an extension along existing roads further into Hyattsville in the mid-1940s, a realignment within Hyattsville in the mid-1950s, an extension through Riverdale in the late 1960s, and the final extension to Landover Hills in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|MS 465 first {{appeared}} as a gravel road on the state map in 1956, connecting US 61 near Vicksburg to MS 1 in Fitler. A year later, {{a section of the}} highway became paved in northwest Warren County, and its southern terminus was realigned to north of Vicksburg by 1958. The terminus continued to shift north to parallel the Yazoo River the next two years, ending near Redwood. The southern half of the route was fully paved by 1964, and the northern by 1984. The route <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> significantly since. The route was proposed {{to be part of the}} Great River Road, but it was not included in the most recent reiteration of the route.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{is roughly}} middle-aged; it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> {{dramatically}} {{for more than}} four billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. After hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which it is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable.|$|E

Until 1998, NY31E was state-maintained from its western terminus in Middleport to the Medina village line. On October1, 1998, ownership and maintenance of NY31E between NY271 in Middleport and the Niagara–Orleans county line was transferred from the state to Niagara County {{as part of a}} highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. This section of the route was subsequently co-designated, but not signed, as CR143 by Niagara County.|$|E
5|$|Carrick {{is a small}} {{historic}} {{village that}} is primarily a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. Development has been slow and <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> the town's original 19th century character. The local council's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen, keeping them as distinct centres. Construction is only planned within the town's boundary, where up to sixty homes could potentially be built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016. The town's development boundary is dictated by the span of sewerage connection. There are few businesses in the town and little incentive for business growth due to the town's small population. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Federal Division of Lyons, and the State Division of Lyons.|$|E
5|$|The Roosevelt dime {{was first}} struck on January 19, 1946, at the Philadelphia Mint. It was {{released}} into circulation on January 30, {{which would have}} been President Roosevelt's 64th birthday. The planned release date had been February 5; it was moved up to coincide with the anniversary. With its debut, Sinnock became the first chief engraver to be credited with the design of a new circulating U.S. coin since those designed by Charles E. Barber were first issued in 1892. The release of the coins was a newsworthy event, and demand for the new design remained strong, although many of Roosevelt's opponents, particularly Republicans, were outraged. There were reports of the new dime being rejected in vending machines, but no changes to the coin were made. The dime's design <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> much in its over seventy years of production, the most significant alterations being minor changes to Roosevelt's hair and the shifting of the mint mark from reverse to obverse in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed,</b> literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E
