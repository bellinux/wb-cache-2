40|$|The {{consumption}} of dehydrated vegetables, which provides {{an important source}} of vitamins, is increasing worldwide. Dehydrated vegetables are located on non-refrigerated shelves in food shops and, therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the modifications that take place in the content of these labile micronutrients at the ambient conditions currently found in food shops. The present study discusses the effect of storage for 3, 6, 9 and 12 months on the content of thiamin and vitamin C in different commercial and pilot plant dehydrated garlic, onions, potatoes and carrots in darkness at room temperature under vacuum conditions. The content of b-carotene under these conditions was also studied in dehydrated carrots. Thiamin remained stable over the first 3 months of storage (# 2; 90 % retention), while long-term storage led to larger losses (retention of 85 % in garlic and 45 % in commercial carrots after 12 months of storage). The content of vitamin C drastically decreased during the storage period and even disappeared in some <b>dried</b> <b>onions</b> and carrots following 12 months of storage. Storage for 6 months at ambient conditions preserved 80 ¿ 90 % of the b-carotene content in dehydrated vegetables, while long-term storage led to significant b-carotene degradation (retentions between 43 and 81 %). These results suggest that vitamins are gradually lost during storage at the practical conditions in food shops and will thus provide relevant information concerning dried vegetables, so manufacturers may calculate shelf life under established storage conditions.

40|$|Onions are {{the most}} {{important}} cash crop for farmers of the Dogon Plateau. Of the total grown only 1 % are consumed by the growers themselves. The harvest period lasts from early December to the end of April and peaks at the end of February. During the harvest period the price of fresh onions fluctuates considerably. The average price paid per kilogramme at the beginning of December is 150 FCFA compared to 35 FCFA at peak production time. Preserving onions by drying is a long-establishe practice among the Dogon. During drying, a fermentation occurs which gives the onions a special flavour. Because of this flavour they are used more as a spice than as a fresh onion substitute. Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) have been looking into various methods by which fresh onions could be dried without fermentation. The method chosen had to be usable in the villages, be operable without auxiliary power and be an addition to rather than a replacement of the traditional method. Several experimental processes were tried using a tunnel system but results were not satisfactory until an open air rack system was developed. Each wooden rack is covered with fine mesh on the bottom and sides and has feet that allow the racks to stack on top of each other. The onions are skinned before slicing and the slices spread out on the racks. The racks are placed side-byside on the first day but are subsequently stacked, no more than ten high, to ensure stability. While drying, the onions are carefully loosened up once a day to improve aeration. The racks are easily made and maintained by local farmers and the onion slicing machines are made by local blacksmiths.
