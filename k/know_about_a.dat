5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn {{everything there is to}} <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official must be prepared to defend every contract on its merits.|$|E

She is joined by Simon, still half-costumed, who chains her to the bed. Simon claims to be Krampus, and the scene ends with Kathy screaming as [...] "Krampus" [...] cackles. The actor playing [...] "Krampus" [...] leaves. The cameras keep rolling as plastic is put under [...] "Kathy" [...] for a scene she did not <b>know</b> <b>about.</b> <b>A</b> new actor is dressed as the Krampus, and Kathy is roughly gagged. The new Krampus advances, armed with a machete; the older Dennis {{explains that}} [...] "Kathy" [...] understands, and that we are witnessing genuine fear. The tape cuts just as the machete is about to fall. Dennis says that he is surprised the tape has surfaced again, but that it was [...] "one of the better ones"; The Devil of Christmas, unbeknownst to [...] "Kathy", was a snuff film. Dennis's interviewer terminates the police interrogation.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> different world." ...|$|E

Clay, Glen's brother, says Glen was talking about how he had met Brown and was [...] "going to take her down" [...] {{a few days before the}} murders happened in 1994. When the murder case was under process, Deputy AD of Van Nuys Lea D'Argostino came to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> letter Glen had written revealing he had met Brown. The information was forwarded to O.J. Simpson's prosecutors, but it was ignored. Much later, in his years long correspondence (beginning in 2009) with criminal profiler Anthony Meolis, Glen also wrote about and created paintings pointing towards his involvement with the murders. During a personal prison meeting between the two, Glen said he was hired by O.J. Simpson to break into Brown's house and steal some expensive jewelry, and that O.J. had told him: [...] "you may have to kill the bitch".|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the text}} of most pages, there are usually {{a large number of}} {{hypertext}} links to other pages within the wiki. This form of non-linear navigation is more [...] "native" [...] to a wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. Users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain [...] "by hand", as multiple authors and users may create and delete pages in an ad hoc, unorganized manner. Wikis can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Some wikis, including the original, have a backlink feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is also typically possible in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what they <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> subject new to the wiki. Wiki users can typically [...] "tag" [...] pages with categories or keywords, {{to make it easier for}} other users to find the article. For example, a user creating a new article on cold weather cycling might [...] "tag" [...] this page under the categories of commuting, winter sports and bicycling. This would make it easier for other users to find the article.|$|E
