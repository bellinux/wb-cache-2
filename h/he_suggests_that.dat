5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{disguise}} are unknown. Hingley notes that many contemporary publications attempted to suggest women had {{played a role in}} their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E

5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Historian Martin Samuels has {{questioned}} {{whether it was}} in fact Varro in command on the day on the grounds that Paullus may have been in command on the right. The warm reception that Varro received after the battle from the Senate was in striking contrast to the savage criticism meted out to other commanders. Samuels doubts whether Varro would have been received with such warmth had he been in command. Gregory Daly notes that, in the Roman military, the right was always the place of command. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> at the Battle of Zama Hannibal was quoted saying that he had fought Paullus at Cannae and concludes {{that it is impossible to}} be sure who was in command on the day.|$|E
5|$|In Cú Chulainn's youth {{he is so}} {{beautiful}} the Ulstermen worry that, without a wife of his own, he will steal their wives and ruin their daughters. They search all over Ireland for a suitable wife for him, but he will have none but Emer, daughter of Forgall Monach. However, Forgall is opposed to the match. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Cú Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman Scáthach {{in the land of}} Alba (Scotland), hoping the ordeal will be too much for him and he will be killed. Cú Chulainn takes up the challenge, travelling to her residence Dún Scáith (Fortress of Shadows) on the Isle of Skye. In the meantime, Forgall offers Emer to Lugaid mac Nóis, a king of Munster, but when he hears that Emer loves Cú Chulainn, Lugaid refuses her hand.|$|E

5|$|In another study, Gregory S. Paul {{pointed out}} that the flexed kneed and digitigrade adult Tyrannosaurus were much better adapted for running than {{elephants}} or humans, pointing out that Tyrannosaurus had a large ilium bone and cnemial crest that would have supported large muscles needed for running. He also mentioned that Alexander's (1989) formula to calculate speed by bone strength was only partly reliable. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the formula is overly sensitive to bone length; making long bones artificially weak. He also {{pointed out that}} the lowered risk of being wounded in combat may have been worth the risk of Tyrannosaurus falling while running.|$|E
5|$|In chapter eleven, History, Wade {{demonstrates}} how genetics {{can be related}} to recorded history. An example given is the substantial genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his male relatives. History correlates with this, as writers of the period stated that he had hundreds of wives. Wade then covers the origins of the British; contrary to popular belief, he writes, neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Vikings eradicated the indigenous population, as the Y chromosomes common to Celtic speakers are carried by {{a large percentage of the}} male population of Britain. Markers in these Y chromosomes can be linked to the Basques, and <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the British and Irish descend from a refuge in Spain they shared during the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E
5|$|Kirby Muxloe Castle is {{positioned}} {{set back from}} the village of Kirby Muxloe on low-lying land; the castle's gardens and orchard probably stood to the north and west of the current site. John Goodall suggests that the earlier residence on the site was built around two courts, one of which survives within the later castle, with the other on the north-west side of the site. The historian Anthony Emery, however, argues that the earlier manor was similar in size and shape to the current castle: <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> it was fortified and was protected by a moat similar to that seen today. The foundations of the first residence discovered between 1912 and 1913 were left uncovered after the excavations and remain visible in the castle lawns.|$|E

5|$|Much {{commentary}} {{has focused}} on the novel's depiction of njais, a subject common in contemporary Chinese Malay literature. Sumardjo describes the novel as an ode to njais, citing Marsiti's loyalty to Aij Tjeng and her pureness of purpose; Marsiti is ultimately recognised for her devotion when her grave in Cikembang is moved to Batavia, with empty spaces on either side for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Sumardjo finds subtle criticism of the Dutch and Chinese men who kept njais, showing the women as often becoming victims of their lovers. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> this was manifested in the character of Keng Djim's unnamed njai (Marsiti's mother), who is banished after rumours spread that she has been unfaithful. Sutedja-Liem likewise emphasises the role of the njai within the story, considering the novel to be an ode to the love and loyalty of the concubines.|$|E
5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at first glance surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even been threatened with prosecution. However, <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> no challenge was made because the legislation was likely to be challenged at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Roger Sale {{believes}} Andersen {{expressed his}} feelings {{of social and}} sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds. The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina’s inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply different. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority.|$|E

5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E
5|$|According to Hardorff, {{the theory}} is {{discounted}} by most academics. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Marquis may have made errors due {{to the use of}} sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. In his book, Wooden Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians. Attributing the soldier's suicides to the effects of whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although Wooden Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful– which he immediately spat out– that he took from a captured bottle. In later life, Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E
5|$|Articles {{published}} in the 1970s and later suggest that Debierne's results {{published in}} 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900. Furthermore, the now-known chemistry of actinium precludes its presence {{as anything other than}} a minor constituent of Debierne's 1899 and 1900 results; in fact, the chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had, instead, accidentally identified protactinium, which would not be discovered for another fourteen years, only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his laboratory equipment. This has led some authors to advocate that Giesel alone should be credited with the discovery. A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the then nascent state of radiochemistry: highlighting the prudence of Debierne's claims in the original papers, he notes that nobody can contend that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium. Debierne, who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89.|$|E

5|$|By 1440 he {{was firmly}} in the king's favour, being made in {{succession}} the first ever English viscount as Viscount Beaumont (1440), possibly because by then Boulogne was effectively lost to him and then granted royal lands in East Anglia, further official positions in royal castles, Lord Great Chamberlain, elected to the Garter and the feudal Viscountcy of Beaumont in France. In 1445 he was made premier viscount, and granted precedence over any other- as-yet unmade- viscounts. These consistent promotions and favouritism {{have been the subject}} of some speculation by historians; John Watts has questioned why he 'attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and perquisites from the crown in these years.' <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> as a major noble in East Anglia- with all the territorial and regional significance that meant- was enough to make him worthy of promotion. Beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry, Knyghthode and Bataile, an adaption of Vegetius for presentation to the king, and was also a major benefactor of Queens' College, Cambridge which the king had granted by charter to his wife Margaret in 1448.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood stove and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E
5|$|N. J. Higham {{has argued}} that because {{the date of the}} {{original}} information is unknown and the largest Northumbrian kingdoms are not included in the Tribal Hidage, it cannot be proved to be a tribute list of Mercian origin. He notes that Elmet, which was never a province of Mercia, is included in the list. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the Tribal Hidage may have been a tribute list drawn up by Edwin of Northumbria in the 620s, and that it probably originated before 685, after which no Northumbrian king exercised imperium over the Southumbrian kingdoms. According to Higham, the values assigned to each people are likely to be specific to the events of 625-626, representing the individual contracts made between Edwin and those who recognised his overlordship at that time. This explains the artificial and rounded nature of the figures that were arrived at: the figure of 100,000 hides for the West Saxons was probably the largest number Edwin knew. However, D. P. Kirby notes that the Northumbrian origin theory has not been generally accepted as convincing.|$|E
