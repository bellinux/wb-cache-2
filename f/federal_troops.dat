5|$|According to news reports, {{the first}} {{passenger}} trains {{left the city}} at 9:00am, and continued running throughout the day. Around 10:00am, General W. S. Hancock arrived and was followed by 360–400 <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> from New York and Fort Monroe, who relieved those guarding Camden Station. They brought with them two 12 pounder artillery pieces. From that point on, {{the men of the}} 5th and the <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> took turns guarding the station.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{played a}} role in the {{evacuation}} of <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> from Texas at the onset of the American Civil War. As Texas considered whether to secede from the United States, General David E. Twiggs, commander of <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> in Texas negotiated with state leaders concerning the transfer of federal property. After learning of such negotiations, the United States military moved to decommission Twiggs, and replace him with Colonel Carlos Waite. Texas viewed this move as a rejection of the negotiations and proceeded to forcefully claim the federal property. Twiggs, while awaiting relief from Waite, surrendered the property on the condition that <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> could peacefully evacuate. They were allowed to depart, but only from the Texas coast. Waite arrived and relocated troops near Green Lake, where they could await coastal departure near an adequate source of freshwater. During the stay, Fort Sumter fell under siege, and Texas grew concerned about the concentration of armed <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> in the area. With their respective nations now at war, Texas considered the deal with Twiggs void, and began to capture <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> to force them to either join the Confederacy or be Prisoners of War. Some of the remaining uncaptured companies elsewhere in the state attempted to flee to Green Lake. Several regiments camped by the lake later in the war, and complained about mosquitos.|$|E
5|$|In May 1871, Grant ordered <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> to help marshals in arresting Klansmen. That October, Grant {{suspended}} {{habeas corpus}} {{in part of}} South Carolina and sent <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> {{to enforce the law}} there. After prosecutions by Akerman and his replacement, George Henry Williams, the Klan's power collapsed; by 1872, elections in the South saw African Americans voting in record numbers. That same year, Grant signed the Amnesty Act, which restored political rights to former Confederates. Lacking sufficient funding, the Justice Department stopped prosecutions of the Klan in June 1873; civil rights prosecutions continued throughout Grant's second term but with fewer yearly cases and convictions. Additionally, Grant's Postmaster General John Creswell, using his patronage powers, integrated the postal system and appointed African American postmasters across the nation.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{not being}} actual insurgents in the EZLN, many {{indigenous}} women still supported the EZLN in other ways. These women {{were those who}} were typically older or had families to care for. The civilian women contributed by warning communities if the military arrived, operating radios to notify communities of <b>federal</b> <b>troop</b> movement, sewing uniforms, feeding troops, and more.|$|R
50|$|As Steele fled northward {{after the}} battle, clearly not {{intending}} to join Banks {{in his attempt}} to capture Shreveport, Louisiana, Walker reversed course and headed back south to join Taylor's pursuit of Banks. He arrived in Alexandria on May 23, 1864, the same day that Banks's retreating Army was being picked up by <b>Federal</b> <b>troop</b> transports at Simmesport.|$|R

5|$|Order {{began to}} be {{restored}} on Thursday. The New York State Militia and some <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> were returned to New York, including the 152nd New York Volunteers, the 26th Michigan Volunteers, the 27th Indiana Volunteers and the 7th Regiment New York State Militia from Frederick, Maryland, after a forced march. In addition, the governor sent in the 74th and 65th regiments of the New York State Militia, which {{had not been in}} federal service, and a section of the 20th Independent Battery, New York Volunteer Artillery from Fort Schuyler in Throgs Neck. The New York State Militia units were the first to arrive. By July 16, there were several thousand <b>Federal</b> <b>troops</b> in the city.|$|E
5|$|According {{to reports}} in The Sun, the {{following}} day at 3:00pm, those who were left of the original 6th Regiment disbanded. No official order was given to this effect, but their duties had by this point been entirely assumed by <b>federal</b> <b>troops,</b> the soldiers of the 5th, and the newly formed 7th and 8th. The armory of the 6th remained guarded by a single police officer.|$|E
5|$|Even though Maryland did not {{secede from}} the Union, Steuart's loyalty lay with the South, as did {{that of his}} father. He {{commanded}} one of the Baltimore city militias during the riot of April 1861, following which <b>Federal</b> <b>troops</b> occupied Baltimore, an incident which was arguably the first armed confrontation of the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|In Luuq, Al-Shabaab {{attacked}} Transitional <b>Federal</b> Government <b>troops</b> using hit-and-run tactics, killing four soldiers.|$|R
50|$|On September 26, 1906 {{the first}} armed {{rebellion}} against the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, precursor to the Mexican Revolution began in Jiménez, it was led by Juan José Arredondo and Calixto Guerra, members of the Partido Liberal Mexicano of Ricardo Flores Magon. The movement was short lived as <b>Federal</b> <b>troop</b> reinforcements from Piedras Negras, surprised and dispersed the revolutionaries {{the next day at}} Hacienda Victoria.|$|R
2500|$|The {{depictions of}} mass Klan {{paramilitary}} actions {{do not seem}} to have historical equivalents, although there were incidents in 1871 where Klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all-black portion of the state militia under various justifications, prior to the eventual <b>Federal</b> <b>troop</b> intervention, and the organized Klan's continued activities as small groups of [...] "night riders".|$|R
5|$|In 1872, General Meade died, leaving Hancock the army's senior major general. This {{entitled}} {{him to a}} {{more prominent}} command, and President Grant, still desirous to keep Hancock from a Southern post, assigned him command of the Division of the Atlantic, headquartered at Fort Columbus on Governors Island, in New York City. The vast department covered the settled northeast {{area of the country}} and was militarily uneventful {{with the exception of the}} army's involvement in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. When railroad workers went on strike to protest wage cuts, the nation's transportation system was paralyzed. The governors of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland asked President Hayes to call in <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> to re-open the railways. Once <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> entered the cities, most of the strikers melted away, but there were some violent clashes.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{was elected}} {{president}} on November 6, 1860, and the following month Booth drafted a long speech, apparently undelivered, that decried Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of slavery. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began, and eventually 11 Southern states seceded from the Union. In Booth's native Maryland, some of the slaveholding {{portion of the population}} favored joining the Confederate States of America. Although the Maryland legislature voted decisively (53–13) against secession on April 28, 1861, it also voted not to allow <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> to pass south through the state by rail, and it requested that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> in Maryland. The legislature seems to have wanted to remain in the Union, while also wanting to avoid involvement in a war against southern neighbors. Adhering to Maryland's demand that its infrastructure not be used to wage war on seceding neighbors would have left the federal capital of Washington, D.C. vulnerable and would have made the prosecution of war against the South impossible, which was no doubt the legislature's intention, so Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus and imposed martial law in Baltimore and portions of the state, ordering the imprisonment of many Maryland political leaders at Ft. McHenry and the stationing of <b>Federal</b> <b>troops</b> in Baltimore. Many Marylanders, including Booth, agreed with the ruling of Marylander, and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, Roger B. Taney in Ex parte Merryman that Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus in Maryland was unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Madero {{sent some}} of his forces to make a diversionary attack on Agua Prieta, which proved successful; the {{resulting}} First Battle of Agua Prieta was significant {{in that it was}} the first time railroads were used by the rebels to gain surprise and that US forces were involved in the fighting. The town was recaptured by <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> two weeks later once additional reinforcements arrived.|$|E
50|$|The {{objectives}} of the Mississippi Squadron were to cooperate with and support Generals William Rosecrans, Ambrose Burnside, Ulysses S. Grant, and others in combating guerrillas along the river banks; to stop the transport of arms and munitions from Mississippi to Arkansas; to punish rebel supporters living {{in and around the}} river communities; and to escort <b>Federal</b> <b>troop</b> and supply transports on the waterways. To these ends, St. Clair and her sister gunboats were successful throughout the war.|$|R
50|$|The 2nd Regiment South Carolina Volunteer Infantry (African Descent) was an African-American {{infantry}} regiment {{that served}} in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was among the scores of units raised starting {{in the middle of}} the war to augment <b>Federal</b> <b>troop</b> strength by tapping into the large Southern population of former slaves. The regiment and its white commander gained notoriety for its actions during the controversial looting and burning of the pro-Confederate town of Darien, Georgia.|$|R
5000|$|Hayes was peacefully inaugurated. Points 1 and 2 of the {{compromise}} took effect. Hayes had already announced {{his support for}} the restoration of [...] "home rule," [...] which would involve <b>federal</b> <b>troop</b> removal, before the election. It was not unusual, nor unexpected, for a president, especially one so narrowly elected, to select a cabinet member favored by the other party. Points 3 and 4 were never enacted; it is possible there was no firm agreement about them.|$|R
5|$|On October 16 {{the miners}} held {{a meeting and}} {{unanimously}} voted to return to work. They did so beginning the next day, having won nothing in concessions. On October 19, the Governor advised President Rutherford B. Hayes that the <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> could be withdrawn. The Thirteenth Infantry departed the city on October 31, and Colonel Hartley's temporary forces departed in November 1877.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of February 8, 1861, Rector and Totten signed an {{agreement}} placing the arsenal {{in the hands of}} state officials. That afternoon, the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with Governor Rector at its head. All of the <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> had left at this point, except Totten who had stayed behind to listen to the Governor's speech and to hand the arsenal over in person.|$|E
5|$|Passage {{of the act}} {{coincided with}} the seizure of escaped slave Anthony Burns in Boston. Northerners rallied in support of Burns, but Pierce was {{determined}} to follow the Fugitive Slave Act to the letter, and dispatched <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> to enforce Burns' return to his Virginia owner despite furious crowds.|$|E
5000|$|On Monday, U.S. Representative John Conyers (D-Michigan), who {{was against}} <b>federal</b> <b>troop</b> deployment, {{attempted}} to ease tensions by driving along 12th Street with a loudspeaker {{asking people to}} return to their homes. Reportedly, Conyers stood on {{the hood of the car}} and shouted through a bullhorn, [...] "We're with you! But, please! This is not the way to do things! Please go back to your homes!" [...] But the crowd refused to listen. Conyers' car was pelted with rocks and bottles.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Fanchers' arrival, the Utah Territory was {{organized}} as a theocratic democracy under the lead of Brigham Young, who had established colonies along the California Trail and Old Spanish Trail. President James Buchanan had recently issued an order to send troops to Utah. Rumors spread in the territory about the motives for the <b>federal</b> <b>troop</b> movement. Young issued various orders, urging the local population to prepare for the arrival of the troops. Eventually Young issued a declaration of martial law.|$|R
2500|$|In {{accordance}} with Presidential Decree signed on 3 March 2004 №314 [...] "On {{the system and}} structure of federal executive agencies" [...] the <b>Federal</b> Railway <b>Troops</b> Service was abolished and its functions transferred to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The provisions of the decree concerning the <b>Federal</b> Railway <b>Troops</b> of the Russian Federation entered into force after the entry into force of the federal law (Federal Law of 29.06.2004 N 58-FZ). On October 5, 2004 the troops became subordinated to the Russian Armed Forces Rear Service).|$|R
5|$|The force {{gathered}} at Camden Station at 8:30am on Saturday, July 29, included 250 <b>federal</b> <b>troops,</b> 250 {{men of the}} 5th Maryland Regiment, and 260 policemen. Under this guard, freight traffic once again resumed {{in and out of}} Baltimore. That day between 8 and 34 trains were dispatched in total.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle changed the {{perception}} of the rebel movement in Mexico. Before Madero's victory many believed that the rebel forces would scatter {{as soon as they were}} confronted by <b>federal</b> <b>troops.</b> The fall of Juárez proved that notion wrong and revealed the real strength of the rebel forces.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{activities}} or owner {{are not known}} after her sale, but Ozark transported <b>Federal</b> <b>troops</b> and New Orleans police attempting to apprehend the white supremacists who killed {{a large number of}} blacks during the Colfax Massacre in 1873. She ferried witnesses back and forth to their homes on the Red River during the subsequent trials in 1874. Her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Two weeks later, on May 7, the Adelaide was {{chartered}} by the U.S. Navy {{and attached}} to the Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In that role, {{she was used to}} transport <b>Federal</b> <b>troops</b> in support of operations in North Carolina's Outer Banks, directed against the Confederate-held forts guarding Hatteras Inlet. Later that year, the Adelaide was returned to the Baltimore Steam Packet Company.|$|E
5|$|Violence {{erupted in}} Baltimore on July 20, with police and {{soldiers}} of the Maryland National Guard clashing with crowds of thousands gathered throughout the city. In response, President Rutherford B. Hayes ordered <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> to Baltimore, local officials recruited as many as 500 additional police, and two entirely new national guard regiments were formed. Peace was restored on July 22.|$|E
5|$|After the {{assassination}} of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968, riots {{broke out in the}} District, primarily in the UStreet, 14thStreet, 7thStreet, and HStreet corridors, centers of black residential and commercial areas. The riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 <b>federal</b> <b>troops</b> stopped the violence. Many stores and other buildings were burned; rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|July 18: The <b>federal</b> {{government}} <b>troops</b> {{known as}} Johnston's Army depart from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas on the [...] "Utah Expedition" [...] to replace Brigham Young as governor. This {{results in the}} Utah War.|$|R
25|$|His gallantry {{and display}} of good {{judgment}} in action near Winchester, Virginia, during the Second Battle of Winchester, {{earned him a}} brevet to Captain in 1863. It was during this time, Confederate forces captured Lieutenant Randolph's artillery battery and he was wounded. Sent to the infamous Libby prison, a converted brick warehouse in Richmond, Virginia, Randolph worked with others for eight months, standing watch and helping with the digging, eventually escaping the Libby prison. Over the week following, {{he was able to}} make his way through the city and into the swamps, avoiding capture until finally making his way to <b>Federal</b> <b>troop</b> positions near Williamsburg, Virginia.|$|R
50|$|January 30 - Five Federal Police {{officers}} were ambushed by gunmen while traveling on the Highway Occidente; seven federal {{officers were}} reported injured. The government scrambled <b>federal</b> helicopters, <b>troops,</b> and state police {{to find the}} ones responsible.|$|R
