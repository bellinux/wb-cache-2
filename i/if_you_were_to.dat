5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E
5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> go outside {{on a clear}} night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E

Just as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> see the lifeless corpse of a man lying far away, it would be fitting to list all the causes of death in order to make sure that the single cause of this death may be stated. For you would not be able to {{establish}} conclusively that he died by the sword or of cold or of illness or perhaps by poison, but we know that there is something of this kind that happened to him.|$|E

25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. Imagine <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back on shelves, trying on clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if {{a huge number of}} customers arrive and spend all their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Mulder {{prepares to}} submit his {{application}} to be reassigned to X-Files division. Meanwhile, Mulder's boss, Deputy Director Kersh, informs Doggett {{that he intends}} to deny the request. As season eight was nearly over, the producers and writers decided to refuse Mulder re-admittance into the FBI as a way to segue John Doggett and Monica Reyes into the series as the new main stars of season nine. David Duchovny agreed with this method, noting, [...] "I completely thought it was correct that they should be trying to focus elsewhere, and that, since I was going to come back for the second half of season eight, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> refocus on whatever Mulder's up to, you'd be in the same lousy situation at the beginning of season nine." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} were {{inspired}} by 1960s and 1970s rock bands. [...] "Between the Lines" [...] was written with The Animals, The Zombies and Paul Revere & the Raiders in mind, and Weiland considered [...] "Cinnamon" [...] to {{be a combination of}} 1960s British pop and Ian Curtis (of Joy Division). [...] "Huckleberry Crumble" [...] was inspired by Aerosmith, specifically [...] "Same Old Song and Dance". Dean admitted to the similarities: [...] "The arrangement is almost the same: riff, solo, verse, chorus, solo, back to a second verse—it's pretty much the same setup." [...] He also noted how the song sounded different {{depending on the type of}} instruments used to play it. [...] "It's amazing how, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> present that opening riff on a Tele really clean, it's almost a country riff. But if you present it with a Les Paul through a Marshall, it takes on this whole different thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Cuba's burgeoning tourist {{industry}} {{of the late}} 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to The Economist, [...] "In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It's as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner." [...] The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions. Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and people have always performed them in the street. Despite {{the appeal of the}} [...] "Buena Vista" [...] ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the [...] "Buena Vista Social Club" [...] than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern Timba, Songo and other musical forms on the island, such as reggaetón by luminaries such as Raul Zeballos, the creator of the genre. Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience, as they were not creating anything new; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years.|$|E
500|$|The Gunnerkrigg Court webcomic is told in {{a series}} of episodic {{chapters}} such that each, while forming part of the overall storyline, also functions individually as a stand-alone story arc."Each of the chapters individually is sort of a self-contained thing, so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> just read one of them it wouldn't be like you {{had no idea what was}} going on." [...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 × 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames. At the bottom of the most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page, in which readers may comment on and discuss that day's comic.|$|E
500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared {{that he would not be}} able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] as to what they would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it." ...|$|E

500|$|Rubano had a bassline that, {{within an}} hour of playing it, became the track [...] "New Again." [...] After writing it, Fazzi said it was a [...] "no-brainer for an opener". O'Connell called it [...] "powerful" [...] and said it [...] "sets the mood" [...] for the album. One day during rehearsals, Fazzi played a guitar riff, then O'Connell played along, {{resulting}} in [...] "Sink into Me." [...] The song begins with cheerleader-esque [...] "hey!"s that Fazzi came up with. Lazzara referred to it as a [...] "freight train. ... <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> stand in front of it, you would get pummeled". Lazzara also mentioned that the music to it was [...] "unlike anything we've ever done before. It's real upbeat." [...] For [...] "Lonely, Lonely," [...] Lazzara said it was the [...] "first time that we just turned it up to ten and went with it". With this song, Fazzi said the group wanted something [...] "short, to the point and just punishing from start to finish". The song's bridge had been suggested by Fazzi during his audition for the band. Rubano said the track was [...] "a freight train of rock & roll" [...] and was inspired by Queens of the Stone Age. [...] "Summer, Man" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs written for New Again. It was composed during the Projekt Revolution tour, and consisted originally of a bridge guitar riff by Reyes. Rubano said it was the band's take on a Beach Boys-esque song.|$|E
500|$|David is an android {{that acts}} as the ship's butler and {{maintenance}} man. It {{is designed to be}} indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop [...] "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, [...] "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> ask him, 'What do you think about all of this? What's going on? What do you think about these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?" [...] Fassbender said, [...] "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance". In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose [...] "vacancy" [...] and longing for a soul interested him. Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in , the [...] "funny walk and economy of movement" [...] of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence. Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast, despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.|$|E
