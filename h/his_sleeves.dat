5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up <b>his</b> <b>sleeves,</b> present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.|$|E

25|$|In 1880 Blyth was {{appointed}} Freeland Professor of Natural Philosophy at Anderson's College, Glasgow, {{which became the}} Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College in 1886. Whilst teaching at the technical college he pursued an active research programme with a particular interest in the generation and storage of electricity from wind power. Blyth was liked by his students and colleagues who admired his hard working nature, down-to-earth attitude and willingness to roll up <b>his</b> <b>sleeves.</b> He was also {{well known in the}} local community through a series of popular lectures and demonstrations.|$|E
25|$|Knott {{was known}} for his {{idiosyncratic}} behaviour on the field. His trademarks included always keeping his shirt collar turned up to protect him from the sun; <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> rolled down to safeguard his elbows when diving; and, after a tip from former Northamptonshire and England wicket-keeper Keith Andrew, warming his hands with hot water before going on the field. According to Bob Taylor, Knott preferred strong-backed gloves with full webbing and plenty of padding in the palms, wearing two pairs of Chamois inners with strips of plasticine across the palms.|$|E
25|$|Heima, {{tied up with}} rope, reveals Shihei's plot {{to seize}} power, {{describing}} each detail and he bemoans his fate, having failed in his mission to kill Kan Shōjō, and having been captured. Hearing of Shihei's treachery, Kan Shōjō becomes enraged, breaking off a branch from the plum tree and striking off Heima's head with it, {{as if it were}} a sword. He asks Shiradayū and Umeōmaru to hurry to the capital, to warn the emperor of Shihei's plans. Knowing that he cannot return to the capital himself, at least not in body, having been formally exiled, he vows to return as an angry spirit. To that end, he vows to journey to the summit of Mount Tenpai, where he will engage in austere disciplines, swear oaths to the gods, and become a ghostly lord of thunders. As he speaks, a storm rises up. His retainers grasp at <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> and try to stop him, but he throws them off, and flies off into the sky, already beginning to transform into a thunder spirit.|$|E

500|$|After {{originally}} {{beginning his}} career as a winger, O'Keefe switched to central midfield and was described by former Cardiff City manager Russell Slade as a [...] "hard working, energetic, athletic midfield player." [...] Slade also praised O'Keefe for his determination when not playing regularly in the first team, stating [...] " [...] Stuart will roll <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> up, work harder, to try and show his manager and the coaching staff that he's capable of playing in the first team." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1998–99 lockout, Falk {{was often}} {{described}} as the [...] "invisible hand" [...] that guided union negotiations. [...] The NBPA President during the lockout, Patrick Ewing, was a client of Falk's. [...] Falk was also the agent of [...] "nearly half" [...] of the union's 19-member negotiating committee, including Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard, and Dikembe Mutombo. [...] Though his presence in negotiations was already assumed, Falk publicly stated in an October 31, 1998 New York Times article that he would [...] "roll up <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> and exert as much influence as he (could) behind the scenes,... (planning) {{to take a more}} proactive role in ending the lockout." ...|$|E

King is shown [...] "stepping forward with conviction to deliver his powerful message". He is surrounded by three allegorical figures: behind and to King's right is a young white man with <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> rolled up who symbolizes the working American; directly behind King is a woman wading ashore who represents the country's immigration history; and behind and to the left of King is a young girl, shown releasing King's coattail, who represents [...] "intergenerational respect".|$|E

500|$|Kippax was an [...] "impeccably {{correct and}} elegant batsman, [...] an upright, easy stance at the wicket; like his schoolboy idol Victor Trumper, he rolled <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> between wrist and elbow and excelled {{with the late}} cut", who was {{probably}} at his peak during the 1920s. His omission from the 1926 team to tour England caused great controversy at the time—especially as he hit a brilliant 271 not out against Victoria {{on the eve of}} selection. [...] Kippax was well into his thirties by the time he became a consistent selection for the Test team. Highly regarded by both fellow players and spectators, Kippax's innings of 83 in the Lord's Test of 1930 induced Neville Cardus to comment that, [...] "he pleased the eye of the connoisseur all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, {{he was not a}} very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E
500|$|During the Zoo TV Tour, the song's {{performance}} was significantly altered. In these shows, the Edge played guitar on his Fender Stratocaster {{with the band}} on the main stage, while Bono sang the song on the B-stage with a headset microphone. [...] Bono mimed {{the actions of a}} heroin addict, rolling up <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> and then pretending to spike his arm during the final lyric, after which he would sing [...] "Hallelujah" [...] over and over while reaching up into a pillar of white light. [...] Writer Robyn Brothers sees the addition of the [...] "Hallelujah" [...] coda as indicating that while organized religion may act in the role of a sedative, a notion akin to other Zoo TV themes, the role of personal faith may still have a [...] "desiring, affirming, and 'deterritorializing' force." [...] At the culmination of the [...] "Bullet to Blue Sky" [...] to [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] sequence, red and yellow smoke flares came out from either end of the stage (an idea of U2's security chief, who was a U.S. Vietnam veteran), as the coda segued into [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". This arrangement and performance of [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was included in the 1994 concert film [...]|$|E

500|$|Manley {{describes}} Headley as {{just under}} medium height with sloping shoulders. His movements were precise and economical on the cricket field; his cap was usually at a slight angle and <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> were buttoned {{down to the}} wrist. Wisden noted in 1933 that his timing and placement of the ball was perfect. Exceptionally quick on his feet, he watched the ball onto the bat {{more than any other}} batsman. According to Wisden, all his shots were equally good but most notable was his on drive played from the back foot. He hit the ball hard and was very difficult to get out. He faced criticism for playing off the back foot so often, but R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed his square cut, late cut, and hook were exceptionally good. Headley was particularly effective on bad batting wickets. C. L. R. James calculated that Headley averaged 39.85 and passed fifty on seven occasions in thirteen innings on difficult wickets. According to James's reckoning, Bradman in similar conditions passed fifty once, and averaged 16.66 in fifteen innings. Headley himself preferred batting when the odds favoured the bowlers as he had to go for his shots and play his natural attacking game. He stated: [...] "On a bad wicket, it was you and the bowler...no nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} B-stage, U2 often played [...] "Bad" [...] or [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", with {{performances}} of [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] and [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] following. For [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky", the video screens displayed burning crosses and swastikas. During [...] "Running to Stand Still", Bono mimed {{the actions of}} a heroin addict from the B-stage, rolling up <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> and then pretending to spike his arm during the final lyric. Afterwards, red and yellow smoke flares ignited from either end of the B-stage, before the band re-grouped on the main stage for U2 classics played straight. [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] was accompanied by sped-up video of the group in the desert from The Joshua Trees photo shoot. U2 often finished their set with [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] while a clip from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famed [...] "I've Been to the Mountaintop" [...] speech was played on the video screens. The group was initially unconvinced that the leap {{from the rest of the}} show's irony and artifice to something more sincere would be successful, but they thought that it was important to demonstrate that certain ideals were so strong and true that they could be held onto no matter the circumstance. The group alternated performances of [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] in acoustic form on the B-stage with using it to close the main set.|$|E

I am a fashion god." [...] In another e-mail, Brown's press secretary, Sharon Worthy, advised him to roll up <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> [...] "to look more hard-working... Even the {{president}} rolled <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> to just below the elbow." [...] An e-mail offering critical medical equipment went unanswered for four days.|$|E
2500|$|In the Monster High media, {{including}} {{video games}} and web animations, there is a teacher named [...] "Mr. Where", who dresses in the Invisible Man's bandages, trench coat, and gloves (however, he usually wears a beret and sunglasses, as he is the drama teacher). He is confirmed to be invisible beneath these coverings {{on more than one}} occasion, where <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> are shown bunching up to reveal his invisible limbs. He also seems {{to have the ability to}} extend his invisibility, making his clothing disappear as well.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "lady" [...] {{is shown}} {{a number of}} silks and brocades {{possibly}} suitable for her wedding dress, into which she inserts {{a small piece of}} cloth and then removes it, sticking it into her kimono. Noticed by Kōbei, she is accused of stealing, and a scuffle erupts. Rikimaru (as the lady's retainer) manages finally to mediate, {{with the help of the}} shop's neighbor and a few others. He shows a receipt from another shop for the scrap of fabric, proving it was not stolen from the Hamamatsu-ya. In the course of the fighting however, the [...] "lady" [...] suffered a blow to her head, for which Rikimaru then demands 100 ryō as recompense. As the pair prepare to leave with their illicit gains, however, a man by the name of Tamashima Ittō (Nippon Daemon in disguise) emerges from the backroom and points Kozō out, noting that the cherry blossom tattoo peeking out under <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> reveals him as a man.|$|E
