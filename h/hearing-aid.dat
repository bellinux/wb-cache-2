2500|$|Early tubes used a {{metal or}} glass {{envelope}} atop an insulating bakelite base. In 1938 a technique {{was developed to}} use an all-glass construction with the pins fused in the glass base of the envelope. This {{was used in the}} design of a much smaller tube outline, known as the miniature tube, having 7 or 9 pins. Making tubes smaller reduced the voltage where they could safely operate, and also reduced the power dissipation of the filament. Miniature tubes became predominant in consumer applications such as radio receivers and hi-fi amplifiers. However the larger older styles continued to be used especially as higher power rectifiers, in higher power audio output stages and as transmitting tubes.Subminiature tubes with a size roughly that of half a cigarette were used in <b>hearing-aid</b> amplifiers. These tubes did not have pins plugging into a socket but were soldered in place. The [...] "acorn tube" [...] (named due to its shape) was also very small, as was the metal-cased RCA nuvistor from 1959, {{about the size of a}} thimble. The nuvistor was developed to compete with the early transistors and operated at higher frequencies than those early transistors could. The small size supported especially high-frequency operation; nuvistors were used in UHF television tuners and some HiFi FM radio tuners (Sansui 500A) until replaced by high-frequency capable transistors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (telecoil) mode {{is usually}} {{more effective than}} the acoustic method. This is mainly because the microphone is often automatically switched off when the hearing aid is operating in telecoil mode, so background noise is not amplified. Since there is an electronic connection to the phone, the sound is clearer and distortion is less likely. But in order for this to work, the phone has to be <b>hearing-aid</b> compatible. More technically, the phone's speaker has to have a voice coil that generates a relatively strong electromagnetic field. Speakers with strong voice coils are more expensive and require more energy than the tiny ones used in many modern telephones; phones with the small low-power speakers cannot couple electromagnetically with the telecoil in the hearing aid, so the hearing aid must then switch to acoustic mode. [...] Also, many mobile phones emit high levels of electromagnetic noise that creates audible static in the hearing aid when the telecoil is used. [...] A workaround that resolves this issue on many mobile phones is to plug a wired (not Bluetooth) headset into the mobile phone; with the headset placed near the hearing aid the phone can be held far enough away to attenuate the static. [...] Another method is to use a [...] "neckloop" [...] (which is like a portable, around-the-neck induction loop), and plug the neckloop directly into the standard audio jack (headphones jack) of a smartphone (or laptop, or stereo, etc.). Then, with the hearing aids' telecoil turned on (usually a button to press), the sound will travel directly from the phone, through the neckloop and into the hearing aids' telecoils.|$|E

Abstract: Objective: To investigate word recognition in noise in subjects treated in childhood with chemotherapy, study benefits of open-fitting <b>hearing-aids</b> for word recognition, and investigate whether self-reported hearing-handicap corresponded to subjects' word recognition ability. Design: Subjects diagnosed with cancer and treated with platinum-based chemotherapy in childhood underwent audiometric evaluations. Study Sample: Fifteen subjects (eight females and seven males) fulfilled the criteria set for the study, and four of those received customized open-fitting <b>hearing-aids.</b> Results: Subjects with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity had severe difficulties recognizing words in noise, and scored as low as 54 % below reference scores standardized for age and degree of hearing loss. Hearing-impaired subjects' self-reported hearing-handicap correlated significantly with word recognition in a quiet environment but not in noise. Word recognition in noise improved markedly (up to 46 %) with <b>hearing-aids,</b> and the self-reported hearing-handicap and disability score were reduced by more than 50 %. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of testing word recognition in noise in subjects treated with platinum-based chemotherapy in childhood, and to use specific custom-made questionnaires to evaluate the experienced hearing-handicap. Open-fitting <b>hearing-aids</b> are a good alternative for subjects suffering from poor word recognition in noise...|$|R

The insertion of grommets is currently being used to correct hearing impairment and prevent complications of unmanaged OME, but there is ongoing discussion about whether the benefits of grommets outweigh the costs and risks. A decision-tree model was developed to assess the surgical insertion of grommets with two non-surgical alternatives (<b>hearing-aids</b> and do-nothing strategies) in cleft palate children with persistent bilateral OME. The model assumed a 2 -year time horizon and a UK National Health Service perspective. Outcomes were valued using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) estimated by linking utility values with potential hearing gains measured in decibels. Multiple data sources were used, including reviews of the clinical effectiveness, resource use and utility literature, and supplemented with expert opinion. Uncertainty in the model parameters was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Expected value of perfect information {{analysis was used to}} calculate the potential value of future research. The results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the grommets strategy was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £ 9, 065 per QALY gained compared with the do-nothing strategy, and the <b>hearing-aids</b> strategy was extended dominated by the grommets strategy. The population expected value of perfect information was £ 5, 194, 030 at a willingness to pay threshold of £ 20, 000 per QALY, implying that future research could be potentially worthwhile.

With regard to the age-matched profoundly deaf children with hearing aids, 12 % (63 children) attended mainstream schools, whereas 55 % (281 children) were in a unit of a mainstream school, and 33 % (167 children) were in schools for the deaf. In the group of age-matched severely deaf children, 38 % (239 children) attended mainstream schools, whereas 51 % (326 children) were in a unit of a mainstream school, and 11 % (70 children) were in schools for the deaf. Statistical analysis revealed a highly {{significant difference between the}} educational placement of implanted children and <b>hearing-aided</b> profoundly deaf children (p< 0. 00001), whereas there was no statistically significant difference between implanted children and <b>hearing-aided</b> severely deaf children.

40|$|One may {{encounter}} numerous forms of hearing losses in daily life.

40|$|The {{movement}} of the external ear canal, associated with jaw motion, relative to the concha region of the pinna has been studied. This issue is most relevant to the fitting and function of In-The-Ear <b>hearing-aids.</b> Pairs of open-jaw and closed-jaw silicone impressions were taken of 14 ears from 10 subjects. 3 D coordinate data {{was obtained from the}} concha region and the anterior surface of the canal using a reflex microscope. The canal regions were plotted via an optical flat mirror. Proprietary area-based matching software was used to verify the stability of the concha region and evaluate distortion of the canal during jaw motion. The canal data from each pair was placed into the same coordinate system with their respective concha regions aligned using the areamatching software. Contour and difference maps of the canal data were used to demonstrate the amount of anterior-posterior (A-P), superior-inferior (S-I), and medial-lateral (M-L) movement that occurred between the open and closed-jaw impressions. Rotations were also evaluated. Analysis confirmed that the concha regions did not undergo significant deformation during jaw movement. The canal regions underwent varying amounts of internal deformation with the majority of canals conforming within an RMS of 400 pm across the entire surface. The majority of canals underwent significant morphologic change relative to the concha. Movement of the canal in the M-L plane ranged from 0 to 3. 8 mm with a mean of 1. 4 mm; 8 canals moved laterally, 5 canals moved medially and 2 ears did not move in the M-L plane. Movement in the S-I plane ranged from 0 to 3. 7 mm with a mean of 1. 3 mm; 9 canals moved inferiorly, 2 canals moved superiorly and 3 canals did not moved in the S-I plane. Movement in the A-P plane ranged between + 3. 5 mm and - 3 mm, with 5 canals moving anteriorly, 3 ears moved posteriorly, and 4 ears moving in a mixed fashion. The geometry of the external ear has created difficulties in acquiring accurate surface maps for analysis. The study has focused on the key areas of the pinna and canal previously reported to undergo significant change. This study does not support previous reports that suggest that the ear canal only widens with jaw opening.

Most of the studies were made to explore the impact that hearing aids have for people with severe or congenital hearing impairment. So far it has been confirmed that there are changes regarding voice production in these individuals. A group that has not been investigated regarding voice production to a larger extent are hearing aid users with an acquired hearing impairment. In the present study the voice production of seven individuals, four men and three women, with a moderate acquired hearing impairment is examined.

Analysis on an individual level shows that throughout the different tasks, no participant demonstrated constant, audible differences regarding both fundamental frequency and vocal effort.

40|$|When {{capturing}} speech signals using {{a distant}} microphone within a confined acoustic space, the recordings are often degraded by reverberation. This {{can have a}} detrimental impact on the quality and intelligibility of speech, especially when combined with acoustic noise. In recent years, there has been increasing demand for effective ways of combating the damaging effects of reverberation in applications such as hands-free telephony or <b>hearing-aids</b> technology. However, the task of providing a blind single-channel dereverberation method robust {{to high levels of}} noise and suitable for real-time processing remains a challenge. An important prerequisite for many single-channel dereverberation algorithms is the estimation of the acoustic parameters governing reverberation. In this thesis, a novel online method of estimating these parameters jointly with the interfering signal powers is proposed that is based on a combination of Voice Activity Detection and Extended Kalman Filters. This method is then extended {{to take into account the}} spectral structure of clean speech signals and to perform dereverberation by applying a time-frequency gain to the degraded speech spectrogram. The estimation of this gain is formulated as a Bayesian filtering problem conditioned on a Hidden Markov Model.

40|$|Introduction: Usher {{syndrome}} is a genetic condition causing deaf-blindness {{and is one}} of the most common causes of syndromic deafness. Individuals with USH 1 in Sweden born during the last 15 years have typically received cochlear implants (CI) as treatment for their congenital, profound hearing loss. Recent research in genetics indicates that the cause of deafness in individuals with Usher type 1 (USH 1) could be beneficial for the outcome with cochlear implants (CI). This population has not previously been the focus of cognitive research. Objective: The present study aims to examine the phonological and lexical skills and working memory capacity (WMC) in children with USH 1 and CI and to compare their performance with children with NH, children with hearing-impairment using <b>hearing-aids</b> and to children with non-USH 1 deafness using CI. The participants were 7 children aged 7 - 16 years with USH 1 and CI. Methods: The participants performed 10 sets of tasks measuring phonological and lexical skills and working memory capacity. Conclusions: The results indicate that children with USH 1 and CI as a group in general have a similar level of performance on the cognitive tasks as children with hearing impairment and hearing aids.

40|$|Emerging markets such as {{electric}} {{mobility and}} renewable power generation are driving {{a demand for}} high-performance electrochemical energy storage. Zinc-air batteries are a promising technology due to their high theoretical specific energy, use of cheap materials, and superior operational safety. But they suffer from effects such as poor cycling stability and self-discharge due to carbonate formation in the alkaline electrolyte. The EU Horizon 2020 project Zinc Air Secondary (ZAS!) aims to overcome these limitations and develop a high-performance rechargeable zinc-air battery. Modelling and simulation of novel electrolytes provide crucial support towards achieving this goal. We have developed a 1 D finite volume continuum model implemented in MATLAB. Our model includes a thermodynamically consistent description of mass transport in concentrated electrolytes, multi-phase coexistence in porous media, and reaction kinetics with considerations for anode passivation due to types I and II ZnO, among other effects. Within this framework, we simulate performance on mesoscopic and macroscopic scales. Zinc-air batteries have long been commercialized as primary batteries for <b>hearing-aids.</b> The contamination of potassium hydroxide electrolyte due to carbon dioxide from ambient air is known to limit the lifetime of alkaline zinc-air batteries {{to just a few}} months. This reaction is irreversibly forms carbonate species and degrades cell performance by consuming hydroxide. Our simulations show that as carbonate species form, the hydroxide concentration decreases linearly with time. The depletion of hydroxide decreases the ionic conductivity and in combination with the logarithmic dependence of anode overpotential on hydroxide concentration, this effect leads to a marked decrease in cell potential over time. Carbon dioxide reactions do not occur in non-alkaline electrolytes. Near-neutral chloride aqueous electrolytes have been proposed to improve zinc-air battery lifetime. These electrolytes do exhibit superior lifetime performance, but also have lower nominal conductivity values. This inhibits ionic transport in the electrolyte, and can be rate-limiting for large geometries.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{demonstrates the}} feasibility of three novel low-power and low-noise schemes for the readout interfaces of MEMS Capacitive Microphones (MCM) by presenting their detailed design descriptions and measurement results as application-specific ICs (ASIC) in CMOS technology developed to exploit their application scope in consumer electronics and hearing aids. MCMs are {{a new generation of}} acoustic sensors, which offer a significant scope to improve miniaturization, integration and cost of the acoustic systems by leveraging the MEMS technology. Electret-Condenser-Microphones (ECM) are the current market solution for acoustic applications; however, MCMs are being considered as the future microphone-of-choice for mobile phones in consumer electronics and for hearing aids in medical applications. The readout interface of MCM in an acoustic system converts the output of the MEMS sensor into an appropriate electrical representation (analog or digital). The output of a MCM {{is in the form of}} capacitive-variations in femto-Farad range, which necessitates a low-noise signal-translation employed by the readout interface together with a low-power profile for its portable applications. The main focus of this dissertation is to develop novel readout schemes that are low-noise, low-power, low-cost and batch-producible, targeting the domains of consumer electronics and <b>hearing-aids.</b> The presented readout interfaces in this dissertation consist of a front-end, which is a preamplifier, and a backend which converts the output of the preamplifier into a digital representation. The first interface presents a bootstrapped preamplifier and a third-order sigma-delta modulator (SDM) for analog-to-digital conversion. The preamplifier is bootstrapped to the MCM by tying its output to the sensor’s substrate. This bootstrapping technique boosts the MCM signal by 17 dB and also makes the readout insensitive to the parasitic capacitors in MCM electro-mechanical structure, achieving 55 dBA/Pa of SNDR. The third-order low-power SDM converts output of the PAMP into an over-sampled digital bitstream demonstrating a dynamic-range (DR) of 80 dBA. This ASIC operates at 1. 8 V single-supply and 460 uA of total current consumption; thus, highlighting {{the feasibility of}} low-power integrated MCM readout interface. This ASIC is also acoustically characterized with a MCM, bonded together in a single package, demonstrating a reasonable agreement with the expected performance. The second interface presents a readout scheme with force-feedback (FFB) for the MCM. The force-feedback is used to enhance the linearity of the MCM and minimize the impact of drift in sensor mechanical parameters. Due to the unavailability of the sensor, the effect of FFB could not be measured with an MCM; however, the presented results point out a significant performance improvement through FFB. The preamplifier in this ASIC utilizes a high-gain OTA in a capacitive-feedback configuration to achieve parasitic insensitive readout in an area and power-efficient way, achieving 40 dBA/Pa of SNDR. The digital output of the third-order SDM achieved 76 dBA of DR and was also used to apply the electrostatic FFB by modulating the bias voltage of the MCM. A dummy-branch with dynamic matching converted the single-ended MCM into a pseudo-differential sensor to make it compatible with force-feedback. This interface operates at 3. 3 V supply and consumes total current of 300 uA. The third interface presents a chopper-stabilized multi-function preamplifier for MCM. Unlike typical MCM preamplifiers, this preamplifier employs chopper-stabilization to mitigate low-frequency noise and offset and it also embeds extra functionalities in the preamplifier core such as controllable gain, controllable offset and controllable high-pass filtering. This preamplifier consists of two stages; the first stage is a source-follower buffering the MCM output into a voltage signal and the second-stage is a chopper-stabilized controllable capacitive gain-stage. This preamplifier employs MΩ bias resistors to achieve consistent readout sensitivity over the audio band by utilizing the miller effect, avoiding the conditionally-linear GΩ bias resistors. The offset control functionality of this preamplifier can be used to modulate idle tones in the subsequent sigma-delta modulator out of the audio-band. The high-pass filtering functionality can be used to filter-out low-frequency noises such as wind-hum. This preamplifier operates at 1. 8 V and consumes total current of 50 u with SNDR of 44 dB/PA, demonstrating the feasibility of a low-power low-noise multifunction preamplifier for the MCM sensor...|$|R
40|$|In this {{publication}} are assembled {{the most important}} results of a survey carried out in 1971 / 1972 by the Central Bureau of Statistics as {{to the number of}} physically handicapped in the Netherlands, their social circumstances and the use made of and demand for services and facilities. For the purpose of this survey a sample was drawn from the Netherlands population of 5 years of age and older (both institutionalized and non-institutionalized) registered in the municipal civil registers as of 28 th February 1971. In the first instance these persons received a questionnaire by mail. Of those who responded (83 %), those who claimed to have physical complaints were approached by means of an interview survey. Co-operation was 95 %. In the framework of this survey by physically handicapped is understood: = anyone who has one or more functional disorders to at least a certain degree. Disorders in the following are regarded as functional disorders: function of legs, function of arms/hands, sight, hearing, speech, endurance (heart, lungs), micturition, defecation, balance (including epilepsy), other functions. With respect to each function it was determined to what degree of severity the disorder must at least be present for the individual to be considered physically handicapped. 3 to 4 degrees of severity were distinguished for each functional disorder. The results of the study are published in Dutch in six parts. The first part, containing the key figures, appeared at the end of 1974. It is expected that parts 2 and 3 will appear in the course of 1976. This part (7) is an English language synopsis of the first three parts. In addition to a general description of definitions and research methods the following subjects are dealt with:- demographic data (age, sex, degree of urbanization, province, civil status);- physical data (nature of functional disorder, cause, diagnosis groups, physical defects, location of accident, age at which functional disorder became manifest, degree of severity);- special aids (prostheses, wheel chairs, <b>hearing-aids</b> etc.), use and demand;- medical services (general practitioner, rehabilitation treatment), use and demand;- social services, contact and demand. For each of these subjects some of the most salient results are given. Of the Netherlands population of 5 years of age and older 8. 7 % are found to be physically handicapped {{on the basis of the}} definition employed in the survey. This is equivalent to over a million persons. The chance of becoming physically handicapped increase sharply with increase of age. Of young people of 5 - 24 years of age approximately 2 % are handicapped. Among persons of 75 years of age and older this percentage is 35. Till the age of 55 differences between men and women are not large. After this age differentiations are to be found. Differences in mortality patterns and in physical burden are probably responsible for this. The sharp increase among men up to the age of 65 and the decrease after this age is striking. Even when the factor age is eliminated it is found that the percentage of physically handicapped in rural areas is significantly lower than in urban municipalities. After elimination of the age factor, differences between the provinces are found to disappear. Only the province of Limburg, which encompasses the former mining area, is found to have a significantly higher percentage. Disorders in endurance and in function of legs play a very large role. Of all physically handicapped (of 5 years and older) 21 % have only a disorder in endurance and 18 % a disorder in function of legs. in addition to this there are a large number of physically handicapped persons with a disorder in endurance and/or function of legs in combination with other functional disorders. This results in there being a disorder in endurance among 45 % of all physically handicapped and a disorder in function of legs among 42 %. Slightly more than 80 % of handicapped persons are handicapped simply as a result of illness (including old age). After this in order of frequency follow "due to accident" and "from birth". In the case of disorders due to accident, traffic is found to account for the largest number, followed closely by accidents at work and at home. In the diagnosis groups heart and vascular diseases and rheumatic conditions are the most widespread. For the purpose of moving around approximately 56 % of persons with disorders in function of legs make use of special aids such as canes and orthopaedic aids, while nearly 10 % move around with the assistance of others. It is estimated that 8. 9 % of all physically handicapped with a disorder in function of legs, or 0. 3 % of the Netherlands population, makes use of some form of special transport such as a wheel chair, invalid car, push chair etc. Approximately 87 % of all physically handicapped had consulted a general practitioner or specialist in the year preceding the survey and 12. 3 % had at some time received rehabilitation treatment. Of the physically handicapped of 5 - 64 years of age, 22 % had contact with social services in some form. In conclusion it should be stated that in many instances a lack of information was found to exist as to aids, services and the channels to obtaining these. Though it is possible that resistance and bash fulness play a role it does appear desirable that more attention should be devoted to the aspect "information". more information in general, but in particular to the physically handicapped, to persons in their immediate surroundings and to their potential helpers should be considered. In view of the fact that a high percentage of the physically handicapped fairly regularly come into contact with some form of medical services, co-operation with this sector to further information and to point the way to the appropriate institutions is to be advocated. ...|$|R
5000|$|BMC's {{relationship}} to performance cycling began when BMC began supplying the Swiss professional road racing team Phonak with bikes. The team's patron was Andy Rihs, {{owner of the}} world-leading <b>hearing-aid</b> company of the same name. Andy Rihs took over BMC in 2000 with the vision of building a carbon production facility in Grenchen, Switzerland to produce the ‘Porsche of race bikes’ and the Impec road bike was created. Having a carbon production facility at its disposal has heavily influenced how BMC approaches bike manufacturing. The facility is now called the Impec Advanced R&D Lab and it is primarily used {{for research and development}} by the company's design and engineering teams.|$|E
