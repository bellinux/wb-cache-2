The particular geology and highly concentrated river system could provide more infiltration and percolation of rainwater from surface or streams through permeable soils into water-holding rocks. It may provide useful water supply to undergrounds. In order to study the possible water storage underground in PingTung Plain, we used WASH 123 D watershed model to study this issue. The WASH 123 D numerical model is a physical based computational model with dealing surface flow and groundwater interactions competently. We firstly used field wells data to construct modeling environment, and then applied observation data to calibrate simulated parameters. Modelling environment including rivers, overland and groundwater are constructed in our model. Three examples with including extreme typhoon events insides are studied. We designed the period at last one month to calibrate our model parameters. It is because the flow condition after extreme rainfall occurred is one of the major phenomena that we are interested.

40|$|The Upper Tekezē–Atbara river sub-basin, {{part of the}} Nile Basin, is {{characterized}} by high temporal and spatial variability of rainfall and streamflow. In spite of its importance for sustainable water use and food security, the changing patterns of streamflow and its association with climate change is not well understood. This study aims to improve {{the understanding of the}} linkages between rainfall and streamflow trends and identify possible drivers of streamflow variabilities in the basin. Trend analyses and change-point detections of rainfall and streamflow were analysed using Mann–Kendall and Pettitt tests, respectively, using data records for 21  rainfall and 9  streamflow stations. The nature of changes and linkages between rainfall and streamflow were carefully examined for monthly, seasonal and annual flows, as well as indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA). The trend and change-point analyses found that 19  of the tested 21  rainfall stations did not show statistically significant changes. In contrast, trend analyses on the streamflow showed both significant increasing and decreasing patterns. A decreasing trend in the dry season (October to February), short season (March to May), main rainy season (June to September) and annual totals is dominant in six out of the nine stations. Only one out of nine gauging stations experienced significant increasing flow in the dry and short rainy seasons, attributed to the construction of Tekezē hydropower dam upstream this station in  2009. Overall, streamflow trends and change-point timings were found to be inconsistent among the stations. Changes in streamflow without significant change in rainfall suggests factors other than rainfall drive the change. Most likely the observed changes in streamflow regimes could be due to changes in catchment characteristics of the basin. Further studies are needed to verify and quantify the hydrological changes shown in statistical tests by identifying the physical mechanisms behind those changes. The findings from this study are useful as a prerequisite for studying the effects of catchment management dynamics on the <b>hydrological</b> <b>variabilities</b> in the basin...|$|R

A survey of the recent literature finds that a plethora of teleconnection indices have been employed in the analysis of <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability.</b> Indices representing modes of climatic variability such as El Niño Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Pacific North America pattern, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Meridional Oscillation dominate the literature on climatic and <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability.</b> While examples of discernible signals of modes of climatic variability in stream flow and lake and groundwater level time series abound, the associations between periodic to quasi-period oscillations in atmospheric/ocean circulation patterns and variability within the terrestrial branch of the hydrological are far from simple, being both monotonic (linear and non-linear) and non-monotonic and also conditional on period of analysis, season and geographic region. While there has been considerable progress {{over the last five years}} in revealing the climate mechanisms that underlie the links between climatic and <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability,</b> a bothering feature of the literature is how climatic and <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability</b> is often viewed through a purely statistical lens with little attention given to diagnosing the relationship in terms of atmosphere and ocean physics and dynamics.

40|$|Small Mediterranean streams {{are shaped}} by {{predictable}} seasonal events of flooding and drying over an annual cycle, and present a strong inter and intra-annual variation in flow regime. Native fish assemblages in these streams are adapted to this natural environmental variability. The distinction of human-induced disturbances from the natural ones is thus a crucial step before assessing the ecological status of these streams. In this aim, the present study evaluates the effects of natural <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability</b> on fish assemblages from disturbed and least disturbed sites in small intermittent streams of south Portugal. Data were collected {{over the last two}} decades (1996 - 2011) in 14 sites located in the Guadiana and Sado river basins. High variability of fish assemblages was strongly dependent on human-induced disturbances, particularly nutrient/organic load and sediment load, and on natural <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability.</b> Natural <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability</b> can act jointly with anthropogenic disturbances, producing changes on fish assemblages structure of small intermittent streams. In least disturbed sites, despite the natural disturbances caused by inter-annual rainfall variations (including drought and flood events), fish assemblages maintained a long-term stability and revealed a high resilience. On the contrary, disturbed sites presented significantly higher variability on fish assemblages and a short and long-term instability, reflecting a decrease on the resistance and resilience of fish assemblages. Under these conditions, fish fauna integrity is particularly vulnerable and the ecological assessment may be influenced by natural hydrological variations. High <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability</b> (especially if it entails high frequency of dryer years and meaningful cumulative water deficit) may affect the impact of the human pressures with significant and consistent consequences on fish assemblage composition and integrity. In this study, fish metrics that maximize the detection of human degradation and minimize the response to natural variability were based on the relative abundance of native species (insectivorous species, eurytopic species, water column species, native lithophilic species), relative abundance of species with intermediate tolerance and relative number of exotic species. Results highlight the importance of assessing temporal variability on stream biomonitoring programs and emphasize the need to improve the assessment tools, accounting for long-term changes in fish assemblages, namely by selecting the most appropriate fish metrics that respond to anthropogenic disturbances but exhibit low natural temporal variability, essential both in the characterization of the biological reference conditions and in the development of fish indexes in intermittent streams...|$|E

To better assess the future {{impact of this}} water crisis, {{it is essential that}} we develop continental archives of past <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability.</b> Using four sediment cores from Lake Elsinore in Southern California, we reconstruct late Holocene (∼ 3800 calendar years B. P.) hydrological change using a twentieth-century calibrated, proxy methodology. We compared magnetic susceptibility from Lake Elsinore deep basin sediments, lake level from Lake Elsinore, and regional winter precipitation data over the twentieth century to calibrate the late Holocene lake sediment record. The comparison revealed a strong positive, first-order relationship between the three variables. As a working hypothesis, we suggest that periods of greater precipitation produce higher lake levels. Greater precipitation also increases the supply of detritus (i. e., magnetic-rich minerals) from the lake's surrounding drainage basin into the lake environment. As a result, magnetic susceptibility values increase during periods of high lake level. We apply this modern calibration to late Holocene sediments from the lake's littoral zone. As an independent verification of this hypothesis, we analyzed δ 18 O (calcite), interpreted as a proxy for variations in the precipitation:evaporation ratio, which reflect first order <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability.</b> The results of this verification support our hypothesis that magnetic susceptibility records regional hydrological change as related to precipitation and lake level. Using both proxy data, we analyzed the past 3800 calendar years of <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability.</b> Our analyses indicate a long period of dry, less variable climate between 3800 and 2000 calendar years B.

40|$|A deep {{understanding}} of natural decadal variability is pivotal to discuss recently observed climate trends. Paleoclimate proxies allow reconstructing natural variations before the instrumental period. Typically, regional-scale reconstructions depend on factors like dating, multi-proxy weighting and calibration, which may lead to non-robust reconstructions. Riverine records inherently integrate information about regional climate variability, partly overcoming the above mentioned limitation. The Po River provides major freshwater input to Eastern Mediterranean, as its catchment encompasses {{a large part of}} Northern Italy. Here, using historical discharge data and oceanographic measurements, we show that Po River discharge undergo robust decadal fluctuations that reach the Ionian Sea, - 1, 000 km South of Po River delta, through propagating salinity anomalies.

We analyse inter-amount time distributions of high-resolution streamflow time series for 17  (semi-) urbanised basins in North Carolina, USA, ranging from 13 to 238  km 2 in size. We show that in the inter-amount-time framework, sampling frequency is tuned to the local variability of the flow pattern, resulting in a different representation and weighting of high and low flow periods in the statistical distribution. This leads to important differences in the way the distribution quantiles, mean, coefficient of variation and skewness vary across scales and results in lower mean intermittency and improved scaling. Moreover, we show that inter-amount-time distributions can be used to detect regulation effects on flow patterns, identify critical sampling scales and characterise flashiness of hydrological response. The possibility to use both the classical approach and the inter-amount-time framework to identify minimum observable scales and analyse flow data opens up interesting areas for future research...|$|R
40|$|Water {{resources}} in Central Asia are scarce, so complicated issues arise from this. Kazakhstan is a Central Asian landlocked country which has mostly closed drainage basins, characterized by endorheic lakes {{that do not}} drain to the oceans. These endorheic lakes {{are very sensitive to}} climate change and anthropogenic influences. Very few studies have been conducted on the hydrological cycle of the small endorheic lakes. This work reviews the endorheic lakes within Burabay National Nature Park (BNNP), Northern Kazakhstan. BNNP is a small ecozone consisting of terminal lakes watersheds covered by mixed forests and grasslands. These endorheic lakes have been drying out during the last one hundred years or so with the water level decrease accelerated in the past few decades. According to historical observations (1935 - 2014), on the one hand precipitation amounts did not significantly change, while on the other hand, air temperature steadily increased. The lake level decrease is most probably caused by a water budget deficit, with evaporation exceeding the precipitation inputs in the long-term. The direct anthropogenic impact (water abstraction) plays a minor role in deterioration of water levels, with most significant impacts through localized land use changes such as road and building construction in the catchments. The future of the park’s sensitive ecosystems in a changing climate is uncertain; therefore, BNNP requires modern ecohydrological monitoring methods and analysis tools to improve our understanding of its <b>hydrological</b> cycle <b>variability,</b> and to enable us to develop adequate adaptation and mitigation measures. ...|$|R

Multisite precipitation and temperature change scenarios for 2011 – 2040 were generated from five ESMs under four representative concentration pathways to project changes in streamflow variability using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Jing River, China. The correlation reconstruction method performed realistically for intersite and intervariable correlation reproduction and hydrological modeling. The SWAT model was found to be well calibrated with monthly streamflow with a model efficiency coefficient of 0. 78. It was projected that the annual mean precipitation would not change, while the mean maximum and minimum temperatures would increase significantly by 1. 6  ±  0. 3 and 1. 3  ±  0. 2  °C; the variance ratios of 2011 – 2040 to 1961 – 2005 were 1. 15  ±  0. 13 for precipitation, 1. 15  ±  0. 14 for mean maximum temperature, and 1. 04  ±  0. 10 for mean minimum temperature. A warmer climate was predicted for the flood season, while the dry season was projected to become wetter and warmer; the findings indicated that the intra-annual and interannual variations in the future climate would be greater than in the current climate. The total annual streamflow was found to change insignificantly but its variance ratios of 2011 – 2040 to 1961 – 2005 increased by 1. 25  ±  0. 55. Streamflow variability was predicted to become greater over most months on the seasonal scale because of the increased monthly maximum streamflow and decreased monthly minimum streamflow.

We analysed populations at site level (29 sampling localities in fluvial sectors) along the longitudinal gradient in the main rivers of the Segura River basin, which is one of the most regulated basins in the Iberian Peninsula. The total of 3265 specimens (1636 A. alburnus, 349 L. gibbosus and 1280 G. lozanoi) caught during autumns was measured in situ for length. We explored nine population size metrics (average, median, maximum, minimum, size range, variance, coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis of Fork Length). Population size metrics significantly differed at site level and at sector level. Sampling sites directly influenced by a potential refuge of the large reservoirs showed a higher variance in the population size structure of A. alburnus and L. gibbosus, but less variance in the G. lozanoi populations. In fact, flow regulation and the presence of fish refuges to higher discharges have been shown as significant factors to explain the variability in several population size metrics. Documented changes in fish size metrics at population levels can demonstrate trends in non-native fishes at basin scale, however, the collinearity with spatial gradients and the species-specific response could make it a difficult undertaking...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that changes in {{catchment}} runoff variability are a function of changes in climate as well as catchment behavior. For proper management of a certain watershed {{it is important to}} have a good understanding of the main causes of variability. Specifically, changes in extreme conditions of water resources are imperative as their consequences are far reaching. This paper attempts to identify the cause of <b>hydrological</b> extremes <b>variability</b> in the upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. A method is proposed to utilize conceptual hydrological models to simulate long term (41 years) hydro-meteorological data and analyse the outputs using the Quantile Perturbation Method (QPM) specially designed for investigation of the temporal variability of extreme values in time series over multi-annual to (multi-) decadal time scales. Two conceptual hydrological models were calibrated and evaluated for their performance to simulate extreme high flows and changes in these flows for corresponding changes in rainfall conditions. The temporal variability results show similar patterns for simulated and observed extreme flows. This indicates the major influence of climate variability in extreme flows as demonstrated by the rainfall input in the models. There is no discernible change in the catchment response, e. g. quick runoff coefficient as a function of soil saturation state, between periods of the 1960 – 1970 s, the 1980 s and the 1990 – 2000 s, which are attributed to land policy changes. This shows the influence of changes in catchment characteristics is minimal. (Multi-) decadal climate variability is identified as the main cause of temporal variation in hydrological extremes of the Blue Nile basin. status: publishe...|$|R

Water storage infrastructure, {{on a range}} of scales, can help to mitigate <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability.</b> This study uses a water balance model to investigate how storage capacity can improve water security in the world's 403 most important river basins, by substituting water from wet months to dry months. We construct a new water balance model for 676 'basin-country units' (BCUs), which simulates runoff, water use (from surface and groundwater), evaporation and trans-boundary discharges. When <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability</b> and net withdrawals are taken into account, along with existing storage capacity, we find risks of water shortages in the Indian subcontinent, Northern China, Spain, the West of the US, Australia and several basins in Africa. Dividing basins into BCUs enabled assessment of upstream dependency in transboundary rivers. Including Environmental Water Requirements into the model, we find that in many basins in India, Northern China, South Africa, the US West Coast, the East of Brazil, Spain and in the Murray basin in Australia human water demand leads to over-abstraction of water resources important to the ecosystem. Then, a Sequent Peak Analysis is conducted to estimate how much storage would be needed to satisfy human water demand whilst not jeopardizing environmental flows. The results are consistent with the water balance model in that basins in India, Northern China, Western Australia, Spain, the US West Coast and several basins in Africa would need more storage to mitigate water supply variability and to meet water demand...|$|E
40|$|Rivers {{provide an}} {{excellent}} system to study interactions between patterns of biodiversity structure and ecological processes. In these environments, gene flow is restricted by the spatial hierarchy and temporal variation of connectivity within the drainage network. In the Australian arid zone, this variability {{is high and}} rivers often exist as isolated waterholes connected during unpredictable floods. These conditions cause boom/bust cycles in the population dynamics of taxa, but their influence on spatial genetic diversity is largely unknown. We used a landscape genetics approach to assess the effect of <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability</b> on gene flow, spatial population structure and genetic diversity in an Australian freshwater fish, Macquaria ambigua. Our analysis is based on microsatellite data of 590 samples from 26 locations across the species range. Despite temporal isolation of populations, the species showed surprisingly high rates of dispersal, with population genetic structure only evident among major drainage basins. Within drainages, <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability</b> was a strong predictor of genetic diversity, being positively correlated with spring-time flow volume. We propose that increases in flow volume during spring stimulate recruitment booms and dispersal, boosting population size and genetic diversity. Although it is uncertain how the hydrological regime in arid Australia may change under future climate scenarios, management strategies for arid-zone fishes should mitigate barriers to dispersal and alterations to the natural flow regime to maintain connectivity and the species’ evolutionary potential. This study contributes {{to our understanding of}} the influence of spatial and temporal heterogeneity on population and landscape processes. 15 page(s...|$|E
30|$|Seasonal {{monsoon climate}} characterises Vaitarna and Ulhas basins {{in the western}} Deccan trap region. Both basins show a {{considerable}} <b>hydrological</b> <b>variability</b> in the drainage network throughout the year. The study area also experienced a rapid erosion in the recent geological period due to the recession of Western Ghat escarpment (Subrahmanya 1987; Widdowson 1997; Kale and Shejwalkar 2007) through the combined processes of climate, tectonics, lithology and slope. These factors {{play a crucial role}} in landscape evolution (Goodbred 2003; Zhang 2005) and leave fingerprints on the drainage network (Das et al. 2018). Assessment of these factors together with drainage network and relief characteristics divulges the hydrological, geomorphic and denudation history of an area.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates and quantifies the {{near-field}} and far-field contamination {{effects from}} Groupe de Recherche en Géodesie Spatiale GRACE products {{to assess whether}} or not they influence the accuracy with which hydrological signals in the Murray-Darling Basin, southeast Australia can be estimated. Far-field contamination was assessed by simulating some of the world’s largest geophysical processes which generate major gravitational signals (e. g. melting of the Greenland icesheet, hydrology in the Amazon Basin) and measuring the proportion of the simulated signal detected in the Murray-Darling Basin. Near-field contamination from the Australian continent (excluding the Murray-Darling Basin) was also assessed. The sum of the near-field and far-field effects revealed a maximum of * 10 mm (equivalent water height) of spurious signal within the Murray-Darling Basin. This equates to only one quarter of the formal uncertainty of the basin-scale estimates of changes in total water storage. Thus, GRACE products can be used to monitor broad-scale <b>hydrological</b> trends and <b>variability</b> in the Murray-Darling Basin without the need to account for contamination from external geophysical sources...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to address}} the role of {{uncertainty}} in climate change impact studies, with particular focus on the impacts of climate change on UK flooding. Methods are developed to quantify the uncertainty associated with climate <b>variability,</b> <b>hydrological</b> model parameters and flood frequency estimation. Each is evaluated independently, before being combined to assess {{the relative importance of}} the different sources of uncertainty in the ‘top down’ impact study framework over multiple time horizons. The uncertainty from climate variability is addressed through the creation of a resampling methodology to be applied to global climate model outputs. Through resampling model precipitation, the direction of change for both mean monthly flows and flood quantiles are found to be uncertain with large possible ranges. Hydrological model parameter uncertainty is quantified using Monte Carlo methods to sample the model parameter space. Through sensitivity experiments, individual hydrological model parameters are shown to influence the magnitude of simulated flood quantile changes. If a larger number of climate scenarios are used, hydrological model parameter uncertainty is small only contributing up to 5...|$|R
40|$|Lake Tana {{sub-basin}} of Abbay (Blue Nile) River Basin {{is located}} in the high land areas with unimodal rainy season with spatial and temporal variation of rainfall and runoff. Depending on available resources, there are many developmental plans and projects which seek the wise planning and management of water resources considering both low flows and floods. The seasonal streamflow variability analysis of the basin was performed with recorded meteorological and hydrological data. The four seasons of the year are considered for seasonality analysis. The rainfall variability is analysed using seasonality and variability measures of coefficient of variation, seasonal relative rainy days and seasonal rainfall intensity. The rainfall variability is more related with latitude and longitude. Spatial and temporal seasonal rainfall variation is analysed from daily rainfall data. Seasonal runoff and streamflow variations are also analysed using HEC-HMS hydrological model to generate runoffs at required and selected points to detect spatial variation. Runoff variation for catchments with gauged stations was analysed from recorded time series streamflow data. Runoff coefficient is taken as a variability index for both generated and recorded streamflows. The runoff coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. The range is high in the dry seasons and less in the wet seasons. The average runoff coefficient value of the basin is 0. 28 ranging from 0. 18 to 0. 36. The average seasonal runoff coefficient value from generated runoffs is 0. 45, 0. 3 for dry and 0. 6 for wet seasons. From the results, it is shown that runoff coefficient is more dependent on antecedent soil wetness condition, land use and land covers. Catchments were categorised spatially and temporally as vulnerable, moderately vulnerable and less vulnerable to runoff based on the analysis. From <b>hydrological</b> data <b>variability</b> tests, it is clearly observed that seasonal time series data are not homogeneous, stationary and independent. Minimum flows are more stationary and homogeneous than mean and maximum flows. No Full Tex...|$|R
