The police kept close to the car to stay within the transmitter's signal range. Only portions of the conversation were recorded because the police were unable to remain within range all the time. While in the car, Cisneros gave Martínez an envelope with US$500. Cisneros then asked Martínez if there was any evidence that she had orchestrated the murder.

[...] However, Nehemiah sued HUD in a federal district court, citing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act.

[...] At about the same time, another provider of seller-funded down-payment assistance (AmeriDream) filed a similar action in a different court.
