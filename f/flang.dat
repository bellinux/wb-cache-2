40|$|Abstract. <b>Flanging</b> is {{a method}} of sheet metal forming process under {{combined}} compressive and tensile conditions using a punch and die to raise closed rims (flanges or collars) on pierced holes. For the <b>flanging</b> product used for the automotive steering part, {{the thickness of the}} bottom radius area is very important because of the crack usually occurred during the using process. But during conventional <b>flanging</b> process, the thickness of the rim and the bottom radius area were decreased seriously and make the hole <b>flanging</b> not strong enough to be used. In order to increase the thickness of bottom radius area of the <b>flanging</b> wall, a new method that combines <b>flanging</b> process and cold forging process was proposed in this paper and a special forming die set was designed with a stripper subjected to counter-pressure with an aim to obtain a more substantial flange. FEM software DEFORM 3 D was employed to simulate these <b>flanging</b> part forming processes. The results showed the thickness of bottom radius area of the <b>flanging</b> wall was increased and a more substantial flange was obtained...|$|R
5|$|Males {{without them}} {{are known as}} unflanged males in {{contrast}} to the more developed <b>flanged</b> males. The transformation from unflanged to <b>flanged</b> can occur very quickly. Unflanged and <b>flanged</b> males have two different mating strategies. <b>Flanged</b> males attract oestrous females with their characteristic long calls. Those calls may also suppress development in younger males. Unflanged males wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one, will force copulation on her. While both strategies are successful, females prefer to mate with <b>flanged</b> males and seek their company for protection against unflanged males. Resident males may form consortships with females that can last days, weeks or months after copulation.|$|R

40|$|<b>Flanged</b> {{sections}} {{are often}} used for long-span concrete beams to maximize their structural efficiency. However, although for the same sectional area a <b>flanged</b> section could render a higher flexural strength, it would also lead to a lower flexural ductility, especially when heavily reinforced. Thus, when evaluating the flexural performance of a beam section, both the flexural strength and ductility need to be considered. In this study, the post-peak flexural behaviour of <b>flanged</b> sections is evaluated {{by means of an}} analytical method that uses the actual stress-strain curves of the materials and takes into account strain reversal of the tension reinforcement. From the numerical results, the flexural strength-ductility performance of <b>flanged</b> sections is investigated by plotting the strength and ductility that could be simultaneously achieved in the form of design graphs. It is found that (1) at the same overall dimensions and with the same amount of reinforcement provided, a <b>flanged</b> section has lower flexural ductility than a rectangular section; (2) at the same overall dimensions, a <b>flanged</b> section has inferior strength-ductility performance compared to a rectangular section; and (3) at the same sectional area, a <b>flanged</b> section has better strength-ductility performance compared to a rectangular section.

40|$|In microforming, {{handling}} and transporting of meso/micro-sized intermediate preforms are difficult {{due to the}} influence of adhesive force on preform surfaces. In this research, the fabrication of meso-scaled bulk cylindrical and <b>flanged</b> parts by directly using sheet metal is investigated. The cylinder is made with a single stroke by shearing, while the <b>flanged</b> part is formed progressively via multi-stage shearing and extrusion. In forming of the <b>flanged</b> part, an intermediate preform is fabricated with sheet metal and a pre-pierced hole for positioning. The final part is blanked out from the sheet metal in the last operation. In such a way, the transporting, positioning and ejecting of the <b>flanged</b> part are facilitated. Furthermore, the characteristics of the developed meso-scaled forming process are extensively investigated. The shearing and fractured surfaces on both the cylindrical and <b>flanged</b> parts are found. The surface grains of the blanked cylinder have undergone severe deformation and been hardened, which increases the flow stress of the blanked cylinder. In addition, the longer cylinder and <b>flanged</b> part are obtained with fine-grained material. This implies that a larger amount of material flow to the lateral side of the workpiece in the case of coarse-grained material. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} effect of flange {{thickness}} on nonlinear behavior of <b>flanged</b> shear walls. Four T shape <b>flanged</b> shear walls are studied and analyzed using finite element method. The total volume of each model is similar, such that when thickness decreases in the model, the length of wing increases. The results indicate that {{in the presence of}} lateral loads, the thickness has a significant effect on the shear absorption, ductility, displacement and crack pattern of the <b>flanged</b> shear walls. Numerical results show that shear walls with thick flanges behave more efficient than walls with thin flanges. For instance, lateral strength resisted by shear walls with thin flanges is 1250 kN which is 14 percent decrease compared with thick <b>flanged</b> wall. Moreover, nonlinear behavior of <b>flanged</b> shear wall with thick flanges shows that strength and ductility are equivalent. Finally, the analyses indicate that while flange is in pressure, the global behavior is much more improved compared with condition which is in tension...|$|R
