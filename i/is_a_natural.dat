5|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are the result}} of hybridization. The Lonicera fly <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> hybrid. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, {{although}} its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence of {{at least one of the}} parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|E
5|$|An eclipse <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> phenomenon. However, in {{some ancient}} and modern cultures, solar eclipses were {{attributed}} to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens.

5|$|American Sign Language (ASL) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{language}} {{that serves as}} the predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada. Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.|$|E

5|$|Ilaiyaraaja's {{first two}} non-film albums were explorations in {{the fusion of}} Indian and Western {{classical}} music. The first, How to Name It? (1986), {{is dedicated to the}} Carnatic master Tyāgarāja and to J. S. Bach. It features a fusion of the Carnatic form and ragas with Bach partitas, fugues and Baroque musical textures. The second, Nothing But Wind (1988), was performed by flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia and a 50-piece orchestra and takes the conceptual approach suggested in the title— that music <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> phenomenon akin to various forms of air currents (e.g., the wind, breeze, tempest etc.).|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{algebraic topology}} and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology groups of the space to the (co)homology groups of the subspaces. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology groups of the whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology groups of the subspaces, and the (co)homology groups of {{the intersection of the}} subspaces.|$|E

A total of 51 {{different species of}} plants were identified to be consumed by the Transbaikalia population, the most common being Stipa capillata and species of Allium. However, in Tuva, only 10 species of plant were identified to be consumed by the population, the most common being Potentilla.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the design of the first castle at Rochester as it has since vanished, and even the exact site is uncertain. It most likely took the form of a motte-and-bailey castle, with a mound and an outer {{enclosure}} defended by a timber palisade and earthen banks. Boley Hill has been suggested as the site of the first castle, an outwork reinforcing the castle's defences, or an abandoned siege castle like those documented in the 1088 siege. Boley Hill <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> outcrop of rock, and could have acted as a motte.|$|E
5|$|Malvern water <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{spring water}} from the Malvern Hills {{on the border of}} the {{counties}} of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in England. The Hills consist of very hard granite and limestone rock. Fissures in the rock retain rain water, which slowly permeates through, escaping at the springs. The springs release an average of about 60 litres a minute and the flow has never been known to cease.|$|E
5|$|Many {{projects}} aim {{to prevent}} or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages.
