25|$|Starvation is {{a severe}} {{deficiency}} in caloric energy intake, {{below the level}} needed to maintain an organism's life. It is the most extreme form of malnutrition. In humans, prolonged starvation can cause permanent organ damage and eventually, death. The term <b>inanition</b> refers to the symptoms and effects of starvation. Starvation may {{also be used as}} a means of torture or execution.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{academic}} analysis of Godwin's work focuses on challenges her characters have as women. According to Contemporary Fiction Writers of the South, a typical protagonist in Godwin's novels is a young woman that [...] "in search of herself, confronts obstacles caused by her family, her lovers, her husband, or her own <b>inanition</b> as she struggles to establish her independence and secure her identity through her work." [...] The main character may be personally flawed, then achieve self-reflection or personal growth thanks to the support of their community or a mentor. Main characters often make poor choices, but become a better person, learn to make better decisions and build stronger bonds often {{as a result of}} intellectual pursuits. According to critic Anne Cheney, the protagonist may be [...] "searching for happiness, academic or artistic achievement, love, respect, or, more generally, meaning in life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, Baldwin's son A. W. Baldwin {{published}} a biography entitled My Father: The True Story. It {{has been written}} that his son [...] "evidently could not decide whether he was answering the charge of <b>inanition</b> and deceit which {{grew out of the}} war, or the radical [...] "dissenters" [...] of the early 1930s who thought the Conservatives were warmongers and denounced them for rearming at all".|$|E
2500|$|Later in his life, GÃ¶del {{suffered}} {{periods of}} mental instability and illness. He had an obsessive {{fear of being}} poisoned; he would eat only food that his wife, Adele, prepared for him. Late in 1977, she was hospitalized {{for six months and}} could no longer prepare her husband's food. In her absence, he refused to eat, eventually starving to death. He weighed [...] when he died. His death certificate reported that he died of [...] "malnutrition and <b>inanition</b> caused by personality disturbance" [...] in Princeton Hospital on January 14, 1978. He was buried in Princeton Cemetery. Adele's death followed in 1981.|$|E
60|$|He seemed frozen into <b>inanition.</b> His {{face was}} like the cast of a dead man's. His voice was cold and hopeless.|$|E
60|$|And in {{this state}} of utter dejection, <b>inanition,</b> and collapse, with Blink asleep on his feet, he was driven back to Hampstead.|$|E
60|$|He {{was half}} dead with <b>inanition,</b> and was {{conveyed}} speechless and helpless {{to his home}} in the Rue de Grammont, there, presumably, to be nursed back to health by Madame his wife.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I guess, from a {{previous}} acquaintance with the party's character, that it's really all you, Marcia. I don't blame you. Miss Kingsbury's hospitality has left me as hollow as if I'd had nothing to eat for a week; and I know you're perishing from <b>inanition.</b> Hence these tears." ...|$|E
6000|$|The decayed and drowsy {{voice of}} the loafer, the {{agreeable}} stink of beer-dregs, threw a spell of <b>inanition</b> over Babbitt. The bartender moved grimly toward the crowd of two men. Babbitt followed him as delicately as a cat, and wheedled, [...] "Say, Oscar, I {{want to speak to}} Mr. Hanson." ...|$|E
6000|$|The little Leila, {{with her}} orient eyes, [...] And taciturn Asiatic {{disposition}} [...] (Which saw all western things with small surprise, [...] To {{the surprise of}} people of condition, [...] Who think that novelties are butterflies [...] To be pursued as food for <b>inanition),</b> [...] Her charming figure and romantic history [...] Became a kind of fashionable mystery.|$|E
6000|$|The {{condition}} of England {{one of the}} most ominous ever seen in this world: Full of wealth in every kind, yet dying of <b>inanition.</b> Workhouses, in which no work can be done. Destitution in Scotland. Stockport Assizes. (p. 3.)--England's unprofitable success: Human faces glooming discordantly on one another. Midas longed for gold, and the gods gave it him. (7.) ...|$|E
60|$|Abner Power {{walked back}} to the castle at a slow and equal pace, as though he carried an over-brimming vessel on his head. He silently let himself in, entered the long gallery, and sat down. The length of time that he sat there was so {{remarkable}} as to raise that interval of <b>inanition</b> to the rank of a feat.|$|E
60|$|The {{voice was}} masculine, but the logic was feminine. In cases of great prostration with mental debility, in the hopeless vacuity that precedes death by <b>inanition</b> or starvation, it is {{sometimes}} very effective. They all assented to it, and, by a singular intellectual harmony, the expression of each was the same. It was simply an awful curse.|$|E
60|$|Now in {{all this}} matter, I ask you, Sir, who ran the {{greatest}} risk? Why, I--Hector Ratichon, of course--Hector Ratichon, in whose apartment M. de Firmin-Latour was discovered in a position bordering on absolute <b>inanition.</b> And the proof of this is, that that selfsame night I was arrested at my lodgings at Passy, and charged with robbery and attempted murder.|$|E
60|$|The bishop's first idea was, that Mr Harding, if left to himself, would {{certainly}} starve,--not in the figurative {{sense in which}} {{so many of our}} ladies and gentlemen do starve on incomes from one to five hundred a year; not that he would be starved as regarded dress coats, port wine, and pocket-money; but that he would positively perish of <b>inanition</b> for want of bread.|$|E
60|$|She waited, {{every moment}} of the day, for his next kiss. She {{admitted}} it to herself in shame and bliss. Almost consciously, she waited. He waited, but, until the time came, more unconsciously. When the time came that he should kiss her again, a prevention was an annihilation to him. He felt his flesh go grey, he was heavy with a corpse-like <b>inanition,</b> he did not exist, if the time passed unfulfilled.|$|E
6000|$|... --In {{pursuing}} these speculations, {{said the}} dean conclusively, there is, however, {{the danger of}} perishing of <b>inanition.</b> First you must take your degree. Set that before you as your first aim. Then, little by little, you will see your way. I mean in every sense, your way in life and in thinking. It may be uphill pedalling at first. Take Mr Moonan. He {{was a long time}} before he got to the top. But he got there.|$|E
6000|$|... "That, I dare say, {{was not a}} part of his reckoning. He thought, no doubt, that Mrs. Chapman or {{the servant}} would {{discover}} and rescue him pretty soon. He meant to appear just a little faint, and endured quietly the first twenty-four hours of <b>inanition.</b> But the excitement and want of food told on him more than he expected. After twenty-four hours he turned very giddy and sick, and, falling from one fainting fit into another, was unable to give the alarm.|$|E
60|$|Then one day {{our last}} franc went {{and we had}} nothing left. Mme. la Marquise had not touched food for two days. I had stood {{at the corner of}} the street, begging all the day until I was driven off by the gendarmes. I had only {{obtained}} three sous from the passers-by. I bought some milk and took it home for M. le Vicomte. The following morning when I entered the larger attic I found that Mme. la Marquise had fainted from <b>inanition.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Everything {{was there}} before them and around them, {{everything}} massive and shining, {{so that he}} had instinctively fallen {{back in his chair}} as for the wondering, the resigned acceptance of it; where her last words stirred in him a sense of odd deprecation. Only for [...] "that"? [...] "That" [...] was everything, at this moment, to his long <b>inanition,</b> and the effect, as if she had suddenly and perversely mocked him, was to press the spring of a protest. [...] "Isn't 'this' then riches?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Case is plain, the Devil, tho' he {{knew him}} to be the Son of GOD, did not fully know the Mystery of the Incarnation; nor did he know how far the <b>Inanition</b> of Christ extended, and whether, as Man, he was not subject to fall as Adam was, tho' his reserv'd Godhead might be still immaculate and pure; and upon this Foot, as he would leave no Method untried, he {{attempts}} him three Times, one immediately after another; but then, finding himself disappointed he fled.|$|E
60|$|Austrian affairs are not now {{in their}} nadir-point; a long while now since they passed that. Austria, to all {{appearance}} dead, started up, and began to strike for herself, with some success, the instant Walpole's SOUP-ROYAL (that first 200,000 pounds, followed since by abundance more) got to her lips. Touched her poor pale lips; and went tingling through her, like life and fiery elasticity, out of death by <b>inanition!</b> Cardinal moment, which History knows, but can never date, except vaguely, some time in 1741; among the last acts of judicious Walpole.|$|E
60|$|Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain {{texts of}} Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a {{protracted}} reading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By {{the time that}} exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat! I was now nearly sick from <b>inanition,</b> having taken so little the day before.|$|E
60|$|On {{the third}} day of Madame Beaumont's {{residence}} in the hotel a young man entered and registered himself as a guest. His clothing--to speak of his points in approved order--was quietly in the mode; his features good and regular; his expression that of a poised and sophisticated man of the world. He informed the clerk that he would remain three or four days, inquired concerning the sailing of European steamships, and sank into the blissful <b>inanition</b> of the nonpareil hotel with the contented air of a traveller in his favorite inn.|$|E
60|$|But this {{is merely}} {{to explain why}} Bud Oakley and I gladly {{stretched}} ourselves {{on the bank of}} the nearby charco after the dipping, glad for the welcome <b>inanition</b> and pure contact with the earth after our muscle-racking labours. The flock was a small one, and we finished at three in the afternoon; so Bud brought from the morral on his saddle horn, coffee and a coffeepot and a big hunk of bread and some side bacon. Mr. Mills, the ranch owner and my old friend, rode away to the ranch with his force of Mexican trabajadores.|$|E
60|$|The {{phases of}} Boldwood's life were {{ordinary}} enough, but his {{was not an}} ordinary nature. That stillness, which struck casual observers {{more than anything else}} in his character and habit, and seemed so precisely like the rest of <b>inanition,</b> may have been the perfect balance of enormous antagonistic forces--positives and negatives in fine adjustment. His equilibrium disturbed, he was in extremity at once. If an emotion possessed him at all, it ruled him; a feeling not mastering him was entirely latent. Stagnant or rapid, it was never slow. He was always hit mortally, or he was missed.|$|E
60|$|The {{sketch of}} its contents, {{given in the}} {{correspondence}} with Horne, will make the modern reader accept with equanimity {{the fact that it}} never progressed beyond the initial stage of drafting the plot. It is allegorical, philosophical, fantastic, unreal--everything which was calculated to bring out the worst characteristics of Miss Barrett's style and to intensify her faults. Fortunately her removal from Torquay to London interrupted the execution of the scheme. It was never seriously taken up again, and, though never explicitly abandoned, died a natural death from <b>inanition,</b> somewhat to the relief of Miss Barrett, who had come to recognise its impracticability.|$|E
6000|$|But {{her coming}} to was slow--very, very slow. Her pulse was still weak. Her heart pumped feebly. We feared she might sink from <b>inanition</b> at any moment. Hilda Wade {{knelt on the}} floor by the girl's side and held a spoonful of beef essence coaxingly to her lips. Number Fourteen gasped, drew a long, slow breath, then gulped and {{swallowed}} it. After that she lay back with her mouth open, looking like a corpse. Hilda pressed another spoonful of the soft jelly upon her; but the girl waved it away with one trembling hand. [...] "Let me die," [...] she cried. [...] "Let me die! I feel dead already." ...|$|E
6000|$|England, full of wealth, yet {{dying of}} <b>inanition,</b> 3; [...] the {{guidance}} of, not wise enough, 34, 335; [...] England {{of the year}} '1200,' 57, 62, 79, 139, 303; [...] disappearance of our English Forests, 122; [...] this England, the practical summary of English Heroism, 165; [...] now nearly eaten up by puffery and unfaithfulness, 180; [...] real Hell of the English, 182; [...] of all Nations, the stupidest in speech, the wisest in action, 197, 211; [...] unspoken sadness, 200; [...] conservatism, 203; [...] Berserkir rage, 205; [...] a Future, wide as the world, if we have heart and heroism for it, 330.|$|E
6000|$|Rosamond talked. She {{always had}} a certain embarrassment in tete-a- tetes with Cecil, and it took form in a flow of words. [...] "Poor Terry! he turned faint and giddy at breakfast. I thought he had been indulging at the refreshment-stall, {{but he says he}} was saving for a fine copy of the Faerie Queen that Friskyball told him of at a book- stall at Backsworth, and existed all day on {{draughts}} of water when his throat grew dry as showman; so I suppose it is only <b>inanition,</b> coupled with excitement and stuffiness, and that quiet will repair him. He would not hear of my staying with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was removed}} from the hotel to the Boscastle surgery, and from the surgery, after some weeks, to London. But he still {{resisted}} every attempt at reanimation. After a time, for reasons that will appear later, these attempts were discontinued. For a great space he lay in that strange condition, inert and still neither dead nor living but, as it were, suspended, hanging midway between nothingness and existence. His was a darkness unbroken by a ray of thought or sensation, a dreamless <b>inanition,</b> a vast space of peace. The tumult of his mind had swelled and risen to an abrupt climax of silence. Where was the man? Where is any man when insensibility takes hold of him? ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{friend had}} no breakfast himself, {{for it was}} one of his peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food, and I have known him presume upon his iron {{strength}} until he has fainted from pure <b>inanition.</b> [...] "At present I cannot spare energy and nerve force for digestion," [...] he would say in answer to my medical remonstrances. I was not surprised, therefore, when this morning he left his untouched meal behind him, and started with me for Norwood. A crowd of morbid sightseers were still gathered round Deep Dene House, which was just such a suburban villa as I had pictured. Within the gates Lestrade met us, his face flushed with victory, his manner grossly triumphant.|$|E
60|$|At last, to Ernest's intense joy, {{the season}} {{began to show}} premonitory {{symptoms}} of collapsing from <b>inanition.</b> The twelfth of August was drawing nigh, and the coming-of-age of grouse, that most important of annual events in the orthodox British social calendar, would soon set free Lord Exmoor and his brother hereditary legislators from their arduous duty of acting as constitutional drag on the general advance of a great, tolerant, and easy-going nation. Soon the family would be off again to Dunbude, or away to its other moors in Scotland; and among the rocks and the heather Ernest felt he could endure Lord Exmoor and Lord Lynmouth a little more resignedly than among the reiterated polite platitudes and monotonous gaieties of the vacuous London drawing-rooms.|$|E
60|$|Whilst he is thus {{employed}} {{according to}} his policy and to his taste, he has not leisure to inquire into those abuses in India that are drawing off money by millions from the treasures of this country, which are exhausting the vital juices {{from members of the}} state, where the public <b>inanition</b> is far more sorely felt than in the local exchequer of England. Not content with winking at these abuses, whilst he attempts to squeeze the laborious, ill-paid drudges of English revenue, he lavishes, in one act of corrupt prodigality, upon those who never served the public in any honest occupation at all, an annual income equal to two thirds of the whole collection of the revenues of this kingdom.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{hard work}} to control the {{workings}} of inclination and turn the bent of nature; but {{that it may be}} done, I know from experience. God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from <b>inanition,</b> nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.|$|E
6000|$|On {{our return}} to town we {{determined}} to spend three days there {{together and then}} proceed to our errand. We were as conscious one as the other of that deeper mystic appeal made by London to those superstitious pilgrims who feel it the mother-city of their race, the distributing heart of their traditional life. Certain characteristics of the dusky Babylon, certain aspects, phases, features, [...] "say" [...] more to the American spiritual ear {{than anything else in}} Europe. The influence of these things on Searle it charmed me to note. His observation I soon saw to be, as I pronounced it to him, searching and caressing. His almost morbid appetite for any over-scoring of time, well-nigh extinct from long <b>inanition,</b> threw the flush of its revival into his face and his talk.|$|E
