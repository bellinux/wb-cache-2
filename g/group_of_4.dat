25|$|Salaam India is {{the story}} of cricket. It {{revolves}} around a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>4</b> boys and their passion for the game. The boys come from humble backgrounds and limited resources but what they have is a zeal for the game of cricket and undeniable natural talent. They study in the local corporation school where the most important sport on agenda is wrestling…. Taught by Wrestling Guru Surinder Huda- a man driven by hatred for cricket because in his eyes it is cricket that is responsible for destroying traditional sports like Kushti, Kabbadi, and Hockey etc.|$|E

2500|$|A quarto (from Latin quartō, {{ablative}} form of quartus, fourth [...] ) {{is a book}} or pamphlet made up {{of one or more}} full {{sheets of}} paper on which 8 pages of text were printed, which were then folded two times to produce four leaves. Each leaf of a quarto book thus represents one fourth the size of the original sheet. Each <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>4</b> leaves (called a [...] "gathering" [...] or [...] "quire") could be sewn through the central fold to attach it to the other gatherings to form a book. Sometimes, additional leaves would be inserted within another group to form, for example gatherings of 8 leaves, which similarly would be sewn through the central fold. Generally, quartos have more squarish proportions than folios or octavos.|$|E
2500|$|The Sudanese Möbius {{band in the}} three-sphere S3 is geometrically a {{fibre bundle}} over a great circle, whose fibres are great semicircles. [...] The most {{symmetrical}} image of a stereographic projection of this band into R3 is obtained by using a projection point that lies on that great circle {{that runs through the}} midpoint of each of the semicircles. Each choice of such a projection point results in an image that is congruent to any other. But because such a projection point lies on the Möbius band itself, two aspects of the image are significantly different from the case (illustrated above) where the point is not on the band: 1) the image in R3 is not the full Möbius band, but rather the band with one point removed (from its centerline); and 2) the image is unbounded – and as it gets increasingly far from the origin of R3, it increasingly approximates a plane. [...] Yet this version of the stereographic image has a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>4</b> symmetries in R3 (it is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group), as compared with the bounded version illustrated above having its group of symmetries the unique group of order 2. (If all symmetries and not just orientation-preserving isometries of R3 are allowed, the numbers of symmetries in each case doubles.) ...|$|E
