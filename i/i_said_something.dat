500|$|The final {{song on the}} record, [...] "Whipping Post," [...] {{was written}} shortly after Allman {{returned}} to Jacksonville. The song came to him shortly before bed, but {{he was unable to}} acquire a pencil and paper to write down his ideas, as there was a child asleep in the room and he could not turn on the lights. Turning to his next best alternative, he struck two kitchen matches (one for light and one, later blown out, as a charcoal writing utensil) and wrote down his lyrics on a bedside ironing board. [...] "Whipping Post" [...] was similar in composition to [...] "Dreams" [...] in its first incarnation, with Oakley later creating the heavy bassline that starts off the track. Duane and Betts take quick solos before the track builds to an [...] "anguished climax," [...] leading to Gregg Allman's solo voice, singing the song's refrain: [...] "Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'." [...] Allman had no idea the intro was written in 11/4 time — [...] "I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with" [...] — until his brother pointed it out for him. [...] "My brother told me — I guess the day I wrote it — he said, 'That's good, man. I didn’t know you understood 11/4.' Of course <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> intelligent like, 'What's 11/4?' Duane just said, 'Okay, dumbass, I'll try to draw it up on paper for you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the project}} {{proceeded}} there was increasing tension between Richard Thompson and Rafferty. Thompson preferred a spontaneous approach to recording and found Rafferty's time-consuming and perfectionist approach hard to cope with. He also felt increasingly frozen {{out of the}} project: [...] "When {{he got to the}} mixing, I just didn’t bother to turn up [...] [...] [...] because if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> it was totally ignored and I thought 'hey, whose record is this anyway?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hillary Clinton {{described}} the remarks as [...] "elitist, out of touch, and frankly patronizing." [...] Noting {{he had not}} chosen his words well, Obama subsequently explained his remarks, [...] "Lately {{there has been a}} little typical sort of political flare-up, because <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> that everybody knows is true, which {{is that there are a}} whole bunch of folks in small towns in Pennsylvania, in towns right here in Indiana, in my hometown in Illinois, who are bitter." [...] Obama had addressed similar themes in a 2004 interview with Charlie Rose, and his strategists countered that Bill Clinton had made similar comments in 1991.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! Alfred, then. I am glad it's no worse. I {{was afraid}} <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>{{something}}</b> shocking. <b>I</b> am always saying something wrong to ma.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that I {{hope will}} never be. When I wrote {{to you from}} Liverpool <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> had <b>something</b> {{particular}} to tell you. You've never asked me what it is. Is it because you've suspected?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He doesn't look a good life,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'but {{perhaps he}} can be patched up.' Miss Sichliffe turned crimson; I saw Mrs. Godfrey {{exchange}} a glance with her married daughter, and knew <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> which {{would have to be}} lived down.|$|R
2500|$|Ullman {{became an}} American citizen in December 2006 and holds dual {{citizenship}} in the United States and the United Kingdom. The {{results of the}} 2004 United States presidential election, and a comment made by actor Tom Hanks, prompted her desire to naturalise. “Tom Hanks was standing in a corridor at a party and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something,</b> {{and he was just}} very nice and he went, ‘Oh, yeah. I know that but you’re British. You know, you don’t {{have to put up with}} that stuff ... I went, ‘No. Actually I’ve been here a long time.‘ I thought, that’s it. I’m going to join in. So I took the [...] test.” In 2006, she topped the list for the [...] "Wealthiest British Comedians," [...] with an estimated wealth of £75 million. In 2015, Ullman's wealth was estimated to be £77 million, making her the wealthiest British actress and female comedian. In 2017, The Sunday Times increased it to £80 million.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{like this}} to my friend; and he {{answered}} with sardonic truth, [...] "Ah, you wait till {{we come to a}} telegraph post." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something,</b> I {{know not}} what, {{as the light}} began to dawn on me. And then I added, [...] "I had not thought about the General." ...|$|E
6000|$|I had a {{momentary}} suspicion that <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> stupid. Her smile amongst {{many other things}} seemed to have meant that, too. And I answered it with a certain resignation: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you mean, Colonel," [...] said his wife. [...] "I offered Caroline a basket of magnum bonums for preserving, and one would think <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> very extraordinary." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{believe he}} <b>said</b> <b>something</b> else, but <b>I</b> never heard it. I was already fast asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was staggered; I {{could see}} that. But he was sly enough {{at the same}} time to hold his tongue and wait till <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> more.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>{{something}}</b> {{about my}} not being hurt, {{and then something}} more, urging him to run back and try if he might not yet recover the fish.|$|E
60|$|At Queenstown {{one of my}} new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, {{and when}} <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about the Lakes of Killarney, he sighed, and sung, {{with a look at}} me...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am," [...] she said, [...] "the most luckless of beings. <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>something,</b> <b>I</b> {{know not}} what, to {{distress}} you, Margaret--Mystery {{is a bad}} thing, and betwixt us there should be none." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, I don't know. <b>I</b> just <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{about her}} {{behaving}} peevishly. With that Italian blood of hers, there's no knowing how she may take what one says. She's a fierce little thing, though she seems so quiet generally.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{this the}} Countess shrank back from {{me as if}} <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> very shocking. 'Do I {{understand}} Colonel Altamont aright?' says she: 'and that a British officer refuses to meet any person who provokes him {{to the field of}} honour?' ...|$|R
60|$|THE STATUE. Ha ha! Do you {{remember}} how I frightened you when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> like that to you from my pedestal in Seville? It sounds rather flat without my trombones.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, don't be foolish," [...] I {{heard her}} reply, {{and this time}} the {{telephone}} did not completely disguise the note for which I strained. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> more, but the circuit was closed....|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, near {{a village}} called Crumville. They say <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about {{a bad man}} who wouldn't buy some candy for me. It may be that that man put me off the train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The explosion! The strike!" [...] she exclaimed; {{suddenly}} enlightened. [...] "Now <b>I</b> remember! You <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about Hampton being nitro-glycerine--human nitro-glycerine. You predicted this strike." ...|$|R
6000|$|That <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something,</b> {{in the act}} of waking, I felt sure: the hoarse stifled cry {{was still}} ringing in my ears, even if the startled look of my fellow-traveler had not been {{evidence}} enough: but what could I possibly say by way of apology? ...|$|R
60|$|From hence {{in my way}} to {{the seaside}} I came to New Forest, of which <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> already with {{relation}} to the great extent of ground which lies waste, and in which there is so great a quantity of large timber, as I have spoken of already.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>{{something}}</b> I {{ought not}} to have done. I ought to have waited for her, {{but it was something}} that had been tearing at me ever since last night, and I couldn't bear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> of {{the room}} being ready but Arthur said very low [...] "He is dying--internal bleeding;" [...] and when Jaquetta asked [...] "Can nothing be done?" [...] he answered, [...] "Nothing but to leave him still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's bothered {{out of his}} life,--as a hen {{would be}} if you were to throw her into water. He's so shy, he hardly knows how to speak to you; and he broke down {{altogether}} when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about the Lords." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> fancy Melville <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about {{carrying}} the thing too far. He doesn't {{remember what he}} did say. I don't think he even knew at the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our friend," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "knows <b>something</b> {{of every}} ship. He {{seems to have}} gone about the seas prying into things considerably." ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{might have}} fancied Saul {{was eager to}} be praised for his early rising, and <b>I</b> might have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{calculated}} to irritate him, but that Pierre cried with a laugh: ...|$|R
6000|$|I think <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> feeble about [...] "Harold, {{how could}} you?" [...] but he first shook his head, and led off the pony to the stable, observing, [...] "I'll come {{for you in}} an hour," [...] and Dora rushing after him.|$|E
6000|$|... "His father?" [...] he said, {{lifting his}} eyebrows. [...] "No. Oh! I remember, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{to that effect}} the other night, {{but it was a}} mistake. I mixed up two names, as one often does after a lapse of many years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, you see, Mrs. McKeon;--I {{am afraid}} <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> rude which set Miss Louey's back up, but I am sure {{in her heart}} she'd be glad of {{anything}} that would be of service to Feemy. Come, Mrs. McKeon, will you drive over to Ballycloran this fine morning, and ask her?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{would have}} <b>said</b> <b>something</b> friendly, but remembered {{in time that}} if the child fell ill {{afterwards}} I should be credited with the Evil Eye, {{and that is a}} horrible possession.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes, <b>I</b> know,' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> with <b>something</b> like despair in my heart, but bowing my head {{before the}} faith that was in her, before that great and saving {{illusion}} that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness, in the triumphant darkness from which I could not have defended her--from which I could not even defend myself.|$|R
60|$|He pants for breath. I {{perceive}} {{that in our}} discussion of his case I must have gone too far, {{and that he has}} rebelled. Clearly <b>I</b> must have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> wounding about that ineffectual love story of his.|$|R
