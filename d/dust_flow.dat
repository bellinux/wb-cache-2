The dust interaction with space suits and other equipment is a major concern for long term space missions. Dust on the moon greatly deteriorated the space suits in NASA’s Apollo program. We have developed a test enclosure for the study of dust motion. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center has developed a Particle Image Velocimeter (PIV) to measure the velocity and size of thousands of moving particles. The PIV was developed as a demonstration project for use on possible future NASA missions to Mars, the moon, or even asteroids. A controllable and stable simulation environment accommodating this PIV device was needed to collect data on the PIV performance. The “Dust Box” is designed to contain the PIV, provide the ability to collect stable and accurate data, and have flexibility to run many different experimental configurations.
