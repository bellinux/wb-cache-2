5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake</b> she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E

Though the {{production}} is largely shambolic, she catches {{the eye of}} an amorous Italian director who begins showering her with attention, praise, and vague promises {{right in front of}} jealous Baron. Unbeknownst to her, Filip has also followed her down to Vrnjačka Banja {{in a desperate attempt to}} get her back, so three of her suitors are now fighting over her. Intrigued by the Italian, she runs off with him leaving two jilted lovers <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yorktown {{emerged from}} the {{shipyard}} in January 1961 and returned to Long Beach on 27 January. She conducted refresher training and then resumed normal west coast operations until late July. On 29 July, the aircraft carrier stood out of Long Beach, bound once again for the Orient. She made an extended stopover in the Hawaiian Islands in August and, consequently, did not arrive in Yokosuka until 4 September. That {{tour of duty in}} the Far East consisted of a normal schedule of anti-air and antisubmarine warfare exercises as well as the usual round of port visits. She concluded the deployment at Long Beach on 2 March 1962. Normal west coast operations occupied her time through the summer and into the fall. On 26 October 1962, the warship left Long Beach <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake</b> and set a course for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, then on to Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines in the Far East. During that deployment, she served as flagship for Carrier Division 19. She participated in several ASW and AAW exercises, including the SEATO ASW exercise, Operation Sea Serpent. The deployment lasted until 6 June 1963, at which time the carrier set a course back to Long Beach.|$|E

500|$|Dunn {{then moved}} {{onto the scene}} during the funeral, when the child trembled from seeing her mother's lips sewn shut. Described by her {{as one of the}} most troubling shots in {{mainstream}} music videos, the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother lying <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake.</b> The singer recalled in a 1991 interview with Vanity Fair, that she remembered that her mother's lips looked funny in the funeral. When she got closer, she saw that Madonna Sr's lips had been sewn together. This image of her mother had haunted Madonna for many years, and led her to comment that she never could resolve her Electra complex. The singer further explained: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} of the song was Madonna's attempt to embrace and accept her mother's death. Directed by David Fincher and shot in black-and-white, it shows a little girl playing in the snow, as her mother dies. A grown-up Madonna follows the child and sings the song, as the child runs away from her abusive father. Described by reviewers as [...] "autobiographical", the video was listed by Rolling Stone as one of [...] "The 100 Top Music Videos". Scholars noted how Madonna's persona was split into the child and adult in the video, and one writer {{described}} a scene involving the dead mother shown <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake,</b> with her lips sewn shut, {{as one of the}} most disturbing scenes in the history of mainstream music videos—the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother from her funeral. [...] "Oh Father" [...] was performed only on the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, where Madonna portrayed a woman trying to find her religion and her battle for it.|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{was hired}} by the United States Bureau of the Mint as a Class D {{temporary}} clerk in 1904, when she was 38 years old, older than most new employees. She served in the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Bureau of the Mint, where Mint Director George E. Roberts was impressed by her business experience and competence. [...] Initially having only temporary status, she was made a permanent employee in 1905, and was promoted again that year to Clerk Class I at a salary of $1,200. When Margaret Kelly was commissioned Examiner of the Bureau of the Mint in 1911, the ripple of promotions <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake</b> included O'Reilly, who became adjuster of accounts. [...] This made her in effect the chief clerk of the Mint Bureau, with responsibility for reviewing all contracts. According to Teva J. Scheer, biographer of Nellie Tayloe Ross (O'Reilly's final Mint Director before retirement) [...] "it must have required an almost unprecedented combination of drive and intelligence for [...] to have climbed so far up through the organization in her male-dominated work environment".|$|E

500|$|By 1918, the Allies had {{strengthened}} their blockade on the Strait of Otranto. As a result, it {{was becoming}} more difficult for German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats {{to get through the}} strait and into the Mediterranean. In response to these new measures at blockading the straits, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with battleships, scout cruisers, and destroyers. During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola with Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen. At about 11:00pm on 9 June 1918 Szent István and Tegetthoff, escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, departed Pola, after some troubles getting the harbour defense barrage opened. They were en route to the harbour at Slano, north of Dubrovnik (Ragusa) to rendezvous with Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen, for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. At about 3:15am on 10 June, two Italian MAS boats, MAS 15 and MAS 21, spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast. The MAS platoon was commanded by Capitano di corvetta Luigi Rizzo, who had sunk the Austro-Hungarian coastal defense ship [...] in Trieste six months before. The individual boats were commanded by Capo timoniere Armando Gori and Guardiamarina di complemento Giuseppe Aonzo respectively. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts. MAS 21 attacked Tegetthoff, but her torpedoes failed to hit the ship. MAS 15 fired her two torpedoes successfully at 3:25am at Szent István. Both boats evaded any pursuit although MAS 15 had to discourage the Austro-Hungarian torpedo boat Tb 76 T by dropping depth charges <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake.</b> Tegetthoff thought that the torpedoes were fired by submarines and pulled out of the formation and started to zigzag to throw off any further attacks. She repeatedly fired on suspected submarine periscopes until she rejoined her half-sister at 4:45.|$|E
500|$|Cannibal {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics upon its release. The album holds a score 73 out of 100 based on 11 critical reviews, {{according to the}} music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic was positive in the review of Cannibal. Erlewine was somewhat critical of the choice to release the EP noting that the only real reason for the release was that Animal had been [...] "squeezed dry of hits". Although critical of the re-release, Thomas' consensus of the album was positive, writing: [...] "aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal’s brevity trumping the scattershot Animal -- but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice. She’s all ravenous id, spitting at strangers and backstabbing friends, humiliating hotties, and laughing at the wreckage <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake.</b> She is who she is and she offers no apologies." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Kesha's writing of the album noting that her [...] "herky-jerky rhymes still sound like {{they came from the}} bathroom wall of a reform-school kindergarten", not citing that as a negative but instead noting that the album had a [...] "sulfurous end-of-days whiff about it". Greenblatt ended her review of the album giving it a rating of [...] "B+" [...] and called [...] "Sleazy" [...] and [...] "Blow" [...] the standout tracks on the album. Will Hermes from Rolling Stone noted that Kesha's main pop competitor was Lady Gaga writing, [...] "This EP proves Kesha would kick Gaga's ass in a freestyle battle" [...] praising her rhyming and production by Dr. Luke calling Kesha the [...] "snap queen of clubland." [...] Chad Grischow from IGN met the album with a positive review, giving the album a score of 6.5 out of 10. Grischow was critical of the production of the album and overuse of Auto-Tune writing that there was [...] "so much overdubbing and autotune used that most of the songs may as well be sung by a spunky robot". He also noted that when Kesha's vocals were stripped down she could actually sing, highlighting the ballads [...] "The Harold Song" [...] and [...] "C U Next Tuesday" [...] in the album's review. Grischow ended his review writing, [...] "Cannibal proves to be too mired in mindless lyrics and excessive vocal effects to have any lasting appeal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Houston was {{considered}} by many to be a [...] "singer's singer", who had an influence on countless other vocalists, both female and male. Similarly, Steve Huey from Allmusic wrote that the shadow of Houston's prodigious technique still looms large over nearly every pop diva and smooth urban soul singer– male or female– <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake,</b> and spawned a legion of imitators. Rolling Stone, on her biography, stated that Houston [...] "redefined the image of a female soul icon and inspired singers ranging from Mariah Carey to Rihanna". Essence ranked Houston sixth on their list of 50 Most Influential R Stars of all time, calling her [...] "the diva to end all divas".|$|E

2500|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle {{advanced}} theories {{involving a}} female murderer dubbed [...] "Jill the Ripper". Supporters of this theory {{believe that the}} murderer worked, or posed, as a midwife, who could be seen with bloody clothes without attracting suspicion and would be more easily trusted by the victims than a man. Women proposed as the Ripper include the convicted murderers Mary Pearcey and Constance Kent, and Theosophist Helena Blavatsky. The 19 December 1893 edition of the Ohio Marion Daily Star reported that Lizzie Halliday, a mentally ill Irish immigrant suspected of leaving a string of dead husbands <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake</b> before being arrested in upper New York State {{for the murder of}} two women and her last husband, was likewise accused of the Whitechapel murders, of which she spoke [...] "constantly".

A change in plans delayed their return for two years. Their route back to Japan was blocked by the Enewetak Proving Ground, a [...] area of the Pacific declared off-limits to Americans by the U.S. government, which was using the area to test nuclear weapons during Operation Hardtack I. A smaller yacht, the [...] Golden Rule, was docked near the Phoenix at the time. Its crew of Quaker pacifists, Albert Bigelow, George Willoughby, William R. Huntington, James Peck and Orion Sherwood had attempted to sail into this forbidden zone to protest nuclear testing and had been brought back by the U.S. Coast Guard.

She suffered heavy damage, receiving some 26 hits from 5-, 6-, 8- and 14-inch shells. However, with attention focused on South Dakota, Washington was able to maneuver undetected. Closing range from [...] to about [...] from Kirishima, she opened fire. In the span of seven minutes, the Japanese ship was struck by at least nine 16-inch and around forty 5-inch shells, destroying her ability to steer and setting her on fire. Now realizing Washingtons position, some of the Japanese destroyers gave chase and fired torpedoes, forcing Washington to evade (several detonated <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake),</b> but they soon withdrew under the cover of a smoke screen. Washington found South Dakota later in the morning, and the two set course for Nouméa.|$|E

2500|$|Helena {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for the revival of Greek influence in Cyprus due to the numerous members of the Byzantine court who arrived <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>wake</b> and were given positions at the Lusignan court. This led to a renewal of ties with the Byzantine Empire. After the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, she welcomed and gave assistance to many Byzantine refugees who had fled to Cyprus. She was described as having been [...] "stronger in character than her husband". She took charge of the kingdom, and her policies in favour of the Orthodox faith and Greek culture enraged the Franks who looked upon her as a dangerous enemy; however she had become far too powerful for them to attack. Pope Pius II also condemned her for supporting the Orthodox Church, and her endowment of 15,000 ducats per annum to the monastery of Saint George of Mangana also drew much criticism as it was considered to have been [...] "extravagant generosity in impoverished times". The Greek Cypriots, on the other hand, had always revered Helena as a great heroine due to her bold, decisive character in looking after their interests.|$|E
