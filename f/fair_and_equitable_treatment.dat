500|$|As the Cold War heated up, {{tensions}} {{developed between}} the Church in Indonesia and the Indonesian Communist Party ( [...] , or PKI). Soegijapranata {{believed that the}} PKI was making progress with the poor through its promises of workers' rights in a communist-led union. To combat this, he worked with other Catholics to establish labour groups, open to both Catholics and non-Catholics. He hoped that these would empower workers and thus limit the PKI's influence. One such labour group was Buruh Pancasila, which was formed on 19June 1954; through the organisation Soegijapranata helped promote the state philosophy of Pancasila, literally [...] "the five tenets". The following year the Church Representatives Conference of Indonesia ( [...] , or KWI), recognising Soegijapranata's devotion to the poor, put him in charge of establishing social-support programmes throughout the archipelago. On 2November 1955, he and several other bishops issued a decree denouncing communism, Marxism, and materialism, and asking the government to ensure <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>treatment</b> for all citizens. Relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands continued to be poor, specifically in regard to control of West Papua, historically under Dutch control but claimed by Indonesia. Soegijapranata firmly supported the Indonesian position; West Papua was annexed in 1963.|$|E

40|$|Investment law is {{a rapidly}} moving and {{increasingly}} debated area of international law. Shifts in international economic relations, the broad nature of investment standards, {{the role played by}} arbitral tribunals and the guarantees granted by law to foreign investors are the object of many comments and disagreements. In particular, it is often feared that contractual stability commitments taking the form of stabilisation clauses are excessive and detrimental to states in terms of sovereignty. This thesis does not focus on the sovereignty debate but proposes a contextual analysis of those stabilisation clauses. Because stabilisation clauses implement FDI protection policies, it suggests that the sustainability of a stabilisation clause essentially depends on whether the FDI protection policy remains compatible with host states' future public policies and development needs. The sustainability of stabilisation clauses is thus considered at three different levels: in terms of (a) political and economic ideology, (b) policymaking and Cc) in terms of contractual commitments. The thesis finds that the current FDI framework suffers from significant ideological tensions because it defends liberal values and imposes liberal standards which tend to ignore national interests. At the same time, it suggests that the policies are not legally unsustainable: they provide broad standards of treatment, do not breach the debated 'right to development' and do not prevent host states from setting up 'valid' policies and regulatory measures as long as a due process of law is observed. Investment contracts, in turn, are often criticised for their negative impacts on states' regulatory powers, but they provide little reliable guarantees of stability to foreign investors and justify a need to rely on contract stabilisation commitments, especially since the role and interpretation of 'legitimate expectations' under the <b>Fair</b> <b>and</b> <b>Equitable</b> standard of <b>treatment</b> is changing. Current contract stabilisation methods, however, create unreasonable expectations, make FDI policies legally unbalanced and must therefore be reviewed to allow for more policy space and to create more 'legitimate' predictability expectations.

It was necessary, at the crisis I speak of, that the supreme {{power of the state}} should meet the conciliatory dispositions of the subject. To delay protection would be to reject allegiance. And why should it be rejected, or even coldly and suspiciously received? If any independent Catholic state should choose to take part with this kingdom in a war with France and Spain, that bigot (if such a bigot could be found) would be heard with little respect, who could dream of objecting his religion to an ally whom the nation would not only receive with its freest thanks, but purchase with the last remains of its exhausted treasure. To such an ally we should not dare to whisper a single syllable of those base and invidious topics upon which some unhappy men would persuade the state to reject the duty and allegiance of its own members. Is it, then, because foreigners are in a condition to set our malice at defiance, that with them we are willing to contract engagements of friendship, and to keep them with fidelity and honor, but that, because we conceive some descriptions of our countrymen are not powerful enough to punish our malignity, we will not permit them to support our common interest? Is it on that ground that our anger is to be kindled by their offered kindness? Is it on that ground that they are to be subjected to penalties, because they are willing by actual merit to purge themselves from imputed crimes?
