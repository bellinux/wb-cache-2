Below this dam is Merced Falls Dam, an irrigation <b>diversion</b> <b>dam.</b> The lowermost, the Crocker-Huffman <b>Diversion</b> <b>Dam,</b> was built in 1906 and completely blocks the passage of anadromous fish up the Merced River.|$|E
5|$|Since 1969, the Hyatt {{plant has}} worked in tandem with an {{extensive}} pumped-storage operation comprising two offstream reservoirs west of Oroville. These two facilities are collectively known as the Oroville-Thermalito Complex. Water is diverted into the upper Thermalito reservoir (Thermalito Forebay) via the Thermalito <b>Diversion</b> <b>Dam</b> on the Feather River. During periods of off-peak power use, surplus energy generated at Hyatt is used to lift water from Thermalito's lower reservoir (the Thermalito Afterbay) to the forebay, which releases water back into the afterbay to generate up to 114 MW of power at times of high demand. The Hyatt and Thermalito plants produce an average of 2.2 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity each year, {{about half of the}} total power produced by the SWP's eight hydroelectric facilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, the Portland Water Committee, {{predecessor}} of the Portland Water Bureau, began {{a search}} for a superior drinking water source. The committee, led by Henry Failing, commissioned Isaac W. Smith, an engineer and surveyor, to inspect any viable water supply in the region. Smith chose the Bull Run River, and a five-month survey trip led him to conclude that a gravity-flow system could deliver clean water from Bull Run to Portland. In 1892, U.S. President Benjamin Harrison signed a proclamation creating a protected area, the Bull Run Reserve, in the watershed. By 1895 Portland had built a <b>diversion</b> <b>dam</b> on the Bull Run River, and completed its first conduit (Conduit 1) to carry Bull Run water to the city. At {{about the same time as}} the Smith survey, a small farming community, at first named Unavilla but renamed Bull Run in 1895, grew up near the confluence of the Bull Run and Sandy rivers. Meanwhile, improvements to the Barlow Road encouraged population growth along the lower Sandy and the establishment of cities like Gresham and Sandy. Even so, by 1900 much of the upper Sandy basin was still remote, wild, and accessible mainly by trails.|$|E

50|$|<b>Diversion</b> <b>dams</b> are one {{of three}} classifications of dams which include: storage dams, {{detention}} <b>dams,</b> and <b>diversion</b> <b>dams.</b> Storage dams are used to store water for extended lengths of time. The stored water then {{can be used for}} irrigation, livestock, municipal water supply, recreation, and hydroelectric power generation. Detention dams are built to catch surface runoff to prevent floods and trap sediment by regulating the flow rate of the runoff into channels downstream. <b>Diversion</b> <b>dams</b> are used to raise the water level in order to redirect the water to the designated location. The diverted water can be used for supplying irrigation systems or reservoirs.|$|R

5|$|Irrigation {{with water}} from the Merced River {{continued}} to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river, some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was {{to such an extent}} that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced River confluence with the San Joaquin, the latter river was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced River enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River. In 1991, a fish hatchery, the Merced River Hatchery, was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman <b>Diversion</b> <b>Dam,</b> the lowermost Merced River dam. Fall chinook salmon travel up a fish ladder into the hatchery's pools, which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced River.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{irrigation}} {{water in the}} Sacramento area {{and other parts of}} the Central Valley were also growing. In 1854, a <b>diversion</b> <b>dam</b> was constructed on the North Fork American River at the site of Auburn Dam, to divert water into ditches that supplied downstream farms. Irrigation with dam and canal systems was favored because the seasonal nature of the American River caused floods in some years and droughts in others. A large dam at the Auburn site was thus considered for both flood control and water supply. In the 1950s, the Bureau of Reclamation created the first plans for a high dam at Auburn. Several designs, ranging from earth-fill to concrete gravity dams, were considered. Before the dam could be built, the Auburn-Foresthill Road – which crosses the river just upstream of the dam site – had to be relocated. Even before the project was authorized, contracts were let for the construction of a high bridge to carry the road over the proposed reservoir, as well as preliminary excavations at the dam site.|$|E

25|$|A barrage dam is {{a special}} kind of dam which {{consists}} of a line of large gates that can be opened or closed to control the amount of water passing the dam. The gates are set between flanking piers which are responsible for supporting the water load, and are often used to control and stabilize water flow for irrigation systems.

40|$|Battle Creek {{is located}} in {{northern}} California and is a cold water tributary to the Sacramento River. Development of Battle Creek for hydroelectric power generation {{began in the early}} 1900 s and resulted in the eventual construction of five <b>diversion</b> <b>dams</b> on the North Fork and three <b>diversion</b> <b>dams</b> on the South Fork, along with a complex canal system, to support five high-head, low-volume powerplants. The Battle Creek Hydroelectric Project has been owned and operated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) since 1919, and is currently licensed by FERC through 2026. Declining salmonid populations in the Sacramento River system, aggravated by ineffective fish ladders, unscreened diversions, and inadequate streamflows, resulted in a multi-agency agreement with PG&E in 1999 to pursue a plan for Battle Creek that would restore and enhance approximately 48 miles of anadromous fish habitat while maintaining the economic viability of the Hydroelectric Project. The Battle Creek Restoration Project includes the installation of fish screens and ladders at three <b>diversion</b> <b>dams,</b> the removal of five <b>diversion</b> <b>dams,</b> the construction of two tailrace connectors and a penstock bypass to prevent canal flows from entering the South Fork; and an increase in streamflows by reducing diversions. Contracts for the project work on the North Fork were awarded in 2009 following FERC approval of PG&E’s license amendment application, with the remaining work to be contracted as additional approvals and funding become available.

Below the Mowich confluence, the Puyallup River flows through a rugged region of mountains and foothills. The river is dammed at Electron <b>Diversion</b> <b>Dam</b> shortly below the Mowich confluence. The dam diverts {{a portion of}} the Puyallup River into a long flume, which runs for several miles to Electron, where the water is passed through turbines in a hydroelectric powerhouse before being returned to the river. The Puyallup River passes through a steep and narrow gorge between Electron Dam and the powerhouse.|$|E
25|$|It {{was in the}} mid-1860s {{that the}} San Joaquin River and its {{surrounds}} underwent the greatest change they had seen in human history: the introduction of irrigated agriculture. As early as 1863, small irrigation canals {{were built in the}} Centerville area, southeast of Fresno, but were destroyed in subsequent floods. The vulnerability of the small local infrastructure led to the establishment of irrigation districts, which were formed to construct and maintain canals in certain areas of the valley. One of the first was the Robla Canal Company in the Merced River area, which went into operation in March 1876, but was soon surpassed by the Farmers Canal Company. The district built a <b>diversion</b> <b>dam</b> on the Merced, sending its water into a pair of canals still in use today.|$|E

50|$|A {{detention}} dam is a dam {{built to}} catch surface runoff and stream water flow {{in order to}} regulate the water flow in areas below the dam. Detention dams are commonly used to reduce {{the damage caused by}} flooding or to manage the flow rate through a channel. Detention dams can also be constructed to replenish groundwater and trap sediment. Detention dams are one of three classifications of dams which include: storage <b>dams,</b> <b>diversion</b> <b>dams,</b> and detention dams. Storage dams are used to store water for extended lengths of time. The stored water then can be used for irrigation, livestock, municipal water supply, recreation, and hydroelectric power generation. <b>Diversion</b> <b>dams</b> are used to raise the water level in order to redirect the water to the designated location. The diverted water can be used for supplying irrigation systems or reservoirs.|$|R
25|$|Timber dams {{were widely}} used {{in the early part}} of the {{industrial}} revolution and in frontier areas due to ease and speed of construction. Rarely built in modern times because of their relatively short lifespan and the limited height to which they can be built, timber dams must be kept constantly wet in order to maintain their water retention properties and limit deterioration by rot, similar to a barrel. The locations where timber dams are most economical to build are those where timber is plentiful, cement is costly or difficult to transport, and either a low head <b>diversion</b> <b>dam</b> is required or longevity is not an issue. Timber dams were once numerous, especially in the North American West, but most have failed, been hidden under earth embankments, or been replaced with entirely new structures. Two common variations of timber dams were the crib and the plank.|$|E
25|$|The dam poses an impassable {{barrier to}} {{migrating}} salmonids which {{is significant because}} the San Francisquito Creek watershed hosts the most viable remaining native steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) population in the South San Francisco Bay. Although anadromous or seagoing steelhead trout still spawn below Searsville Dam, {{they can no longer}} run above Searsville Dam to spawn. Corte Madera Creek was described as an historic steelhead trout spawning stream by Skinner in 1962. However stream resident coastal rainbow trout, run up from Searsville Reservoir to spawn in upper Corte Madera Creek and its tributaries, enabling this native fish to survive above the dam as well. A May 2002 steelhead trout migration study reported Searsville Dam as the only complete barrier to migration on mainstem San Francisquito Creek (construction of a fishway in 1976 resolved passage at the Lake Lagunita <b>diversion</b> <b>dam</b> 2.5 miles below Searsville Dam), and that elimination of the Searsville dam could restore ten miles of anadromous steelhead habitat.|$|E
25|$|The Puyallup River and {{its main}} tributary, the White River, have been {{subjected}} to major modifications during the 20th century. The Puyallup River between Sumner and its mouth at Tacoma was straightened. A <b>diversion</b> <b>dam</b> was built at Game Farm Park in 1914 to prevent the White River from flowing on its natural course into the Green River at Auburn; since then it has flowed into the Puyallup River instead of the Green River. Flood protection structures were built along many rivers in the basin, including extensive levees. A flood storage reservoir, Mud Mountain Lake, was created on the White River with the construction of Mud Mountain Dam. As part of the flood control efforts, river channels and embankments have been generally kept clear of debris such as gravel bars, large trees, logjams, and other woody debris. These modifications have radically altered the natural character of the rivers. River widths have been generally reduced. Water now fills nearly all of the land between river banks, instead of the historic pattern of braided meanders and wetlands.|$|E
40|$|Radio {{telemetry}} and PIT tags {{were used}} to track redband trout movement in the Donner und Blitzen River during the 2007 spring spawning season. The spawning migration lasted from March through June. Most fish migrated during late April and early May when the mean daily flows were between 200 and 400 cfs. Redband were observed to migrate as far as 90 km from {{near the mouth of}} the river to tributaries in the Steens Mountain. Most radio tagged redband, however, migrated up to the river section between River km 70 and 80.

This was to be accomplished with a storage dam, <b>diversion</b> <b>dam</b> and system of canals. Their advancement of the project began in 1888 with the formation of the Agua Fria Water and Land Company. The company hired George Beardsley's Agua Fria Construction Company, and in 1892, construction on the project began. In 1895, Beardsley died, and his brother William who was now president of the Water and Land Company helped continue the project. In 1896, {{due to a lack of}} funding caused by poor nationwide economic conditions, the project was halted. The Water and Land Company soon went bankrupt, but William Beardsley would keep the project alive. Work had been primarily done on the <b>diversion</b> <b>dam</b> and canal while only the foundation of the storage dam, a gravity dam, was completed.
