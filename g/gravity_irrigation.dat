5000|$|As of 1990, the country's largest {{irrigation}} {{project had}} been developed on land between the Blue and White Nile rivers south of their confluence at Khartoum. This area is generally flat with a gentle slope {{to the north and}} west, permitting natural <b>gravity</b> <b>irrigation,</b> and its soils are fertile cracking clays well suited to irrigation. The project originated in 1911, when a private British enterprise, Sudan Plantations Syndicate, found cotton suited to the area and embarked on what in the 1920s became the Gezira Scheme, intended principally to furnish cotton to the British textile industry. Backed by a loan from the British government, the syndicate began a dam on the Blue Nile at Sannar in 1913. Work was interrupted by World War I, and the dam was not completed until 1925. The project was limited by a 1929 agreement between Sudan and Egypt that restricted the amount of water Anglo-Egyptian Sudan could use during the dry season. By 1931 the project had expanded to 450000 ha, the maximum that then could be irrigated by the available water, although an additional 10000 ha were added in the 1950s. [...] The project was nationalized in 1950, and was operated by the Sudan Gezira Board as a government enterprise. In 1959 a new agreement with Egypt greatly increased the allotment of water to Sudan, as did the completion in the early 1960s of the Manaqil Extension on the western side of the Gezira Scheme. By 1990 the Manaqil Extension had an irrigated area of nearly 400000 ha hectares, and with the 460000 ha eventually attained by the original Gezira Scheme, the combined projects accounted for half the country's total land under irrigation.In the early 1960s, the government set up a program to resettle Nubians displaced by Lake Nubia (called Lake Nasser in Egypt), which was formed by the construction of the Aswan High Dam in Egypt. To provide farmland for the Nubians, the government constructed the Khashm al Qirbah Dam on the Atbarah River and established the Halfa al Jadidah (New Halfa) irrigation project. Located west of Kassala, this project was originally designed to irrigate about 164000 ha. [...] In 1982 it was the only large irrigation project in the country that did not use the waters of the Blue Nile or White Nile. The resettlement was effected mainly after completion of the Khashm al Qirbah Dam in 1964. Part of the irrigated area was also assigned to local inhabitants. The main commercial crops initially introduced included cotton, peanuts, and wheat. In 1965 sugarcane was added, and a sugar factory having a design capacity of 60,000 tons was built to process it. [...] The project enabled 200000 ha of land to be irrigated for the first time. Heavy silting as well as serious problems of drainage and salinity occurred. As a result, by the late 1970s the reservoir had lost more than 40 percent of its original storage capacity and was unable to meet the project water requirements. These problems persisted in the early 1990s.|$|E

The main reason why we chose the agent technology in the field of <b>gravity</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems, is the complexity to manage in real-time the water distribution operations those arrive asynchronously and dynamically and to be reactive and adaptive to the dynamic and unpredictable events that characterizes the field (mainly rainy advents). Our objectives are mainly located on two levels. The first one, concerns the <b>gravity</b> <b>irrigation</b> modeling by a multi-agent technology and the agent modeling through AML language.

40|$|The {{viability}} {{and sustainability}} of crop production is currently threatened by increasing water scarcity. Water scarcity {{problems can be}} addressed through improved water productivity and the options usually presumed in this context are efficient water use and conversion of surface irrigation to pressurised systems. By replacing furrow irrigation with drip or centre pivot systems, the water efficiency can be improved by up to 30 % to 45 %. However, the installation and application of pumps and pipes, and the associated fuels needed for these alternatives increase energy consumption. A balance between the improvement in water use and the potential increase in energy consumption is required. When surface water is used, pressurised irrigation systems increase energy consumption substantially, by between 65 % to 75 %, and produce greenhouse gas emissions around 1. 75 times {{higher than that of}} <b>gravity</b> based <b>irrigation</b> systems so their use should be carefully planned keeping in view adverse impact of carbon emissions on the environment and threat of increasing energy prices.
