50|$|Large-scale ad hoc {{wireless}} networks may {{be deployed}} {{for long periods}} of time. During this time the requirements from the network or the environment in which the nodes are deployed may change. This can require modifying the application executing on the sensor nodes, or providing the application with a different set of parameters. It may be very difficult to manually reprogram the nodes because of the scale (possibly hundreds of nodes) and the embedded nature of the deployment, since the nodes may be located in places that are difficult to access physically. Therefore, the most relevant form of reprogramming is remote multihop reprogramming using the wireless medium which reprograms the nodes as they are embedded in their sensing environment. Specialized protocols have been developed for the <b>embedded</b> <b>nodes</b> which minimize the energy consumption of the process as well as reaching the entire network with high probability in as short a time as possible.|$|E
40|$|The area of {{wireless}} <b>embedded</b> <b>nodes</b> has attracted significant research interest, primarily {{with respect to}} the utilisation of this technology in a number of applications domains. Under this context, the main topic of this thesis pertains to the design of a framework for real-time, range-only target tracking utilizing low power wireless <b>embedded</b> <b>nodes.</b> The proposed tracking system is designed to operate solely on range measurements which are obtained without the need for additional hardware incorporated on the <b>embedded</b> <b>nodes.</b> The core objective of this research was to present a target tracking system that can be applied to real-world applications, incorporating support for effectively tracking manoeuvring targets facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate range readings from low-power <b>embedded</b> <b>nodes</b> and finally the ability to achieve real-time system operation. The contribution of the work presented in this thesis is threefold. The tracking problem is theoretically formulated as a dynamical system with the objective being, the real-time estimation of the target’s kinematic variables based on range observations. To address the need for effective tracking of manoeuvring targets an adaptive multiple-model approach was developed. The resulting system is non-linear, due to the non-linearity between the range observations and the kinematic variables. To solve this system, a novel adaptive multiple-model Particle Filter tracking algorithm is proposed. Secondly, to achieve accurate enough ranging between <b>embedded</b> <b>nodes</b> a Time-of-Flight ranging scheme is adopted as part of the proposed tracking system. The final contribution of this work pertains to the real-time operation of the tracking system. The tracking algorithms were evaluated on a simulation environment under realistic experimental conditions. The ranging method was implemented on <b>embedded</b> <b>nodes</b> and tested in terms of accuracy in various environments. Ultimately, the entire system was implemented on hardware and tested in outdoor experiments. In the experiments carried out one mobile wireless node was used as the target and a set of anchor nodes attempted to infer the target’s kinematic variables. A total of 25 experiments are presented in this thesis. An average accuracy of approximately 2. 6 m for position and 1. 9 m/s for velocity was attained in a 15 m x 15 m square area. Such performance, which is confirmed from the simulation results reveal the potential of the proposed range-only system in application domains where real-time tracking of mobile targets is a demand.

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} graph embedding methods focus on nodes, which aim to output a vector representation for each node in the graph such that two nodes being "close" on the graph are close too in the low-dimensional space. Despite the success of <b>embedding</b> individual <b>nodes</b> for graph analytics, we notice that an important concept of embedding communities (i. e., groups of <b>nodes)</b> is missing. <b>Embedding</b> communities is useful, not only for supporting various community-level applications, but also to help preserve community structure in graph embedding. In fact, we see community embedding as providing a higher-order proximity to define the node closeness, whereas most of the popular graph embedding methods focus on first-order and/or second-order proximities. To learn the community embedding, we hinge upon the insight that community <b>embedding</b> and <b>node</b> <b>embedding</b> reinforce with each other. As a result, we propose ComEmbed, the first community embedding method, which jointly optimizes the community <b>embedding</b> and <b>node</b> <b>embedding</b> together. We evaluate ComEmbed on real-world data sets. We show it outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks of node classification and community prediction.

In the recent years, particular emphasis was given to pervasive wireless sensor nodes that enabled innovative applications for infrastructure monitoring, crowd-source sensing and mobile cyber-physical infrastructure. Indeed, security {{is one of the}} main open challenges to face; available security solutions are not able to cope with new attack scenarios and proactive measures to protect nodes are needed. Techniques aimed at continuously changing a system configuration, recently referred to as moving target defence (MTD), are emerging to improve the security level provided by the system but their feasibility in resource constrained environment should be evaluated. Starting from these considerations, in this paper, we propose a reconfiguration framework for <b>embedded</b> <b>nodes</b> that is able to enhance the performance of available reconfiguration tools and also to enable the MTD approach in battery-supplied wireless sensor nodes.

Our {{focus is on}} low-cost large-scale deployments where nodes need to be battery-powered with predictable network lifetimes and applications require bounded end-to-end delay. An effective approach to such energy-constrained networks is to operate at low duty cycles and maximize the shutdown interval between packet exchanges. The pri-mary challenge is in coordinating transmissions so they are collision-free while minimizing the duration the nodes are active. RT-Link is a time-synchronized link protocol for fixed and mobile embedded radios. We identify three key observa-tions {{in the design and}} deployment of RT-Link: (a) RT-Link offers predictable network lifetime with bounded end-to-end delay. (b) Achieving global time synchronization is both eco-nomical and convenient for indoor and outdoor deployments. (c) Due to interference between nodes, our experiments con-firm that nodes with the same schedule must be spaced by a minimum of 3 hops. Furthermore, to minimize end-to-end de-lay, {{it is more important to}} order time slots than to minimize the number of time slots.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} maximizing the second smallest eigenvalue of the weighted Laplacian of a (simple) graph over all nonnegative edge weightings with bounded total weight. We generalize this problem by introducing node significances and edge lengths. We give a formulation of this generalized problem as a semidefinite program. The dual program can be equivalently written as embedding problem. This is fifinding an embedding of the n nodes of the graph in n-space so that their barycenter is at the origin, the distance between adjacent nodes is bounded by the respective edge length, and the <b>embedded</b> <b>nodes</b> are spread as much as possible. (The sum of the squared norms is maximized.) We proof the following necessary condition for optimal embeddings.

The rotational dimension of a graph is a minor monotone graph parameter. We characterize the graphs with rotational dimension up to two...|$|E
