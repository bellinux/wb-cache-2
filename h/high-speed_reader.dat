5000|$|A {{variation}} on the tape punch was a device called a Chadless Printing Reperforator. This machine would punch a received teleprinter signal into tape and print the message on {{it at the same}} time, using a printing mechanism similar to that of an ordinary page printer. The tape punch, rather than punching out the usual round holes, would instead punch little U-shaped cuts in the paper, so that no chad would be produced; the [...] "hole" [...] was still filled with a little paper trap-door. By not fully punching out the hole, the printing on the paper remained intact and legible. This enabled operators to read the tape without having to decipher the holes, which would facilitate relaying the message on to another station in the network. Also, of course, there was no [...] "chad box" [...] to empty from time to time. A disadvantage to this mechanism was that chadless tape, once punched, did not roll up well, because the protruding flaps of paper would catch on the next layer of tape, so it could not be rolled up tightly. Another disadvantage, as seen over time, was that there was no reliable way to read chadless tape by optical means employed by later <b>high-speed</b> <b>readers.</b> However, the mechanical tape readers used in most standard-speed equipment had no problem with chadless tape, because it sensed the holes by means of blunt spring-loaded sensing pins, which easily pushed the paper flaps out of the way.|$|R

The main results showed that using the finger tracking system permitted the exploration of the moment-to-moment cognitive processes of the braille reader with unprecedented precision. Readers showed relatively rapid sensitivity to lexical properties of the text (e. g., word frequency, lexical structure, orthographic uniqueness point) and demonstrated sensitivity to topdown context effects during reading. The final experiment provided suggestive evidence that the auditory cortex may be involved in skilled braille reading...|$|R

A 10-bit I/O control bus, consisting of 6 bits of device address information and 4 bits of function selection, was used. The basic processor had a single interrupt signal line, but an option provided up to 48 interrupts. [...] In addition to a front-panel display of lights and toggle switches, the system supported different types of input/output devices. A Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinter {{could be used as}} a console I/O device and (in the most basic systems) to load and store data to paper tape. Smaller systems typically used a <b>high-speed</b> paper-tape <b>reader</b> and punch for data storage. The Honeywell family of peripherals included card readers and punches, line printers, magnetic tape, and both fixed-head and removable hard disk drives.|$|R
50|$|A {{free-standing}} console is also provided, {{which includes}} binary displays of the machine's registers and switches to boot and debug programs.

Most systems {{include at least}} two magnetic tape drives, operating at up to 75 inches/second at 800 bpi. The normal variety of peripherals is also available, including magnetic drum units, card readers and punches, and an extensive set of analog-digital/digital-analog conversion devices.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2014. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Jian-Ping Wang. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 122 pages, appendix A. Spin transfer torque (STT) induced magnetization switching and oscillation in nanometer scale magnetoresistance (MR) devices {{have been studied}} intensively due to its direct application in the non-volatile STT random access memory (STT-RAM) and its potential application in the high frequency spin torque oscillatior (STO). STO {{could be used in}} high-density microwave signal processor and chip-to-chip communication system due to its nanometer scale footprint and ultra high oscillation frequency. STO has also been suggested in the magnetic recoridng head for the microwave assisted magnetic recording (MAMR) and in the <b>high-speed</b> magnetic <b>reader</b> for future hard disk drive. However, several critical engineering challenges for those exciting STO applications are still remaining, including optimizing the operating condition, tuning the frequency, narrowing the linewidth and improving the output power. In this thesis work, the spin transfer torque induced oscillation is experimentally studied in MgO barrier based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with focus on the improvement of the key performances of the STO. The power angular dependence of spin torque oscillation is experimentally studied in dual MgO barrier MTJs based on the understanding of the relation between the MR and oscillation output power. It is proved that the STO electrical power increases with the polarizer canting angle. Meanwhile, the results also reveal a solution for extending the oscillation operating condition. Furthermore, the MTJ based STO device with a built-in hard axis polarizer is designed and studied. This design provides an external-field-free STO with high power, low critical current and extended operation range of the driving current for the first time. Additionally, two oscillation modes in the dual MgO barrier MTJs are observed and investigated. It is found from the field-dependent power spectra that the extra oscillation mode may come from the weakly-pinned top reference layer. A single-shot time-domain measurement to characterize the switching time of each switch under different voltages for MTJs in the nanosecond precessional regime was carried out too...|$|R
50|$|The 803 is a transistorised, bit-serial machine; the 803B {{has more}} {{parallel}} paths internally. It uses ferrite core memory in 4096 or 8192 words of 40 bits, comprising 39 bits of data with parity. The CPU {{is housed in}} a single cabinet about 66 inches long, 16 inches deep and 56 inches high. Circuitry is based on printed circuit boards with the printed circuits being rather simple {{and most of the}} signalling carried on wires. There is a second cabinet about half the size used for the power supply, which is unusually based on a large nickel-cadmium battery with charger, an early form of uninterruptible power supply. A third cabinet (the same size as the power cabinet) holds the extra working store on machines with 8192 word stores. There is an operator's control console, Creed teleprinter and <b>high-speed</b> paper tape <b>reader</b> and punch for input/output, using 5-track Elliott telecode code, not Baudot. Tape is read at 500 characters per second and punched at 100 cps.The operator's console, about 60 inches long, allows low-level instructions to be entered manually to manipulate addresses and data and can start, stop and step the machine: there is a loudspeaker (pulsed by the top bit of the instruction register) which allows the operator to judge the status of a computation. The system requires air conditioning, drawing about 3.5 kW of power in a minimal configuration.|$|R

Text Categorization may be the remedy of increased need for advanced techniques. Text Categorization is the classi cation of units of natural language texts with respect to a set of pre-existing categories. Categorization of documents is challenging, as the number of discriminating words can be very large. This thesis presents compilation of a Turkish dataset, called Anadolu Agency Newsgroup in order to study in Text Categorization. Turkish is an agglutinative languages in which words contain no direct indication where the morpheme boundaries are, furthermore, morphemes take a shape dependent on the morphological and phonological context. In Turkish, the process of adding one suÃ†x to another can result in a relatively long word, furthermore, a single Turkish word can give rise to {{a very large number of}} variants. Due to this complex morphological structure, Turkish requires text processing techniques di erent than English and similar languages. Therefore, besides converting all words to lower case and removing punctuation marks, some preliminary work is required such as stemming, removal of stopwords and formation of a keyword list. This thesis also presents the evaluation and comparison of the well-known k-NN classi cation algorithm and a variant of the k-NN, called Feature Projection Text Categorization (FPTC) algorithm. The k-NN classi er is an instance based learning method. It computes the similarity between the test instance and training instance, and considering the k top-ranking nearest instances to predict the categories of the input, nds out the category that is most similar. FPTC algorithm is based on the idea of representing training instances as their pro jections on each feature dimension. If the value of a training instance is missing for a feature, that instance is not stored on that feature. Experiments show that the FPTC algorithm achieves comparable accuracy with the k-NN algorithm, furthermore, the time eÃ†ciency of FPTC outperforms the k-NN signi cantlyÄ°lhan, UfukM. S...|$|R
