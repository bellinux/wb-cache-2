40|$|Many past {{studies of}} {{relative}} financing {{costs in the}} United States and Japan have relied on interest rates from the 1970 s and earlier when Japanese financial markets were subject to numerous regulations and controls and were shielded by capital controls from financial markets abroad. Interest rates on bank loans, the most important source of financing in Japan, in fact, systematically underestimated the true costs of borrowing. In the United States, capital controls were being dismantled by the early 1970 s, but the prime loan rate used in past studies had by then become an unreliable measure of {{the true cost of}} borrowing in the United States. This study shows that most of the reported gap in short term financing costs between the two countries can be traced to past features of the national markets which have largely disappeared Now that markets have been deregulated and international capital flows liberalized, national interest rates are closely related to those in the unregulated <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>markets.</b> And, as this study shows, average real interest differentials in the <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>markets</b> have been close to zero over the last twenty years. ...|$|R
40|$|BELL, Graham Douglas, M. Com. University of the Witwatersrand, 1985. This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} development and operation, advantages and {{problems associated with the}} <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>market.</b> It also considers the parallel emergence of the United States dollar as the primary international vehicle currency. A well-developed international money market with easy access to a widely accepted international numeric is deemed desirable because it reduces the costs of international financial transactions and facilitates international capital mobility. Two major criticisms are that the <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>market</b> contributes to international inflation and that Euro banks have been imprudent in lending to developing countries. The thesis concludes that the conventional credit multiplier model is not appropriate in studying the market but that there is, however, some inflationary potential. As for imprudent Euro bank lending, some blame adheres to the bankers but extensive international controls are ruled out. Finally, the advent of floating exchange rates in the 1970 s and uncertainty surrounding United States economic policy has led to considerable uncertainty in international financial markets. This has been aggravated by volatile short-term international capital flows fuelled by the efficient <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>market.</b> In such an environment South Africa has experienced considerable oscillations in the price of gold, its major export, and has embarked on a programme to establish a flexible foreign exchange market.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three articles, examining the performance of demutualized securities exchanges from 2000 to 2011, in view of changes in governance and regulation. The first part is an empirical study {{of the influence of}} each type of shareholder (financial investor, broker, strategic or widely-held shares). The results show that fragmented owner ship is correlated with lower performance and investment managers’ presence with higher performance; strategic investors are on balance detrimental to shareholder value. The second article looks at the same exchanges individually, through case studies. The findings of the first article are validated. However,a closer look at strategic investors shows three outcomes : when they consist of founders, they increase shareholder value; when they are employed managers,they decrease it; and when the strategic investor is a competitor, the target company’s performance becomes more volatile. The third article looks at the combination of technology and regulation. Through mean comparisons and a difference-in-differences approach, this section shows that recent market deregulation has allowed high-tech start-ups to challenge the dominance of the established exchanges, just like previous coincidences of regulatory and technological change resulted in significant market up heavals: the disappearance of London’s jobbers following Big Bang and the <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>market</b> displacing New York as a major center for dollar borrowing and lending. This dissertation introduces two new concepts: “quasi-agent principals”(shareholders who destroy value in their investment {{as a result of their}} conflicts of interest) and the “adjuvant effect” (when the combined effect of regulation and technology is a multiple of the effects of each). Cette thèse, sous forme de trois articles, tente d’expliquer le déclin des bourses organisées au profit de nouvelles plateformes de transaction, à la lumière des récents changements de gouvernance et réglementaires. Les deux premiers articles évaluent l’influence de quatre types d’actionnariat (flottant, courtiers, investisseurs financiers et actionnaires stratégiques) sur la performance de l’entreprise. Il existe une corrélation positive de la performance avec l’actionnariat institutionnel,et négative avec le flottant et avec les investisseurs stratégiques. Le deuxième article –six études de cas– valide ces résultats. L’analyse plus détaillée des actionnaires stratégiques montre que ceux-ci créent de la valeur quand ils sont fondateurs; la détruisent quand ils sont des dirigeants salariés; et augmentent la volatilité des performances de l’entreprise dans les cas de prise de contrôle avortée par un concurrent. Le troisième article analyse l’effet conjugué des changements réglementaires et technologiques. A travers une approche par comparaisons de moyennes, il apparait que les marchés exposés à la déréglementation souffrent plus de la concurrence des plateformes électroniques que les autres bourses. Cette thèse introduit deux nouveaux concepts: le «principal quasi-agent» (un actionnaire qui réduit la valeur de son investissement en raison de ses conflits d’intérêt) et l’«effet adjuvant» (ou comment la réglementation démultiplie les effets concurrentiels permis par les avancées technologiques) ...|$|E

During the period 1890 1931, commercial banks of industrialised countries promoted organisational and process innovations that successfully challenged the dominance of merchant banks in international financial intermediation. International banking re-emerged from interwar nationalistic retrenchment during the late 1950 s, when banks exploited regulatory asymmetries to foster the emergence of <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>markets.</b> Eurobanks provided not only global liquidity redistribution but also portfolio transformation services to corporate and sovereign customers.

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, {{differential}} national regulation in conjunction with increasing capital mobility {{has given rise to}} tremendous growth in the <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>markets.</b> In this paper, we analyze whether the announced plans of the European Commuission to remove barriers to capital flows (in July 1990) and to harmonize other financial regulations (by the end of 1992) will have a major effect on the Euromarkets. The analysis in this paper revolves around the concept of the Net Reguatory Burden (NRB). Three variables will play a crucial role for the developnent of the Euronarkets after 1992. These are (1) reserve requirements on bank deposits, (2) taxation of residents and non-residents on interest income, dividends and capital gains, and (3) disclosure of interest and dividends to tax authorities. Presently there is considerable variation in these factors across Europe. Competitive pressures should lead to a convergence of regulation, but national sovereignty leaves open the possibility for sone divergence of the NRB across European countries, and in comparison with other financial centers such as Switzerland. These differences in NRB will {{play a key role in}} determining the location and size of Euromarkets after 1992. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the empirical investigation of monetary policy independence as this is manifested in the inter–relationships between domestic and foreign money market interest rates. Instead of following an ad–hoc econometric approach, we have imposed a specific economic structure on the proposed model by establishing a link of the yield curves of two different countries through the Uncovered Interest Rate Parity, UIP. The expectations hypothesis of the term structure and the UIP imply certain overidentifying restrictions on the cointegrating space of a vector autoregressive process consisting of the interest rates of the two markets. The model has been tested on data from the domestic US money market and the euromark and euroyen markets. The main finding of our analysis is that we reject the overidentifying restrictions of the models for the USD/DEM case but we are unable to reject them for the USD/JPY case, at the one percent significance level and this implies that the term spreads of the euroyen market are being affected, in the long run, by changes of the US short Fed funds rate. cointegration, expectations theory, uncovered interest parity, <b>eurocurrency</b> <b>markets,</b> Granger causality...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons of {{trend growth}} {{rates in the}} 1960 s with the 1980 s and early 1990 s pose an {{economic}} policy question of supreme importance. In every G 7 economy growth has slowed to around twothirds of the rate in the 1960 s, and unemployment has risen. In developing countries {{taken as a whole}} the average rate of growth has also slowed, to roughly the same extent. Even in East and Southeast Asia, trend growth per capita declined in four out of seven of the major economies, before the onset of the recent crisis. For the policy-maker, the commonality of this experience demands explanation. Some countries bucked the trend but the overwhelmingly common experience was of slower growth (and, typically, of slower productivity growth too). It is possible that this was due to a variety of special local factors that just happened to reduce growth rates throughout the world at the same time. It is surely more likely, however, that some common factor has been at work. All countries have, of course, been affected by the liberalization of the international financial regime that began around <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>markets</b> in the 1950 s and the explosive growth of capital markets since 1970.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{evidence on}} interest differentials under the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates {{and under the}} flexible rate system which succeeded it. Under the Bretton Woods system, many countries resorted to capital controls {{in an attempt to}} pursue independent monetary policies. In the three major countries studied in this paper, Britain, Germany and the United States, these capital controls resulted in large differentials between national interest rates covered for exchange risk. The capital controls and resulting interest differentials distorted many cross-border investment and borrowing decisions. The paper compares these covered interest differentials with uncovered interest differentials in the <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>markets</b> which are free of capital controls. In both fixed and flexible periods, average uncovered differentials between Eurodollar interest rates and four other Eurocurrency rates are in most cases close to zero. So these average uncovered interest differentials, whether attributable to exchange risk premiums or forecast errors, are much smaller than average covered interest differentials between national markets due to capital controls. If exchange risk premiums have significant effects on uncovered interest differentials in some periods, these premiums must be time-varying with a mean close to zero over the long sample periods studied. Similarly, if forecast errors have systematic components in some periods, in the long sample periods studied these errors have a mean close to zero as well. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to create a model of {{exchange}} rates that explains the short term, daily levels of the foreign exchange spot market. The model is a monetary type {{that focuses on the}} <b>eurocurrency</b> <b>markets</b> and the current account. It has a liquidity preference form and employs daily data. The futures rate, the euro interest rate, the eurocurrency money stocks and a current account variable are the individual variables of the model. The futures rate and the euro interest rates are from the assumed Fisher's 'Covered Interest Rate Paradigm'. The eurocurrency money stock variable's justification is based on the real world structure of the spot market where the foreign exchange desks of the major world commercial banks are the dominant players. The current account variable, which is motivated by a desire to improve on the short run performance of the Purchasing Power Parity variable of other monetary models, is justified by trade theory. The liquidity preference form of the model is in keeping with current monetary models. The econometric results show that the model is better than the random walk model. However the results of the individual variables are mixed. The futures rate accounts {{for the vast majority of}} the model's success. Although the eurocurrency variable is as statistically significant as the interest rate differentials from the widely accepted Fisher's Covered Interest Rate Parity paradigm, neither was as significant as the futures rate. The current account variable results are not statistically significant. Thus, the current account variable may be discarded while the eurocurrency interest rates and euromoney variables warrant further study. As a result of the dominance of the futures rate variable, models that cry to capture rational expectations such as the News or Chaos Models are appealing. This rational expectations characteristic of the market combined with the dominance of speculation over economic fundamentals also points toward game theory as a good candidate for further study...|$|R
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of price stability is the Bundesbank's ultimate objective. The memory of two hyperinflations within a 30 -year period {{has made the}} fight against inflation of paramount social and political importance. In the Bank's view inflation engenders uncertainties which may jeopardise capital investment on which the competitiveness of German industry as well as full employment and economic growth depends. The Bundesbank pursues this goal by setting the marginal cost of central bank money required by the banks to finance their expansion. Thus, both the liquidity of the banking system {{and the cost of}} borrowing are controlled. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} the banks' loan rate of interest is the Bundesbank's Intermediate target. In fact, the Bank does not have one single intermediate target. Since the Bank's views of the monetary sector are manifested in the form of an interlocking system of financial variables, the selection of an appropriate intermediate target depends on the actual economic situation. In this context, the money stock supply (M 3) is seen by the Bundesbank as functionally related to bank lending and the accumulation of long-term funds at the banks (monetary capital formation). An increase in interest rates would reduce bank lending, stimulate monetary capital formation and hence reduce the money stock supply (M 3). In addition, it would check the utilisation of the money stock supply. This is seen as important because once money has entered the system it may generate unacceptable expenditure flows. To control the growth of the money stock supply, the Bundesbank relies on monetary capital formation, because small stocks of public debt rule out large-scale open market operations. In the Bank's view monetary policy should aim at keeping the banks' loan rate of interest as closely as possible to the natural rate. Lags in this Wicksellian transmission process may arise if the banks have ample margins between their loan and deposit rates when a restrictive monetary policy is implemented. As deposit rates adjust sooner than loan rates to a change in market rates, this also blunts the immediate impact of a policy change. The Bundesbank favours flexible rates of exchange in order to safeguard the financial system against inflows of foreign capital. It would welcome an appreciation of the D-Mark as a contribution to price stability, even though it could result in a loss of employment and exports as it stimulates German business to invest abroad. Furthermore, the Bank aims at constraining the monetary disturbances arising from public sector deficits and collective wage bargaining by means of its annual monetary growth target. This should serve as a signal to non-banks, which they are supposed to internalise in their decision-making. During the review period, the effectiveness of these safeguards was small as witnessed by inflows of foreign capital, large public sector deficits and excessive wage settlements. Moreover, the Bundesbank has been confronted with the development of parallel markets, in particular the <b>Eurocurrency</b> <b>markets,</b> in which borrowers can avoid the effects of its constraints...|$|R

40|$|This Guide to the {{international}} banking statistics is intended to serve two main purposes: firstly, to provide reporting countries with definitions and guidelines for the reporting of data; secondly, to give {{a detailed account of}} current country practices regarding the coverage and disaggregation of the reported data. The Guide describes two statistical systems, the locational banking statistics and the consolidated banking statistics. It replaces the previous issue (July 2000) and includes numerous changes and updates to the tables on countries' reporting practices. The locational banking statistics, which are described in Part I, gather quarterly data on international financial claims and liabilities of bank offices resident in the reporting countries broken down by currency, sector and country of residence of counterparty, and by nationality of reporting banks. In this system, both domestic and foreign-owned banking offices in the reporting countries record their positions on a gross (unconsolidated) basis, including those vis-à-vis own affiliates, which is consistent with the principles of national accounts, balance of payments and external debt statistics. The statistics were introduced with a breakdown by major individual currencies and a partial sectoral and geographical breakdown {{at the beginning of the}} 1970 s to provide information on the development and growth of the <b>eurocurrency</b> <b>markets.</b> In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling oil-related surpluses and the accompanying rise in international indebtedness shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed geographical breakdown and of flow data. The outbreak of the debt crisis in the early 1980 s stimulated further efforts to refine both the geographical coverage of the data and the estimates of exchange rate adjusted flows. In the early 1990 s, strong interest arose in making use of these statistics to improve the coverage and accuracy of the recording of balance of payments transactions. Following the financial crises in emerging economies in the late 1990 s the locational banking statistics became an important component of the Joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank Statistics on External Debt, which were developed in response to requests for dissemination of more timely external debt indicators. The consolidated banking statistics, which are described in Part II, collect quarterly data on banks' international financial claims broken down by remaining maturity and sector of borrower. In addition, they include information on exposures by country of immediate borrower and on the reallocation of claims (ie risk transfers) to the country of ultimate risk. The latter is defined as the country where the guarantor of a claim resides. The data mainly cover claims reported by domestic bank head offices, including the exposures of their foreign affiliates, and are collected on a worldwide consolidated basis with inter-office positions being netted out. The statistics also provide separate data on international claims of foreign bank offices whose head offices are located outside the reporting countries on an unconsolidated basis. The statistics were introduced as a semiannual reporting exercise in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s to provide information on the country risk exposures of major individual nationality banking groups to developing countries. Following the financial crises in emerging economies in the late 1990 s, the consolidated banking statistics were enhanced to include complete country coverage of banks' on-balance sheet exposures, separate country data on an ultimate risk basis and a move to a quarterly reporting frequency. In response to recommendations of a working group of the CGFS, and in order to maintain the consolidated banking statistics as a key source of public information on international financial market developments, it is planned to improve the measurement of commercial banks' consolidated country risk exposures on an ultimate risk basis. Consequently, the statistics will, as from end- 2004, cover more detailed and comprehensive data on country risk exposures inclusive of derivatives and other off-balance sheet positions. Part III of this Guide provides a glossary of terms used in the locational and consolidated banking statistics, while part IV contains a list of international organisations (Appendix 1) and official monetary authorities (Appendix 2). Beginning in 1998, the BIS has invited a number of additional countries, in particular from emerging markets, to participate in {{the international}} banking statistics. This is intended to further increase the global coverage of the statistics. So far, 12 economies have joined the locational (Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Guernsey, India, Isle of Man, Jersey, Panama, Portugal, Taiwan (China) and Turkey) and nine have joined the consolidated (Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, Taiwan (China), and Turkey) banking statistics, with more countries expected to be included in the near future. The Guide has been prepared with the assistance of the central banks or official authorities contributing to the two sets of international banking statistics. The BIS is grateful to all these institutions for their cooperation and valuable advice in its preparation. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction A {{revised version}} of this paper has been {{released}} in July 2009. The origins of BIS activities in the field of international financial statistics go back to the mid- 1960 s and the emergence of the so-called <b>eurocurrency</b> <b>markets</b> that had sprung up to circumvent domestic regulations. At that time the key policy concern that gave rise to the joint data collection exercise by the central banks of the G 10 countries {{under the aegis of the}} BIS was the need to monitor the rapid growth of these markets and its possible monetary implications. This led to the introduction of reporting by internationally active banks of their international positions in major individual currencies, with a geographical and partial sectoral breakdown. On the basis of these reports the central banks and the BIS compiled the so-called locational banking statistics for various lending and borrowing countries. In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling the current account surpluses of oil-producing countries shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed geographical breakdown and of flow data. In the context of the deregulation of domestic financial systems and capital flows in the 1970 s and 1980 s these concerns abated, but in their place came others, notably the rise in the indebtedness of many developing countries to international banks in the early 1980 s. This build-up was visible in the existing locational banking statistics collected and published by the BIS, but it was not possible to evaluate in a comprehensive way the risk characteristics of the exposures of national banking systems to individual borrowing countries. The need for such information therefore led to the reporting of a second set of international banking data on a fully consolidated basis. A maturity breakdown of the consolidated banking claims was also introduced at that time. In response to calls for more up-to-date information on the international lending activities of banks, the BIS began in the early 1990 s to collect and publish data on signed syndicated credit facilities. More recently, with the objective of enhancing the analysis of country risk exposures, efforts have been made to achieve a more complete and detailed reporting of consolidated banking data on an ultimate risk basis, including off-balance sheet positions relating to bank's derivatives transactions. As a result of the increasing role of the international securities markets in global financial intermediation, the BIS was mandated in the mid- 1980 s to collect and publish statistics on these markets on the basis of data from commercial databases and information available to individual central banks. In the 1990 s the BIS also became increasingly involved in the coordination of joint surveys that central banks carried out on a regular basis to monitor activity in global foreign exchange markets. Moreover, as derivatives markets expanded in the wake of financial innovation, central banks asked the BIS to collect and publish international data on exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives transactions. The development of the BIS international financial statistics thus reflects evolving central bank concerns relating to monetary and financial stability in the context of worldwide financial market deregulation, innovation and globalisation. In addition to their use for policy-related monitoring purposes by central banks, the international financial statistics have meanwhile proved to be of interest to private sector market participants. The latter have come to recognise the unique value of the BIS data for tracking the borrowing by emerging market countries from the international banking and securities markets. The BIS data are also used by the IMF in the compilation of its international financial statistics and in its surveillance of individual economies. Moreover, the BIS data have proved to be useful for improving balance of payment statistics and for measuring and monitoring developing countries' foreign debt. With respect to the latter, following the 1997 Asian debt crisis the IMF, OECD, World Bank and BIS pooled their respective statistics to collectively publish data from creditor and market sources on countries' foreign indebtedness. Apart from providing insights into the geographical distributions of international financial flows and external vulnerabilities and risk exposures of debtors and creditors, the international financial statistics collected and disseminated by the BIS contain important information on the structural developments in international financial markets. They can be used, for instance, to analyse the importance of individual financial centres (including so-called offshore centres), the emergence of new relationships between financial and non-financial firms, the level and concentration of activity in financial markets as well as spillovers between different market segments. Much of this is not easily available elsewhere. The statistics become even more valuable when they are combined with other sources covering financial asset prices, market liquidity and trading patterns, external ratings, and the activity of non-bank financial firms and non-financial companies. They then allow market participants and policymakers to make an assessment of credit and liquidity risks in domestic and international financial markets as well as of potential vulnerabilities to systemic disturbances in these markets. The usefulness of the international financial statistics is, of course, potentially affected by the fact that the boundaries between international and domestic markets are becoming more blurred. This could, on the one hand, constitute a weakness of the statistics as it may become increasingly difficult to define and distinguish pure international financial market activity from that in domestic markets. On the other hand, as this guide explains and illustrates, the methodology of the international statistics has tried to keep pace with such developments and to ensure that financial analysts are aware of the limitations of the statistics. Moreover, given that financial innovations have often started in the competitive environment of the international financial markets and that market sentiments are becoming increasingly correlated internationally, the BIS statistics have been and continue to be a very useful tool to capture structural and market developments in global markets at an early stage. The BIS, and the central banking community working through it, have also taken steps to complement the publication of the international financial statistics with a selection of highlights and analyses of major market trends. In the case of the BIS this applies to the press releases accompanying the release of new data; to the BIS Quarterly Review, which contains more in-depth analysis of specific issues, and to its Annual Report, which analyses long-term trends and emerging policy issues. The statistics are also mentioned and explained regularly in presentations by senior BIS officials to central banks, market participants and academics. Other initiatives to promote the use of the statistics include making them available in electronic form on the BIS website and updating the guidelines and methodological notes on a regular basis. Work on collecting, compiling and disseminating the BIS international financial statistics is closely related to, and guided by, the activities of the various Basel-based committees and expert groups as well as those of other international institutions. The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) plays a key role in reaching a consensus on priorities to improve the BIS statistics. With respect to international banking data, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is consulted on methodological issues to help ensure the collection of adequate statistical information from internationally active banks on risk exposures. The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) has also formulated a number of recommendations to enhance statistics on international financial markets and capital flows that are taken into account by the BIS in its statistical work. As a result of the strong support of these groups it has been possible to improve on the reporting frequency and timeliness of the international financial statistics in recent years. One of the major underlying objectives of the various Basel-based groups is to strengthen financial stability through transparency and market discipline. Increased public disclosure plays a key role in this and should, over time, lead to better quantitative and qualitative information on the activities and risk profiles of individual institutions as well as market infrastructures such as payment, settlement and trading systems. With respect to the functioning of domestic and international financial markets, various proposals have been made to complement the BIS statistics on banking, securities, foreign exchange and derivatives markets over time by improved aggregate information on liquidity, leverage and position-taking in these markets. More recently the IMF has been elaborating a methodology for the collection by individual countries of comprehensive financial soundness indicators, which should complement the BIS statistics. The disclosure framework on the exposures and capital structure of internationally active banks proposed under the New Basel Capital Accord (its so-called Pillar III) should contribute to better balance sheet data of individual internationally active banks. This Guide is structured around the three main areas of the BIS international financial statistics: the international banking statistics (Part II); the securities statistics (Part III); and the derivatives and foreign exchange statistics (Parts IV and V). It also provides a description of the joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank statistics on external debt for which the BIS is a main contributor of data (Part VI). The guide provides a detailed description of the sources, compilation, transformation and publication of the data. Two separate chapters on the quality and the uses of the statistics (Parts VII and VIII) follow the description of the statistics. A more detailed description of the BIS international banking statistics and their underlying methodology is provided in a separate guide. This Guide has been prepared by Paul Van den Bergh, Rainer Widera, Karsten von Kleist, Jesper Wormstrup and others in the Monetary and Economic Department of the BIS. Chapter VIII draws largely on an article by Philip Wooldridge. ...|$|R
