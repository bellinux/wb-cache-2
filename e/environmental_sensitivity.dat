25|$|Tasmania has {{numerous}} relatively unspoiled, ecologically valuable regions. Proposals {{for local}} economic development have therefore been faced with strong requirements for <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> or outright opposition. In particular, proposals for hydroelectric power generation proved controversial {{in the late}} 20th century.

25|$|Micropiles, {{also called}} mini piles, {{are often used}} for underpinning. They are also used to create {{foundations}} {{for a variety of}} project types, including highway, bridge and transmission tower projects. They are especially useful at sites with difficult or restricted access, or with <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Micropiles are made of steel with diameters of 60 to 200mm. Installation of micropiles through top soil, sand and cobblestones overburden and into soil rock can be achieved using Air Rotary or Mud Rotary drilling, impact driving, jacking, vibrating or screwing machinery. Micropiles {{can also be used to}} construct a grout column around the shaft of a standard Helical Pile system, allowing for use in higher load applications.|$|E
500|$|With the Eisenhower Tunnel finished, {{the last}} {{remaining}} obstacle for I-70 to be an interstate commercial artery was the two lane, non-freeway portion in Glenwood Canyon. Construction had started on this section in the 1960s with a small section opening to traffic in 1966. The remainder was stopped due to environmentalist protests that caused a 30-year controversy. The original design was criticized as [...] "the epitome of environmental insensitivity". Engineers scrapped the original plans and started work on a new design that would minimize additional environmental impacts. A new design was underway by 1971, which was approved in 1975; however, environmental groups filed lawsuits to stop construction, and the controversy continued even when construction finally resumed in 1981. The final design included 40 bridges and viaducts, three additional tunnel bores (two were completed before construction was stopped in the 1960s) and [...] of retaining walls for a stretch of freeway [...] long. The project was further complicated {{by the need to}} build the four-lane freeway without disturbing the operations of the railroad. This required using special and coordinated blasting techniques. Engineers designed two separate tracks for the highway, one elevated above the other, to minimize the footprint in the canyon. The final design was praised for its <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> A Denver architect who helped design the freeway proclaimed, [...] "Most of the people in western Colorado see it as having preserved the canyon." [...] He further stated, [...] "I think pieces of the highway elevate to the standard of public art." [...] A portion of the project included shoring up the banks of the Colorado River to repair damage and remove flow restrictions created in the initial construction of US6 in the 1930s.|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{evidence}} on the symptomatic profile, health status and illness behavior of people with subjective sensitivity to noise is still scarce. Also, it is unknown to what extent noise sensitivity co-occurs with other <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitivities</b> such as multi-chemical sensitivity and sensitivity to electromagnetic fields (EMF). A cross-sectional study performed in the Netherlands, combining self-administered questionnaires and electronic medical records of non-specific symptoms (NSS) registered by general practitioners (GP) allowed us to explore this further. The study sample consisted of 5806 participants, drawn from 21 general practices. Among participants, 722 (12. 5 %) responded "absolutely agree" to the statement "I am sensitive to noise", comprising the high noise-sensitive (HNS) group. Compared {{to the rest of}} the sample, people in the HNS group reported significantly higher scores on number and duration of self-reported NSS, increased psychological distress, decreased sleep quality and general health, more negative symptom perceptions and higher prevalence of healthcare contacts, GP-registered NSS and prescriptions for antidepressants and benzodiazepines. These results remained robust after adjustment for demographic, residential and lifestyle characteristics, objectively measured nocturnal noise exposure from road-traffic and GP-registered morbidity. Co-occurrence rates with other <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitivities</b> varied between 9 % and 50 %. Individuals with self-declared sensitivity to noise are characterized by high prevalence of multiple NSS, poorer health status and increased illness behavior independently of noise exposure levels. Findings support the notion that different types of <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitivities</b> partly overlap. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Anticipated climatic changes {{combined}} with eutrophication are predicted {{to enhance the}} dominance of several notorious cyanobacterial taxa. Cyanobacteria have many key ecological traits that may allow them to thrive under foreseen scenarios of environmental change. Understanding the ecophysiological traits of harmful species has proven important for their successful control and management. Indeed, if the links between key cyanobacterial traits and the specific environmental conditions that allow expression of these traits can be disrupted, we could identify (novel) means for operational control and mitigate or prevent water quality problems. A good example is artificial mixing of a lake that breaks down the water column stability on which fast floating, buoyant cyanobacteria depend. Based upon Reynolds’ functional phytoplankton classification, we focused on five groups of cyanobacteria that from a management point of view {{can be seen as}} homogeneous and have comparable <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> For each group, we present (1) its key traits, (2) how these characteristics will maintain their function under future environmental change, (3) explanation of how understanding the function of these traits can reveal the “Achilles heel” of the particular functional group and (4) which (combination of) control measures is most likely to be successful. Despite looking for specific <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of individual groups, we maintain that controlling nutrients remains the basis for managing blooms, no matter which functional type dominates. Providing further ecological knowledge to lake management could be the key to effective bloom control and healthier, sustainable freshwater ecosystems even in a warmer future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Chemical and {{electrical}} sensitivities are often invisible disabilities.

Most research has been conducted in the area of chemical sensitivity; persons with chemical sensitivities experience a wide range of negative disabling reactions to common chemicals such as fragrances, pesticides, paints, cleaners, and exhaust fumes. Recent findings indicate that chemical sensitivity is found world-wide and crosses lines of gender, race, and age.

50|$|The {{development}} of GMO {{food and the}} increased use of herbicides on food crops has resulted in an increased interest in the area of <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> A polarized debate has grown between supporters of the new agri-technology who characterize themselves as rational scientists and opponents as ignorant alarmists. On the other hand, the opponents characterize the supporters as dogmatic industry shills and themselves as critical thinkers and environmentalists. Both groups claim to be the majority opinion, although the only consensus that has weight is within the government organizations that rule on safety. At issue is the non-industry science that characterizes herbicides and the genetically engineered pesticides of GMO crops as endocrine disruptors. That disruption also triggers autoimmune system responses consistent with those observed by clinical ecologists.|$|R
