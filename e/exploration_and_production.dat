5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> <b>production</b> {{continued}} {{to expand and}} stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E
5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> <b>production</b> frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E
5|$|The Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land MSA's gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) in 2012 was $489billion, making it the fourth-largest of any metropolitan area in the United States and larger than Austria's, Venezuela's, or South Africa's GDP. Only 26 countries other than the United States have a {{gross domestic}} product exceeding Houston's regional gross area product (GAP). In 2010, mining (which consists almost entirely of <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> <b>production</b> {{of oil and gas}} in Houston) accounted for 26.3% of Houston's GAP up sharply in response to high energy prices and a decreased worldwide surplus of oil production capacity, followed by engineering services, health services, and manufacturing.|$|E

5|$|The federal {{government}} has dedicated nearly 2,000 times more acreage to oil and gas leases than to solar development. In 2010 the Bureau of Land Management approved nine large-scale solar projects, with a total generating capacity of 3,682 megawatts, representing approximately 40,000 acres. In contrast, in 2010, the Bureau of Land Management processed more than 5,200 applications gas and oil leases, and issued 1,308 leases, {{for a total of}} 3.2 million acres. Currently, 38.2 million acres of onshore public lands and an additional 36.9 million acres of offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico are under lease for oil and gas development, <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mining which {{includes}} mostly {{oil and gas}} <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> <b>production</b> in Houston accounts for 11 percent the region's GAPdown from 21 percent as recently as 1985. The reduced role {{of oil and gas}} in Houston's GAP reflects the rapid growth of other sectorssuch as engineering services, health services, and manufacturing. Oil and gas <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> <b>production,</b> however, has increased in reaction to high energy prices and a reduced worldwide surplus oil production capacity.|$|E
