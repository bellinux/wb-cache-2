5|$|In chemistry, {{one central}} issue was the {{distinction}} between organic and inorganic substances, especially {{in the context of}} organic transformations such as fermentation and putrefaction. Since Aristotle these had been considered essentially biological (vital) processes. However, Friedrich Wöhler, Justus Liebig and other pioneers of the rising field of organic chemistry—building on the work of Lavoisier—showed that the organic world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 Wöhler showed that the organic substance urea could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to vitalism. Cell extracts ("ferments") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with <b>diastase</b> in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of enzymes was well established, though equations of chemical kinetics would not be applied to enzymatic reactions until the early 20th century.|$|E

Methods: In a propensity score matching analysis, out of 94 patients who underwent sternal reconstruction, 20 patients were selected: 10 patients underwent sternal reconstruction with bilateral pectoralis muscle flaps (group 1) and 10 underwent sternal rewiring (group 2). Eligibility criteria included the presence of hemisternum <b>diastases</b> associated with multiple (≥ 3) bone fractures and radiologic evidence of synchronous chest wall motion (CWSM).

This young man sustained a high speed car accident and survived an extreme hyperextension injury to the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) without any neurological deficits.

Objective: To describe a rare case of a severe displaced transverse petrous {{temporal bone}} fracture with impending intra-operative exsanguination, treated with fracture reduction and lateral plating in order to achieve hemostasis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of a patient admitted to the neurosurgical department with a hyperacute epidural hematoma (EDH) secondary to a transverse petrous temporal bone fracture with venous sinus and petrous ICA injuries. Results: A 22  year old male was admitted for a severe traumatic brain injury leading to a left displaced transverse petrous temporal bone fracture and a hyperacute EDH. Given the location of the fractures, injury to the venous sinus (at the area of the transverse-sigmoid junction) and petrous ICA was suspected. Intra-operatively, significant blood loss from both the venous sinus and petrous ICA was encountered. Given the displaced temporal bone fracture, packing of the areas was impaired. We performed a manual reduction of the temporal fracture, followed by lateral plating in order to achieve hemostasis from the petrous ICA and aid with packing of the venous sinus injury.

30|$|The {{first series}} of {{patients}} {{had been treated}} surgically by anatomical open reduction and stable internal fixation (ORIF). The fibula was fixed by a plate and the medial malleolus by one cannulated screw. In 4 of the 12 trimalleolar fractures, we performed reduction and fixation of the posterior malleolus by two cannulated screws. In the remaining cases we did not synthesize the posterior bone fragment because it measured < 25 % of the joint surface length, and {{it appeared to be}} well reduced {{at the end of the}} operation. The fracture of the fibula was always fixed first. In all 12 cases of Weber type C fracture and in 1 case of type B, the tibiofibular joint was <b>diastased</b> and we performed a trans-syndesmotic fixation with a screw going through one of the holes of the plate, in order to obtain an anatomical reduction of the diastasis and to further stabilize the osteosynthesis. Immediately after surgery a continuous passive motion machine was applied to the operated ankle, starting with 5 ° of dorsiflexion and 10 ° of plantar flexion. We gradually increased the passive movements of the ankle, in order to reach the maximum dorsiflexion and plantar flexion possible 2  weeks after the operation. The machine was applied full-time for 3  weeks, for the first three postoperative days at the hospital, and subsequently at home. Full-time means at least 8  h during the day and all night. The first day after surgery, patients were allowed to walk for short distances on crutches without weight bearing, wearing an elastic bandage. Gradual weight bearing was started 8  weeks after surgery. In all cases but one, the screw fixing the tibioperoneal syndesmosis was removed under local anesthesia before starting weight bearing.|$|R

Bee digestive enzymes – invertase, amylase, and <b>diastase</b> – along with gastric acid hydrolyze sucrose to a mixture of glucose and fructose. The bees work together as a group with the regurgitation and digestion for as long as 20 minutes until the product reaches storage quality. It is then placed in honeycomb cells left unsealed while still high in water content (about 20%) and natural yeasts, which, unchecked, would cause the sugars in the newly formed honey to ferment. The process continues as hive bees flutter their wings constantly to circulate air and evaporate water from the honey to a content around 18%, raising the sugar concentration, and preventing fermentation. The bees then cap the cells with wax to seal them. As removed from the hive by a beekeeper, honey has a long shelf life and will not ferment if properly sealed.|$|E
