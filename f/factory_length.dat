50|$|By 1886 {{there were}} {{sufficient}} {{people living in}} the district to necessitate the establishment of the Blackall Range School. About 1890 the area became known as Maleny, the same year that a small postal receiving office opened. In the late 1890s farmers in the Maleny area turned to dairying and by 1900 were sending cream by pack horse to Landsborough for railing to the Queensland Meat Export Company's Brisbane butter <b>factory.</b> The <b>length</b> of time it took to transport Maleny cream to Brisbane was problematic, encouraging Maleny farmers to establish their own co-operative dairy factory in 1903-04. The first cream was treated at the new Maleny Butter Factory on 19 December 1904. The factory proved very successful, and was replaced twice before closing in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the panel}} track is laid, a work train (pulled by diesel locomotives) {{can bring in}} the {{sections}} of continuous welded rail {{that will be used}} for the permanent way of this first track. The rail comes from the <b>factory</b> in <b>lengths</b> varying from 200 m (660 ft) to 400 m (1310 ft). Such long pieces of rail are just laid across several flatcars; they are very flexible, so this does not pose a problem. A special crane unloads the rail sections and places them {{on each side of the}} temporary track, approximately 3.5 m (12 ft) apart. This operation is usually carried out at night, for thermal reasons. The rail itself is standard UIC section, 60 kg/m (40 lb/ft), with a tensile strength of 800 newtons per square millimetre or megapascals (116,000 psi).|$|R
50|$|As the {{floodplain}} widens, the riversides become forested with tupelo, bald cypress, red maple, and other water loving vegetation. The uplands from Effingham to Johnsonville, South Carolina are also rich agricultural areas. Tobacco {{is the primary}} money crop for farmers, but cotton, corn, wheat, hay, and vegetables are also grown. Effingham {{is the site of}} McCall Farms, South Carolina's only canning factory. At Johnsonville, the stream passes what was the largest <b>factory</b> along its <b>length,</b> that of Wellman Industries, a fiber processing and recycling plant that has been inactive since 1996. Just below Johnsonville, Lynches River empties into the Great Pee Dee River.|$|R
50|$|The {{road was}} built between 1746 and 1750 {{as part of}} the longer route between Frankfurt and Mainz. As one of the most heavily used roads in Frankfurt, {{factories}} soon sprang up along its length as Germany industrialised in the 19th century, including the headquarters of Adler and Tenovis. A tramway, the modern day lines 11 and 21, soon followed, supported by the industries along its length. By the outbreak of World War I, there were around 40 <b>factories</b> along the <b>length</b> of the road, with more along the many side roads that branch off it.|$|R

However the archaic tooling on which the basic Volga was produced, was not up to standard on the technological level that the new car would require. Moreover, its price was well above the money that a Russian {{was willing to pay}} for a Volga. Thus in 1997 a compromise solution was developed, the GAZ-3111. Retaining most of the chassis architecture from the GAZ-3110 (single rear axle with leaf springs, A-bar front suspension, traditional propshaft drive, etc.), it nonetheless featured completely new body, influenced by the GAZ-3103 with retro-styling elements from the GAZ-21.|$|R
50|$|Before these experts' arrival, Simeon {{has asked}} for experts from Persia, who arrived to Etchmiadzin on June 28, 1775 and built a new factory {{in a short period}} of time. They also taught two {{students}} (Nigoghayos and Markar) how to produce paper in high quality. By these, two factories are built in the city, by French and Persian experts. The French experts' <b>factory</b> had 2240m <b>length</b> and 1008m width. All the expenses were provided by Krikor Agha of Tchakig. There isn't any information about the size of the Persian factory. On April 16, 1776, after the Persian experts finished their work, returned to Persia. On October 28, the young French expert was put out of the job, following the old expert. (The French experts put out of Etchmiadzin because they didn't do their job).|$|R
5000|$|Heinlein's {{vision of}} a Road, always capitalized, was a fully {{enclosed}} Slidewalk or multi-speed conveyor belt whose cargo was people and freight, stretching from city to city, and operating at maximum speeds of 100 miles per hour. The Road City was a consequence of this, clearly noted in the story, where people whose livelihood depended on the Road began to live in new communities built along its <b>length.</b> <b>Factories</b> were located along the Road because of easy transport for their goods and materials. Entire businesses established themselves on the conveyor strips to cater to travelers while they moved from city to city, {{and the people who}} worked in those business lived within easy reach of the Road itself, living in [...] "the country" [...] but working in [...] "the city".|$|R
5000|$|The North American button {{industry}} {{began with}} a German craftsman named John Boepple, who had made buttons from seashells, horns and antlers in his native country.

By 1891, Boepple had set up a shop and was in business as a craftsman making buttons. John Boepple's buttons became popular locally and to ward off competition he was very protective of the secrets of his trade. Since freshwater mussels were so common and the profit potential in making [...] "pearl" [...] buttons was so high, some of Boepple's staff who knew his techniques were [...] "recruited" [...] by other businessmen to start competing businesses.

The area is {{typically}} recognized by bungalow style Craftsman homes built in the 1920s. However it also contains the Ray and Kay Price House, designed by the famed Ralph Rapson, and the Frederick Lang House, designed by Herb Fritz. Minnehaha Falls was once a national attraction and still is an important cultural node of the Twin Cities. The neighborhood's central corridor runs along 42nd Avenue South and is home to many businesses including the Riverview Theater, Turtle Bread Company, The Blue Door Pub, and Mother Earth Gardens. Along the northern edge runs the Midtown Greenway trail and the vibrant East Lake business district, which is home to many award winning restaurants including Le Town Talk Diner, Sonora Grill, and The Craftsman. The west border was once an agri-industrial and milling processing center served by the Northern Pacific Railway. Today the grain silos and <b>factories</b> along the <b>length</b> of the highway are set to make way for new residential condos, apartment buildings, and a new greenway connecting Minnehaha Falls and the Midtown Greenway.

50|$|In {{the early}} days of RB, they also {{produced}} a few other products including a range of lorry-mounted drilling rigs, primarily used for water bore holes. They also produced a design for a self-erecting tower crane in an era when tower cranes were rare. In the 1960s, {{there used to be a}} bridge over the High Street in Lincoln stating that Ruston Bucyrus was the largest Excavator manufacturer in the World. The <b>factory</b> ran the <b>length</b> of Beevor Street, about 900m, apart from a short piece on the north side where a drivebelt manufacturing business was based. The grounds were up to 400m wide. There were more than 30 bays in the factory, most of which were about 150m long, nearly all fitted with overhead cranes. At the far end of the Works, there was an extra-large bay for assembly of the large machines including the 150RB and walking draglines. Beyond that was the testing area where cranes were taken for calibration. The company employed up to 2000 persons on the site with manufacturing on both day and night shifts. With exception of foundry work, virtually all manufacturing processes were completed on site. The machine shops used, for the period, the latest in technology including tape-programming and high-speed tipped tooling. There were eight service depots around the UK and a team of service engineers operated from the Lincoln Works to service international customers. Ruston Bucyrus cranes and excavators had been exported to most parts of the World.|$|R
40|$|The pipavav port {{in western}} Gujarat, India, will be {{developed}} in two phases, one projected for 1997 and the second for 2010. In the first phase four terminals are projected on the northern side of the bay. (See appendix II for {{a map of the}} project site.) One of these terminals will be a multi-purpose terminal for the handling of bagged rice and bagged foodgrain, iron scrap and other general cargo as well as containerized and ro-ro cargo. The cargo will in the first phase be handled by ships gear, supported by one heavy mobile crane and in the second phase t w o additional rail mounted gantry cranes will be installed on the quay. The terminal is projected as a reclaimed island with a solid gravity type berth, connected with the mainland by an approach road. Open and covered storage will be provided directly behind the apron. Warehousing will take place on the mainland. The length of the quay will be 275 m for two berths. The projected cargo volume will be 290, 000 tons in the first phase and 1, 1 20, 000 tons in the second. The second terminal will be a so called common user bulk terminal for the handling of oil cakes, salt, fertilizer and fertilizer raw materials and coal. The loading will be done by one shiploader with an effective loading capacity of some 750 - 1000 ton/h. Unloading will be done with a grab unloader of 700 - 900 ton/h capacity discharging directly on a belt conveyer. Open and covered storage will be provided directly behind the apron in the form of wind row arrangement and storage sheds. The terminal is located directly westward of the multi-purpose terminal. It shares the same approach road. The inland transport of both terminals will be with trucks which can discharge and load on the reclamation. The length of the quay is 425 m hosting two berths. The projected cargo volume will be 2. 4 million tons in the first phase and 4. 1 million tons in the second. The third terminal will be a dedicated cement terminal of 185 m. The terminal will be situated southwest of the common user bulk terminal and constructed as a piled jetty connected to the mainland by a partially piled, partially earth dam approach road. The fourth terminal will be a dedicated copper smelter terminal for the import of dry bulk and the export of liquid bulk. The terminal will be connected to the cement terminal on the southwest side, sharing the same approach road. Storage facilities will probably have to be provided {{in the vicinity of the}} terminal or else on the mainland, near the <b>factory.</b> The <b>length</b> of the quay will be 195 m for one berth.
