50|$|The most {{interesting}} {{feature of the}} Ace was the Guy <b>Disc-Valve</b> motor, created by engineer Fred M Guy, and Otto W. Heinz. Initially, it was prepared as a four-cylinder engine for production in the Hackett, but the company folded before it was ready.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in 1967, the 350 GTR was, for its time, a middleweight {{displacement}} motorcycle, {{and used}} an air-cooled [...] two-stroke parallel-twin engine, which produced [...] at 7,500 rpm. Although a mostly conventional design, the engine used a rotary <b>disc-valve</b> induction system, allowing more precise {{management of the}} gasses inside the engine than traditional piston-port systems did. Two of these disc valves were used (one per cylinder), and a 26 mm Mikuni carburettor was bolted to each one. The six-speed gearbox was also a plus point, as was the ability for the 350 GTR's riders to use either their left foot or their right foot to change gear; the gear lever and rear brake pedals could be swapped around {{in order to allow}} this. However, the gearbox did cause issues for some riders, as neutral was located in an unusual place; {{at the top of the}} gearbox, as most motorcycles placed this gear between first and second. Chassis-wise, the 350 GTR was fairly conventional, as it used a steel twin-cradle frame, gaitered front forks with twin shock absorbers at the rear, 19" [...] wheels and drum brakes.|$|E
40|$|This report {{deals with}} a rare {{complication}} of <b>disc-valve</b> prosthesis in the mitral area. A significant disc poppet and struts destruction of mitral Beall valve prostheses occurred 20 and 17 months after implantation. The resulting valve incompetence {{in the first case}} contributed to the death of the patient. The durability of Teflon prosthetic valves appears to be in question and this type of valve probably will be unacceptable if there is an increasing number of <b>disc-valve</b> variance in the future...|$|E
50|$|The tandem twin layout has {{virtually}} no benefit for a four-stroke engine. The layout is used only with two-stroke engines since these {{must have a}} discrete crankcase chamber per cylinder. The prime advantage of a tandem-twin two-stroke is that the engine can be very narrow while allowing chain final drive without a power-wasting 90° turn. The layout also simplifies the use of intake <b>disc-valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Yamaha FS1-E has a 49 cc single {{cylinder}} two-stroke air-cooled rotary <b>disc-valved</b> engine with a four-speed gearbox. The FS1-E was the FS1 with the suffix E, which stood for England (differing from the models sold {{in other countries}} as the FS1-E had more cycle parts in common with other UK-imported Yamaha models). Yamaha introduced various improvements such as a front disc brake (FS1-E DX model) over the years, and later an autolube model with a two-stroke oil tank and oil pump, with no need to manually mix two-stroke oil into the fuel tank.|$|R
40|$|From 1965 through 1986, 817 {{patients}} underwent {{aortic valve}} replacement at our institution. Six hundred forty-five patients received Starr-Edwards ball valves, including 286 Silastic ball valves (Models 1200 / 1260), 165 cloth-covered caged-ball prostheses (Models 2300 / 2310 / 2320), and 194 track-valve prostheses (Model 2400). In contrast, 172 patients received <b>disc-valve</b> prostheses, including 126 St. Jude Medical aortic bi-leaflet disc valves, 32 Lillehei-Kaster pivoting disc valves, and 14 Björk-Shiley valves (6 convexoconcave and 8 monostrut) ...|$|E
40|$|To compare {{prosthetic}} valve behaviour {{with that}} of the natural aortic valve, experiments were performed in vitro as well as in vivo. In a mock circulation system, cinematographic high-speed recordings of the valvular behaviour were made for Björk-Shiley, St Jude and Hancock heart valve prostheses. Simultaneously with the film recording, the aortic flow and the left ventricular and aortic pressures were measured. The closing behaviour of the natural aortic valve was recorded in in vivo experiments following the same measuring technique. Comparison of the film frames with the aortic flow signal revealed that the mechanical prostheses mainly close due to the back flow in the early phase of diastole; they close only for 5 % of their cross-sectional area during systolic ejection. The Hancock bioprosthesis closes already for 45 % during the flow deceleration phase of systole, which is however significantly less than the corresponding closure of the aortic valve as recorded in vivo (74 %). The change in fluid viscosity from 3. 10 - 3 Ns/m 2 to 1. 10 - 3 Ns/m 2 does not affect the closing behaviour of the mechnaical prostheses. Reducing the peak value of systolic aortic flow by a factor two decreases the cross-sectional area of the prosthetic valves at peak systole. When the natural aortic valve closing mechanism is applied to a <b>disc-valve</b> prosthesis, a partial (30 %) systolic valve closure is found...|$|E
