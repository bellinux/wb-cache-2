5|$|Dead Island, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> about killing zombies, {{not a game}} focused on delivering an emotional experience. Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, Deep Silver. With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled. The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately {{four years after the}} game's initial announcement.|$|E
5|$|Rare then {{developed}} Diddy Kong Racing, {{their first}} self-published game. Originally {{intended as a}} real-time strategy game involving cavemen, the game was re-imagined into a racing game prior to its release in 1997. It {{was one of the}} fastest selling games at the time, as recorded by The Guinness Book of Records. Diddy Kong Racing also features protagonists from some future Rare games, including Banjo and Conker. At the time, Rare was still working on the large-scale platform game. Originally codenamed , <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> featuring a young boy named Edison and pirates. The protagonist was then replaced by a bear known as Banjo, and Rare expanded the role of Kazooie the bird. The two characters were inspired by characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios films and Rare hoped that they could appeal to a younger audience. Banjo-Kazooie was released in June 1998 to critical acclaim. A sequel, Banjo Tooie, was released in 2000. It was a critical success and it outsold the first game, selling 3 million copies.|$|E

Australia, {{who had the}} misfortune to bat on a stickier wicket, were {{dismissed}} for 81 and from 7 for 6 recovered to 70 all out, but that still equated to a further innings defeat. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> decided by the toss and the rain: and ended with an English victory at 1.52pm (before lunch) on the second day.|$|E

2500|$|His {{capabilities}} in defence drew criticism from some coaches, not least his own coach at Wigan. Following {{the game at}} Wakefield Trinity, Noble stated that, [...] "there are other parts of his game he needs to improve." [...] In a pre-match interview before the Magic Weekend in Round 12, St Helens coach Mick Potter stated he was a target for high kicks, {{with the belief that}} Ainscough's opposite winger Ade Gardner, the leading try scorer in 2008's Super League XIII, would put him under pressure. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> Ainscough did not eventually play in.|$|E
2500|$|Gavin Tomlin {{was to make}} {{an instant}} impact, scoring just five minutes into his debut in the home match against Shrewsbury. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> in which the Gulls {{went on to win}} 5-0, a {{particularly}} impressive performance considering the Shrews were currently 4th in the table and had spent the majority of the season in the play-off positions. [...] Even that result was arguably bettered by Torquay’s trip to Gigg Lane three days later where they beat 2nd placed Bury 2-1 after coming back from a goal down. [...] Earlier in the month, Torquay had already claimed four points from two other play-off challengers, grabbing a 1-1 draw with Rotherham and a 2-0 victory against Stevenage. [...] In fact, Torquay seemed to be experiencing more problems against teams lower down in the division; the only defeat of the month came away to Aldershot and the Gulls only just managed to sneak a point with a 91st minute Guy Branston header to secure a 3-3 draw away at Macclesfield.|$|E
2500|$|... 2007 saw Keating’s side {{taken on}} Limerick in their opening game. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> that Tipp were {{expected}} to win, however, Limerick put up a good fight and the game ended in a draw. [...] For the replay of the game Keating made the drastic move of dropping legendary goalkeeper Brendan Cummins. [...] The second game saw Keating’s side lead by ten points at one stage, however, {{by the end of}} the seventy minutes both sides were level once again. [...] A period of extra-time failed to separate these two sides were forced to meet for a third time. [...] Once again extra-time had to be played, however, after nearly four hours of hurling Limerick emerged as the winners. [...] After the defeat Keating looked less than impressed when he was forced to do a television interview alongside ecstatic Limerick manager Richie Bennis. [...] The All-Ireland qualifiers saw Keating’s side win all of their games, including a victory over Cork for the first time since 1991. [...] It looked as if Tipp had come out on the easy side of the draw as their opponents, Wexford, were not regarded as being up to much. [...] Because of this Keating may have been guilty of having one eye on the All-Ireland semi-final. [...] His decision to relegate star forward Eoin Kelly to the substitutes bench baffled many, particularly since Kelly tops the chart as Tipp’s all-time top scorer. [...] The game itself was an exciting one, however, a Damien Fitzhenry penalty sealed the victory for Wexford and dumped Tipp out of the championship. [...] Keating resigned as manager shortly after this defeat.|$|E
