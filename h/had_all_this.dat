In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be <b>had.</b> <b>All</b> <b>this</b> was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E
500|$|After {{engineer}} Glyn Johns {{had failed}} to compile a satisfactory album from the Get Back tapes throughout 1969, the project passed to American producer Phil Spector, via the latter's connection with Beatles manager Allen Klein. Like Lennon, Harrison welcomed Spector's involvement, and he offered a glowing endorsement of the producer's talents on the sleeve of Ike & Tina Turner's album River Deep – Mountain High. In January 1970, Spector was in London discussing the possibility of producing a solo album by Harrison when the latter invited him to a recording session for Lennon's Plastic Ono Band single [...] "Instant Karma!" [...] After this session, Spector urged Harrison to record his album, which would become the triple set All Things Must Pass. In 2011, Spector recalled of the material that Harrison had amassed, such as [...] "Let It Down": [...] "He had literally hundreds of songs, and each one {{was better than the}} rest. He <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> emotion built up... I don't think he had played them to anybody, maybe Pattie." ...|$|E
500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody knew what it was, including the governor." ...|$|E

500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times praised Michael Giacchino's musical score, {{writing that}} [...] "I'm {{reminded}} of the heights of emotion this series can evoke." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post thought that the finale's split and two-week break was [...] "not cool", but asked [...] "how brilliant was Sun's smackdown on her bad daddy?". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that [...] "when Lost is at its best … it manages to balance revelations … with great character moments. [...] I don't know that I'd put this one in the pantheon (again, {{a lot of it}} was set-up for … [...] ), but it was definitely in the spirit of what I love about the show." [...] Kristin dos Santos of E! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel, who play Sayid and Nadia, respectively. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three-hour finale a 7.9. [...] He commended the music and called it [...] "a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale"; however, the lack of suspense in favor of set-up was cited as the reason for the modest rating. However, Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review, tying with other perfect-10 episodes such as [...] "The Constant" [...] and [...] "Through the Looking Glass". He stated that [...] "Not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well-executed conclusion to what has been a fantastic season." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal called [...] "Part 1" [...] "an excellent setup episode [...] fast pace, important revelations, and nearly a full utilization of the cast". [...] Compora decided that [...] "certain characters work much better in very small doses … a little bit of [...] goes a long way [...] it was nice to see Jack featured without completely dominating an episode." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV summed up Part 1 as [...] "very good", but said that the opening flashforward in which the Oceanic Six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and [...] "although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations, it felt patched together and a little sloppy, like Lindelof and Cuse <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> ground to cover in their quest to link all the action up to the final scene of season 3 … That said, the flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well." [...] Daniel of TMZ welcomed the return of Richard (on the island) and gave the episode an [...] "A", saying that it had [...] "more than a few fantastic scenes. [...] All the flashforward scenes tonight were right on the money as far as I was concerned." [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post [...] "really liked this episode" [...] and concluded that it [...] "definitely showcased the new breath of life the fourth season gave to the show." ...|$|E

Consequently, [...] "when Lincoln comes in, she’s a little more open to him [...] and working with someone again." ...|$|E

The album was recorded with no particular concept in mind, and the theme [...] "came after the fact," [...] according to Lamson. After recording, the group [...] " [...] <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> time to just sit on what we had done," [...] and they found the songs happened to come out {{as an expression of}} being grateful. [...] "Like I don't care how bad your life is, there's always something around you to be grateful for," [...] said Guarisco in 2011. [...] "Our songs are a testament to that kind of thinking." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 January 1946, {{he was at}} an {{ammunition}} depot in Savernake Forest when ammunition being loaded from lorries into {{railway trucks}} caught fire. [...] A three-ton lorry, and two twenty-tonne railway wagons were destroyed almost immediately. [...] Secondary explosions then destroyed two more lorries and 27 wagons. [...] In addition to the train being loaded, {{there was also a}} fully loaded train in the freight yard, in all 96 wagons, containing 2000 tons of explosive (5.5inch artillery shells and mines), were threatened by the blaze. [...] It is probable that <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> material been detonated, in addition to killing all the personnel present, severe damage would have been caused to the nearby town of Marlborough.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{customary}} {{to talk of}} Kelly as quintessentially an Irish rider. For my part, though, I {{think it}} helps to place Kelly better as a cyclist {{to see him as}} the last of the Flemish riders. This is usually a title associated with the post-war rider, Briek Schotte who has become appropriately enough the man in day-to-day charge of the de Gribaldy teams. As exemplified by Schotte it stood for a certain type of mentality, willing to suffer, narrowly focussed, and hard, hard, hard. Kelly <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> in him from his Irish small-farm background: the outside loo; the dogs that have to be chained before you can step from your car; the one career possible, as a bricklayer on a construction site, stretching away and away into the grey mists. On the positive side, along with the self-reliance, came a physical strength that even by peasant standards is impressive. In a profession of iron wills, there is no one harder." ...|$|E

2500|$|A DVD extra on Heartbreak And Triumph, and in Michaels's {{autobiography}} of the same, titled The Rockers [...] "Fight" [...] reveals {{that they got}} into a legit fight in May 1991 that was instigated by Roddy Piper. The incident according to Michaels happened as the boys were intoxicated, Piper, also drunk, started talking about how Michaels would be an even greater competitor in the business, that he would even be {{the future of the}} business. Piper stated, that [...] "Michaels had had a great future in the business and that Michaels <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> talent". Jannetty, believing that to be an insult to him challenged Shawn to a fight to which Shawn declined. Marty however, would not take no for answer and attacked Michaels which started the fight. Piper pulled the two apart, and Michaels passed out right after, and wouldn't come to until the next day. The story, told by Jannetty, reveals that police were called to the scene and arrested Jannetty. As they were arresting him though, Randy Savage stepped in and prevented him from going to jail by telling the police that it was all part of a storyline even though in reality he did not know the cause of the fight in the first place. Michaels almost quit the WWF over the incident, and Jannetty believes that this incident was one of the factors in the WWF's decision to break up The Rockers.|$|E
