5|$|To the {{practical}} ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification {{in being able}} to ascertain the distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance, whether at rest, or during their flight; for not only every genus <b>has</b> <b>something</b> peculiar to itself, but each species has its own appropriate marks, by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost with certainty.|$|E
5|$|An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory is a 2010 {{textbook}} by the British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane. It is {{the first}} book in the publisher Palgrave Macmillan's Animal Ethics Series, edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn. Cochrane's book examines five schools of political theory—utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism—and their respective relationships with questions concerning animal rights and the political status of (non-human) animals. Cochrane concludes that each tradition <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to offer to these issues, but ultimately presents his own account of interest-based animal rights as preferable to any. His account, though drawing from all examined traditions, builds primarily upon liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Mr. Gold asks Emma {{to track}} down Ashley. He claims that she <b>has</b> <b>something</b> that belongs to him and that Ashley is {{unstable}} and troubled. Emma reluctantly agrees, and learns from Ruby (Meghan Ory) that she should stop by the home of her ex-boyfriend Sean (Phillipps). Emma goes there and speaks to Sean and his father, finding {{out that it is}} the latter that has told him not to get involved with the pregnant teenager. Emma discovers that Ruby has given her car to Ashley so that she can leave Storybrooke and head to Boston. Emma and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) find the vehicle has crashed just short of the city's limits, with Ashley about to deliver the baby.|$|E

5|$|This ending was the {{favourite}} {{amongst the}} actors. Mangan {{said that the}} alternative ending was the best moment {{in the whole of}} Green Wing. However, the alternative ending was rejected and the writers favoured the ending that was eventually broadcast. It is believed that the alternative ending would have been broadcast if a third series was being made, as that ending was much more ambiguous, since Alan and Joanna are still seen alive and Mac tells Caroline that he still <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to say.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose <b>has</b> <b>something</b> {{to offer to}} his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to {{question}} their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Tim {{investigate}} Hank’s alibi further, and it checks out, {{leading to}} his release. Veronica and Tim find secret phone recordings kept by Hank. Veronica brings Keith the CD, but he informs her that Hank has disappeared as well. We see Hank {{showing up on}} Mindy’s boat. While listening to the phone calls, Veronica notices Mindy and Hank talking about a place named “Papa’s cabin”. They investigate the most recent phone calls made by Hank, and find that his alibi was faked—he was helping the witness’s son escape foster care. Keith comes {{up with the idea}} that Papa’s cabin <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to do with Ernest Hemingway. Keith visits the cabin, a retreat in Central America, before boarding the motorboat. He finds Hank, who says that he was working with her to kill the Dean. He says that he and Mindy had a fight, and Mindy fell overboard. We see Mindy’s body washed up on a beach.|$|E

How mankind ever came to be afflicted with wiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a pit of it, I don't know; so it is." ...|$|R

5|$|On the October 10 {{episode of}} Raw, Heyman, on Lesnar's behalf, {{challenged}} Goldberg to a fight after the pair had been feuding {{for several months}} through social media and during promotional work for the WWE 2K17 video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. Heyman stated that Goldberg was the one blemish on Lesnar's WWE career, as Goldberg had defeated Lesnar at WrestleMania XX in 2004. On the October 17 episode of Raw, Goldberg returned to the WWE after a twelve-year absence and accepted Lesnar's request for a fight with their match later scheduled for Survivor Series. On the final Raw before Survivor Series, Lesnar and Goldberg had a confrontation {{for the first time}} in twelve years, resulting in a brawl with security after Heyman insulted Goldberg's family. On November 20 at Survivor Series, Lesnar lost to Goldberg in 1 minute and 26 seconds, marking the first time in three years that Lesnar was pinned. The next night on Raw, Goldberg declared himself the first entrant in the 2017 Royal Rumble match. The following week on Raw, Heyman addressed the Survivor Series match, stating that they underestimated Goldberg and that the match was a humiliation and embarrassment for him and Lesnar, who would also be in the Royal Rumble as he <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to prove. Lesnar returned on the January 16 episode of Raw to confront other Royal Rumble participants, attacking Sami Zayn, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns. At the Royal Rumble on January 29, Lesnar entered at number 26 and went on to eliminate Enzo Amore, Dean Ambrose and Dolph Ziggler before confronting Goldberg, who entered at number 28 and quickly eliminated Lesnar after a spear.|$|E

Using the collected magical energy of these people, Plokta creates an army of Mindless Ones. When challenged by Captain Britain, Plokta reveals he <b>has</b> <b>something</b> Brian may want; Meggan. Captain Midlands betrayed his remaining comrades, allowing them to be captured by Plokta briefly. When the team eventually defeated Plokta, Midlands was taken into custody.|$|E
25|$|Through water {{communications}} systems are {{more suitable for}} scuba as the diver is not encumbered by a communications cable, but they can be fitted to surface supplied equipment if desired. Most through water systems have a Push To Talk (PTT) system, so that high power is only used to transmit the signal when the diver <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to say. For commercial diving applications this is a disadvantage, in that the supervisor can not monitor the condition of the divers by hearing them breathe.|$|E
25|$|His basic {{approach}} was to combine several fundamental constants {{in order to}} produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 1040, its square, or its square root. He was convinced that the mass of the proton and the charge of the electron were a natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, Paul Dirac, also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the Dirac large numbers hypothesis, and some scientists even today believe it <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to it.|$|E

Granger explains that man <b>has</b> <b>something</b> the phoenix does not: mankind can remember its mistakes and try never to repeat them. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built, so that way people can take {{a long look at}} themselves and reflect on their lives.

On Easter 1975, another circuit layout, {{measuring}} 1.654 miles, came into use. Oulton Park is unique amongst the new post-World War II circuits in that it is a true road circuit whilst its contemporaries were, with one exception, converted airfields (the exception being the short-lived Blandford).

The game then cuts back to the opening scene, as the player receives a message from Pete.
