Two FBI agents inside the unit tried to alert FBI headquarters, but CIA officers rebuffed them.|$|E
5|$|Military clashes {{continued}} in Huainan and Sichuan, but Jin incursions after Caishi had no intent {{of reaching the}} Yangtze. The Jin <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> southern China's many lakes and rivers impeded their cavalry. They signed a peace treaty with the Song in 1165, ending hostilities. The Huai River border remained the same and the Song continued to pay annual indemnities to the Jin, but the Song no longer recognized their state as a Jin vassal.|$|E
5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots were coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E

5|$|When the Eretrians <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the Persian {{task force}} was heading to attack them, they had {{appealed to the}} Athenians to send reinforcements. The Athenians agreed to this, and {{instructed}} the 4,000 Athenian colonists from the nearby Euboean city of Chalcis to aid the Eretrians. These colonists had been planted on Chalcidian land after Athens had defeated Chalcis some 20 years previously. However, when these Athenians arrived at Eretria, they were told by a leading citizen, Aeschines, of the divisions amongst the Eretrians, and he advised them to leave and save themselves. The Athenians followed Aeschines' advice and sailed to Oropus, thus avoiding {{the fate of the}} Eretrians.|$|E
5|$|Alex {{was born}} on July 18, 1992. She grew up in Oakland, California, with her parents Michael and Sita. Her father was an {{alcoholic}} and physically abusive towards his wife. When Alex was in her pre-teenage years, Michael was killed during a violent episode against Sita. The police declined to press charges, unaware that Alex was responsible for Michael's death. Alex was then sent to live with Sita's family in Mumbai, India. Alex returned to the United States, where she enrolled at the FBI Academy in 2015. Unknown to the Bureau, Alex <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> {{her father was a}} former FBI agent and had applied to learn more about his past. Alex kept her activities a secret from Sita, telling her mother that she was starting graduate school. A stuffed bear wearing a UC Berkeley sweater can be seen on her desk in the fifteenth episode of the first season, suggesting that she may have attended the University of California, Berkeley, prior to enrolling at Quantico.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his success with United, Bruce was {{contacted}} by Jack Charlton, manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, who <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that,</b> due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a friendly match was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a UEFA-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country. He has subsequently claimed that he chose not to play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with the}} choice of {{remaining}} with Clarkson, whose plans were nullified by SDCC's decision, or cooperating with the council, Maguire chose the former and with Mulden's financing, initiated a High Court judicial review of the decision. The review failed and on 11 April 2005, facing debts of over two million Euro, the club entered into examinership. The 400 Club agreed to completely bankroll the club during the process. On 5 May 2005, Tony Maguire resigned on request by the FAI, who <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the club had submitted their 2003 accounts in their {{application for a licence}} for the 2005 season. This resulted in a points deduction and subsequent relegation under Roddy Collins. The examinership concluded in July 2005 with the examiner accepting the 400 Club's bid for Shamrock Rovers, saving the club from extinction, and the supporters-owned club won promotion at the first attempt in 2006 under Pat Scully. The 2007 and 2008 seasons at Tolka Park were ones of overachievement and stability, but the major event of the period was the recommencement of building on the stadium after more than two years of legal disputes between the council and Thomas Davis CLG.|$|E

25|$|The genus {{was first}} {{published}} in 1871 by Louis and Charles Tulasne who <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> two species (Sebacina incrustans and S.epigaea) previously referred to Corticium or Thelephora possessed septate basidia, similar to those found in the genus Tremella. Although it was unusual at that time to separate fungal genera on purely microscopic characters, Sebacina was erected for effused, Corticium-like fungi with tremelloid basidia.|$|E

25|$|On 27 September 1915, Townshend's forces {{approached}} the Ottoman {{positions at the}} Es Sinn. Over the previous days, air and cavalry reconnaissance had scouted the area and located the camouflaged Ottoman defenses as best they could. Scouts <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the area between the Ataba and Suwaikiya Marshes, north of the Ottoman lines, was passable for a heavy formation. Rather than attacking the position head on, Townshend opted for a complicated plan to envelop the Nureddin's forces.|$|E

25|$|King Frederick William III was indulgent of the {{relationship}} between his son William and Elisa, but the Prussian court <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> her ancestors had purchased their princely title from Emperor Maximilian I, and she was not deemed noble enough to marry a potential King of Prussia. Ironically, Crown Princess Elisabeth Ludovika, who as a Bavarian princess was considered to be of correct rank, counted both Bogusław Radziwiłł and Janusz Radziwiłł among her ancestors, albeit through female descent.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005, {{workers at}} Agriprocessors’ {{distribution}} site in Brooklyn voted {{to join the}} United Food and Commercial Workers union. The company did not recognize the vote, arguing that it was invalid because management <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> many of the workers who participated were in the US illegally, making their votes invalid despite protection granted undocumented workers in the National Labor Relations Act. A National Labor Relations Board judge decided against the company and ordered it to recognize the vote. Workers alleged that Agriprocessors paid low wages, failed to pay overtime and immediately terminated employment of workers who complained about conditions or wages.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consultant}} to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR), Laue met Walther Meissner who was working there on superconductivity. Meissner <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> a weak magnetic field decays rapidly to zero in the interior of a superconductor, which is known as the Meissner effect. Laue showed in 1932 that the threshold of the applied magnetic field which destroys superconductivity varies with the shape of the body. Laue published a total of 12 papers and a book on superconductivity. One of the papers was co-authored with Fritz London and his brother Heinz. Meissner published a biography on Laue in 1960.|$|E

Examining and measuring Change radiation, he <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> all known Change Projectors were actually redistributors of Change radiation from a single source, a so-called Grand Projector. Were this projector destroyed, all creatures would cease to function, and the Overlords would likely be removed whence they came. Having discovered {{the source of the}} Change Radiation - at Mount Silverstone - they set out with Deceptors to find and destroy the source, which would hopefully bring reality back to normal.|$|E

Davis hoisted the flags of a British man-of-war and was allowed to enter the harbour. After a few days, Davis invited the governor to lunch on board his ship, intending to hold him hostage for a ransom. Davis had to send boats to collect the governor, and {{he was invited to}} call at the fort for a glass of wine first.
