And the IT related professions, such as computer science and software engineering should bear more responsibility. In the open era, we can take advantages of various resources, such as we can cooperate with enterprises, social education institutions, industry organizations and alumni, to help our undergraduates become useful personnel. School administrators have huge innovative space in transforming traditional teaching-step, adopting new education-model, and taking part in discipline competitions.
