5|$|Sources {{describing}} Fuller's movements {{after her}} time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but {{found it difficult to}} realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.|$|E
5|$|Herbert de Losinga was {{appointed}} a papal legate in 1093 by Pope UrbanII {{to investigate the}} matter of Thomas' profession of obedience to Lanfranc. Herbert seems to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> about investigating the issue. Also in 1093, King WilliamII gave the Archbishops of York the right to appoint the Abbot of Selby Abbey in compensation {{for the loss of}} York's claim to the Diocese of Lincoln. While Anselm was in exile after quarrelling with the King in 1097, Thomas consecrated Herbert de Losinga as Bishop of Norwich, Ralph de Luffa to the See of Chichester, and Hervey le Breton as Bishop of Bangor, an unusual step because these dioceses were in Canterbury's province, and it was Anselm's right to consecrate the new bishops. In 1100 after the sudden death of King WilliamII and the seizure of power by the King's younger brother Henry, Thomas arrived in London too late to crown HenryI, as the ceremony had already been performed by Maurice, Bishop of London, in the absence of both archbishops. Anselm at this time was still in exile. Thomas was initially angry at the slight, until it was explained to him that the King had worried over the chance of disorder in the kingdom if there was a delay. To mollify him, Thomas was allowed to crown the King publicly at a church council held soon after the coronation.|$|E

25|$|Some {{asserted}} that Rachmaninoff's music was derivative, {{perhaps because he}} was a Romantic at heart and eschewed much of the contemporary revolution in musical thought which was emerging in the early 20th century.

25|$|In Calvinist (Reformed) theology, {{unconditional}} {{election is}} considered to be one aspect of predestination in which God chooses certain individuals to be saved. Those elected receive mercy, while those not elected, the reprobates, receive justice without condition. This unconditional election is essentially related {{to the rest of the}} TULIP doctrinal outline and hinges upon the supreme belief in the absolute sovereignty of God over the affairs of man. God unconditionally elects certain people even though they are sinful as an act of his saving grace apart from the shortcomings or will of man. Those chosen <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> to deserve this grace.|$|E

25|$|On about August 9 Armijo {{called a}} meeting {{with a number of}} {{respected}} New Mexicans. He did not want to fight, but the priests present did, as did the young regular-army commander, Diego Archuleta, and the young militia officers Manuel Chaves and Miguel Pino. According to a refugee from the war, Armijo would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> toward defense if the latter two had not threatened to shoot him. Then on August 12 or 13 he received an American named James Magoffin, the husband of a relative of his, who later claimed to have convinced Armijo not to fight. An unverified story says that Magoffin bribed them. Magoffin later requested a reimbursement from the U. S. Treasury of $50,000, of which he received $30,000.|$|E
25|$|On 9 December 2014, {{police in}} Stockholm raided the company's {{premises}} and seized servers and other computers and equipment, {{which resulted in}} the website going offline. The raid was in response to a complaint from Rights Alliance, a Swedish anti-piracy group. The Pirate Bay was one of many peer-to-peer and torrent-related websites and apps that went down. One member of the crew was arrested. TorrentFreak reported that most other torrent sites reported a 5–10% increase in traffic from the displaced users, though the shutdown had little effect on overall piracy levels. In retaliation to the raid, a group of hackers claiming to be part of Anonymous allegedly leaked email log-in details of Swedish government officials. The Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde commented in a blog post that he was happy to see the website shut down, believing his successors <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> to improve the site, criticising in particular the increased use of advertisements. IsoHunt has since copied much of the original TPB database and made it accessible through oldpiratebay.org, a searchable index of old Pirate Bay torrents. IsoHunt also released a tool called The Open Bay, to allow users to deploy their own version of the Pirate Bay website. The tool is responsible for around 372 mirror sites. Since 17 December 2014, The Pirate Bay's Facebook page has been unavailable. On 22 December 2014, a website was resumed at the domain thepiratebay.se, showing a flip clock with the length of time in days and hours that the site had been offline, and a waving pirate flag. From this day TPB was hosted for a period in Moldova, on Trabia Network (Moldo-German company) servers. The Pirate Bay then began using the services of CloudFlare, a company which offers reverse proxy services. On 1 January 2015, the website presented a countdown to 1 February 2015. The website returned with a prominent phoenix logo displayed at the domain thepiratebay.se on 31 January 2015.|$|E

In Fairfax County, only George Washington owned more, and Mason is {{not known}} to have freed any even in his will, in which his slaves were divided among his children. The childless Washington, in his will, ordered his slaves be freed after his wife's death, and Jefferson manumitted a few slaves, mostly of the Hemings family. According to Broadwater, [...] "In all likelihood, Mason believed, or {{convinced}} himself, {{that he had no}} options. [...] Mason would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> that might have compromised the financial futures of his nine children." [...] Peter Wallenstein, in his article about how writers have interpreted Mason, argued that he could have freed some slaves without harming his children's future, if he had wanted to.|$|E

It was Hay's job to persuade potential supporters that McKinley was worth backing. Nevertheless, Hay found time for a lengthy stay in New Hampshire—one visitor at The Fells in mid-1895 was Rudyard Kipling—and later [...] in the year wrote, [...] "The summer wanes and I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> for McKinley." [...] He atoned with a $500 check to Hanna, the first of many.

500|$|Burke's {{law firm}} had {{employed}} Joseph A. Martinez, {{a real estate}} tax appeal attorney, as a full-time partner since about 1977, when in 1981 Mayor Jane Byrne appointed Martinez to replace the resigning 31st Ward Alderman Chester Kuta. Martinez served out the remainder of Kuta's term but declined to run for re-election when the ward committeeman endorsed a challenger. Between 1985 and 1992, Martinez received $91,000 in wages and benefits for doing little or no work for City Council committees, and was a target of Operation Haunted Hall. In April 1995, after the federal subpoena of Council committee personnel records, Martinez returned the $91,000, sending cash to City Hall in three installments. He was charged and pleaded guilty on January 23, 1997. In his plea agreement, he admitted he was a ghost payroller on City Council committees, starting with the Finance Committee in 1987, {{and said that he}} was employed in each committee job [...] "in order to receive health insurance". Martinez's attorney said Burke got Martinez the jobs because Burke's law firm did not provide health insurance. In a statement, Burke wrote, [...] "A memorandum filed in Mr. Martinez's case [...] asserted that I participated in a scheme that gave rise to these charges. This allegation is untrue. I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong in connection with this matter." [...] Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mike Royko wrote, [...] "You would think that a bright fellow such as Burke - whose father was a ward boss and an alderman - would know better..." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{presentation}} of evidence against her, Mary broke down and pointed accusingly at Walsingham saying, [...] "all {{of this is the}} work of Monsieur de Walsingham for my destruction", to which he replied, [...] "God is my witness that as a private person I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> unworthy of an honest man, and as Secretary of State, nothing unbefitting my duty." [...] Mary was found guilty and the warrant for her execution was drafted, but Elizabeth hesitated to sign it, despite pressure from Walsingham. Walsingham wrote to Paulet urging him to find [...] "some way to shorten the life" [...] of Mary to relieve Elizabeth of the burden, to which Paulet replied indignantly, [...] "God forbid that I should make so foul a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot to my poor posterity, to shed blood without law or warrant." [...] Walsingham made arrangements for Mary's execution; Elizabeth signed the warrant on 1 February 1587 and entrusted it to William Davison, who had been appointed as junior Secretary of State in late September 1586. Davison passed the warrant to Cecil and a privy council convened by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge agreed to carry out the sentence as soon as was practical. Within a week, Mary was beheaded. On hearing of the execution, Elizabeth claimed not to have sanctioned the action and that she had not meant Davison to part with the warrant. Davison was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Walsingham's share of Elizabeth's displeasure was small because he was absent from court, at home ill, in the weeks just before and after the execution. Davison was eventually released in October 1588, on the orders of Cecil and Walsingham.|$|E
