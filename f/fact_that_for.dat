5|$|The {{question}} however has to {{be considered}} {{on the basis of}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.|$|E
5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|In {{her account}} of the affair, Margaret Macaulay explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a {{significant}} factor and notes that although numerous documents {{from the hands of}} Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children. Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour. Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun. Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale {{from the perspective of the}} descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.|$|E

25|$|Frank Williams had {{admitted}} that he had regretted parting with BMW but stated that Toyota had tremendous ability to become a top engine supplier. Speculation had been surrounding Toyota's future on the Formula 1 grid. This was due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a big budget team, Toyota had only managed second place as their best result. In December 2008, Williams confirmed their commitment to F1 following the Honda withdrawal announcement.|$|E
25|$|This {{property}} {{stems from}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> each n, the sum of nth powers of an algebraic integer x and its conjugates is exactly an integer; this follows from an application of Newton's identities. When x is a Pisot number, the nth powers of the other conjugates tend to 0 as n tends to infinity. Since the sum is an integer, the distance from xn to the nearest integer tends to 0 at an exponential rate.|$|E

Dole was criticized by Democrats during her first Senate campaign over the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> over 40 years prior to her nomination, she had not lived in North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in 1903 {{at the age}} of 24, {{her plans}} to study to become a teacher in Tokyo came to nothing. In a letter to Mrs. Abendanon, R.A.

This was despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> its part, the Dutch Education Department had finally given permission for R.A. Kartini and R.Ay. Rukmini to study in Batavia.|$|E
25|$|The {{links between}} the two nations remains strong, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the last two centuries a great number of Montenegrins had emigrated to Serbia further {{strengthens}} the ties. The Montenegrin littoral is still the main turistic destination for citizens of Serbia, and a large population of Serbians own property in Montenegro. Many of these properties consist of summer homes, and contribute to a seasonal influx of Serbs in Montenegro, during the summers. Despite the geopolitical separation, the economic balance and relationship shared between the two countries continues to be strong.|$|E

25|$|Airy wave theory uses a {{potential}} flow (or velocity potential) approach {{to describe the}} motion of gravity waves on a fluid surface. The use of – inviscid and irrotational – potential flow in water waves is remarkably successful, given its failure to describe many other fluid flows where it is often essential to take viscosity, vorticity, turbulence and/or flow separation into account. This {{is due to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the oscillatory part of the fluid motion, wave-induced vorticity is restricted to some thin oscillatory Stokes boundary layers at the boundaries of the fluid domain.|$|E
25|$|The date of {{foundation}} of a church in Berkhamsted town is uncertain; a chapel certainly existed {{within the walls of}} Berkhamsted Castle from the 11th Century, rebuilt around 1250 by Richard of Cornwall. The possibility exists of another town chapel dedicated to St James; this is supported by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> many centuries, the Berkhamsted town fair was held on the feast day of St James rather than at Petertide, suggesting an ancient celebration of the patron saint. It is thought that this chapel of St James stood on the present site of the town Post Office.|$|E
25|$|During the 2011 England riots, Eltham {{received}} {{national attention}} {{due to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> three nights, a vigilante group of 200–300 people occupied the centre of Eltham, claiming to protect people and property from rioters. Extra police were sent to maintain order. The group gathered after rumours that Eltham would be the latest place {{to be hit by}} unrest. A small number claimed to be EDL members, others were supporters of local football clubs Charlton Athletic and Millwall. Police were forced to move the crowds on for fear of violence. Police were involved in minor clashes. Eltham did not have any riot damage.|$|E

25|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> many years, {{no other}} {{scholars}} besides Smith {{were known to}} have seen the manuscript contributed to the suspicions of forgery. This dissipated {{with the publication of}} color photographs in 2000, and the revelation that Guy Stroumsa and several others had viewed the manuscript in 1976. In response to the idea that Smith had kept other scholars from inspecting the manuscript, Scott G. Brown noted that he was in no position to do so. The manuscript was still where Smith had left it when Stroumsa and company found it eighteen years later, and it did not disappear until many years after its relocation to Jerusalem and its separation from the book.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{universal}} behaviors in the furry fandom {{is the creation of}} a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona – an anthropomorphic avatar or representation of themselves. Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas; in part, {{this is due to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their ideal self. The most popular fursona species include wolves, foxes, dogs, large felines, and dragons. Data suggest that there are generally no associations between personality traits and different fursona species. However, furries, along with sport fans, report different degrees of personality traits when thinking of themselves in their everyday identity compared with their fan identity. Some furries identify as partly non-human: 35% say they do not feel 100% human (compared with 7% of non-furries), and 39% say they would be 0% human if they could (compared with 10% of non-furries).|$|E

500|$|The main Byzantine {{source for}} the period, Theophylact Simocatta, {{displays}} a marked bias in favour of Priscus, especially in its account of the Balkan campaigns, where the other generals are denigrated and made to appear incompetent, with their achievements regularly belittled while Priscus's successes are extolled and his defeats glossed over. This {{may be due to}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> this period, Simocatta relied on a semi-official [...] "campaign log" [...] compiled during the years of Emperor Phocas, when Priscus was pre-eminent while most of his rivals were either executed or in exile.|$|E

For Debnath, [...] "the best was saved till last", but the whole episode was [...] "tightly written". Patrick Mulkern (Radio Times), too, said that [...] "this dark tale soon works a devilish spell". Christine Brandel, writing for {{entertainment}} website PopMatters, particularly praised the episode's [...] "beautifully done" [...] dialogue, saying that [...] "it feels authentic in its phrasing, even during the more bizarre (and hilarious) court scenes". Owen, similarly, said [...] "the dialogue was also frequently hilarious, with Shearsmith and Pemberton having a fine ear for the rhythms of Olde English {{and how best to}} have characters deadpan their way through some ridiculous sentences." [...] Hawksley praised Warner's [...] "effortlessly batty" [...] performance as Sir Andrew Pike, and claimed that Sheen [...] "brought an unsettling complexity" [...] to the title character. Gerard Gilbert, of The Independent, claimed Warner was clearly [...] "having a ball" [...] as Pike, and Wright (The Guardian) said [...] "Warner quite brilliantly makes the most of every line he's given". Brandel considered Warner one of the best guest stars of the series.|$|E
