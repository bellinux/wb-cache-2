40|$|Though the {{pervasive}} rumor that the “traditional” dissertation persists {{because of the}} “I suffered, so they too should suffer” mentality — the professor revenge theory — students are often the ones eager to pin down writing genres {{so that they can}} master them. However, hopes to stabilize and thus capture the secret or equation of the <b>dissertation</b> <b>genre</b> are futile, since genres, like language, are alive: rhetorical, evolving, and flexible. Thus, to demonstrate the contemporary context of the <b>dissertation</b> <b>genre,</b> the conflicting perspectives of university stakeholders, the forces working on the genre to enact change, and the process by which genre knowledge develops and transfers in the highest levels of university writing, Mapping <b>Dissertation</b> <b>Genre</b> Ecology explores the discourse, both written and spoken, which constitutes the dissertation as a discursive construct — what I call the <b>dissertation</b> <b>genre</b> ecology. To better understand how dissertations are shaped institutionally, I ask the following questions: How is the dissertation as a genre constituted by various stakeholder groups at the university? How do these myriad accounts contribute to a larger system, a <b>dissertation</b> <b>genre</b> ecology at the university? And, ultimately, how does the <b>dissertation</b> <b>genre</b> ecology affect genre change? Through the use of rhetorical genre theory, my study develops a broad, interdisciplinary conception of genre, one that is not mired in formalistic worries about fixing genre in place. I use the voices of students and faculty from the humanities and social sciences as well as interdisciplinary documents as data for this project. By examining these discursive artifacts and making institutional tensions explicit, my project has broad implications for WAC/WID literature in transfer and genre studies...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} on dissertation writing fails to embed {{it within the}} context of different, and often competing institutional forces constituting the genre expectations associated with producing the dissertation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the negotiations of dissertation writers in a large Midwestern research university across a range of different activity systems: the Graduate School, department, advisor, committee, employment, and potential job market as different "layered " (Prior, 1998) systems. Analysis of interview data of 11 writers indicated that writers perceived marked differences in the objects/outcomes, roles, norms, and genre tools to vary across these different systems. While the Graduate School and departments formulated one set of expectations, the advisor or committee articulated different expectations for completing the dissertation. Writers also experienced time conflicts between the demands of teaching and writing. And, they experienced conflicting outcomes for the dissertation related to writing for an advisor or committee as opposed to positioning themselves for the job market, creating ambiguity related to their dissertation audience. They also noted that the research university positions the <b>dissertation</b> <b>genre</b> as preparing students for positions in other research universities as opposed work in universities in which teaching is a priority...|$|E
40|$|Research {{into the}} luxury debate in 18 th century Sweden {{has focused on}} poetry and literature, the wording of decrees and the minutes of the Swedish riksdag. One source {{material}} largely left unexplored is the body of dissertations published by Swedish universities of the time. Not only is this an unfortunate omission as the universities were important intellectual centres, {{but also because they}} had a distinct culture, heavily influenced by Latin and the classics, in which luxury condemnations played a pivotal role. Building on the notion that ideas are best studied as arguments in debates, this master’s thesis examines twelve dissertations published in Sweden in the years 1722 – 1779 using models of conceptual change and argumentation analysis as theoretical approaches. The results indicate that the academic debate on luxury, through its focus on classical antiquity and conceptual definition, distinguished itself from other contemporary Swedish contributions to the debate, and that the interpretation of its characteristics must proceed from both the <b>dissertation</b> <b>genre</b> and the learned culture of university. The investigation furthermore stresses the importance of the university as a venue for reception of ideas {{in the latter part of}} the Early Modern Period and emphasises the dissertations as a central medium in this process...|$|E
40|$|Research degrees are {{a recent}} {{phenomenon}} in the emergent academic design disciplines, and design practitioners and academics still debate their characteristics. Practice-based degrees may incorporate studio and other project work {{as part of the}} submission and the dissertation may exhibit variation in the visual and textual modes employed. The production of ‘hybrid’ practice-based <b>dissertation</b> <b>genres</b> has consequences for research, supervision and writing pedagogies. The academic literacies approach stresses the need for students, faculty, and others to acknowledge the fundamentally underdetermined forms and conventions of dissertation writing and to work together for greater transparency in giving and getting feedback. If design fields wish to pursue the hybrid genres that practice-led project incorporating projects demand, a relevant writing pedagogy must be developed which looks beyond current conventions. Including evidence from an analysis of four recent practice-based doctorates with data from qualitative interviews with design educators, this paper argues for the relevance of academic literacies for dissertation writing and project work in design. In the final part of the paper I argue for the particular relevance of academic literacies for design research practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between humor and politics {{has been a}} frequently discussed issue for communication researchers in the new millennium. The rise and success of shows like The Daily Show and The Colbert Report force a reevaluation of the {{relationship between}} journalism and politics. Through archival research of scripts, programs, and surrounding discourses this dissertation looks to the past and historicizes news parody as a distinct genre on American television. Since the 1960 s several programs on network and cable parodied mainstream newscasts and newsmakers. More recent examples of this genre circulate within the same discursive field as traditional television news, thereby functioning both as news in their own right and as a corrective to traditional journalism grounded in practices of objectivity.

40|$|This study explores MBA students’ {{experiences}} of academic writing, and endeavours {{to determine the}} difficulties experienced by MBA students during the writing of their dissertations {{especially in terms of}} academic literacy. Case study research design and mixed methods were used to generate both quantitative and qualitative data in this qualitative study. A constant comparative method of analysis was used to identify categories and themes within the data. The results of this research showed that the majority of MBA students, while at Business School X, viewed their identities primarily as business professionals as opposed to students of business in an academic setting. Findings of the study showed that MBA students’ identities as readers and writers are strongly framed by the business genres they encounter in their professional capacities. The study also revealed that MBA students writing their dissertations desire to produce a professionally relevant research document as much as one that meets the requirements of academic rigour. It is within this arena of academic research writing that a dilemma exists for MBA students with reference to the purpose, format and value of the dissertation as a vehicle for reporting research findings. Recommendations are that academic literacies and genre pedagogy are mainstreamed into the course design of the MBA programme at Business School X and that the repurposing of the <b>dissertation</b> as a <b>genre</b> be evaluated in terms of business relevance...|$|R
40|$|Common {{thought about}} cinema {{calls to mind}} an {{audience}} seated in a darkened theatre watching projected moving images that unfold a narrative onto a single screen. Cinema {{is much more than}} this. There is a significant history of artists experimenting with the moving image outside of its familiar setting in a movie theatre. These investigations are often referred to as "expanded cinema". 	This <b>dissertation</b> proposes a <b>genre</b> of expanded cinema called haptic cinema, an approach to interactive narrative that emphasizes material object sensing, identification and management; viewer's interaction with material objects; multisequential narrative; and the presentation of visual and audio information through multiple displays to create a sensorially rich experience for viewers. The interactive digital media tabletop is identified as one platform on which to develop haptic cinema. This platform supports a subgenre of haptic cinema called tabletop cinema. Expanded cinema practices are analyzed for their contributions to haptic cinema. Based on this theoretical and artistic research, the thesis claims that haptic cinema contributes to the historical development of expanded cinema and interactive cinema practices. I have identified the core properties of a haptic cinema practice during the process of designing, developing and testing a series of haptic cinema projects. These projects build on and make use of methods and conventions from tangible interfaces, tangible narratives and tabletop computing. Ph. D.

40|$|This <b>dissertation</b> foregrounds <b>genre</b> as a politically-charged {{modality}} {{in early}} twentieth-century American literature, specifically the entangled relations between realism, romance, and naturalism {{through which the}} shifting formations of race and gender reproduce or challenge transnational capitalism’s reifying processes. My readings of articulations of racialized and gendered subjectivity during two pivotal periods in US history offers {{a new way of}} understanding the historical conditions underlying the emergence and circulation of reified identities and addresses many puzzling textual ambiguities as the cultural effects of the reified abstraction of labor. Reification’s relation to labor frames the dissertation’s four chapters, appearing in the opening chapter as unconscious forgetting and in the final chapter as deliberate remembering. In the dissertation’s first part I devote attention to under-theorized representations of white heteronormative masculinity. I situate the emerging configurations of racialized heterosexuality at the interface of consumer culture’s social engineering of subjects of desire. In the dissertation’s second part, I turn to two narrative experiments that more strategically and dialectically manipulate conventions of romance and naturalism to recast reified racial and gendered subjects as they emerge out of histories of transnational capital’s hyper-extraction of value from the colonial body. I draw out the narratives’ romantic utopian aspirations for overcoming racialized divisions between agency and structure, culture and labor. Chapter one on Theodore Dreiser’s Sister Carrie foregrounds memory as a mediatory code for analyzing how reification relates to capitalism’s mechanization of labor and its effects on new white feminine and masculine disembodied consumer subjects. Chapter four on W. E. B. Du Bois’s novel The Quest of the Silver Fleece reads the epic memory of the slave’s labor congealed in the commodity cotton as crucial to the black utopian socialist project of de-reifying the racialized division between labor and culture. Chapter two on the stories of Sui Sin Far and Chapter three on the novel Cogewea by Mourning Dove theorize reification as a process through the splitting and doubling of racialized subjects to manage white anxieties about miscegenation. These chapters examine how texts featuring mixed-race heroines work with and against romance and naturalist conventions to re-narrate histories of colonial capitalism and overcome experiential disconnections imposed upon self and community. Reading form dialectically draws out the intensely cathected constellations of relations as they open up vantages for understanding totality, all be it ones that hover in the margins...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on three questions:What is orality, how has orality developed during the last 200 years in Swedish non-fiction, {{and what is the}} cause of this development? Orality is treated here as the linguistic consequence of a certain communicative function. The basis is the different conditions of speech and writing and the different styles and features that are determined by these conditions. By means of factor analysis it is possible to obtain co-occurrence patterns, factors, of linguistic features. The patterns are functionally determined, and therefore the factors can be interpreted in terms of textual functions, dimensions. By computation of factor scores an exact measure of the different dimensions of each text is obtained, and texts can therefore easily and exactly be compared. 37 Swedish linguistic features were chosen for the analysis in this <b>dissertation.</b> Four <b>genres</b> are included: cultural articles, parliamentary records, travel books and news articles. For statistical purposes transcriptions of spontaneous speech were also included. Four functionally interpretable factors were obtained and labelled as follows: interactive vs informative (1), expository vs descriptive (2), elaborated vs concise (3), and factual vs animated (4). Dimension 1 is of great importance to the difference between speech and writing, but of surprisingly little importance to the difference between the written genres. From {{the first half of the}} 19 th century all genres have a development towards a more expository style (2). All genres have undergone a substantial change towards a concise style (3), i. e. a more oral style. This is the dimension that reflects the statement about the increased orality in written language during the 20 th century. The clearest pattern of (4) is the increase of animated style in the last 50 years, which also means increased orality. During the 20 th century the genres have a higher degree of parallelism with regard to direction of change, than during the 19 th century. Orality is not one coherent phenomenom. There are tendencies of development, but they cannot be summarized in a development of orality. The split picture during the first part of the 19 th is probably due to the new written culture, which caused uncertainty with regard to text norms. During the 20 th century, when the genres had been established, intelligibility, clarity and simplicity became more important according as more and more people participated in written communication...|$|R
40|$|Nested Narrative: Þórðar saga hreðu and Material Engagement Þórðar saga hreðu is an Icelandic saga, of {{the type}} usually {{referred}} to as Sagas of Icelanders or Family Sagas, that lacks much of the drama of other sagas of a similar type. The <b>dissertation</b> utilizes this <b>genre</b> outlier to test a new method for analyzing the sagas, which combines literary analysis with recent anthropological theory. This method foregrounds {{the interaction of the}} material world with the saga narrative as an essential way that meaning is constructed. Chapter 1 looks at the saga's physical manifestation in manuscripts, which offers a new emphasis on the saga as a product of a local community. Chapter 2 turns to the human-made objects referenced within the text, suggesting that the depiction of the material world in this saga is in keeping with the non-modern milieu from which it originated. Chapter 3 focuses on scenes in the saga where characters are described as moving through the landscape, and analyzes these as a way to demonstrate how co-constitutive the real landscape was for the saga narrative. Chapter 4 employs Cultural Memory theory to explain why certain placenames are included in the saga instead of others, noting that placename references are a clear invitation to include the real material world into the meaning-making of the saga. Chapter 5 looks at how the dynamic between the narrative of the saga and the local landscape of Skagafjörður as place has been disrupted in the modern period. The Conclusion offers a broad assessment of why repositioning the material world back into the interpretation of saga narratives is important...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a combination}} of three loosely connected projects: First it discusses the disciplinary history of genre traced back to literary, linguistic and rhetorical studies to argue that this diverse body of knowledge contains valuable elements of articulating knowledge about writing. This portion of the <b>dissertation</b> postulates that <b>genre</b> is both a metaphorical and a rhetorical concept, which implies that all genre concepts whether they are defined as classifications, strategies, or descriptions can only partially grasp the nature of discourse. Nevertheless, all genre concepts provide useful guidance for writers and readers about texts in so far as they are applied for a valuable purpose to highlight and articulate the rhetorical, linguistic, or discursive features of texts. Second, two chapters discuss the relationship between genres and disciplinary knowledge, arguing that this diffuse and wayward connection provides valuable insight into the nature of writing and knowledge making, and that genre is a concept that can help writers better grasp the nature of relevant discourse in their disciplinary areas. Finally, the dissertation illustrates the potential of genre analysis as a combination of linguistic, literary, and rhetorical analysis to highlight the discursive and epistemological preferences of disciplinary texts by analyzing two significant articles from the field of rhetoric and composition. The pedagogical implications of these explorations are stated in the first and last chapters of this work implying that the complex analysis of texts as socially embedded patterns of knowledge making can be an important component of writing instruction both on elementary and on advanced levels, and need not be seen as an outmoded alternative or a purely theoretical supplement to the currently dominant process model of composition pedagogy...|$|R
40|$|As audiences, we {{interact}} with fictions in many ways: we evaluate their artistic worth, we imagine the scenarios that they describe, we emotionally {{respond to the}} characters in them, and we draw from them lessons that apply to our lives. As theorists, we want explanations of our interactions with fictions to have two qualities. We want explanations to be specific enough to acknowledge the diversity of fictions, {{to attend to the}} differences amongst them, and to account for their peculiarities. We also want explanations to be general enough to extrapolate from individual works, to illuminate interesting patterns, and to endow us with theoretical understanding. Genre explanations have both specificity and generality. As sensible groupings of fictions, genres mark relevant boundaries in the landscape of diverse fictions. My <b>dissertation</b> argues that <b>genre</b> is central to explaining phenomena that arise from our interactions with fictions. Chapter 1 introduces and addresses two intuitive challenges to genre explanations that question their robustness and informativeness. Chapter 2 brings out genre's role in explaining imaginative resistance. Imaginative resistance occurs when certain propositions, such as morally-disagreeable claims, are presented in fictions and people resist imagining them and accepting them as true in the fiction. Genre gives us an understanding of why certain propositions evoke imaginative resistance when they are presented in some fictions but do not evoke imaginative resistance when they are presented in other fictions. Chapter 3 uses methods of cognitive science to empirically vindicate the theoretical account developed in the previous chapter. Since genre is low in psychological salience, its role in generating imaginative resistance may be more readily and persuasively demonstrated by empirical means. Chapter 4 brings out genre's role in explaining moral persuasion. Genre gives us an understanding of how different fictions educate or corrupt us in different ways...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} unique {{as the basic}} {{research}} acknowledges the chorale prelude as a genre in South Africa. The compilation of a catalogue of organ chorale preludes by South African composers is also a first and important contribution to the knowledge of this genre. The history of the organ in South Africa {{is an integral part}} of this study and offers a background and context for the research on this specific category of music. Knowledge of the contributions to this genre in South Africa is however limited because the available literature on these topics is dated. Due to the restricted publishing opportunities in South Africa, works are unpublished or informally published and not re-printed or even published in other countries. All available literature was thoroughly researched whereafter there was a need to extrapolate the unsatisfactory data with the primary research. Many composers and organ specialists were approached and different library collections were consulted. The church plays a key role in the history of the organ in South Africa, and this results in the fact that most organ repertoire, by South African composers, is liturgical (church) music. Unfortunately, knowledge of early compositions is unknown and the first documented chorale preludes date from the late 19 th and early 20 th century. It is only since the middle of the 20 th century that South African composers have been actively contributing to the genre reaching a climax during 2010 and 2011 when two volumes of chorale preludes were published by the Suider-Afrikaanse Kerkorrelistevereniging (SAKOV). 1170 Chorale preludes by 78 composers are catalogued with a chronological discussion of the key works, with reference to different styles and forms, as a well-developed <b>genre.</b> <b>Dissertation</b> (MMus) [...] University of Pretoria, 2014.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} positions {{itself against}} the predominant identity-based discourse found in queer theory and LGBT studies by arguing that what is commonly codified as gay male identity in fact operates like a biological virus. To establish this claim—the significance of which ultimately lies in the argument that men having sex with men need {{to find ways of}} resisting their sexual actions’ reduction to an identity category—this dissertation first provides a genealogy of HIV and AIDS to demonstrate that they are separate phenomena. Second, this dissertation traces the history and implications of the terms gay and homosexual as well as engages the works of theorists such as Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Bruce Bagemihl, José Esteban Muñoz, Leo Bersani, and David Halperin to illustrate that like AIDS, gay male identity operates in accordance with viral properties such as the ability to infect without the host’s knowledge, to reproduce itself with an utter disregard to the host’s health or well-being, and to thereby transform the host into a vector of transmission. Third, this dissertation turns to the role of literature, especially to works by James Baldwin and Scott Heim, to scrutinize the limitations of gay male identity as a framework or methodology for textual analysis. Next, revisiting Vito Russo’s filmography challenges his conclusions about the pedagogical role of homosexual representation in twentieth century cinema. In addition, an examination of the odd controversy surrounding the film Cruising reveals one instance where gay male identity overtook and obscured any alternate explanation or understanding of one film. Finally, this <b>dissertation</b> explores different <b>genres</b> including the graphic arts to investigate potential permutations of an immune responses to this identity virus. Overall, the significance of this dissertation’s core argument is the disquieting revelation that gay male identity is in fact an infectious “identity bug” that however seemingly benign nevertheless possesses the same harmful and destructive qualities associated with other contagions. ...|$|R
40|$|Narrative Epic and New Media investigates why epic {{narratives}} have {{a renewed}} significance in contemporary culture, showing that new media epics model the postmodern {{world in the}} same way that ancient epics once modelled theirs. It demonstrates how the epic genre recurs across different cultures and subcultures, even as each instantiation of the epic remains unique to its particular society. The <b>dissertation</b> draws upon <b>genre</b> theory from critical discourse analysis and from observations made by various critics about the epic’s status as a literary “super-genre,” which encompasses as many other kinds of narrative as it can. It extends genre theory to explain how works of epic scope emerge from new media as well. The dissertation develops a framework for defining epics that balances textual analysis with attention to the social processes of narrative representation, production, and reception. This model outlines the formal continuities of the epic’s field of cultural production while accounting for historical change and differing cultural contexts. The following texts are analysed in depth: the HBO drama The Wire (2002 – 2008); works adapted from Batman comics, specifically the Dark Knight film trilogy (2005 – 2012) and the Batman: Arkham video game series (2009 – 2015); and Nintendo’s Legend of Zelda video game series (1986 - 2013). Related books, films, comics, and video games furnish supporting evidence, while the reception of these works is gauged in journalism and scholarship, as well as in popular sources (blog postings, fan fictions, etc.). After showing how The Wire, Batman, and Zelda relate to their cultural contexts as epics, Narrative Epic and New Media addresses the implications for epic theory in light of current cultural production. In particular, The Wire, Batman, and Zelda all demonstrate the new understanding of space and cognitive mapping that critics have seen as essential to theories of postmodernity, especially those that examine how the features of fictional narratives model lived experience in society. The dissertation ends with an argument in favour of a more “flexible” formalism, which can better account for the disembedding of generic forms...|$|R
40|$|E. B. White called Walden his {{favorite}} book and found in it “an invitation to life’s dance. ” To read White ecocritically is {{to accept a}} similar invitation to broaden our environmental imagination. Although {{one or two of}} his essays are often anthologized as nature writing, critics have not read White environmentally. While emphasizing White’s three books for children, this <b>dissertation</b> reads across <b>genre</b> lines to examine his lifelong work. Drawing on Laurence Buell’s prismatic term, the study explores how White’s engagement with the natural world contributes to the renewal of our collective environmental imagination. Examining White’s affinity for animals, evident across the spectrum of his work, this study concludes that for White the world is fundamentally inhabited both by humans and non-human animals; his work reflects concern for the habitat of both. White’s three books for children, considered within a framework of Joseph W. Meeker’s literary ecology, form a bridge connecting children’s literature and ecocriticism. This study presents Stuart Little as a series of place-based adventures and a comedy of survival. In Charlotte’s Web, White’s environmental magnum opus, he presents his biophilic sense of the web of life and invites the animal world to speak for itself, Fern showing the rest of us how to pay attention to other species. A braided story of human and animal habitat, The Trumpet of the Swan continues Stuart’s quest underway {{at the end of the}} earlier book. An initial chapter exploring White’s literary ecology (his childhood in the age of nature study, his early sense of place, and his affinity for animals) also examines representative essays, poems and other writings. Closing the study is a chapter connecting White to the wider web of environmental literature through a focus on the nature of story, an emphasis on animal presence, and an expansive sense of ecocriticism that includes children’s literature. Finding the root of the environmental imagination to be in childhood experience, the study treats each of White’s children’s books in separate chapter...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} project traces {{a cultural}} {{reception of the}} romance genre in England and France in the late fourteenth century. In compiling lengthy descriptions of courtly trappings, medieval romances serve as vehicles for idealized aristocratic self-presentation and thereby become complicit in associating material luxury with aristocratic power. I argue that while the changes in material technologies of medieval textual production break down the exclusivity of romance by opening the texts to wider reading publics, the positive representations of luxury in verbal ornament and visual programs of narrative art objects continue the perpetuation of aristocratic privilege. Chapter One examines the Shield of Gawain in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and the Trojan image-texts in Chaucer’s House of Fame as imitatio of Virgilian ekphrases, theorizing medieval understanding of a Greek poetic device. Chapter Two analyzes the Tryst beneath the Tree episode from Tristan and Isolde as it is rendered on fourteenth-century Parisian ivory caskets, situating the composition within the larger visual program that teaches aristocratic women about heterosexual desire through a negotiation of sight and touch. Chapter Three reads Pearl as a romance-adjacent text and a material object, identifying an emotional community within which the positive vocabulary of aristocratic luxury is deployed {{as a vehicle for}} communicating intricate feelings of loss, and where salvation becomes the ultimate aesthetic experience. The dissertation culminates with Chapter Four, which examines Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde and the Breton lay Emaré as texts that thematize a romance encounter and invite the associative reading of romance. By attending to the surface pleasures of romance within these seemingly disparate texts, this <b>dissertation</b> locates the <b>genre’s</b> unique aesthetic—a preoccupation with surfaces, conventions, and the boundaries of the perceptible and the experiential. As such, this project intervenes in the growing field of medieval aesthetics. As a feature of both its internal worlds and its physical media, luxury gives us a sense of how romance mediates the aesthetic encounter, while constructing aristocratic ideals and celebrating earthly pleasures. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises {{an analysis}} of the play Maveplasker. Maveplasker is a production of the Department of Integration and Education, C:NTACT, at the Betty Nansen Theatre in Copenhagen. C:NTACT’s intention is to use theatre to portray the diversity of the so called “others” in the Danish society. They do so by creating plays with young people from the age 15 to 25 who get on stage and tell their own, personal stories {{in the form of a}} coherent play to a live audience. The young people are not professional actors, and partly for this reason C:NTACT uses the term “reality theatre” to describe these productions. This dissertation argues that the Department, C:NTACT, plays an important role in the shaping of these personal stories – from the beginning the department defined what genres the young participants could express their personal stories through – while acknowledging that genres such as hip-hop an street-dance can lead to a somewhat stereotypical and impersonal portrayal of the young participants. With Maveplasker as its focus, this dissertation investigates what representation of “the others” C:NTACT actually ends up producing. The dissertation presents theories of performativity in order to see how identity categories such as “the others” are produced, reproduced but also possibly transformed. It presents theories of performative aesthetics in order to try and place Maveplasker somewhere in between the representative theatre and the performance in order to investigate the play’s potential to transform a generalised conception of “the others”. In the dissertation a thorough textual analysis of Maveplasker is also presented. It particularly focuses on the genre of the play, including the surroundings, such as the theatre building, and the way that C:NTACT speak about their “reality theatre” in the public sphere. The textual analysis also focuses on how the play enunciates the personal stories and the interaction between the enunciation and the genre. In particular the element of the young participants playing themselves is investigated, since this is a central part of placing Maveplasker in between representative theatre and performance. The <b>dissertation</b> concludes that <b>genres</b> as hip-hop and street-dance do cause a somewhat stereotypical representation of the young participants, but it also incorporates them in a general, popular youth culture, and in that sense Maveplasker has a potential to show an increased diversity of “the others”...|$|R

This is particularly {{the case in}} Astrid Väring’s novels Frosten (1926) and Vintermyren (1927), in which the author pays tribute to the homestead and the rural community {{in contrast to the}} industrial community, whilst her novels also express an ambivalent attitude towards modernity. Astrid Väring bases her works on a Norrland literary tradition, which often stood in opposition to the central power despite being dependent on it. In this respect, a similarity with postcolonialism is evident. Access to a wealth of archive material, which has not previously been used in literary scholastic research, has resulted in a natural combination of a biographical method and socio-literary reading. When analysing the novels, the same external circumstances that had signifi cance for the author when the work was drafted, for example economic, social and political conditions, have therefore been taken into account. With reference to the novel Katinka (1942), the view of popular literature during the 1940 s is dealt with. The pejorative view, prevalent in those days, is compared with a contemporary understanding of it. Today, neither the canon nor popular literature stand out as particularly homogeneous categories. Katinka was written {{at the start of the}} Second World War. A comparison is made in the dissertation between Vilhelm Moberg’s Rid i natt! (Ride this Night) (1941) and Katinka in order to ascertain the novels’ attitude towards the offi cial Swedish position of neutrality. In Ride this Night rebellion against the enemy is encouraged, in Katinka a cautious, wait and see attitude is urged. I som här inträden… (1944) is a novel with a purpose. In this novel Astrid Väring directs a harsh attack against the mental health care at Swedish mental hospitals. The <b>dissertation</b> contains a <b>genre</b> discussion concerning the various genres related to the novel with a purpose, for example roman à thèse. It can be concluded that theoretical work concerning the novel with a purpose is rare. But, when the issue pursued in the novel is no longer relevant, the novel with a purpose is often destined to be forgotten. Furthermore, Astrid Väring had the bad luck of falling in the shadow of Sara Lidman’s modernistic West-Bothnian accounts of the 1950 s, which contributed to the fact that her entire works quickly fell into oblivion. This dissertation is the fi rst scholastic work on Astrid Väring’s works...|$|R
40|$|This <b>dissertation</b> {{examines}} a <b>genre</b> of art, {{paintings of}} the Pre-Columbian Inka dynasty, that were produced in Peru for three centuries, beginning with the earliest years of colonial rule and enduring into the first decades following Peru's independence from Spain. The genre emerged from the chaos of conquest and is notable for the diversity of its patronage. The paintings were collected by indigenous descendants of the Pre-Columbian Inka rulers, the Spanish colonial government, creoles (American-born Spaniards), and even foreign travelers. Furthermore, {{paintings of the}} Inka {{could be found in}} a variety of contexts, both public settings and private spaces, including the homes of indigenous elites in Cusco, indigenous parish churches in Lima and elsewhere, Lima's cabildo (city hall), in the residences of elite creoles, and even in the royal collection in Madrid, Spain. Because it focuses on understanding the significance paintings of the Inka accrued in those multiple contexts, the study gives insight into how representations of the Inka past were used to articulate political, cultural and social identities that were constantly in flux. Throughout this study, paintings of the Inka are read in conjunction with other sources in order to flesh out the discourses with which they intersected. These sources include: other artworks that are contemporary with the genre; historical documents, among them colonial accounts of Inka history written from the perspective of indigenous and European authors, archival documents including legal proceedings and wills, and traveler's accounts of Peruvian society. My study advances how paintings of the Inka provided a historical basis that legitimized their patrons. Rather than seeking a unified theory of the genre and its significance, the dissertation highlights how the paintings' meanings were dependent on the diversity of their contexts of reception. While, in general, the subject matter and style of the paintings changed little over time, the period of the paintings' production was marked by dramatic historical and political shifts, ranging from the years in which Spain's power was being consolidated to those in which Spain's hold over its Peruvian territories was in decline. Because paintings of the Inka were a means through which the paintings' patrons could locate themselves historically and culturally within Peruvian society, the implications of the paintings likewise transformed. Paintings of the Inka could convey their subjects as noble ancestors or defeated enemies. They could uphold the legitimacy of the Spanish conquest of the Inka or question the limits of Spain's power. By focusing on how the paintings created meanings that, in some instances, intersected and overlapped, while in others were divergent and contradictory, the dissertation advances understanding into the shifting perceptions of the Pre-Columbian past, and the vital function of that past in constructing one's place in the present...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary children’s books, {{particularly}} picture books, show {{an increasing}} tendency towards complexity and sophistication. There is, however, some resistance to this tendency in the children’s book world. This thesis therefore critically analyses complexity and sophistication in three picture books - chosen because they represent particularly {{high numbers of}} the most common complexities and sophistications - in order {{to determine whether or not}} such resistance is appropriate. The study defines picture books as fictional, illustrated books in which pictures and design are vehicles for meaning, where text and art are integral aspects of an interdependent relationship. It thus examines words, the roles of words and pictures and their interactions, linear progression, time and page-breaks, rhythm, design, colour, medium, style, line, regularity, balance, framing, shot, point of view, gaze, visual weight, position, shape, size, light, background, symbol, pictorial analogy, visual games, nonsense, intervisuality, intravisuality, leitmotif and counterpoint. The sophisticated structure, polyphony, visual nonsense and allusion of Anthony Browne’s Voices in the Park allow deep, complex examinations of its characters’ psychologies, making marginalized groups visible and critiquing stereotypes of class, gender, family structure and unemployment. Its sophistications and complexities thus enable Browne’s book to satisfy significant priorities in the children’s book world, because it avoids overt didacticism, respects “literary” values and is socially aware. The sophisticated structure, visual nonsense, multidimensionality and multivoicedness of David McKee’s I Hate My Teddy Bear raise problems of narrative and focalizer, overtly inscribe inconsistency, vagueness and uncertainty, and determinedly resist resolution. McKee’s book thus refuses to imply a clear reader role, and situates readers firmly outside itself, where subjection to any one interaction with, response to or idea within it becomes impossible. This stimulates child readers’ creative thought, and distributes power between adult writers and child readers unusually equitably, thus offering children the respect and power of literary and ideological self-determination in a safe, restricted area of fiction. John Burningham’s Granpa neglects many of the conventions of writing and storytelling, so that readers face the multiplexity of its form and structure, the emergence of its linear narrative from apparent stasis into irresolution and ambiguity, and its difficult themes and psychological content, with very little guidance in their reading beyond frequently confusing formal signals. This is difficult for adult readers, who have learnt to expect certain conventions from stories, and to use them to interpret and predict what they read. It may, however, be particularly easy for child readers, because it does not force them to read in ways that are still foreign to and thus possibly difficult for them. It may even be less threatening to children and antagonistic to children’s culture than most children’s books, because it does not socialize children into the alien adult culture concomitant with conventional reading. Together, these analyses reveal that complex, sophisticated children’s books may function in a variety of ways. The children’s book world should thus rather evaluate them individually than reject the entire <b>genre.</b> <b>Dissertation</b> (MA (English)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2005.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses the novelette Marara, {{written by}} D. P. Semakaleng Monyaise. This {{work has been}} previously investigated by critics such as Mogajane, Malope and Mogapi, who focused on its content and style and compared it to other literary works. This dissertation differs from these earlier studies in that it aims to analyse {{the structure of the}} text of Marara in depth, focussing on the two levels of structure, namely content and plot. This investigation uses two methods of analysis, namely definition and interpretation, because these approaches will adequately explore the many concepts and ideas related to the analysis of text structure. These methods are applied within the framework of an adapted narratological model. This model suggests that when the content of a text is studied, the concept of the topic should be strongly emphasised; when the plot is investigated the theme should be focussed on; and lastly when the style is examined, then atmosphere is most important. In examining the text of Marara three important concepts related to the novelette are identified, which describe three sub-genres of narratives, namely picaresque, didactic and moral. Picaresque means concerned with a character called picaro, who often embarks on long journeys consisting of sequences of different events and meetings with various characters. This picaro is an ordinary person, not of high social status. His/her weaknesses belittle him/her but he/she is changed by them and so is forgiven. In Marara the protagonist, Rremogolo, is on a journey from his home in Matile, where there is righteousness, to Makgoeng, a place of wickedness. After encountering many problems on the way he realises that he was mistaken to leave his home. He returns to Matile, convinced that it is the best place for him to live. This mistaken journey of temptation can be described as the Makgoeng Motif. Didactic means related to a work designed for institutions of education. Such a work can use as an example the story of a character, either an ordinary person or a person of high social status, who falls because of his/her weaknesses, but then changes and is forgiven. Rremogolo also fits into the didactic frame. Though he is a poor man of low social station, he successfully illustrates the point of the Makgoeng Motif through his fall, which is his failure to achieve financial success in Makgoeng. The moral means concerned with the power of distinguishing right from wrong. The emphasis of moral texts is on good behaviour, on people working and living together co-operatively. This concept can also be related to the plot structure described above, of a person either of high or ordinary social status, who through his/her weaknesses falls, but then changes and is forgiven. When the morality of this story is examined, emphasis is put on the changing of the character, on how the character first does bad things but in the passing of time, and because of the problems he/she encounters, in the end learns his/her mistake, and changes to become a good person. Rremogolo illustrates this exactly, because he begins by abandoning his uncle’s cattle in order to pursue his dream of travelling to Makgoeng, then suffers the results of many problems, realises his mistake, and in the end returns to home and duty. Therefore, careful examination of the text of Marara reveals that in writing this novelette Monyaise mixes three sub-generic categories, namely the picaresque, the didactic and the moral narrative. This makes the novelette difficult to classify, because it is difficult for readers to keep track of generic characteristics in this mix of <b>genres.</b> <b>Dissertation</b> (MA (African Languages)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.
