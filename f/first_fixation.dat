40|$|The {{distribution}} of landing positions and durations of <b>first</b> <b>fixations</b> {{in a region}} containing a noun preceded by either an article (e. g. the soldiers) or a high-frequency three-letter word (e. g. all soldiers) were compared. Although there were fewer <b>first</b> <b>fixations</b> on the blank space between the high-frequency three-letter word and the noun than on the surrounding letters (and the fixations on the blank space were shorter), this pattern did not occur when the noun was preceded by an article. Radach (1996) inferred from a similar experiment that did not manipulate the type of short word that two words could be processed as a perceptual unit during reading when the first word is a short word. As this different pattern of fixations is restricted to article- noun pairs, it indicates that word grouping does not occur purely {{on the basis of}} word length during reading; moreover, as we demonstrate, one can explain the observed patterns in both conditions more parsimoniously, without adopting a word grouping mechanism in eye movement control during reading...|$|R
30|$|In {{the third}} experiment, we test the {{proposed}} method on a gray image dataset, DOVES, which is introduced by van der Linde et al. [50].

40|$|The results {{presented}} in the article are based on first-pass reading times, defined as the sum of fixation durations on a word until the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> on any other word. The first-pass reading time on word wt is zero if a later word from the same sentence was fixated before the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> on wt. To investigate if our conclusions hold for other reading-time measures, we repeated the analysis using two alternatives: right-bounded and go-past reading time. Right-bounded time is identical to first-pass time except that it includes the durations of fixations on wt that occur after a regression. That is, it equals the total duration of fixations on wt until the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> on any later word of the sentence. The go-past reading time {{is defined as the}} total duration of fixations on all words from w 1 (the first word of the sentence) up to wt, starting from the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> on wt until the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> on any later word of the sentence. 1 As was the case for first-pass, the right-bounded and go-past reading times on wt are zero if a later word from the same sentence was fixated before the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> on wt. Results for right-bounded and go-past reading times are {{presented in}} Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.

40|$|Although {{there has}} been recent growing {{interest}} in the associations between measures of visual attention and consumer choice, there is still uncertainty {{about the role of}} the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> in consumer choice and the factors that drive total fixation duration. The study aimed (1) to investigate the influence of the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> on consumer choice, and (2) to disentangle two factors driving total fixation duration, namely preference formation (the process of establishing a preference for one of the items of the choice set) and the decision goal (task instruction). Participants chose between two products while their eye movements were measured. To investigate the influence of <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> location on choice, <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> location was manipulated in half of the trials. To disentangle effects of preference formation and the decision goal, participants selected either the product they wanted, or the product they did not want. Our findings showed that manipulating the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> towards an alternative did not influence its likelihood of being chosen. Although total fixation duration was mainly determined by the decision goal, it was also influenced by preference formation.

A Tobii T 60 eye-tracker was used to present the stimuli and to analyse the gazing behaviour of 59 participants during decision-making.

40|$|Previous eye {{movement}} studies of attentional bias in spider fear reported inconsistent results {{with respect to}} early attentional capture, suggesting that overt attentional capture only reliably occurs under specific circumstances. In addition, none of these studies explored covert attention. The present study examined attentional bias in spider phobia using a change detection paradigm that was expected to provide good conditions for documenting attentional capture. In contrast to our expectations, {{eye movement}} data showed that all participants' <b>first</b> <b>fixations</b> were fastest on general negative targets, whereas participants' <b>first</b> <b>fixations</b> on spider targets were slower in the spider fearful than in the nonfearful group. In addition, spider fearful participants made more nontarget fixations before fixating on a spider target than did nonfearful participants. Thus, we found that participants' overt attention was more quickly focused on general negative targets, whereas covert attentional processes enabled initial avoidance of fear-relevant (i. e. spider) stimuli. The present findings {{have important implications for}} research on attention and fear as they indicate that fearful individuals are not characterized by static attentional orienting toward threat but, under certain conditions, may avert attention from threat automatically...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} sought to test the {{predictions}} of attentional control theory (ACT) in a sporting environment. Fourteen experienced footballers took penalty kicks under low- and high-threat counterbalanced conditions while wearing a gaze registration system. Fixations to target locations (goalkeeper and goal area) were determined using frame-by-frame analysis. When anxious, footballers made faster <b>first</b> <b>fixations</b> and fixated for significantly longer toward the goalkeeper. This dis-ruption in gaze behavior brought about significant reductions in shooting accuracy, with shots becoming significantly centralized and within the goalkeeper’s reach. These findings support the predictions of ACT, as anxious participants {{were more likely to}} focus on the “threatening ” goalkeeper, owing to an increased influence of the stimulus-driven attentional control system...|$|R
40|$|Hills, Ross, and Lewis (2011) {{introduced}} {{the concept that}} the face-inversion effect may, in part, be carried by the first feature attended to, since the first feature fixated upon is different for upright and inverted faces. An eye-tracking study that directly assesses this hypothesis by using fixation crosses to guide attention to the eye or mouth region of the to-be-presented upright and inverted faces was devised. Recognition was better when the fixation cross appeared at the eye region than at the mouth region. The face-inversion effect was smaller when the eyes were cued than when the mouth was cued or {{when there was no}} cueing. The eye-tracking measures confirmed that the fixation crosses attracted the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> but did not affect other measures of eye-movements. Furthermore, the location of the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> predicted recognition accuracy: when the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> was to the eyes, recognition accuracy was higher than when the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> was to the mouth, irrespective of facial orientation. The results suggest that the first facial feature attended to is more predictive of recognition accuracy than the face orientation in which they are presented...|$|E

The influence of the word-frequency by preview validity manipulation on the distributions of <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> duration was examined by using ex-Gaussian fitting as well as a novel survival analysis technique which provided precise estimates of the timing of the first discernible influence of word frequency on <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> duration. Using this technique, we found a significant influence of word frequency on fixation duration in normal reading (valid preview) as early as 145 ms from the start of fixation. We also demonstrated an equally rapid non-lexical influence on <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> duration as a function of initial landing position (location) on target words. The time-course of frequency effects, but not location effects was strongly influenced by preview validity, demonstrating the crucial role of parafoveal processing in enabling direct lexical control of reading fixation times.

40|$|Whether gaze following-a key {{component}} of joint attention-is impaired in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is currently debated. Functional gaze following involves saccading towards the attended rather than unattended targets (accuracy) {{as well as a}} subsequent processing bias for attended objects. Using non-invasive eye tracking technology, we show that gaze following accuracy is intact in intellectually low-functioning 3 -year-olds with ASD. However, analyses of the duration of <b>first</b> <b>fixations</b> at the objects in the scene revealed markedly weaker initial processing bias for attended objects in children with ASD compared to children with typical development and non-autistic children with developmental delays.

40|$|Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) orient less to {{socially}} salient stimuli, such as dynamic social images, than typically developing children. In turn, {{this lack}} of social orienting is thought to impair affected individuals' socio communicative development. Here, we aim to explore the relationship between time spent on dynamic social images and ASD behaviors, such as joint attention and communication, in preschoolers on the autism spectrum. In this study, social orienting is measured using eye-tracking during a task consisting of side-by-side presentations of dynamic social images and dynamic geometric images. The {{side of the screen}} where each type of video was presented alternated between items to avoid visual perseveration from influencing the location of participants' <b>first</b> <b>fixations.</b> Visual exploration patterns recorded during the task from 33 preschoolers with ASD were compared with those of 27 typical developing (TD) children. Additionally, we quantified joint attention behaviors and used standardized parent reports to measure communication. We observed reduced orienting to dynamic social images in preschoolers with ASD compared to TD children. Also, ASD participants went to the dynamic social images less frequently for their <b>first</b> <b>fixations.</b> However, we observed great heterogeneity within the ASD group. ASD preschoolers who spent more time on the dynamic social images also presented more pronounced visual engagement with the dynamic social images (longer mean fixation duration and fewer saccades per second). Moreover, in the ASD group, more time spent on dynamic social images correlated with increased frequency of joint attention behaviors, which in turn correlated with improved communication skills. Our results support reduced social orienting in children with ASD, which correlated with their visual exploration patterns. Further, reduced orienting to the social world in young children with ASD is related to socio communicative deficits and should, therefore, be a focus of intervention programs as early as possible...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} has shown that the gender typicality of applicants’ faces affects leadership selection irrespective of a candidate’s gender: A masculine facial appearance is congruent with masculine-typed leadership roles, thus masculine-looking applicants are hired more certainly than feminine-looking ones. In the present study, we extended this line of research by investigating hiring decisions for both masculine- and feminine-typed professional roles. Furthermore, we used eye tracking to examine the visual exploration of applicants’ portraits. Our results indicate that masculine-looking applicants were favored for the masculine-typed role (leader) and feminine-looking applicants for the feminine-typed role (team member). Eye movement patterns showed that information about gender category and facial appearance was integrated during <b>first</b> <b>fixations</b> of the portraits. Hiring decisions, however, were not based on this initial analysis, but occurred at a second stage, when the portrait was viewed in the context of considering the applicant for a specific job...|$|R
40|$|Hills and Lewis (2011) have {{demonstrated}} that the own-race bias in face recognition can be reduced or even removed by guiding participants' attention and potentially eye movements to the most diagnostic visual features. Using the same old/new recognition paradigm as Hills and Lewis, we recorded Black and White participants' eye movements whilst viewing Black and White faces following fixation crosses that preceded {{the bridge of the}} nose (between the eyes) or the tip of the nose. White faces were more accurately recognized when following high fixation crosses (that preceded the bridge of the nose) than when following low fixation crosses. The converse was true for Black faces. These effects were independent of participant race. The fixation crosses attracted the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> but had less effect on other eye-tracking measures. Furthermore, the location of the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> was predictive of recognition accuracy.

40|$|A preferential-looking {{paradigm}} {{was used}} to investigate how gaze is distributed in naturalistic scenes. Two scenes were presented side by side: one contained a single person (person-present) and one did not (person-absent).

We studied gaze patterns during free viewing, and also in a task requiring gender discrimination of the human figure depicted. Results indicated a strong bias towards looking to the person-present scene. This bias was present on the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> after image presentation, confirming previous findings of ultra-rapid processing of complex information.

40|$|Despite {{significant}} advancements in {{the research}} of subjective well-being (SWB), {{little is known about}} its connection with basic cognitive processes. The present study explores the association between selective attention to emotional stimuli (i. e. emotional faces) and both the emotional and cognitive components of SWB (i. e. emotional well-being and satisfaction in life, respectively). Participants (N = 83) were asked to freely watch a series of 84 pairs of emotional (happy, angry, or sad) and neutral faces from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces database. Eye-tracking methodology measured <b>first</b> <b>fixations,</b> number of fixations, and the time spent looking at emotional faces. Results showed that both the emotional and cognitive components of SWB were related to a general bias to attend to happy faces and avoid sad faces. Yet, bootstrapping analyses showed that positive emotions, rather than life satisfaction, were responsible for the positive information-processing bias. We discuss the potential functionality of these biases and their implications for research on positive emotions...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{evidence}} indicating fatness and thinness {{information are}} processed differently among weight-preoccupied and eating disordered individuals, {{the exact nature}} of these attentional biases is not clear. In this research, eye movement (EM) tracking assessed biases in specific component processes of visual attention (i. e., orientation, detection, maintenance and disengagement of gaze) in relation to body-related stimuli among 20 weight dissatisfied (WD) and 20 weight satisfied young women. Eye movements were recorded while participants completed a dot-probe task that featured fatness-neutral and thinness-neutral word pairs. Compared to controls, WD women were more likely to direct their initial gaze toward fatness words, had a shorter mean latency of <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> on both fatness and thinness words, had longer <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> on fatness words but shorter <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> on thinness words, and shorter total gaze duration on thinness words. Reaction time data showed a maintenance bias towards fatness words among the WD women. In sum, results indicated WD women show initial orienting, speeded detection and initial maintenance biases towards fat body words in addition to a speeded detection – avoidance pattern of biases in relation to thin body words.

Results showed that L 2 WMC has no effects on the grammatical judgement accuracies, the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> duration, gaze duration, go-past times and total fixation duration of the critical regions in wh-extractions. In contrast, OSPAN influences the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> duration and go-past times of the critical regions in wh-extractions. Specifically, in region 1, (e. g., Who do you think loved the comedian [region 1] with [region 2] all his heart [subject-extraction]? versus Who do you think the comedian loved [region 1] with [region 2] all his heart?

In region 2, participants with high OSPAN were much faster than those with low OSPAN in their go-past times of object-extractions. These results indicated that individual differences in OSPAN rather than in L 2 WMC more strongly affect processing of wh-extractions.

It seems that children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have some difficulties recognizing facial emotional expressions, especially negative ones. This study investigated the preference of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for negative (angry, sad) facial expressions compared to normal children. Method: Participants were 35 drug naive boys with ADHD, aged between 6 - 11 years,and 31 matched healthy children. Visual orientation data were recorded while participants viewed face pairs (negative-neutral pairs) shown for 3000 ms. The number of <b>first</b> <b>fixations</b> made to each expression was considered as an index of initial orientation. Results: Group comparisons revealed no difference between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group and their matched healthy counterparts in initial orientation of attention. A tendency towards negative emotions was found within the normal group, while no difference was observed between initial allocation of attention toward negative and neutral expressions in children with ADHD.

40|$|Crowding is a {{phenomenon}} that characterizes normal periphery limiting letter identification when other letters surround the signal. We investigated {{the nature of the}} reading limitation of crowding by analyzing eyemovement patterns. The stimuli consisted of two items varying across trials for letter spacing (spaced, unspaced and increased size), lexicality (words or pseudowords), number of letters (4, 6, 8), and reading modality (oral and silent). In Experiments 1 and 2 (oral and silent reading, respectively) the results show that an increase in letter spacing induced {{an increase in the number}} of fixations and in gaze duration, but a reduction in the <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> duration. More importantly, increasing letter size (Experiment 3) produced the same <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> duration advantage as empty spacing, indicating that, as predicted by crowding, only center-to-center letter distance, and not spacing per se, matters. Moreover, when the letter size was enlarged the number of fixations did not increase as much as in the previous experiments, suggesting that this measure depends on visual acuity rather than on crowding. Finally, gaze duration, ameasure ofword recognition, did not changewith the letter size enlargement. No qualitative differences were found between oral and silent reading experiments (1 and 2), indicating that the articulatory process did not influence the outcome. Finally, a facilitatory effect of lexicality was found in all conditions, indicating an interaction between perceptual and lexical processing. Overall, our results indicate that crowding influences normal word reading bymeans of an increase in <b>first</b> <b>fixation</b> duration, a measure of word encoding, which we interpret as a modulatory effect of attention on critical spacing...|$|E

However, it is unclear whether women's partnership status influences the effects of environmental circumstances on masculinity preference. Further, the role of environmental scarcity on women's gaze patterns when evaluating male faces has not been investigated. The current study investigated how relationship status and environmental factors affected women's gaze patterns and preference towards masculinised and feminised male faces. Twenty-two participants in a long-term romantic relationship, and 26 who were single, were primed with either a high (‘wealthy’) or low (‘scarcity’) resource availability scenario. They then completed a facial masculinity/femininity preference task while eye-gaze behaviour was measured. Women in a relationship (but not single women) had an increased preference towards masculine faces in the scarcity condition, compared to the wealthy condition; this preference was also reflected in eye gaze behaviour. In contrast, single women had longer <b>first</b> <b>fixations</b> on feminine rather than masculine faces when evaluating them as long-term partners in the wealthy condition, but no overt preference for either face type. These findings reveal the importance of taking women's relationship status into account in investigations of the role of environmental influences on masculinity preferences...|$|R
40|$|In {{everyday}} life, human {{faces are}} encountered {{in many different}} views. Despite this fact, most psychological {{research has focused on}} the perception of frontal faces. To address this shortcoming, the current study investigated how different face views are processed, by measuring eye movements to frontal, mid-profile and profile faces during a gender categorization (Experiment 1) and a free-viewing task (Experiment 2). In both experiments observers initially fixated the geometric center of a face, independent of face view. This center-of-gravity effect induced a qualitative shift in the features that were sampled across different face views in the time period immediately after stimulus onset. Subsequent eye fixations focused increasingly on specific facial features. At this stage, the eye regions were targeted predominantly in all face views, {{and to a lesser extent}} also the nose and the mouth. These findings show that initial saccades to faces are driven by general stimulus properties, before eye movements are redirected to the specific facial features in which observers take an interest. These findings are illustrated in detail by plotting the distribution of <b>fixations,</b> <b>first</b> <b>fixations,</b> and percentage fixations across time...|$|R
40|$|The {{human body}} is a highly {{familiar}} and socially very important object. Does this mean that the human body has a special status with respect to visual attention? In the current paper we tested whether people in natural scenes attract attention and "pop out" or, alternatively, are at least searched for more efficiently than targets of another category (machines). Observers in our study searched a visual array for dynamic or static scenes containing humans amidst scenes containing machines and vice versa. The arrays consisted of 2, 4, 6 or 8 scenes arranged in a circular array, with targets being present or absent. Search times increased with set size for dynamic and static human and machine targets, arguing against pop out. However, search for human targets was more efficient than for machine targets as indicated by shallower search slopes for human targets. Eye tracking further revealed that observers made more <b>first</b> <b>fixations</b> to human than to machine targets and that their on-target fixation durations were shorter for human compared to machine targets. In summary, our results suggest that searching for people in natural scenes is more efficient than searching for other categories even though people do not pop out...|$|R
