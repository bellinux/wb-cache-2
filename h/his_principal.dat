He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus. Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was <b>his</b> <b>principal</b> wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.|$|E

Burger told Brown only seven African Americans had graduated from the school that year, but Brown nonetheless was determined to enroll, feeling he would compete well with white students.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, the Royal Academy of Music {{awarded the}} first Mendelssohn Scholarship to the 14-year-old Sullivan, {{granting}} him a year's {{training at the}} academy. <b>His</b> <b>principal</b> teacher there was John Goss, whose own teacher, Thomas Attwood, had been a pupil of Mozart.

5|$|After much delay, the new Massachusetts Constitution {{finally went}} into effect in October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock was elected Governor of Massachusetts in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote. In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably {{patriotic}} given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. James Bowdoin, <b>his</b> <b>principal</b> opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) to serve in the First Continental Congress. Bowdoin's supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.|$|E

Brungardt interned at Blakeslee Recording Company, Saadiq's North Hollywood recording studio, and eventually became <b>his</b> <b>principal</b> sonic partner on projects. The two shared a fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment.

He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a {{coronation}} diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were <b>his</b> <b>principal</b> supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the OULC, Thorpe {{achieved}} {{the presidency of}} the Oxford University Law Society, although <b>his</b> <b>principal</b> objective was {{the presidency of the}} Oxford Union, an office frequently used as a stepping-stone to national prominence. Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union's junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for the presidency. He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster Robin Day. His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders—the socialist Dick Taverne and the Conservative William Rees-Mogg—to secure the presidency for the Hilary term of 1951.|$|E

5|$|Matthew Brettingham (1699 – 19 August 1769), {{sometimes}} called Matthew Brettingham the Elder, was an 18th-century Englishman who rose from humble origins {{to supervise the}} construction of Holkham Hall, and {{become one of the}} country's best-known architects of his generation. Much of <b>his</b> <b>principal</b> work has since been demolished, particularly his work in London, where he revolutionised the design of the grand townhouse. As a result, he is often overlooked today, remembered principally for his Palladian remodelling of numerous country houses, many of them situated in the East Anglia area of Britain. As Brettingham neared the pinnacle of his career, Palladianism began to fall out of fashion and neoclassicism was introduced, championed by the young Robert Adam.|$|E
5|$|Meher Baba gave {{numerous}} teachings on {{the cause}} and purpose of life, including teaching reincarnation and that the phenomenal world is an illusion. He taught that the Universe is imagination, that God is what really exists, and that each soul is really God passing through imagination to realize individually His own divinity. In addition he gave practical advice for the aspirant who wishes to attain Self-realization and thereby escape the wheel of births and deaths. He also taught about the concept of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, and those on the various stages of the spiritual path that he called involution. His teachings are most importantly recorded in <b>his</b> <b>principal</b> books Discourses and God Speaks.|$|E
5|$|Meher Baba's teachings can roughly {{be divided}} into two main categories: his metaphysics {{on the nature of the}} soul and the Universe, and {{practical}} advice for the spiritual aspirant. The two are interrelated. His metaphysics is mostly found in <b>his</b> <b>principal</b> book on the subject, God Speaks. It contains detailed statements on his cosmology and the purpose of life as well as the progression of the soul, while his elucidations on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in Discourses, although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying God Speaks.|$|E
