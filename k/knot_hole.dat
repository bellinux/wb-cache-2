40|$|A {{multiple}} sensor {{machine vision}} prototype {{is being developed}} to scan full size hardwood lumber at industrial speeds for automatically detecting features such as <b>knots,</b> <b>holes,</b> wane, stain, splits, checks, and color. The prototype integrates a multiple sensor imaging system, a materials handling system, a computer system, and application software. The prototype provides a unique general purpose research facility so {{that a variety of}} different industry-scale problems can be addressed in both primary and secondary hardwood manufacturing. BACKGROUND There are three main categories into which features on hardwood lumber may be classified. These are: 1) visual surface features (e. g. <b>knots</b> <b>holes,</b> splits, decay, color, grain orientation), 2) board geometry features (e. g., warp, crook, wane, thickness variations, voids), and 3) internal features (e. g., honeycomb, voids, decay). Surface geometric, and internal features have been categorized in this way because they often require different detection methods that depend on where they appear. Most of these features are treated as defects to be removed in the manufacturing process. Current hardwood mill operations examine lumber manually to locate and identify these types of defects. ...|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{rat snake}} is {{primarily}} active at night during the summer, and diurnal {{in the spring}} and fall. It is a terrestrial burrower and an excellent climber, and it may enter water. It is found under rocks and boards, and in trees under bark and within <b>knot</b> <b>holes</b> and palm fronds. The snake is a constrictor, and adults eat mainly endotherms while young eat mainly ectotherms. The diet includes rodents, lizards, frogs, and birds and their eggs. The snakes can also eat young chickens and chicks, hence the common name chicken snake.|$|R
60|$|Early {{next morning}} a great hubbub rose outside my window, and I jumped {{up to see}} what was going on. Little Thief had come back, and Big Thief caught him in the act of robbery. Away they went pell-mell, jabbering like a flock of blackbirds, along a linden branch, through two maples, across a driveway, and up a big elm where Little Thief whisked out of sight into a <b>knot</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
60|$|He had {{warnings}} enough. Once some students, who {{had been}} friendly all winter, stoned {{him out of a}} tree where he was nestrobbing; once the sparrows caught him in their nest under the high eaves, and knocked him off promptly. A twig upon which he caught in falling saved his life undoubtedly, for the sparrows were after him and he barely escaped into a <b>knot</b> <b>hole,</b> leaving the angry horde clamoring outside. But nothing could reform him.|$|E
60|$|Presently Little Thief came out, {{rubbed his}} eyes, and looked all about. Through my glass I could see Meeko {{blinking}} and twitching under the dark eave, {{trying to control}} his anger. Little Thief ventured to a branch {{a few feet away}} from his refuge, and Big Thief, unable to hold himself a moment longer, rushed out, firing a volley of direful threats ahead of him. In a flash Little Thief was back in his <b>knot</b> <b>hole</b> and the comedy began all over again.|$|E
50|$|The ancient {{township}} of Toxteth {{contains the}} village of Smeedon or Smithdown. It stretches over an area of three miles along the River Mersey and two miles inland, the highest point being {{on the corner of}} Smithdown Lane and Lodge Lane. A brook ran from the northern end of the area, near the boundary of Parliament Street, where it was used to power a water wheel before it ran into the river. Along the river are two creeks; the one near the middle is known as <b>Knot's</b> <b>Hole,</b> and another further south, called Dickinson's Dingle, received a brook which ran past the east end of St Michael's Church, Aigburth.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{generally}} were poorly {{prepared for}} the proper packaging of ammunition {{at the start of}} the war. Ammunition of all kinds was packed in wooden boxes with fillers to hold it in position, and only the most rudimentary protection against moisture was provided by tarring joints and <b>knot</b> <b>holes</b> and occasionally wrapping rounds in wax paper for additional waterproofing. In view of the faulty packaging, it was common for 50 per cent to 90 per cent of hand grenades and mortar shells to fail to function. Now, however, the Japanese are utilizing metal and asphalt-impregnated paper linings for their ammunition containers, and consequently deterioration has been materially lessened.|$|R
5000|$|In 1853 Samuel L. Rugg, {{simultaneously}} the Adams County Recorder and County Clerk and of Joseph D. Nuttman {{a prominent}} local businessman proposed building a 30-mile plank road through Adams County connecting Fort Wayne and Wilshire, OH. Therefore, the Fort Wayne and Piqua plank road was born. [...] "There were certain specific specifications {{that must be}} adhered to. Some of which were that nothing but number one clear white oak plank should be used, without <b>knot</b> or <b>knot</b> <b>holes,</b> eight feet long, three inches thick and twelve inches in width, be laid side by side snugly and chummily. Stringers to be laid underneath and to be four by fours and of the same quality oak." [...] This 16â€™ wide plank toll road served Adams County until about 1862. It had fallen into such disrepair that they discontinued collecting toll in 1866.|$|R
60|$|When {{the time}} of full moon came I {{went back to the}} little house among the ledges, one afternoon, and hid under the same bush to watch until {{something}} should come out. But first I looked all about and found near by a huge hollow chestnut tree that the wood-choppers had passed by for years as not worth the cutting. There were scratches and claw pits everywhere in the rough bark, and just under the lower limbs was a big dark <b>knot</b> <b>hole</b> that might be a doorway to a den. So I lay down in hiding where I could see both the tree and the fern-screened archway among the rocks by simply turning my head.|$|E
60|$|The wolves were {{stealing}} {{through the}} woods all together, one late summer afternoon, having beaten a cover without taking anything, when the puzzled cubs suddenly found themselves alone. A moment before they had been trotting along with the old wolves, nosing every cranny and <b>knot</b> <b>hole</b> for mice and grubs, and stopping often for a roll and frolic, as young cubs do in the gladness of life; now they pressed close together, looking, listening, while a subtle excitement filled all the woods. For the old wolves had disappeared, shooting ahead in great, silent bounds, while the cubs waited with ears cocked and noses quivering, as if a silent command had been understood.|$|E
60|$|The {{moment he}} was gone the blue jay went {{straight}} to the spot, seized a mouthful of nuts and flew swiftly away. He made three trips before the squirrel came back. Meeko in his hurry never noticed the loss, but emptied his pockets and was off to the chestnut tree again. When he returned, the jay in his eagerness had disturbed the leaves which covered the hidden store. Meeko noticed it and was all suspicion in an instant. He whipped off the covering and stood staring down intently into the garner, evidently trying to compute the number he had brought and the number that were there. Then a terrible scolding began, a scolding that was broken short off when a distant screaming of jays came floating through the woods. Meeko covered his store hurriedly, ran along a limb and leaped to the next tree, where he hid in a <b>knot</b> <b>hole,</b> just his eyes visible, watching his garner keenly out of the darkness.|$|E
25|$|Pignut hickory {{is easily}} damaged by fire, which causes stem degrade {{or loss of}} volume, or both.

60|$|At {{twilight}} {{there were}} sudden scratchings {{in the hollow}} tree, mounting higher and higher; then muffled grunts and whinings and expostulations, as if little voices inside the tree were saying: My turn first. No, mine! E-e-e-e-ahh, get out! The whinings stopped abruptly and a face appeared in the dark knot hole--a sharp, pointed face with alert ears and bright eyes that looked out keenly over the still woods where only shadows were creeping about and only a wild duck disturbed the silence, quacking softly to her brood in the little pond. Then the whining began again in the hollow tree, and four other little faces pushed their sharp noses into the <b>knot</b> <b>hole,</b> filling it completely, all watching and listening, and wiggling their chins down on their fellows' heads so as {{to get a better}} view point, yet all eager as children to be out and at play after their long sleep.|$|E
60|$|The {{mother had}} {{scarcely}} disappeared {{when the little}} ones came out of their den and began playing together, rolling and tumbling about like a litter of fox cubs, doing it for fun purely, yet exercising every claw and muscle for the hard work that a coon must do when he is called upon {{to take care of}} himself. After a time one of the cubs left his brothers playing {{and went back to the}} chestnut tree by the same way that he had come, following every turn and winding of the back trail as if there were a path there--as there probably was, to his eyes and nose, though mine could not find any. He climbed the tree as if he were after something, and disappeared into the <b>knot</b> <b>hole,</b> where I could hear the little fellow whining and scratching his way down inside the tree. In a moment he reappeared with something in his mouth. In the dusk I could not make out what it was, but as he came back and passed within ten feet of where I was hiding I had my field-glasses upon him and saw it plainly--a little knot of wood with a crook in it, the solitary plaything which you will find, all smooth from much handling, in almost every house where the Little Brother to the Bear has lived.|$|E

40|$|A sawmill cuts logs into {{lumber and}} sells this lumber to {{secondary}} remanufactures. The price a sawmiller can charge for {{a volume of}} lumber depends on its grade, For a number of species {{the price of a}} given volume of material can double in going from one grade to the next higher grade. Thus, accurately establishing the grade of a volume of hardwood lumber is very important to both seller and purchaser of this material. Currently, the grading of hardwood lumber is done by human inspectors. Unfortunately, they often lack consistency in their grading of lumber. Hence, there is a strong motivation for wanting to develop an automatic lumber grading system. The research reported in this paper is aimed at developing a computer vision system that will be used to automatically grade rough hardwood lumber. The purpose of the computer vision system is to locate and identify grading defects in a speciesindependent manner. The current system can detect four of the most common types of grading defects: <b>knots,</b> <b>holes,</b> wane, and splits/checks. The system has been designed using a knowledge-based approach employing a Blackboard framework. The system has been tested on a number of boards from the most used hardwood species. The results indicate that the development of a fully automatic grading system is possible. 1...|$|R

30|$|All 810 boards were {{visually}} sorted {{according to}} their characteristic appearance. Thereby, neither any public grading standards nor producer-specific grading rules were applied. Instead, different appearance classes were established by iteratively searching for boards with characteristic visual appearance and grouping them with similar ones. If an initial appearance class was not supported by {{a sufficient number of}} similar boards or later perceived as not distinct enough from another one, it would be dismissed and the boards would be reassigned to the best matching appearance class. In this iterative sorting procedure, size, condition, shape and distribution of knots, direction of the annual rings, i.e. flat or vertical grain, colourâ€”which was often influenced by the presence of compression woodâ€”as well as presence and length of visible pith sections were regarded, and all sorting decisions were made by consent of two persons (two of the authors; neither of them being trained as lumber grader). A basic sorting requirement was that the section of characteristic appearance within the board had a minimum length of two metres without any technical defect (such as a <b>knot</b> <b>hole</b> or a large resin pocket) precluding the usability of the piece as a floor or panelling board. Boards that did not have a usable section of at least 2 Â m length were rejected. When sorting was completed, 15 different visual appearance classes had been established. Board counts differed considerably among these appearance classes.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Raw {{material}} costs and limited material availability and quality have created significant {{interest in and}} opportunities {{for the application of}} nondestructive evaluation techniques to improve wood processing technologies. The incentives come from the desire to 1) manufacture the highest valued product, 2) conserve the amount of raw material used, 3) use lower priced and often, lower quality raw materials, and 4) meet future demands for wood products in an economy with stark contrasts of a declining wood supply and increasing pressure from environmental concerns. Developing appropriate non-destructive evaluation techniques requires research and development of new concepts and extending the usability of known principles. Dielectrics is one such technique that offers a number of potential applications in areas such as moisture detection, drying and re-drying, grading and sorting, defect detection, curing and gluing of engineered products, repairing and patching of laminated panel products, monitoring of adhesive curing, and manufacturing of aligned fiber products. The objective of this research was to fill the void in knowledge that existed about the dielectric properties of typical features found on Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) wood. Features investigated included clearwood, various sizes of loose and tight <b>knots,</b> <b>knot</b> <b>holes,</b> pitch pockets, pitch streaks, and blue stain. The dielectric constant and loss tangent were analyzed on a global (whole-feature) basis under a range of excitation frequencies and moisture content conditions typically found in wood processing. This research required the development of specialized instrumentation, because measuring the dielectric properties of wood over a broad full range of moisture and excitation frequency conditions is particularly challenging. Results suggested that there are optimal combinations of moisture and excitation frequencies suitable for applications where it is necessary to distinguish between certain wood features. Simple classifications of features measured at such optimal working conditions are presented in addition to global data on the expected dielectric properties of each feature. These results form a fundamental basis for the development of future stand-alone, dielectric-based applications or applications using dielectric-based in conjunction with and other sensing methods...|$|R
