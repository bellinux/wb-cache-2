3000|$|..., telling <b>s</b> that a <b>forwarder</b> {{is ready}} to provide routing progress. Under the {{circumstances}} that s receives more than one ACKs from multiple awake forwarders, it must figure out one as its unique forwarder. To coordinate those awake <b>forwarders,</b> <b>s</b> will continually retransmit its packet after it receives multiple ACKs. During such a retransmission-based polling process, some <b>forwarders</b> of <b>s</b> may not successfully reply ACK, either because they enter sleeping state or because of the poor link. The above procedure will be iterated until s receives only one ACK from some forwarder, say u; and then s selects u as its unique forwarder. When replying the ACK, each forwarder will back off a random {{period of time in}} order to restrain the possible co-channel collisions. A special case is that the sink node serves as a forwarder. If the sender s receives an ACK from the sink, s will broadcast a short message to other awake forwarders, notifying them to stop replying ACK and forwarding the packet received. In ORW, each of multiple awake forwarders returns ACK to sender with the probability of 50 % to reduce ACK duplications; this way is very likely to prune out forwarders with higher single-hop link quality and better routing progress. Different from ORW, the coordination of EOF leverages the ACK-based handshaking such that EOF can retain the opportunity that all the awake forwarders can offer, and tends to pick out the forwarder with more reliable connection and earlier forwarding opportunity.|$|R

40|$|The {{market for}} the {{licensing}} of intellectual property and other intangibles is growing rapidly in the United States. At {{the same time there}} is increasing interest in the value of these intangible assets and their impact on economic growth, productivity, and competitiveness. Despite this interest there are large gaps in the available data to track and evaluate the impact of intangibles and intellectual property on the economy. This paper describes the measurement challenges and presents both aggregate and industrial sector preliminary estimates of receipts of royalties and license fees. These estimates can be used to better assess the macroeconomic impact of intangibles and to trace the flows and impacts across industries. This paper uses previously unpublished estimates of BEA International Services trade data for royalty and licensing fees by industry sector to improve the current output measures for domestic producers of intellectual property by estimating the share of royalty income earned by different types of intangible assets for 2002.

In 1996, Florida's contribution represented 3. 7 percent of total U. <b>S.</b> cash <b>receipts</b> for carrots (3). Over the period 1988 - 93, Florida's harvested acreage accounted for an average of 9 percent of total U. S. carrot acreage (5). ● During the 1997 - 98 production season in Florida, a total of 6, 800 acres of fresh market carrots were planted and 5, 600 acres were harvested, with an average yield of 12, 500 pounds per acre. A total of 70 million pounds of carrots was produced, with a value of $ 0. 162 per pound and a total value of $ 11. 34 million (2). During the previous season (1996 - 97), Florida growers experienced record high carrot yields, with 18, 500 pounds produced per acre, for a total of 120. 3 million pounds from 6, 500 harvested acres. Over the last ten years, carrot acreage in the state has bee...|$|R
40|$|Market {{windows were}} {{examined}} in five wholesale markets for Oklahoma bell peppers, broccoli, cantaloupes, cauliflower, sweet potatoes and watermelons. “Market window ” refers to {{a period of time}} when the prices received by pro-ducers for selected crops are greater than the production costs. The analysis is based on price-cost comparisons in major wholesale markets. Price risk associated with price variability and yield risk was incorporated into the analysis. The Denver and New Orleans wholesale markets pro-vide excellent market windows for all six crops. The Chicago and Dallas wholesale markets show good market potential for most of the crops. Problem Statement and Objectives Oklahoma experienced a decline in its farm economy during the past decade. Cash receipts from traditional crops such as wheat and cattle have decreased or remained at low levels since the early 1980 <b>s.</b> Cash <b>receipts</b> from marketing of cattle and calf in nominal values have decreased from $ 1. 84 billion in 1980 to $ 1. 79 billion in 1990, while cash receipts from the marketing of winter wheat (Oklahoma’s main crop) have decreased from $ 712 million in 1980 to $ 492 million in 1990 (Oklahoma Department of Agri-culture). To supplement farm income, many Oklahoma producers sought alternative enter-prises. Among these enterprises was horticultural crop production, namely, the production of fruits and vegetables. x~i ~ re~wrch ~a ~ ~Pon~or ~ though a grat from the Agricul~ralMarketingservice,USDA md Hatch projec...|$|R
40|$|Every country faces what economists call an intertemporal (across time) budget constraint, which {{requires}} that its government 2 ̆ 019 s future expenditures, including the servicing of its outstanding official debt, {{be covered by}} its government 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> future <b>receipts</b> when measured in present value. The difference between {{the present value of}} a country 2 ̆ 019 s future expenditures and its future receipts is called its fiscal gap. This study estimates Russia 2 ̆ 019 s 2013 fiscal gap at 890 trillion rubles or 28 trillion. This longterm budget shortfall is 8. 4 percent of the present value of projected GDP. Consequently, eliminating Russia 2 ̆ 019 s fiscal gap on a smooth basis requires fiscal tightening by 8. 4 percent of each future year 2 ̆ 019 s projected GDP. One means of doing this is to immediately and permanently raise all Russian taxes by 29 percent. Another is to immediately and permanently cut all spending, apart from servicing outstanding debt, by 22. 4 percent. How can a country with vast energy resources and foreign reserves and other financial assets that exceed its official debt still have very major fiscal problems? The answer is that the Russia 2 ̆ 019 s energy resources are finite, whereas its expenditure needs are not. Moreover, Russia is aging and facing massive obligations from its pension system and other age related expenditures...|$|R
40|$|Droughts are of {{economic}} interest {{not because of}} the physical damage they cause, but because of the financial consequences that result from the physical damage. This distinction is not trivial, as physical damage may not result in economic loss. In an article recently published in Agricultural Policy for the 21 st Century (Iowa State University Press (ISUP)) and adapted for a forthcoming article in CHOICES, I discuss an empirical finding that the price flexibility obtained by regressing the spring-to-harvest change in harvest futures price on the spring-to-harvest change in average U. S. yield has not differed significantly from- 1 over the period beginning with the 1974 crop year for corn, cotton, oats, soybeans, and wheat. This finding implies that, on average, the product of market-level price and market-level yield, i. e., average U. S. per acre cash receipt, does not change as average U. S. yield changes from spring to harvest. The procedures are discussed briefly in the appendix. Risk is conventionally divided into (1) systemic risk, or risk at the market level, and (2) idiosyncratic risk, or risk unique to the individual. Thus, the above finding can be interpreted as implying that, on average, systemic U. S. yield risk does not translate into systemic U. <b>S.</b> cash <b>receipt</b> risk. In other words, on average the so-called “natural hedge ” between U. S. average price and U. S. average yield was perfect over the last quarter century for these five major U. S. field crops. Until recently researchers have focused on understandin...|$|R
