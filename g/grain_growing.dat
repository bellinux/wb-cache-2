25|$|The U.S. {{economy was}} {{primarily}} agricultural {{in the early}} 19th century. Westward expansion plus the building of canals {{and the introduction of}} steamboats opened up new areas for agriculture. Much land was cleared and put into growing cotton in the Mississippi valley and in Alabama, and new <b>grain</b> <b>growing</b> areas were brought into production in the Mid West. Eventually this put severe downward pressure on prices, particularly of cotton, first from 1820 to 1823 and again from 1840 to 1843.|$|E
25|$|The Cistercian monks {{set about}} proﬁtably using {{the land they}} had bought in a single-minded, well-planned and {{versatile}} way. Economic activities of the Cistercians included quarrying, the planting of vines {{on the slopes of}} the Saale and other suitable areas, the planting of orchards, the establishment of smithies, workshops for weaving, fur production and shoe-making, the setting-up of bakeries and cheese dairies as well as intense sheep rearing, <b>grain</b> <b>growing,</b> timber rafting and ﬁshing. The Cistercians expanded their property from the Köppelberg vineyard, and created nine steep slope vineyards between 1195 and 1208. At the end of the Middle Ages, the monastery owned 58 vineyards between Bad Kösen and Roßbach. Cellar and wine masters at Pforta ensured high quality in wine making, measuring it according to vinum bonum (1226), vinum melius (1289) or vinum terrestre (country wine, around 1340).|$|E

[...] Fortune seekers during the gold rush of 1896 traveled north through Edmonton or took the rail as far north as Prince Albert.

2500|$|Canaanite culture {{apparently}} {{developed in}} situ {{from the earlier}} Ghassulian chalcolithic culture, which pioneered the Mediterranean agricultural system typical of the Canaanite region, which comprised intensive subsistence horticulture, extensive <b>grain</b> <b>growing,</b> commercial wine and olive cultivation and transhumance pastoralism. [...] Ghassulian itself developed from the Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, which in turn developed from a fusion of their ancestral Natufian and Harifian cultures with Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) farming cultures, practicing animal domestication, during the 6200BC climatic crisis {{which led to the}} Agricultural Revolution/Neolithic Revolution in the Levant. The Late Bronze Age state of Ugarit (at Ras Shamra in Syria) is considered quintessentially Canaanite archaeologically, even though its Ugaritic language does not belong to the Canaanite language group proper.|$|E

2500|$|Early in the season, {{many species}} of birds, {{including}} the long-tailed widowbird, and rodents feed upon wheat crops. These animals can cause significant damage to a crop by digging up and eating newly planted seeds or young plants. They can also damage the crop {{late in the season}} by eating the grain from the mature spike. Recent post-harvest losses in cereals amount to billions of dollars per year in the United States alone, and damage to wheat by various borers, beetles and weevils is no exception. Rodents can also cause major losses during storage, and in major <b>grain</b> <b>growing</b> regions, field mice numbers can sometimes build up explosively to plague proportions because of the ready availability of food. To reduce the amount of wheat lost to post-harvest pests, Agricultural Research Service scientists have developed an [...] "insect-o-graph," [...] which can detect insects in wheat that are not visible to the naked eye. The device uses electrical signals to detect the insects as the wheat is being milled. The new technology is so precise that it can detect 5-10 infested seeds out of 300,000 good ones. Tracking insect infestations in stored grain is critical for food safety {{as well as for the}} marketing value of the crop.|$|E
2500|$|GM (Genetically modified) grains are {{not allowed}} in South Australia, where some grain {{producers}} have called for the moratorium to be lifted. [...] They argue the GM technology would help them tackle weeds and other pests, and that farmers {{should be able to}} choose how they run their enterprises {{and whether or not they}} wanted to grow the 'premium products' described by Leon Bignell, the South Australian (SA) Agriculture Minister. Producers have also said their GM-free grain is not translating to higher profits. Bignell conceded more work needed to be done to market produce as GM-free but said he was confident producers would see higher financial returns in the near future. [...] In March 2015, Bignell told farmers they should not use GM but should instead rely upon what he called [...] 'God's gifts'. [...] He said the [...] "amazing" [...] results of the Government's 'New Horizons' [...] soil improvement program [...] "prove," [...] in his view, that grain producers [...] "do not need genetic modification technology." [...] He said that [...] "Instead of using the top five centimetres of the soil, you go down to 50cm or even deeper. You put clay in it when it's needed, you put organic matter where it's needed as well." [...] Bignell said the trials had strengthened his view that South Australia should maintain a moratorium on GM technology, which he said gave the state's produce a [...] "market edge". [...] Bignell also said he believed results of the New Horizons program could be replicated in all <b>grain</b> <b>growing</b> areas of the state. Bignell added that [...] "If you look at GM and the promises around increases of about seven per cent in yields, why would you go for seven per cent when you can get 50 to 100 per cent increases in yield without having to use genetically modified seeds?" ...|$|E
30|$|In {{the theory}} of planet formation, the issue {{concerning}} the radial drift of meter-size dust remains an open question. In a typical scenario, micrometer-size dust <b>grains</b> <b>grow</b> to be kilometer-size planetesimals via collision and merging in a protoplanetary disk (Goldreich and Ward 1973; Hayashi 1981). When the dust <b>grain</b> <b>grows</b> to be meter-sized, there is velocity {{with respect to the}} disk gas and losses in the angular momentum due to the drag force. Thus, the grain falls down to the central star and cannot grow further (Adachi et al. 1976; Brauer et al. 2008).|$|R

60|$|The {{business}} of the colony progressed admirably after this. A large house was erected, with a central hall and numerous sleeping-rooms or closets off it, where all the chief people dwelt together, {{and a number of}} the men messed daily. Grass was found in abundance, and a large quantity of this was cut and stacked for winter use, although there was good {{reason to believe that the}} winter would be so mild that the cattle might be left out to forage for themselves. Salmon were also caught in great numbers, not only in Little River but in the main stream, and in the lake at their very doors. What they did not consume was dried, smoked, and stored. Besides this, a large quantity of fine timber was felled, squared, cut into lengths, and made suitable for exportation. Eggs were found on the islands offshore, and feathers collected, so that early in the summer they had more than enough wherewith to load the ship. Among other discoveries they found <b>grain</b> <b>growing</b> wild. The Saga-writers have called it wheat, but it is open to question whether it was not wild rice, of which large quantities grow in the uninhabited parts of America at the present time. They also found a beautiful kind of wood, called massurwood, of which samples were sent to Greenland and Norway; but what this wood really was we cannot tell.|$|E
