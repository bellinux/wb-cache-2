6000|$|On {{his return}} (in 1749) {{he took his}} degree of Doctor in Medicine, and settled himself at Chelsea[1], where he resided till 1763. The next effort of his pen, an Essay on the <b>External</b> <b>Use</b> of Water, {{in a letter to}} Dr.----, with {{particular}} remarks upon the present method of using the mineral waters at Bath, in Somersetshire, &c. (in 1752) was directed to views of professional advancement. In his profession, however, he did not succeed; and meeting with no encouragement in any other quarter, he devoted himself henceforward to the service of the booksellers. More novels, translation, historical compilation, ephemeral criticism, were the multifarious employments which they laid on him. Nothing that he afterwards produced quite came up to the raciness of his first performances. In 1753, he published the Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom. In the dedication of this novel he left a blank after the word Doctor, which may probably be supplied with the name of Armstrong. From certain phrases that occur in the more serious parts, I should conjecture them to be hastily translated from another language. Some of these shall be laid before the reader, that he may judge for himself. [...] "A solemn profession, on which she reposed herself with the most implicit confidence and faith;" [...] ch. xii. (v. 4. p. 54, of Dr. Anderson's edition.)--"Our hero would have made his retreat through the port, by which he had entered;" [...] instead of the door; ch. xiii. p. 55.--"His own penetration pointed out the canal, through which his misfortune had flowed upon him;" [...] instead of the channel; ch. xx. p. 94.--"Public ordinaries, walks, and spectacles;" [...] instead of places of entertainment; ch. xxv. p. 125.--"The Tyrolese, by the canal of Ferdinand's finger, and recommendation, sold a pebble for a real brilliant;" [...] ch. xxxvii. p. 204.--"A young gentleman whose pride was indomitable;" [...] ch. xlvi. p. 242. In one chapter we find ourselves in a stage-coach, with such a company as Smollett loved to introduce to his readers.|$|E
