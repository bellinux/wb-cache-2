40|$|This paper investigates {{strategies}} {{that have been}} used in companies from different countries to alleviate the impact of extortion from armed groups in businesses, especially in construction companies. Based on these experiences a risk management <b>decision-making</b> <b>criterion</b> will be outlined, resulting on broad recommendations to assist local small and medium size companies in the decision-making process when dealing with an incident of extortion. At the end, a list of potential recommendations is highlighted to assist companies in this process. The methodology for this thesis is based on desk-top research, literature review taken from companies’ websites, NGO’s websites, states reports, journal articles, statistics and relevant cases studies from companies dealing with extortion. The outcome of this investigation would be a <b>decision-making</b> <b>criterion</b> and a list of recommendations that companies could use to mitigate or avoid extortions in Colombia.

5000|$|In {{a series}} of papers, Milgrom studied the problem of {{lobbying}} and politicking, or [...] "influence activities" [...] that occur in large organizations. These papers considered models in which employees are affected by post-hiring decisions. When managers have discretion over these decisions, employees have incentives to spend time attempting to influence the outcomes. Since this time could instead be spent on productive tasks, influence activities are costly for the firm. Milgrom shows that firms may limit the discretion of managers {{in order to avoid}} these costs (Milgrom, 1988). In a paper with John Roberts, Milgrom also studied a model in which employees have information that is valuable to the decision maker. As a result, allowing some degree of influence is beneficial, but excessive influence is costly. Milgrom and Roberts compare various strategies that firms might use to discourage excessive influence activities, and they show that typically, limiting employees' access to decision makers and altering <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> arepreferable to the use of explicit financial incentives (Milgrom and Roberts, 1988). In another paper, with Margaret Meyer and Roberts (1992), Milgrom studied the influence costs that arise in multiunit firms. They demonstrate that managers of underperforming units have incentives to exaggerate the prospects of their unit in order to protect their jobs. If the unit were embedded in a firm whose other units were more closely related, there would be a lower threat of layoffs, because reassignment of workers could occur instead. Similarly, if the unit were independent, there would many fewer opportunities to misrepresent its prospects. These arguments help explain why divestitures of underperforming units occur so frequently and why, when such units do not become stand-alone firms, they are often purchased by buyers operating in related lines of business.|$|E

Our qualitative analysis {{is based on a}} comprehensive, longitudinal data set comprising 11  years of archival data from a European-based VC firm. During this time, the VC managed two funds, reviewed a total of 3631 deals, and made 35 investments. By adopting this research methodology, we can overcome several limitations of post-hoc methods and experiments commonly used in this research stream, and also have the opportunity to tackle some fundamental, yet hitherto elusive research topics. For example, our findings reveal how the importance of <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> varies between different stages of the evaluation process.

40|$|Background: Assessment and {{appraisal}} of new medical technologies require {{a balance between}} the interests of different stakeholders. Final decision should take into account the societal value of new therapies. Objective: This perspective paper discusses the socio-economic burden of disease as a specific reimbursement <b>decision-making</b> <b>criterion</b> and calls for the inclusion of it as a counterbalance to the cost-effectiveness and budget impact criteria. Results/Conclusions: Socio-economic burden is a <b>decision-making</b> <b>criterion,</b> accounting for diseases, for which the assessed medical technology is indicated. This indicator is usually researched through cost-of-illness studies that systematically quantify the socio-economic burden of diseases on the individual and on the society. This is a very important consideration as it illustrates direct budgetary consequences of diseases in the health system and indirect costs associated with patient or carer productivity losses. By measuring and comparing the socio-economic burden of different diseases to society, health authorities and payers could benefit in optimizing priority setting and resource allocation. New medical technologies, especially innovative therapies, present an excellent case study for the inclusion of socio-economic burden in reimbursement decision-making. Assessment and appraisal have been greatly concentrated so far on cost-effectiveness and budget impact, marginalizing all other considerations. In this context, data on disease burden and inclusion of explicit criterion of socio-economic burden in reimbursement decision-making may be highly beneficial. Realizing the magnitude of the lost socio-economic contribution resulting from diseases in question could be a reasonable way for policy makers to accept a higher valuation of innovative therapies...|$|R

(Financial Management) This study aims to {{determine}} whether South African do-it-yourself listed share investors consider selected strategic investment <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> in their investment processes. It also aims {{to determine}} whether South African do-it-yourself listed share investors’ decision-making is affected by selected behavioural bias. A quantitative research approach was adopted, and an electronic questionnaire was emailed to a convenience sample consisting of individuals who are employed at three financial institutions within the Gauteng region. The demographic profile of the convenience sample {{was found to be}} similar to those of previous studies and therefore provided a sound base for comparison and analysis. These results indicated that do-it-yourself listed share investors are in fact considering the selected strategic <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> across the investment process. On assessment of the investor’s behaviour against the selected biases which are commonly associated with listed share investors, it was determined that the respondents, in general, believe that their decision-making is mostly not affected. This study informs the potential do-it-yourself listed share investor of the <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> considered by current investors, as well as potential behavioural biases that could adversely affect their investment decision-making process.

Objective: Determine a set of rules enabling SE researchers to find out, based on the characteristics of the experiments to be aggregated, whether or not it is feasible to accurately detect heterogeneity. Method: Evaluate the statistical power of heterogeneity detection methods using a Monte Carlo simulation process. Results: The Q test is not powerful when the meta-analysis contains up to a total of about 200 experimental subjects and the effect size difference is less than 1. Conclusions: The Q test cannot be used as a <b>decision-making</b> <b>criterion</b> for meta-analysis in small sample settings like SE.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive cognitive management framework for spectrum selection in cognitive radio (CR) networks. The framework uses a belief vector concept {{as a means}} to predict the interference affecting the different spectrum blocks (SBs) and relies on a smart analysis of the scenario dynamicity to properly determine an adequate observation strategy to balance the tradeoff between achievable performance and measurement requirements. In this respect, the paper shows that the interference dynamics in a given SB can be properly characterized through the second highest eigenvalue of the interference state transition matrix. Therefore, this indicator is retained in the proposed framework as a relevant parameter to drive the selection of both the observation strategy and spectrum selection <b>decision-making</b> <b>criterion.</b> This paper evaluates the proposed framework to illustrate the capability to properly choose among a set of possible observation strategies under different scenario conditions. Furthermore, a comparison against other state-of-the-art solutions is presented...|$|R
