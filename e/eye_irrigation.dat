40|$|AIMS—Hypothermic irrigating {{solutions}} {{were used}} during vitrectomy in pressure induced ischaemic eyes {{so that their}} effects on retinal function and histological changes could be investigated.  METHODS—After anaesthetised albino rabbits underwent closed vitrectomy, their vitreous cavities were continuously irrigated for 30  minutes at a perfusion pressure of 140  mm Hg. The rabbits were divided into three groups according to their intraocular perfusion temperatures— 8 °C, 22 °C, and 38 °C. Electroretinograms were taken before and after irrigation. Glutamate levels in the vitreous were examined after <b>irrigation.</b> <b>Eyes</b> were enucleated on the seventh postoperative day and examined histologically.  RESULTS—On the seventh postoperative day, the recovery rate of a-wave amplitudes was significantly lower in the 38 °C group than in the 8 °C group, and that of b-wave amplitudes was significantly lower in the 38 °C group than in either the 8 °C or 22 °C group. Retinal damage in the 38 °C group revealed more severe histological impairment than in either the 8 °C or 22 °C group. Oedema of the inner retinal layer was significant in both the 22 °C and 38 °C groups. Glutamates reached peak values 30  minutes {{after the end of}} ischaemia in the 38 °C group.

During surgery, we used cold (4 ºc) and warm (room temperature) BSS and viscoelastic gel {{in the first and}} second group respectively. For all patients, we started sedation with Midazolam and Fentanyl and in case that we needed additional drug, we used Sodium Thiopental till we reached desired sedation level. Ramsay sedation scores (before, during and after surgery) and total sedative drug consumption were evaluated and compared between two groups {{and at the end of}} the surgery, we checked and recorded the satisfaction score of patients and surgeon about the quality of sedation. Results: The average dosage of Midazolam wasn’t significantly different between two groups, while the average dosage of Sodium Thiopental was significantly lower in cold group. Also, the average time on which we reached desired Ramsay sedation score and the level of Ramsay score were significantly different between two groups. Conclusion: Using cold BSS and viscoelastic gel in cataract surgery in comparison of their combination in room temperature will reduce the dosage of sedative drugs which we use during surgery and help us getting a more effective sedation and higher patient and surgeon satisfaction. ...|$|E

40|$|The sealed-capsule {{irrigation}} device, the Perfect Capsule, is {{a surgical}} device designed to target lens epithelial cells (LECs) during cataract surgery and prevent posterior capsule opacification (PCO). This {{is especially important}} in {{cases in which the}} posterior capsule must stay intact after cataract surgery, such as when implanting accommodative lenses. It also can be used when PCO is expected to be extensive, such as in pediatric cataract surgery. This thesis was created to evaluate the use of the Perfect Capsule in small young eyes with very proliferative lens epithelial cells in an animal model with young rabbits. In the first study, 30 4 -week-old rabbits had bilateral clear lens extraction. The Perfect Capsule was implanted in one <b>eye</b> and sealed-capsule <b>irrigation</b> was performed with either balanced salt solution (BSS), distilled deionized water (DDW), or 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) 50 mg/ml for 5 minutes. The capsule then was flushed with BSS to wash out the residual substance. The contralateral eye did not undergo sealed-capsule irrigation. The after-cataract was evaluated clinically and in images taken at 5. 5 weeks after surgery and histologically after the endpoint 6 weeks postoperatively. Only 5 -FU effectively prevented the development of after-cataract. The second study evaluated the safety of irrigation with 5 -FU in 30 8 -week-old rabbits. Clear lens extraction was performed in one eye and the Perfect Capsule was implanted in three of the four groups. In one group, the capsule was irrigated for 5 minutes with BSS, in the second group with 5 -FU 50 mg/ml, and in the third group with 5 -FU 50 mg/ml and then BSS to wash out the residual substance. In the fourth group, the Perfect Capsule was not used; to mimic leakage in the device 0. 2 ml of 5 -FU 50 mg/ml was instilled in the capsule, left for 30 seconds, and washed out with I/A. Safety was evaluated by comparing pachymetry, endothelial cell count, and histologic findings after the endpoint of 24 or 48 hours postoperatively (half of each group at each time point). There was no difference in pachymetry or endothelial cell count among the groups. Histology showed no damage in the central or peripheral retina or the trabecular meshwork due to the substance used. We concluded that it is safe to use the Perfect Capsule with 5 -FU even if leakage occurs. The third study evaluated the possibility of lowering the 5 -FU concentration and maintaining a sufficient preventive effect on LEC proliferation. We also evaluated irrigation with thapsigargin, which was reported to be effective in in vitro human studies. Thirty 4 -week-old rabbits had clear lens extraction in one eye. The Perfect Capsule was implanted and the capsule was irrigated for 2 minutes with either BSS, 5 -FU 50 mg/ml, 5 -FU 25 mg/ml, or thapsigargin and then BSS for 10 seconds. The after-cataract was evaluated clinically and in images taken 5 weeks postoperatively and histologically at 6 weeks postoperatively. The 50 mg/ml concentration of 5 -FU successfully prevented after-cataract formation. Thapsigargin was ineffective in this animal model. In the fourth study, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to determine if the posterior capsule is damaged by 5 -FU or thapsigargin or just by the use of the Perfect Capsule. Clear lens extraction was performed in 4 -week-old rabbits. We studied two eyes that were irrigated for 2 minutes with BSS, two eyes with 5 -FU 50 mg/ml, two eyes with 5 -FU 25 mg/ml, and two eyes with thapsigargin.

40|$|The {{apparent}} persistency {{of colonial}} irrigation elements in Dutch irrigation practice and {{education is the}} main source of inspiration for this book; the Netherlands East Indian irrigation regime, consisting of explicit and implicit rules for irrigation design is its subject. The book explains how the Netherlands East Indian irrigation regime developed and how (dis) continuities in irrigation education and practice after Indonesian independence can be understood. The idea of persistency in engineering is not new; engineering has been analyzed as being influenced by design schools, in which certain preferences for solutions and/or methods are maintained. The question of continuity is studied applying the concept of technological regime, which is defined in chapter 1 as a set of rules that structure activities of actors (engineers) involved in development and use of a certain technology (irrigation). Five categories of rules are distinguished: (1) founding premises or guiding principles; (2) promises and expectations about a future technology; (3) design requirements, functions to be fulfilled; (4) design tools, knowledge, design heuristics, methods and approaches; and (5) artefacts and operation, results of any design activity. The second chapter discusses guiding principles and promises and expectations for some selected colonial irrigation development processes in India and Africa. The chapter shows how the juggling act of colonial rule between available labour (both from colonisers and colonised), available financial resources and political goals influenced irrigation development. Irrigation development in the British and French colonies did not only have to serve the colonial powers, but also the colony itself; it would not serve mere exploitation, but also become an element of a policy of productive imperialism. The main argument developed in this chapter is that although similar ideologies explaining or defending European domination and consequent colonial irrigation development were stressed in all colonies, in the context of irrigation development these colonial ideologies were translated differently in the African colonial areas (with the exception of Egypt) than in the colonies in the Indies. Chapter 2 shows that guiding principles and promises/expectations are important categories; the third chapter takes the analysis to a more detailed level; the process in which guiding principles, design requirements and artefacts in the Netherlands East Indies context developed is reconstructed. The agrarian policy of the Dutch colonial powers is vital in explaining why a Netherlands East Indian approach could develop. The most important founding element in Dutch colonial irrigation (guiding principle) was the mutual presence of food and commercial crops (respectively rice grown by peasants and sugar cane by the industry) in the same irrigated area. Consequently, the need for adjustable water control was felt (design requirement); to realize such control two types of artefacts were needed: management regulations and structures. Furthermore, the chapter makes clear that debates in different colonial circles (engineers, politicians, general public) did not necessarily coincide; debates within one community did not always influence debates in another one. Chapter 4 reconstructs the debate on river peak discharge determination in the Netherlands East Indies. Like in the third chapter, the interactions between relevant social groups are central in this chapter. Unlike the discourse on water management, however, the hydrological debate has generally been restricted to participants from Dutch colonial circles which can be labelled as either scientific or technical; social groups like sugar producers or colonial politicians were not involved. Javas natural environment has been the stimulus for Dutch irrigation engineers to develop certain procedures; the discharge regime of the rivers, specifically the peak discharge (on Java in the shape of flash floods (bandjirs)) {{was one of the main}} issues. Dutch engineer Melchior developed a methodology to determine the design peak flows of Javanese rivers; although it was heavily debated and criticized, engineers kept applying it throughout the colonial period. One of the irrigation systems in which the methodology was applied was the West-Javanese Tjipoenegara system (design process roughly between 1920 and 1935). Chapter 5 is entirely devoted to this case study. The Tjipoenegara design period is a key period for two reasons: from a theoretical point of view a closer analysis of the timeframe sheds light on the question of regime construction and continuity; from design point of view this timeframe brought a series of quick changes. The main focus in the chapter is on actions and discussions of colonial irrigation engineers in their respective professional circles. The majority of decisions appear to have been the responsibility of the engineering circles alone; most of them relate to the regime categories of design requirements, tools and artefacts. An important design rule appears to be the anticipation of presence of sugar cane next to rice in the irrigated area, requiring control over flows varying in time and space in the irrigated area. The chapter discusses how within this guiding principle, the engineers constructed their design approach. Chapter 6 discusses (dis) continuities in irrigation planning and engineering after World War II, when Indonesia became an independent republic. The case study of the Lampung area (Southern Sumatra) makes clear to that irrigation activities in the Lampung area in independent Indonesia, as in most other areas of Indonesia, colonial influences are still strongly influencing irrigation development. It is demonstrated that design rules, including artefacts and methods developed by Dutch engineers in colonial times, still shape to a large extent irrigation design practice in Indonesia, even when representatives of other irrigation regimes have found their way to Indonesia too. Chapter 7 presents another practice of continuity, Dutch civil engineering irrigation education. Although the civil engineers in the Netherlands East Indies had a keen <b>eye</b> for <b>irrigation</b> developments in other regions, the irrigation courses and graduation designs at Delft Polytechnic did not reflect such interest up to the 1980 s and remained based on the colonial technological regime. It also becomes clear that the community of Dutch irrigation engineers had to defend its position within the Department of Civil Engineering continuously. In the conclusions, it is proposed that it is indeed possible to define a Dutch irrigation regime. Between 1830 and 1940, guiding principles and the design requirements were formulated relatively early, whereas the design tools and artefacts showed a more continuous development over time. A distinction in two phases in the general development process of the Netherlands East Indian irrigation regime can be made. The phase between 1870 and 1910 can be best understood as the formation phase of the regime, in which the guiding principles, promises/expectations and the majority of the design requirements took their shape. The focus in this phase was on developing prescriptions for irrigation design. The phase between 1910 and 1940 can best be understood as the elaboration phase of the regime, in which tools and artefacts to translate general rules into infrastructure were defined. Focus was on perfecting tools and artefacts applied in irrigation design. The innovation pattern of the Netherlands East Indian irrigation regime can be understood as a mission-oriented innovation pattern; main carrier of innovation and transformation in the Netherlands East Indies is the colonial state. Within the colonial state the civil engineers became the most dominating group around 1890. Civil servants were involved in some important regime elements, for example in establishing water regulations, but their importance decreased steadily over time. Agricultural engineers entered the discourse to some extent after 1900, when the guiding principles were already defined. The importance of guidelines and continuing relevance of colonial design rules in modern Indonesian and Delft irrigation practice and education show the essential role of storage in networks: older design guidelines still structure later designers. The design rules to be included in those guidelines were tested; applications that had shown to work in a real-life irrigation system were candidates for guidelines from the Department of Public Works. World War II forms a demarcation for the irrigation regime: suddenly the stable working practice in the East Indies disappeared. The new political realities caused a major shift in contexts for the Dutch irrigation regime. Dutch engineers started working in other tropical regions, engineers from different countries started to work in independent Indonesia. These changes, however, remained far away for a long time from the irrigation education program in Delft. Although the new working realities for Dutch irrigation engineers were recognized, the study material suggests that irrigation engineering in Delft was approached as the application of several design prescriptions from the technological regime developed in the Netherlands East Indies. It took to the 1980 s before Delft irrigation education came loose from the colonial frame and allowed some post-War experiences and new concepts from outside the East Indian regime into the courses.
