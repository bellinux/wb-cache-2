40|$|Purpose: The {{use of a}} {{different}} protocol to assess the same aspects of the Functional Communication Profile (FCP) may contribute to a faster and less expensive determination of individual profiles of abilities and inabilities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to verify the applicability of a checklist to replace the aforementioned complete protocol as a way to facilitate clinical and therapeutic <b>follow-up</b> <b>processes.</b> Methods: The participants in this study were 50 children aged from 3 to 12 years, with diagnoses within the autism spectrum who were receiving specialized speech-language therapy for at least six months. The participants were filmed while interacting with the speech-language pathologist, and the data were transcribed to the FCP protocol. After the recording and prior to the transcription, the speech-language pathologists were asked to answer the checklist of Communicative Functions. Results: All answers on the checklist and on the FCP were compared. The results indicated that there were statistical differences in nine of the 20 communicative functions, and in nine of the 50 children. These results suggest that the checklist is efficient to describe a group of children but not to characterize them individually. Therefore, it is possible to identify differences in the communicative profile but not to specify the frequency with which each function occurs. Conclusion: The checklist can be used as a tool in the therapeutic <b>follow-up</b> <b>processes</b> of children with autism spectrum disorders, but it does not replace the complete FCP protocol...|$|R

Each new sensor node is preloaded with two parameters: (I DnewSnew), an encryption algorithm E(∗), and an one-way hash function H(∗).

40|$|Motivation – To {{provide to}} {{physical}} therapists a monitoring system with effective and accurate patient monitoring and evolution analysis. Research approach – We analyzed therapy sessions with tetraplegic patients {{to better understand}} the rehabilitation process and highlight the major requirements for a technology-enhanced tool.

Research limitations/Implications – Analysis and studies have been performed in a rehabilitation centre with a limited set of therapists (3) and patients (7). Originality/Value – The research herein contributes with a requirement analysis for a computer-assisted rehabilitation platform. We present a tracking-based system instantiating these requirements and outline its values after a preliminary informal validation. Take away message – The capture and virtual playback of motion in physical therapy sessions increases therapist awareness of patient condition and evolution thus improving the rehabilitation process...|$|R

40|$|Follow-up is {{a natural}} {{component}} of both project management and projects which, curiously enough, the research community has not previously addressed. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the role of the <b>follow-up</b> <b>process</b> in project management. The <b>follow-up</b> <b>process</b> is defined as a process where execution and implementation is improved through the exertion of continuous control. The method used was a multiple-case study, building on data from four organizations actively implementing follow-up processes. The data comprised interviews with project managers from the case organizations, company documentation, annual reports, publicly available information and presentations. The sectors the case organizations operated in were IT services, manufacturing, event organization, and a governmental administrative authority. Five themes emerged from an analysis of the empirical data which were found to influence the <b>follow-up</b> <b>process</b> in projects. The five themes are Documentation, Standardization, Accountability, Learning and Risk Assessment. With insights from the five themes, the research community and project managers can gain a strong understanding of what the <b>follow-up</b> <b>process</b> looks like and its role in project management. The implications for project managers include a better appreciation of the <b>follow-up</b> <b>process</b> and knowledge of the aspects to consider when setting up a new project process.

Next, the setting and use of objectives, the nature of assessment objectives, the breadth or scope of objectives set, the strength and clarity of objectives used and the measurement of objectives will be discussed. Building on this we will explore measurement of the achievement of objectives, primarily through the use of indicators, and monitoring and <b>follow-up</b> <b>processes.</b> Stepping back from the detail of objective setting and indicator use, we then reflect on the notion of reductionism and the use of, and relationship with, science in sustainability assessment.
