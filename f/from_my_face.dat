2500|$|According to Schwarzenegger, filming was {{physically}} demanding {{as he had}} to swim in very cold water and spent three weeks covered in mud for the climactic battle with the alien. In addition, cast and crew endured very cold temperatures in the Mexican jungle that required heat lamps to be {{on all of the}} time. Cast and crew filmed on rough terrain that, according to the actor, was never flat, [...] "always on a hill. We stood all day long on a hill, one leg down, one leg up. It was terrible." [...] Schwarzenegger also faced the challenge of working with Kevin Peter Hall, who could not see in the Predator suit. The actor remembers, [...] "so when he's supposed to slap me around and stay far <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> all of a sudden, whap! There is this hand with claws on it!" [...] Hall stated in an interview that his experience on the film, [...] "wasn't a movie, it was a survival story for all of us." [...] For example, in the scene where the Predator chases Dutch, the water was foul, stagnant and full of leeches. Hall could not see out of the mask and had to rehearse his scenes with it off and then memorize where everything was. The outfit was difficult to wear because it was heavy and off-balance.|$|E
2500|$|Zhuge Dan's son, Zhuge Jing (諸葛靚), {{was sent}} as a hostage to Eastern Wu in 257 {{in return for}} support from Wu forces for his father's rebellion. He {{remained}} in Wu and served as Minister of War (大司馬). In 280, after the Jin dynasty conquered Wu, Zhuge Jing went into hiding {{in the home of}} his sister (the one who married Sima Zhou). The Jin emperor Sima Yan (Emperor Wu) considered Zhuge Jing his relative (Sima Zhou was an uncle of Emperor Wu) and knew that Zhuge Jing was hiding in his sister's home, so he paid them a visit. When Zhuge Jing heard that the emperor had come to visit him, he hid in the latrine and refused to come out. The emperor insisted on seeing him and said, [...] "Today, we finally meet each other again." [...] Zhuge Jing replied tearfully, [...] "I regret not being able to cover my body in paint and remove the skin <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> before I meet Your Majesty again!" [...] Emperor Wu appointed him as a Palace Attendant (侍中), but he refused to accept, returned to his hometown and lived {{the rest of his life}} as a commoner. Zhuge Jing had two sons: Zhuge Yi (諸葛頤) and Zhuge Hui (諸葛恢). Zhuge Yi served as Minister of Ceremonies (太常) during the Jin dynasty and was favoured by Emperor Yuan. Zhuge Hui served as Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令).|$|E

60|$|The cheery {{answer came}} with so merry a ring that the clouds cleared <b>from</b> <b>my</b> uncle's <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|The light {{seemed to}} die out <b>from</b> <b>my</b> companion's <b>face.</b> Once more he became stern and thoughtful.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed to}} digest my answer laboriously, his mouth gaping, his little eyes never straying <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{gazed at}} him fixedly, taking my hands <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> with the tears still wet on my burning cheek.|$|E
6000|$|I believe Simon Kenton read <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> the {{thoughts}} {{which were in}} my mind, for he said slowly, as if weighing well each word: ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a fearful}} cry--doubly fearful {{on a ship}} {{hundreds}} of miles <b>from</b> land--and <b>my</b> <b>face</b> blanched as I sprang to my feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look," [...] cried Aissa. [...] "Look at {{the mother}} of your son! She is afraid. Why does she not go <b>from</b> before <b>my</b> <b>face?</b> Look at her. She is ugly." ...|$|R
60|$|The Duke {{examined}} the ring long and searchingly. Then he looked <b>from</b> it into <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|As I made no reply, {{she gently}} took my hands within her own, removed them <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and fixed her eyes steadfastly on mine.|$|E
60|$|But at length, dismissing {{all such}} folly, at least <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> I lifted the trap-door and descended the steep ladder {{into the room}} beneath.|$|E
60|$|A little exclamation {{escaped from}} the Commander-in-Chief. Lord Chelsford never removed his eyes <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> the Duke had still the {{appearance}} of a tolerant but slightly bored listener.|$|E
60|$|From {{the sudden}} {{disappearance}} of the look of careless pleasantry <b>from</b> <b>my</b> friend's <b>face,</b> and the grave earnest tone in which he spoke, I {{saw that he had}} bad news to tell.|$|R
60|$|I bowed, and {{did my best}} to {{hold back}} my {{satisfaction}} at his words <b>from</b> showing in <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'The calmness {{suddenly}} vanished <b>from</b> <b>my</b> tormentor's <b>face</b> and manner. His {{eyes were}} ablaze with mingled triumph and hate. [...] "You thought so, you poor fool!" [...] he hissed {{out at me}} across the table. [...] "Bah! you were a fool! You were easily deceived! Listen! ...|$|R
6000|$|Slowly, at last, {{he moved}} his eyes <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> {{as if he were}} waking from a vision, and cast them round the room. Then he said, in a low voice: ...|$|E
60|$|I stood palely before her, {{striving to}} keep the loathing <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and I was {{conscious}} that Bianca had suddenly turned and was regarding us with eyes of grave concern.|$|E
60|$|Wiping the {{perspiration}} <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> I {{made my way}} to {{the forward}} deck. But few people were on board, and quite undisturbed, I leaned against the railing to review the situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fire!" [...] {{was on my}} lips when in {{an instant}} the English man {{vanished}} <b>from</b> before <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and in his place was a great pile of hay, with a red-coated arm and two Hessian boots waving and kicking {{in the heart of}} it. Oh, the gallant landlady! It was my whiskers that had saved me.|$|R
6000|$|... “I believe, {{my young}} friend, that terror has driven you <b>from</b> <b>my</b> recollection; your <b>face</b> is very familiar, and yet, {{for the honor}} of a score of bucks’ tails in my cap, I could not tell your name.” ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{the time}} he had pulled on his vest and drawers, I came out {{suddenly}} <b>from</b> <b>my</b> ambush and <b>faced</b> him. A fresh shock awaited me. I could hardly believe my eyes. It was NOT Le Geyt--no, nor anything like him! ...|$|R
60|$|I drew {{my fingers}} <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> {{and glared at}} him from between them; then {{scrambled}} to my feet. Out swam the sun again, drenching all around us with its light and heat.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at me quite kindly for a moment. Then {{suddenly}} her manner completely--changed. She withdrew her eyes <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> with a slight flush in her cheeks, and turned abruptly away.|$|E
60|$|He glanced <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> to my jacket, {{and from}} my jacket to my face, and at length, with a pleased but {{somewhat}} puzzled expression, begged me to accompany him on a walk.|$|E
60|$|Shrimp! I {{had seen}} the loathsome, doubled-up creatures (in their boiled state) on a kitchen plate. My blood turned to vinegar; and in rage and shame I fell all of a heap on the table, hiding <b>from</b> her sight <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and <b>my</b> hands as best I could under my clothes, and wishing that I might vanish away from the world altogether.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{gave her}} my first bird [...] When first my voice it knew; [...] I made her share my posies rare [...] And told her where they grew: [...] I taught her God's dear name [...] With prayer and praise to tell, [...] She looked <b>from</b> heaven into <b>my</b> <b>face</b> [...] And said, I love thee well." [...] Margret, Margret.|$|R
500|$|Ling is {{not above}} using her {{ethnicity}} {{as a means}} of gaining advantage. [...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say here, because none of you speak Chinese. But you can see <b>from</b> <b>my</b> sad <b>face</b> I'm sympathetic. You hear <b>from</b> <b>my</b> tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for me. As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|R
60|$|Then my nerve broke, {{the cold}} sweat poured <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and I fled from the hut {{as a man}} might from a scene in hell, {{followed}} by the low mocking laugh of Zikali.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a {{telephone}} in her room," [...] the detective continued, without removing his eyes <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> [...] "We understand from the hall-porter that a message was received by her soon after her arrival." ...|$|E
6000|$|The dancing gladness in {{her eyes}} {{vanished}} swiftly {{as she waited for}} an answer to her question. She caught the note of tragedy <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> [...] "Why have you come back from Italy?" [...] she asked in an altered voice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you will}} do me the favour,' he said, holding up the green shade, and {{revealing}} an eye most horribly discoloured, 'to look at this, you will naturally inquire, in your own minds, how did I get it. If you look <b>from</b> that, to <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> you will wonder {{what could have been}} the cause of all these scratches. And if <b>from</b> them to <b>my</b> hat, how it came into the state in which you see it. Gentlemen,' said Brass, striking the hat fiercely with his clenched hand, 'to all these questions I answer--Quilp!' ...|$|R
5000|$|McAlpine {{said that}} her {{emotional}} scenes with Hawley (John Stape) were very draining and very hard work. She told The Mirror: [...] "It's been very draining. Not emotionally, because I never take my work home with me, but genuinely physically exhausting. It's tiring having to cry continuously and I {{take a long time}} to recover <b>from</b> that. <b>My</b> <b>face</b> goes all red and my eyes sting for ages afterwards. I'm not a good crier!". She added: [...] "I've always been a huge Corrie fan. Being a Northern girl it was always on in my living room. And even today, I love sitting down and catching up with what's going on. This is my dream job." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{happened}} that {{in less than}} a week Marie died. <b>From</b> <b>my</b> bed, which <b>faced</b> the window, I saw the little funeral procession leave the castle--my father and Count Hirsfeld the chief mourners. I saw Martin following away off, with sorrowing face, and I was glad then that I had not deceived him. I saw him weeping over the grave which he believed to be mine. The day afterwards my son was born.|$|R
