5000|$|Practically {{all modern}} {{receivers}} {{are of the}} superheterodyne design. The RF signal from the antenna may have one stage of amplification to improve the receiver's noise figure, although at lower frequencies this is typically omitted. The RF signal enters a mixer, along with {{the output of the}} local oscillator, in order to produce a so-called intermediate frequency (IF) signal. An early optimization of the superheterodyne was to combine the local oscillator and mixer into a single stage called [...] "converter". The local oscillator is tuned to a frequency somewhat higher (or lower) than the intended reception frequency so that the IF signal will be at a particular frequency where it is further amplified in a narrow-band multistage amplifier. Tuning the receiver involves changing the frequency of the local oscillator, with further processing of the signal (especially in relation to increasing the receiver) conveniently done at a single frequency (the IF frequency) thus requiring no further tuning for different stations.Here we show block diagrams for typical superheterodyne receivers for AM and FM broadcast respectively. This particular FM design uses a modern phase locked loop detector, unlike the <b>frequency</b> <b>discriminator</b> or ratio detector used in earlier FM receivers.|$|E

In order to tracking weak GNSS signal, what an efficient approach is increasing coherent time. However, increasing coherent time brings several problems.

This paper proposed an improved tracking architecture based on moving average method, a complex loop filter for the architecture is not considered, but the moving average method before <b>frequency</b> <b>discriminator</b> for a frequency lock loop is introduced. Compared with typical tracking loop, the coherent time is different from loop update interval in the method. Increasing the coherent time reduces the output error of <b>frequency</b> <b>discriminator,</b> and the loop noise bandwidth is increased in shorter loop update interval. Hence, use of such type of scheme provides higher dynamics for weak signal tracking. The simulation results are shown to verify the performance of the methods...|$|E
