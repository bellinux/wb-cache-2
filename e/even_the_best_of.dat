25|$|The {{following}} season – {{one with}} hardly {{a day of}} rain in the Home Counties after early May – bore out almost all that was thought of Knox. When sound, he was clearly the fastest bowler seen {{for a long time}} in county cricket and, even on much truer Oval pitches, he was able to make the ball rise dangerously. He could also spin the ball back from the off as much as Richardson at his best. Early in the season, Knox’s bowling was beyond everything else the factor behind Surrey rising to the top of the table, and at times – notably against Leicestershire and Sussex at the Oval – his pace could bowl sides out cheaply on <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> pitches. However, from the middle of June, the strain of bowling on such hard, sun-soaked pitches took its toll and Knox suffered constantly from shin strains. These strains kept him out of nine of Surrey’s last sixteen matches and according to Wisden, Knox “often played when he should have been resting.” Nonetheless, his twelve wickets for 174 against the Players at Lord's in July is still remembered as perhaps the fastest bowling ever seen in the history of Gentlemen v Players games: some of the professional batsmen were literally intimidated. Knox was rewarded for this and his superb early season form with nomination as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden.|$|E

Noting {{that there is a}} {{difference}} between [...] "rock critics" [...] and the [...] "rock press", he lists the [...] "establishment" [...] members as himself, Jon Landau, Dave Marsh, Paul Nelson, and John Rockwell. Christgau also concedes that [...] "Because we are all self-taught (of necessity, since our academy is as yet informal), <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> our work has the faults of autodidacticism: eccentricity, incompleteness, self-indulgence.

2500|$|Mining in the Philippines began around 1000 BC. The early Filipinos worked various mines of gold, silver, {{copper and}} iron. Jewels, gold ingots, chains, calombigas and {{earrings}} were {{handed down from}} antiquity and inherited from their ancestors. Gold dagger handles, gold dishes, tooth plating, and huge gold ornamets were also used. In Laszlo Legeza's [...] "Tantric elements in pre-Hispanic Philippines Gold Art", he mentioned that gold jewelry of Philippine origin was found in Ancient Egypt.

2500|$|Furthermore, Milton {{makes his}} views on idolatry more {{explicit}} {{with the creation of}} Pandæmonium and the exemplary allusion to Solomon's temple. In the beginning of Paradise Lost, as well as throughout the poem, there are several references to the rise and eventual fall of Solomon's temple. Critics elucidate that [...] "Solomon's temple provides an explicit demonstration of how an artefact moves from its genesis in devotional practice to an idolatrous end." [...] This example, out of the many presented, conveys Milton's views on the dangers of idolatry distinctly. Even if one builds a structure in the name of God, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> intentions can become immoral. In addition, critics have drawn parallels between both Pandemonium and Saint Peter's Basilica, and the Pantheon. The majority of these similarities revolve around a structural likeness, but as Lyle explains, they play a greater role. By linking Saint Peter's Basilica and the Pantheon to Pandemonium—an ideally false structure, the two famous buildings take on a false meaning. This comparison best represents Milton's Protestant views, as it rejects both the purely Catholic perspective and the Pagan perspective.|$|E

2500|$|France's {{political}} troubles interfered for a {{time with}} his career. In the events of 1814–1815 he took the royalist side. He adopted {{the views of the}} party known as doctrinaire, of which Royer-Collard was the philosophical leader. He seems to have gone further, and to have approached the extreme Left. Then came a reaction against liberalism, and in 1821–1822 Cousin was deprived of his offices in the faculty of letters and in the Normal School. The Normal School was swept away, and Cousin shared the fate of Guizot, who was ejected from the chair of history. This enforced abandonment of public teaching was a mixed blessing: he set out for Germany with a view to further philosophical study. While at Berlin in 1824–1825 he was thrown into prison, either on some ill-defined political charge at the instance of the French police, or {{as a result of an}} indiscreet conversation. Freed after six months, he remained under the suspicion of the French government for three years. [...] It was during this period that he developed what is distinctive in his philosophical doctrine. His eclecticism, his ontology and his philosophy of history were declared in principle and in most of their salient details in the Fragments philosophiques (Paris, 1826). The preface to the second edition (1833) and the third (1838) aimed at a vindication of his principles against contemporary criticism. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> his later books, the Philosophie écossaise, the Du vrai, du beau, et du bien, and the Philosophie de Locke, were simply matured revisions of his lectures during the period from 1815 to 1820.
