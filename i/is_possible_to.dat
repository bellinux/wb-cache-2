5|$|By {{fine-tuning}} {{the surface}} roughness, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> achieve a transition between both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions. Generally, the rougher the surface, the more hydrophobic it is.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Graham Cormode {{proved that}} {{deciding}} whether it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> complete {{a level of}} Lemmings is NP-hard. Later, Giovanni Viglietta showed that the task is PSPACE-complete, even for levels where {{there is only one}} lemming to save.|$|E
40|$|We {{point out}} that with {{improving}} our present knowledge of experimental neutrino physics it will <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> locate nuclear powered vehicles like submarines, aircraft carriers and UFOs and detect nuclear testing. Since neutrinos cannot be shielded, it will not <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> escape these detection. In these detectors it will also <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> perform neutrino oscillation experiments during any nuclear testing...|$|R
50|$|Given an {{arbitrary}} window in a spatial file manager, it must <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> determine with complete certainty which folder that window represents. Furthermore, {{it must not}} <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> change that association.|$|R
50|$|In theory {{smartphones}} have {{an advantage}} over hard drives since the OS files are in ROM, and cannot be changed by malware. However, in some systems it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> circumvent this: in the Symbian OS it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> overwrite a file with a file of the same name. On the Windows OS, it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> change a pointer from a general configuration file to an editable file.|$|R

5|$|In this respect, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> analyse Wagiman's vowel {{inventory}} as historically {{deriving from}} a three-vowel system common among the languages from further south, {{but with the}} phonetic influence of a typically northern five-vowel system.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} the m-derivation process repeatedly and produce mm'm-types and so on. However, the improvements obtained diminish at each iteration {{and are not}} usually worth the increase in complexity.|$|E
50|$|The Sky Gnome was {{compatible}} with the Sky and Sky+ Digiboxes. When used in a non-Sky satellite receiver, it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{listen to the radio}} channels, it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> change the channels of the receiver from the Sky Gnome.|$|R
50|$|If {{starting}} from a terminal window, as of version 1.3.6 it has <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> actively control many features here. System settings, Bank lists, Program Changes {{and many others}} are already accessible. Eventually it will <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> edit the instrument patches themselves.|$|R
50|$|Although {{it would}} <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> infer {{procedure}} parameter and return types by examining where {{the procedure is}} called, S-algol does require parameter and return types to be specified. This is a practical decision, since it should <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> understand a procedure without examining its calls.|$|R
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{listen to}} {{recordings}} {{from the collection}} in selected Reading Rooms in the Library through their SoundServer and Listening and Viewing Service, {{which is based in}} the Rare Books & Music Reading Room.|$|E
5|$|Replacement {{which refers}} to the {{preferred}} use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> achieve the same scientific aims. These methods include computer modeling.|$|E

3000|$|... {{which can}} be {{expressed}} as the solution of an additional SDE, then it may <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> include a certain form of history-dependence. However, purely time-delayed systems do not enter {{the scope of this}} theory, although it might <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> derive an analogous averaging method in this framework.|$|R
5|$|According to Plateau's laws, the {{circular}} arcs in two-dimensional soap bubble clusters meet at 120° angles, the same angle {{found at the}} corners of a Reuleaux triangle. Based on this fact, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> construct clusters in which some of the bubbles {{take the form of a}} Reuleaux triangle.|$|E
5|$|From this solution, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{characterize}} the convective heat/mass transfer constants {{based on the}} region of boundary layer flow. Fourier’s law of conduction and Newton’s Law of Cooling are combined with the flux term derived above and the boundary layer thickness.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Creek {{was used}} as a water supply as early as the {{beginning}} of the 1900s. A number of bridges have been constructed over the creek since the 1920s, and it has been dammed by the Bryant Pond Dam. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> canoe on part of the creek. Rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale occur in the watershed.|$|E
50|$|When {{asked if}} a game such as Castlevania <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> remake using the Retro Engine, Whitehead stated that {{multiple}} genres of video games would <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> create with it.

5000|$|For {{taxation}} reasons, it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> deduct [...] "fantasy" [...] outfits in {{the declaration}} of income. The reasoning behind the phrasing was that it shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> wear the same outfit in your daily life. This led to many bands wearing highly extravagant matched outfits in their stage performances.|$|R
5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism {{to conclude that}} the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the lower}} parts it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{cultivate}} products that include barley, wheat, black peas, beans, mustard, hemp, potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, onions, garlic, celery and tomatoes. The traditional staple food is barley flour called tsampa, often combined with buttered tea and {{made into a}} paste.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{achieve an}} {{extremely}} high Q with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators typically have a Q of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 {{can be achieved}} in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose Q {{is limited by the}} resistance of the inductor coils.|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{extend the}} {{definition}} of the flow to more general inputs than curves, for instance by using rectifiable varifolds or the level set method. However, these extended definitions may allow parts of curves to vanish instantaneously or fatten into sets of nonzero area.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{interpret}} the Sylvester sequence {{as the result}} of a greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions, that at each step chooses the smallest possible denominator that makes the partial sum of the series be less than one. Alternatively, the terms of the sequence after the first can be viewed as the denominators of the odd greedy expansion of 1/2.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>{{possible}}</b> <b>to</b> paddle on much of Catawissa Creek {{for parts}} of the year. However, it is not usually possible to paddle on the creek during the summer.
