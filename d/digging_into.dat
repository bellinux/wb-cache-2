5|$|The series {{depicts the}} adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life {{as a high school}} student while {{moonlighting}} as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica finds her mother's old high school records and starts <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> her mother's past, discovering information about the Kane family in the process. Meanwhile, Beaver (Kyle Gallner) proposes a business plan to help Kendall (Charisma Carpenter).|$|E
5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass {{down through the}} entire magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|E

5|$|Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, {{emphasizing}} platforming and gameplay. Their homing attack can lock onto robots {{created by}} Eggman and G.U.N., {{and they can}} grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's levels are slower and oriented towards multi-directional shooting; they are confined to mechs {{in which they can}} jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's levels are open and feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. Their search is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> them to find power-ups.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s {{to protect themselves from}} head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|E

25|$|The {{robotic arm}} was a {{critical}} part of the Phoenix Mars mission. On May 28, scientists leading the mission sent commands to unstow its robotic arm and take more images of its landing site. The images revealed that the spacecraft landed where it had access to digging down a polygon across the trough and <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> its center.|$|E
25|$|Pyramid anchors are pyramid-shaped anchors, {{also known}} as Dor-Mor anchors. They work in the {{upside-down}} position with the apex pointing {{down at the bottom}} such that when they are deployed, the weight of wider base pushes the pyramid down <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> the floor. As the anchors are encountered with lateral pulls, the side edges or corners of the pyramids will dig deeper under the floor, making them more stable.|$|E

25|$|With most {{communications}} cut, German forces {{remaining in}} the pocket were now faced with either death or being taken prisoner. Some 'elite' units, such as the Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann Göring and the 24th Panzer Division, were evacuated by sea, but others were gradually cut off {{in a series of}} small pockets on the coast, in some cases actually <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> the coastal embankments or beaches. POW reports suggested that many German units were now seriously understrength, with the 50th Infantry Division, for example, able to field only a single incomplete regiment.|$|E
25|$|By 1852 he {{had removed}} all the loose doggers and had begun <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> {{the base of}} the cliffs. So {{profitable}} was this business that Holloway cut a channel between the harbour and the foot of the cliffs where he was mining, so {{that he was able to}} bring his ships closer and speed up the process. This channel is still visible today as are the ponds he built to provide water for his cart horses. Between 1856 and 1864, 52,650 tons of ironstone were removed and 13,000 tons in one year alone.|$|E
25|$|Bait tactics {{exploited}} the US focus on body counts and its lavish use of firepower, including relatively ineffective Harassment and Interdiction (H) fire. One related method was {{to occupy a}} hamlet or deploy near it, <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> positions at the treeline on {{the perimeter of the}} hamlet for attack or defense. ARVN or US forces would often counterattack by unleashing air and artillery strikes on the community, causing destruction to the persons and property of the civilians {{they were supposed to be}} protecting. The damage done, and protected by their dug-in positions, VC and PAVN fighters melted away at their earliest convenience, later repeating the cycle elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|As a pilot project, the Trillium Line {{system was}} {{built at the}} cost of $21 million, {{relatively}} little compared with {{the hundreds of millions of}} dollars usually required to build a new transit line. It runs on an existing Canadian Pacific Railway track (Ellwood and Prescott subdivisions,) so the only construction work necessary was to build the stations themselves and the passing tracks necessary to allow trains to operate in both directions. The downside to this, however, is that much ground pollution remains from the track’s previous use. This will become a liability one day when the city has to pay to clean it up, which it has thus far avoided by not <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> the ground under the tracks.|$|E
25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E
25|$|They {{depicted}} the Indians as living at a bare subsistence level, typically located in small rancherias of extended family groups of 100 to 150 people. They had no apparent agriculture, no domesticated animals except dogs, no pottery, and their only tools were {{made out of}} wood, leather, woven baskets and netting, stones and horns. Shelters were made of branches and mud; some dwellings were built by <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> the ground two to three feet and then building a brush shelter on top covered with animal skins, tules and/or mud. Their clothing was minimal in the summer, with animal skins and coarse woven articles of grass clothing used in winter. Some tribes around Santa Barbara, California and the Channel Islands (California) were using large plank canoes to fish and trade, while tribes in the California delta and San Francisco Bay Area were using tule canoes and some tribes on the Northwest coast were using wooden dugout canoes.|$|E

25|$|Lancashire Lightning {{recorded}} the most emphatic victory by {{runs in the}} 2005 Twenty20 season, as they had fun with the Yorkshire Phoenix bowlers. After being put in to bat, Mal Loye and Stuart Law put on 106 for the first wicket, and when Loye departed for 47 Brad Hodge followed up with a 17-ball 33, a partnership of 77 with Law. Despite Ian Harvey <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> them with two wickets, the early run-rate ensured that Lancashire set a target of 208, Law recording the second Twenty20 century this season - in 56 balls. Ian Harvey, {{the man responsible for}} the first of those centuries, was out early for 1, and wickets fell to everyone as Yorkshire were out for 97 - Dominic Cork taking three for 10, Muttiah Muralitharan three for 17, and James Anderson two for 26. Matthew Hoggard and Tim Bresnan {{recorded the}} highest partnership for Yorkshire, with 22 for the tenth wicket.|$|E
25|$|Graves in {{the central}} section of the {{cemetery}} were sporadically discovered between 1839 and 1964, as a road was built and enlarged {{through the middle of}} it. The likely first discovery of skeletons at the site was in 1839, when the Sevenoaks Turnpike Road was diverted, which would have entailed digging at the site; no burials were recorded, although an oral tradition of skeletons and weapons being discovered survived through to the 1930s, when it was recorded by Gordon Ward. In June 1956 the A26 underwent roadworks, resulting in the discovery of 13 further graves. In 1956 and 1958, the Otford Historical Society began an excavation nearby, in the hope of discovering more of the cemetery, but they missed the burial area, discovering nothing. In August 1959, another road improvement revealed 3 further graves {{on the west side of}} the bank, while in November 1959 and January 1960, schoolboys <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> the chalk uncovered two more. A further grave was discovered around 1963 by workmen building a small reservoir; this burial was not recorded.|$|E
25|$|Chaz Mostert {{took his}} first V8 Supercar pole {{position}} when he qualified fastest for the first race of the Ubet Perth Super Sprint. His teammate Mark Winterbottom qualified second {{and went on to}} score pole position for the second race. Winterbottom made a better start than Mostert in the first race and the pair went on to finish first and second, while Craig Lowndes finished in third. Jamie Whincup, after qualifying in 21st place, managed to finish in 15th place but lost the championship lead to Lowndes. Winterbottom won the second race ahead of Whincup and Fabian Coulthard. With Lowndes finishing fifth, Winterbottom took the championship lead. Mostert took his second pole in qualifying for the Sunday race. The session saw Lee Holdsworth make a mistake at turn six and his car rolled onto its side after <b>digging</b> <b>into</b> the sand trap. Despite starting off the front row, Mostert and Winterbottom finished fourth and 15th respectively after their tyre strategy was ruined by a safety car on lap 48. Will Davison won the race, taking Erebus Motorsport's second ever victory, after passing Lowndes for the lead with five laps remaining. Coulthard finished third despite starting 24th. With Winterbottom finishing down the order, Lowndes left the event with the championship lead.|$|E
