5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved <b>digital</b> <b>connectivity,</b> the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Algorithms for {{computing}} contour {{trees for}} visualization commonly as-sume that the input {{is defined by}} barycentric interpolation on simplicial meshes or by trilinear interpolation on cubic meshes. In this paper, we describe a general framework for computing contour trees from a graph that captures all significant topological features. We show how to construct these graphs from any mesh-based interpolant by using cell-by-cell “widgets, ” and also how to avoid constructing the entire graphs by making finite state machines that capture their traversals. Our framework eases algorithm development and implementation, {{and can be used}} to establish relationships between interpolants. For example, we use it to demonstrate a formal equivalence between the topology defined by implicitly dis-ambiguated marching cubes cases and the topology induced by 8 -/ 18 - <b>digital</b> image <b>connectivity.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With the {{technological}} revolution in <b>digital</b> communications and <b>connectivity</b> {{over the past}} two decades, the healthcare sector is {{at the beginning of a}} dramatic overhaul. These technologies have already made their way into our everyday lives and thus changing the way we do things. The healthcare industry with its resistance to change has started considering, evaluating, and embracing the way connectivity can change medical treatment and personal health. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in medical device connectivity with a focus on wireless solutions. Throughout the paper, the discussion primarily applies to the United States and it separately studies its three major care delivery settings: clinical, office, and home. Based on the challenges and requirements that each of these settings present, we discuss the key aspects needed for medical device connectivity to succeed from both a technological and financial perspective. Cellular connectivity can satisfy many of these key aspects. Therefore, we have proposed and operated a testbed for cellular-enabled upload into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, which we present here and outline its implementation in detail. The paper concludes with a longer term outlook on the adoption of <b>digital</b> communications and <b>connectivity</b> in the healthcare sector.
