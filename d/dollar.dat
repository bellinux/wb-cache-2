5|$|In 1969, Nixon {{administration}} Mint Director Mary Brooks {{sought the}} reissuance of the <b>dollar</b> coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the {{continued use of}} silver in the Kennedy half <b>dollar,</b> but Brooks hoped to maintain the <b>dollar</b> as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver <b>dollar</b> was opposed by {{the chairman of the}} House Banking Committee, Wright Patman, who had been convinced by Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, to support the continued use of silver in the half <b>dollar</b> against his better judgment.|$|E
5|$|None of the Peace <b>dollar</b> mintages are {{particularly}} rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for most years for {{little more than}} the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace <b>dollar,</b> minted only at the Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low-mintage 1928-P Peace <b>dollar.</b> The prices for the 1928-P <b>dollar</b> are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced that limited quantities would be produced and many were saved. In contrast the 1934-S <b>dollar</b> was not saved in great numbers so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but mid-grade uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.|$|E

5|$|The coin, {{known as}} the Eisenhower <b>dollar,</b> proved unpopular with the public, and {{very few of the}} coins were found in circulation. In 1976, the Research Triangle Institute {{conducted}} a survey of United States coinage. Among other things, they recommended the half <b>dollar,</b> which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, {{and the size of the}} <b>dollar</b> be reduced. Their report read in part: A conveniently-sized <b>dollar</b> coin would significantly broaden the capabilities of consumers for cash transactions, especially with machines. Members of the automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong interest in a smaller <b>dollar,</b> indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use. Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a Republican, was chosen as a means of balancing the half <b>dollar,</b> depicting Democrat John F. Kennedy. In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half <b>dollar</b> production ceased entirely, and the <b>dollar</b> replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design. Treasury officials desired the small <b>dollar</b> coin as a cost-saving measure; Mint Director Stella Hackel estimated that replacing half of the issued <b>dollar</b> bills with small dollars would save $19 million ($ today) in annual production costs.|$|E
