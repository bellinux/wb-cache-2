40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} the effect of effluents, <b>excess</b> <b>temperature</b> above the ambient of the power plants and flow regime on the mixing zone characteristics. To achieve these aims an undistorted thermal physical model was constructed. The model is a fixed bed with an undistorted scale of 1 : 50. It represents 2. 5  km of EL-Rayah EL-Behery at {{the vicinity of the}} North Giza Power Plant, Egypt. It simulates the thermal plume produced from the plant. The results showed that the mixing zone depends on the flow regime, the effluent discharge and the <b>excess</b> <b>temperature</b> above the ambient at the outfall. The results showed that, the mixing zone area increases with increasing the effluents and decreases with increasing the flow in the river. It was found that in case of increasing the <b>excess</b> <b>temperature</b> above the ambient at the outfall and decreasing the effluent discharge, the mixing zone area was increased. It means that the <b>excess</b> <b>temperature</b> at the outfall has more influence on the mixing zone.

30|$|Hot {{ascending}} plumes become, however, less prominent as Mp increases: At Mp=[*] 2, the {{convective flow}} induced by hot plumes {{is still an}} important element of the convection in the mantle. The <b>excess</b> <b>temperature</b> of the heads of hot plumes with respect to the surrounding mantle is, however, smaller than that calculated at Mp=[*] 1 shown in Fig.  1 a. At Mp=[*] 4 and 6, the <b>excess</b> <b>temperature</b> of hot plume heads becomes even smaller. Hot plumes become faint except around the core–mantle boundary, and the heads are often detached from the stems of hot plumes before they ascend {{to the base of the}} top TBL. The <b>excess</b> <b>temperature</b> of hot plumes rapidly decreases as they ascend, while cold descending plumes are prominent at all depths. At Mp=[*] 9.4, hot plumes become almost invisible, while cold descending plumes are still conspicuous. The effects of adiabatic compression on temperature contrast between plumes and the surrounding mantle are more conspicuous for hot plumes than for cold plumes, because the effect is proportional to the temperature (Eq.  4).|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{discharges}} such as {{from power}} stations or industries into rivers causing degradation of water quality. A {{study was conducted}} in the laboratory to investigate the changes of the ambient temperature caused by thermal effluent discharged into the flow. A cross–flow thermal effluent is discharged from the bed of the channel. Thermal effluent flow rates of 0. 133 liter/s and 0. 05 liter/s and ambient flow rates of 20 liter/s and 10 liter/s were used in the study. Observation of thermal mixing process in the channel is concentrated in the near-field zone. The thermal dispersion patterns were observed along the channel through the isothermal lines; while the changes of ambient temperature are studied from the experimental data. The results indicate that the temperature changes are drastic in the near-field mixing zone. Then it gradually reduces along the channel until reaches the far-field mixing zone. Lower layer of the flow experiences high <b>excess</b> <b>temperature</b> compared to middle and upper layers of the flow. Meanwhile, larger effluent flow rate produces higher <b>excess</b> <b>temperature</b> in the receiving water body than small effluent flow rate.
