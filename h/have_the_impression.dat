25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E
500|$|García Márquez {{received}} the Nobel Prize in Literature on 8 December 1982 [...] "for his novels and short stories, {{in which the}} fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination, reflecting a continent's life and conflicts". [...] His acceptance speech was entitled [...] "The Solitude of Latin America". García Márquez was the first Colombian and fourth Latin American to win a Nobel Prize for Literature. After becoming a Nobel laureate, García Márquez stated to a correspondent: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that in giving me the prize, they have taken into account {{the literature of the}} sub-continent and have awarded me as a way of awarding all of this literature".|$|E

2500|$|The New York Times {{noted that}} Hong Kong has had many controversies over whether {{developers}} have overstated the square footage of apartments {{and the value}} per square foot of property transactions, for example, how to count terraces, common areas and other features. An editorial in Ming Pao said: [...] "Though developers have used controversial marketing gimmicks, the government has rarely exercised its powers to protect consumers. Citizens disapprove of developers. Many are convinced that some government policies are excessively favourable to them. That is why the generality of citizens <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the government colludes with businesses." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Italian foreign {{minister}} Massimo D'Alema said [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the (Israeli) reaction {{is out of}} proportion and dangerous for the consequences it could have, I think that this, apart from some nuances, {{is the way the}} whole international community sees the situation." [...] He then added, [...] "We are working for moves by the EU and the G8 in the next few hours to stop the spiral of violence," [...] making reference to the G8 meeting planned for the weekend in St. Petersburg. He also condemned Hezbollah's assault on Israeli soldiers as [...] "unacceptable," [...] adding that Rome had asked for the release of the soldiers being held hostage.|$|E
2500|$|Nantes {{has been}} {{described}} as the birthplace of surrealism, since André Breton (leader of the movement) met Jacques Vaché there in 1916. In Nadja (1928), André Breton called Nantes [...] "perhaps with Paris the only city in France where I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that something worthwhile may happen to me". Fellow surrealist Julien Gracq wrote The Shape of a City, published in 1985, about the city. Nantes also inspired Stendhal (in his 1838 Mémoires d'un touriste); Gustave Flaubert (in his 1881 Par les champs et par les grèves, where he describes his journey through Brittany); Henry James, in his 1884 A Little Tour in France; André Pieyre de Mandiargues in Le Musée noir (1946), and Paul-Louis Rossi in Nantes (1987).|$|E

2500|$|After the vote, Archbishop Paul-André Durocher {{wrote on}} his blog that [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> many would have {{preferred}} a more open, positive language. Not finding it in this paragraph, they might have chosen to indicate their disapproval of it." [...] Cardinal Vincent Nichols {{said he did not}} think it a good paragraph, because the absence of the key words [...] "respect", [...] "welcome", and [...] "value" [...] meant it did not go far enough. He gave assurance that there was no question in the synod of endorsing the idea of same-sex marriage or of changing the Church's teaching on sexual morality. Other bishops were happy at the removal of language ("welcome", [...] "positive elements") in the interim report that [...] "could be read as code-words for the Catholic Church going soft on its moral teaching." ...|$|E
2500|$|To an extent, {{the above}} danger {{may have been}} overstated by Venizelos as a {{negotiating}} card on the table of Sèvres, {{in order to gain}} the support of the Allied governments. For example, the Young Turks were not in power {{at the time of the}} war, which makes such a justification less straightforward. Most of the leaders of that regime had fled the country at the end of World War I and the Ottoman government in Constantinople was already under British control. Furthermore, Venizelos had already revealed his desires for annexation of territories from the Ottoman Empire in the early stages of World War I, before these massacres had taken place. In a letter sent to Greek King Constantine in January 1915, he wrote that: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the concessions to Greece in Asia Minor... would be so extensive that another equally large and not less rich Greece will be added to the doubled Greece which emerged from the victorious Balkan wars." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{coming to}} his {{decision}} in the present case, Menon highlighted the principle upon which apparent bias stands {{as a ground for}} judicial review, separate from that of actual bias. Since justice is rooted in public confidence, it is imperative that [...] "right-minded people" [...] not hold the impression that [...] "the judge was biased". The appearance of impartiality is as important as actual impartiality, because there is public interest in ensuring that justice is seen to be done. The reasonable suspicion test upholds this principle as it [...] "safeguards not only the fact but also the appearance of justice being done". Thus he held this to be the more appropriate test because the inquiry is focused on whether a reasonable member of the public would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the public authority acted with bias, regardless of whether the court thought it likely or possible. On the other hand, the adoption of the real likelihood test would shift the focus of the inquiry {{from the perspective of a}} reasonable person to that of a judge who is no longer concerned strictly with the appearance of bias but rather with establishing whether there is in fact a sufficient possibility of bias.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 July, Nicholas sent {{a message}} to Wilhelm informing him that he had ordered partial {{mobilization}} against Austria, and asking him to do his utmost for a peaceful solution. Upon hearing of Russia's partial mobilization, Wilhelm wrote: [...] "Then I must mobilize too." [...] The German Ambassador in St. Petersburg informed Nicholas that Germany would mobilize if Russia did not cease all military preparations at once, including those it had previously assured Russia it did not see as a threat against Germany or cause for German mobilization. The German military attaché in Russia reported that: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that they the Russians have mobilized here from a dread of coming events without aggressive intentions and are now frightened at what they have brought about." [...] At the same time, Nicholas’ order for a partial mobilization met with protests from both Sazonov and the Russian War Minister General Vladimir Sukhomlinov, who insisted partial mobilization was not technically possible, and that, given Germany's attitude, a general mobilization was required. Nicholas at first ordered a general mobilization, and then after receiving an appeal for peace from Wilhelm cancelled it as a sign of his good faith. The cancellation of general mobilization led to furious protests from Sukhomlinov, Sazonov, and Russia's top generals, all urging Nicholas to reinstate it. Under strong pressure, Nicholas gave in and ordered a general mobilization on 30 July.|$|E
2500|$|Project {{costs were}} between US$1.2 and $1.3 million, necessitating ABC's {{financial}} support (and with it, their demand of a safety harness). [...] "I'd dare say that {{never in the}} history of the circus industry has there been one event that costs this much," [...] said Wallenda. [...] The production was a serious financial strain on Wallenda. [...] "It's been a tough situation all around", he said a week before the event, blaming the lingering fight over the safety harness for inhibiting sponsorship deals. [...] When production costs ran over the original estimate of $1 million, he appealed to the public for help using the fundraising website Indiegogo. [...] He eventually met his goal of $50,000. [...] Additionally, Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati asked local businesses to chip in, saying he hoped to raise $250,000. [...] Ultimately, he helped generate about $200,000 of support from local business associations. [...] The main causes of the overrun were the need to produce two custom cables – one for the performance and a shorter one for practice – and the need to hire a new helicopter company to set up the cable at the last minute, after the original one discovered they did not hold the necessary licenses. [...] After the event, Wallenda said he had probably lost money on the event; however, he added, it was [...] "clearly worth it" [...] in the long term. [...] With all but one bill accounted for, Wallenda said he lost less than $50,000 on the event. [...] The fundraising, combined with several contractors lowering their bills, helped him get close to budget. [...] "I think people still <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that Nik Wallenda is going to walk away from this thing making millions of dollars, but that's not the case," [...] he commented.|$|E

6000|$|THE WORK OF KEATS. [...] "None but {{the master}} shall praise us; and none but the master shall blame" [...] {{might well be}} written on the fly leaf of every volume of Keats's poetry; for never was there a poet more devoted to his ideal, entirely {{independent}} of success or failure. In strong contrast with his contemporary, Byron, who professed to despise the art that made him famous, Keats lived for poetry alone, and, as Lowell pointed out, a virtue went out of him into everything he wrote. In all his work we <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of this intense loyalty to his art; we <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> also of a profound dissatisfaction that the deed falls so {{far short of the}} splendid dream.
