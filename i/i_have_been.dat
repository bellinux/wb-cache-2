5|$|Apocalyptic rainstorms, which devastated much of Egypt, {{and were}} {{described}} on the Tempest Stele of Ahmose <b>I,</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attributed to short-term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption. The difficulty with this interpretation {{is that in the}} conventional but disputed Egyptian chronology Ahmose I ruled from c. 1539–1514 BCE, whilst the eruption is thought to have occurred somewhere between 1642–1540 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Further aspectual distinctions are encoded {{by the use}} of {{auxiliary}} verbs, primarily {{have and}} be, which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (I have run vs. I was running), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (I had been running) and present perfect (<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> running).|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{bereaved}} of {{the best}} friend of my life, of one who, if {{it has been so}} ordained, would willingly have shared not only my poverty but also my death. During her life she was the faithful helper of my ministry. From her I never experienced the slightest hindrance.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not until}} we were shut up in our cabin-room and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had time to take breath that I began to think why <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made such haste. In one of the sunburnt faces <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{recognized}} Mr. Allan Woodcourt, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> afraid of his recognizing me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unwilling that he should see my altered looks. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken by surprise, and my courage had quite failed me.|$|R

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{thinking}} how very gently I {{have always been}} dealt with. I {{have never had a}} violent shove all my life. The only desire which I can have is like David to serve my own generation by the will of God, and then fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|I {{should not}} be {{surprised}} if this were to terminate in my death. I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{increasingly}} perturbed {{over the}} blatant {{disparity between the}} major role which Negro women have played and are playing in the crucial grassroots levels of our struggle and the minor role of leadership they have been assigned in the national policy-making decisions. It is indefensible to call a national march on Washington and send out a call which contains the name of not a single woman leader.|$|E
60|$|On first {{entering}} the Typee valley, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> struck with the marked contrast presented by its inhabitants {{with those of}} the bay <b>I</b> <b>had</b> previously left. In the latter place, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> favourably impressed with the personal appearance of the male portion of the population; although with the females, excepting in some truly melancholy instances, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wonderfully pleased.|$|R

6000|$|... 75. This scripture made me {{faint and}} fear, yet it kindled fire in my soul. That {{which made me}} fear, was this; lest Christ should have no liking to me, for He called whom He would. But oh! the glory that I saw in that condition, did still so engage my heart, that I could seldom read of any that Christ did call, but I {{presently}} wished, Would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in their clothes, would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> born Peter; would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> born John; or, would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> by and <b>had</b> heard Him when He called them, how would <b>I</b> <b>have</b> cried, O Lord, call me also! But, oh! I feared He would not call me.|$|R
5|$|Never advertised, {{and practiced}} {{by only one}} {{individual}} who healed me, Dr. Quimby of Portland, ME., an old gentleman who had made it a research for twenty-five years, starting {{from the standpoint of}} magnetism thence going forward and leaving that behind. I discovered the art in a moment's time, and he acknowledged it to me; he died shortly after and since then, eight years, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> founding and demonstrating the science.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} I {{have found that}} it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> associated with him in this manner, and though I know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E
50|$|It becomes {{harder and}} the enthusiasm wanes. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{training}} {{for so many}} years and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had my best years. <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> ridden a few more but I decided that was it. I wasn't going to improve and I was no longer as good as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been.</b>|$|R
60|$|I said I was {{perishing}} for a word {{of advice}} or an accent of comfort. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> living for some weeks quite alone; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> ill; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a pressure of affliction on my mind of which it would hardly any longer endure the weight.|$|R
60|$|John. <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> ventured {{their fire}} if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> there.

5|$|Sources {{describing}} Fuller's movements {{after her}} time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but {{found it difficult to}} realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{called in}} too late. Very often another, working towards the same goal, has arrived there first. Twice <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> struck down with illness just as I {{was on the}} point of success.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the past}} six months, {{as chair of the}} Co-operative Commission, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> hearing {{evidence}} from organisations and individuals {{with a wide range of}} views on the direction that the movement should take.

25|$|Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha {{extended}} his congratulations to Trump saying: We {{have to adjust}} to change. Things keep changing. I have not been indifferent to change. Instead, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> keeping abreast of it.|$|E

6000|$|All these, {{you will}} easily suppose, {{must be so}} many stabs into the very soul of one in my own case. It {{immediately}} occurred to me, [...] "Poor Amy! what art thou that I am not?

[...] Then it came to my remembrance that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not only <b>been</b> the same with Amy, but that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the devil's instrument to make her wicked; that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> stripped her, and prostituted her to the very man that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> naught with myself; that she had but followed me, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> her wicked example; and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> led her into all; and that, as we had sinned together, now we were likely to sink together.|$|R
