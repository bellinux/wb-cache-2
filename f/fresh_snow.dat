25|$|Until {{well into}} the 20th century {{and the advent of}} {{mechanized}} trail grooming, cross-country tracks were always made by the first skiers to pass through undisturbed, <b>fresh</b> <b>snow</b> and leave a parallel set of ski tracks behind them. Certain local and regional trails are available where the passage of skiers is the sole source of tracks.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} small walls to climb, {{but they may}} all be outflanked {{on the right side}} if the {{conditions}} are good. From the Western summit the flank seems nearly as forbidding as the wall itself, but at a close distance it is not too difficult and no equipment should be necessary. However, on poor conditions, the Talus may be very loose and great caution is advised. On days with <b>fresh</b> <b>snow,</b> like the last picture, equipment will probably be necessary on all routes.|$|E

25|$|The {{atmosphere}} is severely dry {{nine months of}} the year, and average annual snowfall is only , due to the rain shadow effect. Western passes receive small amounts of <b>fresh</b> <b>snow</b> each year but remain traversible all year round. Low temperatures are prevalent throughout these western regions, where bleak desolation is unrelieved by any vegetation bigger than a low bush, and where wind sweeps unchecked across vast expanses of arid plain. The Indian monsoon exerts some influence on eastern Tibet. Northern Tibet is subject to high temperatures {{in the summer and}} intense cold in the winter.|$|E
25|$|Any albedo {{in visible}} light falls within a range of about 0.9 for <b>fresh</b> <b>snow</b> to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed {{cavities}} can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas {{have some of the}} highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. The average albedo of Earth is about 0.3. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.|$|E
500|$|Cores show visible layers, which {{correspond}} to annual snowfall {{at the core}} site. [...] If a pair of pits is dug in <b>fresh</b> <b>snow</b> with a thin wall between them {{and one of the}} pits is roofed over, an observer in the roofed pit will see the layers revealed by sunlight shining through. [...] A six-foot pit may show anything from less than a year of snow to several years of snow, depending on the location. [...] Poles left in the snow from year to year show the amount of accumulated snow each year, and this can be used to verify that the visible layer in a snow pit corresponds to a single year's snowfall.|$|E

500|$|Iapetus is {{the third-largest}} of Saturn's moons. Orbiting the planet at [...] km, {{it is by}} far the most distant of Saturn's large moons, and also has the largest orbital inclination, at 15.47°. Iapetus has long been known for its unusual two-toned surface; its leading {{hemisphere}} is pitch-black and its trailing hemisphere is almost as bright as <b>fresh</b> <b>snow.</b> Cassini images showed that the dark material is confined to a large near-equatorial area on the leading hemisphere called Cassini Regio, which extends approximately from 40°N to 40°S. The pole regions of Iapetus are as bright as its trailing hemisphere. Cassini also discovered a 20km tall equatorial ridge, which spans nearly the moon's entire equator. Otherwise both dark and bright surfaces of Iapetus are old and heavily cratered. The images revealed at least four large impact basins with diameters from 380 to 550km and numerous smaller impact craters. No evidence of any endogenic activity has been discovered. A clue to the origin of the dark material covering part of Iapetus's starkly dichromatic surface may have been found in 2009, when NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope discovered a vast, nearly invisible disk around Saturn, just inside the orbit of the moon Phoebe—the Phoebe ring. Scientists believe that the disk originates from dust and ice particles kicked up by impacts on Phoebe. Because the disk particles, like Phoebe itself, orbit in the opposite direction to Iapetus, Iapetus collides with them as they drift in the direction of Saturn, darkening its leading hemisphere slightly. Once a difference in albedo, and hence in average temperature, was established between different regions of Iapetus, a thermal runaway process of water ice sublimation from warmer regions and deposition of water vapor onto colder regions ensued. Iapetus's present two-toned appearance results from the contrast between the bright, primarily ice-coated areas and regions of dark lag, the residue left behind after the loss of surface ice.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{cause of}} a glacier flowing," [...] said the Professor, [...] "has long been a disputed point. Some men of science have held {{that it is the}} {{pressure}} of ice and snow behind it which causes it to flow. They do not think that it flows like water, but say it is forced from behind, and crushed through gorges and down valleys, as it were, unwillingly. They say that, if left alone, as they now are, without additions, from this time forward, glaciers would no longer move; they would rest, and slowly melt away; that their motion {{is due to the fact}} that there are miles and miles of snow-fields, thousands of feet deep, on the mountain-tops and in the gorges, to which <b>fresh</b> <b>snows</b> are added every winter, so that the weight of what is behind, slipping off the slopes and falling from the cliffs, crushes down and forward that which is below; thus glaciers cannot choose but advance." ...|$|R

2500|$|Moore {{reported}} finding {{blood on}} a blanket and noted the [...] "sickly-sweet smell of death" [...] at the site. It seemed clear {{that there were no}} survivors. Sullivan noted that recovery of remains would be very difficult as the glacier was already covered by <b>fresh</b> <b>snow</b> eight feet deep. Near the remains of the aircraft, drifted snow was piled up to hundreds of feet. Apparently, the crash had also triggered avalanches that had further buried the remains. Because of the difficult conditions, the recovery effort was terminated after a week and the victims' families were told they would have no remains to bury. The debris was then covered by snow and ice, and was lost for the next 60 years.|$|E
2500|$|In September and October {{the days}} get rapidly shorter, and in {{northern}} areas the sun disappears {{from the sky}} entirely. [...] As the amount of solar radiation available to the surface rapidly decreases, the temperatures follow suit. [...] The sea ice begins to refreeze, and eventually gets a <b>fresh</b> <b>snow</b> cover, causing it to reflect even more of the dwindling amount of sunlight reaching it. [...] Likewise, the northern land areas receive their winter snow cover, which combined with the reduced solar radiation at the surface, ensures {{an end to the}} warm days those areas may experience in summer. [...] By November, winter is in full swing in most of the Arctic, and the small amount of solar radiation still reaching the region does not {{play a significant role in}} its climate.|$|E

Meanwhile, Bonatti and the others were in a stalled situation; they had not moved for the previous three days. Finally they decided to descend but only three climbers (Bonatti, Gallieni and Mazeaud) managed to return safely. The other four died of exhaustion or accident, while {{trying to find a way}} out through the <b>fresh</b> <b>snow.</b> Vieille died at the Rochers Gruber (a technical section of the climb) and Guillaume fell into a crevasse of the Freney Glacier.

2500|$|Dr. Constantine's {{examination}} reveals Ratchett {{was stabbed}} 12 times. Some wounds were slight, {{but at least}} three of them could have resulted in death. The stopped watch in the victim's pocket, as well as Poirot's reconstructed timeline of passenger activities the night before, indicate that Ratchett was murdered at about 1:15a.m. The train had stopped, surrounded by <b>fresh</b> <b>snow,</b> before then. There are no tracks in the snow and the doors to the other cars were locked, so the murderer is almost certainly still among the Calais passengers. Also discovered {{at the scene of the}} crime are a pipe-cleaner, a woman's handkerchief with the initial [...] "H" [...] and a fragment of a burned letter. Upon examining the letter, Poirot discovers that Ratchett's real name was Cassetti, a Mafia gangster who five years before carried out the kidnapping and killing of Daisy Armstrong, the infant daughter of wealthy British Army Colonel Hamish Armstrong who had settled in Long Island, New York with his American wife Sonia. Overcome with grief, the pregnant Mrs. Armstrong went into labour early and died while giving birth to a stillborn baby. A French maidservant named Paulette, wrongly suspected of complicity in the kidnapping, committed suicide, only to be found innocent later. Colonel Armstrong, consumed by these tragedies, later killed himself as well. Cassetti betrayed his partner, leaving him to be executed while he fled the country with the ransom, as he was only revealed to be the leader of the kidnapping plot on the eve of the execution.|$|E
