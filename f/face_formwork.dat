Uz tehničke karakteristike i funkcije postrojenja opisana je i tehnologija rada te problematika konstruiranja, projektiranja i prenamjene za trotračnu i četverotračnu oplatu. Opisana je i prikazana konstrukcija oplate portala, čelne oplate i tunelske niše te montaža dvotračne oplate po fazama kao i distribucija betona. The plant {{used for}} concreting the secondary tunnel lining is described. The plant {{is made of}} three segments: sheathing, self-propelled conveyor, and concrete supply system. In addition to technical properties and other features of this plant, the authors describe the work technology, and problems encountered during concept development, design and adjustment for three-rail and four-rail formwork. The structure of formwork portal, <b>face</b> <b>formwork</b> and tunnel lay-by is described and presented, including also two rail formwork assembly by stages, {{and the distribution of}} concrete...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a laboratory scale experimental technique {{to study the}} performance of the encapsulated sand barrier systems in mitigating shock waves. The geotextile encapsulated sand barrier systems are made of cubical wire mesh formwork lined with geotextile and form a thick protective barrier when filled with granular materials. In the present study, dry sand particles of size varying from microns to few millimeters (fine and coarse) are used as infill granular material. Spherical shaped glass beads are also used as the infill material to study the influence of shape of the infill particle on the attenuation behavior. The process of shock wave attenuation by the sand barrier, with and without the geotextile <b>facing</b> <b>formwork</b> is examined. The experiments are performed using a conventional shock tube, where shock waves with incident Mach number in the range of 129 - 1. 70 are generated. The experimental results show that the presence of geotextile layer has contributed significantly towards shock wave attenuation. The geotextile also plays an important role as a regulator, which is able to deliver gradual pressure rise at the downstream end of the barrier. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|... 2000 - MEVA {{presents}} the first all-plastic facing {{and is the}} first formwork producer to use this kind of <b>facing</b> in all <b>formwork</b> systems. Contrary to wooden facing, the all-plastic facing lasts {{as long as the}} panel frame, can be cleaned with high-pressure cleaners and repaired with identical material on the construction site and delivers a consistently high-quality concrete surface. MEVA’s all-plastic facing alkus [...] comes with a 7-year long term warranty that so far has never been claimed.|$|R
50|$|MEVA is a {{one-stop}} supplier for formwork {{systems and}} solutions. In line with its slogan “… {{more than just}} formwork“ MEVA offers a comprehensive services and consulting package including formwork planning and on-site support with formwork set up, process control and customer staff training. Rental formwork users can choose from different services packages and have their rental formwork inspected, cleaned and repaired by MEVA at MEVA’s industrial cleaning and repair facilities once the formwork is returned from the construction site. Customers with their own formwork inventory can have their formwork regenerated by MEVA and made like new. With its all-plastic <b>facing</b> MEVA <b>formwork</b> delivers high-quality and architectural concrete surfaces. Details about architectural concrete is founded Beside renting and selling new formwork systems MEVA offers used formwork with a double-warranty from the manufacturer. A comprehensive training program with in-depth training and seminars for customers is part of MEVA’s customer services. MEVA is certified according to ISO 9001:2008 and is active in important industry standards committees and organisations such as the American Concrete Institute (ACI) and the German equivalent GSV.|$|R
40|$|The sound {{transmission}} loss of lightweight structures {{can be increased}} by the application of <b>facing</b> <b>formworks.</b> In the aircraft industry this task is accomplished by means of sidewall panels (linings) mounted on the primary fuselage structure of an aircraft. At low frequencies (< 1000 Hz), however, the {{sound transmission}} loss {{is dominated by the}} so-called mass-law which prescribes an inverse relationship between mass and transmitted sound power. This behavior is worsened by the fact that around the so-called mass-air-mass-resonance-frequency the transmission loss of a double panel structure (e. g., an aircraft fuselage structure with linings) falls below that of a single panel (of equal mass). Furthermore, the effectiveness of passive damping methods is limited due to constraints on mass and volume. On the other hand, the interior acoustics in the aircraft cabin is an important issue regarding passenger comfort, which raises the demand for alternative solutions. Active structural acoustic control (ASAC) provides a lightweight-compliant {{solution to the problem of}} low-frequency sound transmission through single or double panel structures. Prior to wind-tunnel or flight tests, the acoustic performance of active lightweight structures is usually tested in sound transmission loss facilities. A reverberation room, equipped with one or a number of independent sound sources, is used to generate a diffuse sound field excitation. Although it is well-known that the statistical properties of such a non-ideal diffuse sound field will deviate from the ideal case, potential implications on the performance of active feedforward control systems have not been discussed so far. This is why this work evaluates the spatial coherence of ideal and non-ideal diffuse sound fields and considers the implications on feedforward control performance. The system under consideration is an aircraft-typical double panel system, equipped with an active sidewall panel, which is realized in a transmission loss facility. Experimental results for different numbers of sound sources in the reverberation room are compared to simulation results of a generic double panel system excited by an ideal diffuse sound field. It is shown that the number of statistically independent noise sources acting on the primary structure depends not only on the type of diffuse sound field but also on the sample lengths of the processed signals. The experimental results show that the number of reference sensors required for a defined control performance has an inverse relationship to the control filter length...|$|R
40|$|Chloride {{migration}} {{tests are}} {{used to measure the}} concrete capacity to inhibit chloride attack. Many researchers carry out this test in a slice of concrete extracted from the central part of cylindrical specimens, discarding about 75 % of the concrete used to mold the specimens. This fact generated the question: would it be possible to extract more slices from a same specimen without losing the confidence in the results? The main purpose of this work is to answer this question. Moreover, another aim {{of this study was to}} show the difference of chloride penetration between finished <b>faces</b> and the <b>formwork</b> surfaces of concrete beams and slabs. The results indicated that it is possible to use more slices of a single specimen for a chloride migration test. Moreover, it was demonstrated that there is a significant difference of chloride penetration between the finished surface and the formwork surface of the specimens. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
