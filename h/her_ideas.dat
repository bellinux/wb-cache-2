5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, {{due in part}} to <b>her</b> <b>ideas</b> {{about the}} role of a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its compositional skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (or have only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.|$|E
5|$|Having {{refused to}} publish <b>her</b> <b>ideas</b> in books, Montalban became largely {{forgotten}} following her death, although the OMS continued under new leadership. Her {{life and work}} was mentioned in various occult texts and historical studies of esotericism during subsequent decades; a short biography by Julia Philips was published by the Atlantis Bookshop in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{commented that}} most of <b>her</b> <b>ideas</b> for the series come after falling asleep in the bath for six hours. An {{exception}} occurs in the plot for second volume of the series, {{which is based on}} a Noh play called Koi no Omoni. As she works, she enjoys listening to Final Fantasy soundtracks, Dragon Ball CDs, the bands Porno Graffitti, L'Arc-en-Ciel, and jazz music.|$|E

40|$|Miss Jeanne Strohmeier, Textiles and Clothing Sr., {{organized}} the first College Shop {{for a large}} department store in Evanston, Illinois, while employed there during the summer months. Her first job was to interest other people in her new project. She had to sell <b>her</b> <b>idea</b> to {{the manager of the}} store; she had to sell <b>her</b> <b>idea</b> to the employees for their cooperation and support; and she had to sell <b>her</b> <b>idea</b> to the college students in Evanston...|$|R

5|$|In 1852 she put <b>her</b> <b>ideas</b> into practice, {{establishing}} a reformatory school at Bristol in 1852, in Kingswood {{in the premises}} of a school which had originally been set by John Wesley. Originally this was for boys and girls, but she soon decided to separate the sexes {{and set up a}} girls' reformatory in what is now the Red Lodge Museum in 1854, initially funded by Lady Byron.|$|E
5|$|Literary critics {{received}} Rand's fiction {{with mixed}} reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest {{has increased in}} recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread <b>her</b> <b>ideas,</b> both {{to the public and}} in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.|$|E
5|$|A doctor {{performed}} an autopsy and showed Eddy her husband's diseased heart, but she responded by giving more interviews about mesmerism. Fraser {{wrote that the}} articles made Eddy a household name, a real-life version of the charismatic and beautiful Verena Tarrant in Henry James's The Bostonians (1885–1886), with her interest in spiritualism, women's rights and the mind cure. Shortly after the death, Eddy moved next door to 571 Columbus Avenue with several students. The following year, 1883, she founded the Journal of Christian Science (later called the Christian Science Journal), which spread news of <b>her</b> <b>ideas</b> across the United States.|$|E

25|$|Ghimire {{convinced}} 22 national cricketers to sign {{a central}} contract {{for the first time}} in the history of cricket in Nepal. She was also praised for <b>her</b> <b>idea</b> to render unique tribute to Late Australian Cricketer Phillip Hughes in Nepal by organizing 63 over tribute match and taking Phillip Hughes equipment to Mt. Everest when Cricket Australia accepted <b>her</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|R
5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, {{though she is}} well aware of them. Over the years, she has learned how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like <b>her</b> <b>ideas.</b> Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E
5|$|McCracken, {{who came}} to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 {{production}} of Oklahoma!, was deeply discouraged by her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he {{made no effort to}} integrate his dances into specific story lines, or to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, since Prinz was not able to support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did not object to <b>her</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Timess Agustin Gurza {{described}} {{the creative process}} between the pair as Chan creating the instrumental first, followed by Chana crafting the lyrics and melodies alongside him. Chana based her lyrics on her previous relationships and break-ups, while Chan found inspiration in the music of Manu Chao. Chana reported that she had some difficulties during the production process due to the personal nature of the lyrics. Although she {{said that it was}} more challenging to write lyrics in Spanish, Chana expressed a preference for it as she felt that it was more poetic than English. She often consulted a Spanish-English dictionary to translate <b>her</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|E

50|$|Blakely {{then drove}} to North Carolina, the {{location}} of most of America's hosiery mills, to present <b>her</b> <b>idea.</b> She was turned away by every representative; these companies were {{used to dealing with}} established companies, and did not see the value of <b>her</b> <b>idea.</b> Two weeks after arriving home from her North Carolina trip, Blakely received a call from a male mill operator based in Asheboro, North Carolina, who offered to support Blakely's concept, as he had received strong encouragement from his three daughters. Blakely further explained in 2011 that the experience of developing <b>her</b> <b>idea</b> also revealed to her that the hosiery manufacturing industry was overseen solely by men who were not using the products they were producing.|$|R

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of <b>her</b> <b>ideas</b> were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved a}} turning point in Eleanor and Sara's long-running struggle, and as Eleanor's public role grew, she {{increasingly}} broke from Sara's control. Tensions between Sara and Eleanor over her new political friends rose {{to the point that the}} family constructed a cottage at Val-Kill, in which Eleanor and her guests lived when Franklin and the children were away from Hyde Park. Eleanor herself named the place Val-Kill, loosely translated as waterfall-stream from the Dutch language common to the original European settlers of the area. Franklin encouraged Eleanor to develop this property as a place where she could implement some of <b>her</b> <b>ideas</b> for work with winter jobs for rural workers and women. Each year, when Eleanor held a picnic at Val-Kill for delinquent boys, her granddaughter Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves assisted her. She was close to Eleanor throughout her life. Seagraves concentrated her career as an educator and librarian on keeping alive many of the causes Eleanor began and supported.|$|E
5|$|After {{military}} service, Jarrell {{moved to}} Chicago where his sister Nellie attended Northwestern University. It was in Chicago where Jarrell {{would have his}} first museum experiences. Growing in up Georgia, African Americans {{were not allowed to}} visit museums until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, therefore these early museum visits made a major impression on him. A year later he enrolled at the Art Institute of Chicago for advertising art and graphic design, where he attended night classes. His days were spent working at the International Paint company where he mixed paint. He also took classes at the Ray Vogue School for Commercial Arts. He began attending the Art Institute full-time in 1954. Jarrell eventually lost interest in commercial art and focused on classes about painting and drawing, gaining inspiration from instructor Laura McKinnon and <b>her</b> <b>ideas</b> about spatial relationship theory. In 1958, he graduated with his original major(s), retaining a strong desire to pursue the life of a fine artist. At this time he also met artist Jeff Donaldson, who became a friend who influenced his career. In 1959, the year of his first marriage, he became an advertising photographer, taking photos of type and lettering styles. The couple would divorce shortly after the marriage.|$|E

Then with a smiling air of heavy patronage she delivered herself of <b>her</b> one <b>idea</b> of a damaging counter-stroke.|$|R
