25|$|Samuel C. Williams {{believed}} that Gist fathered Sequoyah around 1775 {{by his mother}} Wurteh Watts. She {{was the daughter of}} John Watts and Wurteh Giyosikoyohe, and sister of Doublehead. Of a prominent clan, she was also related to Old Tassel. Williams dismissed the story that Sequoyah's father was an itinerant German peddler by the name of <b>Guess.</b> <b>He</b> noted that Sequoyah went by George Guess, Guest, and Gist, and that he finished the Cherokee alphabet in 1821 when he was about 40. This was much too young for a man born in 1761. Williams noted that a letter showed that in 1828, Sequoyah visited Gist relatives in Kentucky and was acknowledged as a family member.|$|E
25|$|The {{story begins}} in the Shire, where the hobbit Frodo Baggins {{inherits}} the Ring from Bilbo Baggins, his cousin and guardian. Neither hobbit {{is aware of the}} Ring's nature, but Gandalf the Grey, a wizard and an old friend of Bilbo, suspects it to be Sauron's Ring. Many years later, after Gandalf confirms his <b>guess,</b> <b>he</b> tells Frodo the history of the Ring and counsels him to take it away from the Shire. Frodo sets out, accompanied by his gardener and friend, Samwise ("Sam") Gamgee, and two cousins, Meriadoc Brandybuck, called Merry, and Peregrin Took, called Pippin. They are nearly caught by the Black Riders but shake off their pursuers by cutting through the Old Forest. There they are aided by Tom Bombadil, a strange and merry fellow who lives with his wife Goldberry in the forest.|$|E

25|$|On October 10, 2001, boxing trainer Eddie Futch {{died at age}} 90. Tim Smith of the New York Daily News remembered an {{encounter}} with the trainer in an article. One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch {{was talking about how}} much he admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales {{said he was going to}} neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> thinks he's going to stand there and let him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece. Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter. I don't know anyone in boxing who won't miss him. I don't know anyone in boxing that can take his place.|$|E

Kristin Dos Santos of E! called Mr. Eko [...] "the best character of the show", and was therefore very disappointed with his death. In response to Mr. Eko's death, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated [...] "I'll miss Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje—his acting was up there with Terry O'Quinn's, Elizabeth Mitchell's, and Michael Emerson's. I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was the sacrifice the island demanded". Writing for Zap2it, Rick Porter said that his death [...] "sucked hard, and loud, and long".

500|$|Of Easy Jet's stamina {{and busy}} {{training}} regimen, Merrick said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> ate at night; I don't know when else.

[...] Easy Jet was so easy to train that Merrick decided to oversee the training himself rather than send the horse away to a professional trainer. In a practice race at the ranch, Merrick matched the yearling against Jet Smooth. Although his elder brother had the advantage of previous race experience, Easy Jet won the 350-yard (320m) race. Easy Jet's performance prompted Merrick to enter him in a yearling race at Blue Ribbon Downs, which the colt won by more than a length.|$|E

Later that day, Peter and Simpson are met with an angry mob instead led by Mayor Adam West, intent on driving the latter out of town. Desperate for a place to live without being bothered by furious citizens, Simpson makes a heartfelt speech, professing that he is just as imperfect as everyone else, causing the residents of Quahog to apologize and embrace with him. A split second later, however, the tables turn to a surprise ending as Simpson takes out a knife and kills three people before running off. A furious mob goes on to chase after Simpson, as the Griffins look on, with Peter, wearing a guilty disappointed look, indifferently declaring, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> did do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for Hulk was {{composed}} by Danny Elfman, who scored Spider-Man the previous year. Frequent Ang Lee collaborator, Mychael Danna, {{was the original}} composer for the film. However, Danna's score was rejected by studio executives for its non-traditional approach, which featured Japanese taiko, African drumming, and Arabic singing. Elfman was then approached by Universal's president of film music, Kathy Nelson. With 37 days to compose over two hours of music, Elfman agreed out of respect to Lee. While instructing to retain much {{of the character of}} Danna's score, Lee pushed Elfman to write material that did not sound like his previous superhero scores. [...] "They did leave some of my music in the movie," [...] said Danna, [...] "so the Arabic singing and some of the drumming is mine. What happened is that they panicked, they brought in Danny and he heard what I've been doing and I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> liked it." ...|$|E

You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting".

He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 3, 2013, just a {{month before}} the film's premiere, {{producers}} announced that Al Pacino had left the film over creative differences about how his character should come to life. At the time of his departure, Pacino's character had already been fully voiced and animated. Chris Renaud, co-director of the film, commented on Pacino's departure: [...] "So we don't want an unhappy actor, and we want something that is well-realized on all sides. If you don't see eye to eye, sometimes it's easier to (part company) and move on from there." [...] Benjamin Bratt, who had already been considered before Pacino, stepped in to voice Eduardo. Chris Meledandri, producer of the film, admitted that he was not [...] "aware of any of the major animated films of the last 15 years that has brought an actor in at such a late stage". Due to the finished animation, Bratt had to match his timing exactly to the character's mouth movement. Initially, during his five-day recording, he tried to imitate Pacino's voice, but found it impossible, saying [...] "no one can out-Al Pacino Al Pacino". He ended up only using Pacino as an inspiration, and resolved to go with his own interpretation of the character. His work was commended by Variety, saying: [...] "You'd never <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> wasn't the filmmakers' first choice." ...|$|E

2500|$|King {{has been}} {{involved}} in many litigation cases with boxers that were focused on fraud. In 1982 he was sued by Muhammad Ali for underpaying him $1.1 million for a fight with Larry Holmes. King called in an old friend of Ali, Jeremiah Shabazz, and handed him a suitcase containing $50,000 in cash and a letter ending Ali's lawsuit against King. He asked Shabazz to visit Ali (who was in the hospital due to his failing health) and get him to sign the letter and then give Ali the $50,000. Ali signed. The letter even gave King the right to promote any future Ali fights. According to Shabazz, [...] "Ali was ailing by then and mumbling a lot. I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> needed the money."

2500|$|He began 1995 {{with a win}} at the San Blas Half Marathon in Puerto Rico, and {{continued}} his winning ways at the Los Angeles Marathon where he ran a very tactical race, which was held in poor weather conditions. Vera's outright refusal to take his turn {{at the front of}} the leading pack (and thus bear his share of the wind and rain) angered the reigning marathon world champion Mark Plaatjes. After 20 miles, Vera tucked in behind the only remaining leader Bob Kempainen and defied Kempainen's attempts to shake him off – following his zig-zag movements across the road. Finally taking the lead in the final stages, Vera enjoyed a tailwind and won the race in 2:11:39 (twenty seconds ahead of the other runners). Kempainen later commented: [...] "I kept trying to get him out front to take the lead, but I couldn't very well turn around and ask him to do it...I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> ran it smart".|$|E

He'd come back on Tuesday, and he'd look beat. He was like a little puppy – so ashamed when he did something wrong. He was all heart, but he didn't have enough muscle to carry through." [...] An unnamed co-star in Dreamcoat was quoted as saying, [...] "I hear {{he spent most of}} his time in his hotel room in front of the TV. I <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was frightened and insecure. That's what happens when you're the baby brother of the Bee Gees." [...] Commenting after Gibb's death, Solid Gold producer Brad Lachman stated, [...] "... was a very charming, vulnerable and charismatic performer. He clearly meant well. He wasn't being difficult.
