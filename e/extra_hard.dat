5|$|In the sub-plot, Lisa {{discovers that}} the senior {{citizens}} at Grampa's nursing home {{do not have}} any entertainment, and decides to buy them a digital TV converter. However, while at the store to buy it, she discovers Mr. Burns feeling very happy playing Funtendo Zii Sports. She decides to buy this for the senior citizens, hoping they will feel younger and happier. When playing the Zii, the senior citizens feel very happy and feel younger. This forces the nurses at the home to work <b>extra</b> <b>hard</b> after their workout, prompting them to wash the Zii in the dishwasher, causing it to break. Lisa becomes angry at the nurses for doing it on purpose, thus showing their disregard for the senior citizens. However, the nurses blow her off. The senior citizens then return to their boring selves, staring at TV static.|$|E

25|$|The battle royal saw Atlantis and Negro Casas as {{the last}} to wrestlers in the ring, meaning that they would face off {{in the last of}} the four first round matches that {{immediately}} followed the Battle Royal. The first round matches were all quick, under or around four minutes per match. In the first round Máscara Dorada defeated Black Warrior, El Terrible defeated Mr. Águila, Rush defeated Rey Bucanero and in the final first round match Atlantis defeated Negro Casas. The second round matches were a bit longer, but still relatively short compared to non-tournament matches. In the second round El Terrible defeated Máscara Dorada and Rush defeated Atlantis, which meant that the long time rivals El Terrible and Rush would meet in the semi-final match. The semi-finals match was longer and also more intense as the long-standing rivalry made both men work <b>extra</b> <b>hard</b> to gain the upper hand. El Terrible took the victory and the spot in the final and then made a challenge to Rush to put his hair on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas ("Bet Match") against El Terrible. Rush accepted the challenge and was subsequently attacked by El Terrible's team mate Rey Bucanero, who hit Rush over the head with a steel folding chair. Following the attack Rush, emphasizing the effects of the attack, was taken out of the arena on a stretch.|$|E
500|$|One {{of the key}} story {{concepts}} {{behind the}} game was the [...] "rebirth" [...] of Lightning as a character: this was cited as the main reason why the game was called Lightning Returns and not XIII-3, alongside the team's desire to attract new players to the series. Lightning was also made into a darker and more vulnerable character, partly because Kitase felt that her previous stoic depictions might have alienated earlier players. The main scenario and script was written by Daisuke Watanabe, the main writer for the previous XIII games. During the concept process, Watanabe, Toriyama {{and other members of}} staff brainstormed ideas for important scenes and events leading up to them. The process of writing the script was slow, causing difficulties {{for the rest of the}} team. In response to this, Watanabe worked <b>extra</b> <b>hard</b> to create an appropriate finale for the characters and story. He also wrote the script as more hard-edged than those for the previous XIII games.|$|E
2500|$|Fisher was {{appointed}} to command [...] as flag captain to the Admiral of the North America and West Indies Station, Astley Cooper Key, from 2 March 1877 to 4 June 1878. Bellerophon {{had been in the}} dockyard for repairs, so the new crew was less than perfect in carrying out their duties. Fisher told them I intend to give you hell for three months, and if you have not come up to my standard in that time you'll have hell for another three months. Midshipman (later Admiral) A. H. Gordon Moore reported, Fisher was a very exacting master and I had at times long and arduous duties, long hours at the engine room telegraphs in cold fog, etc., and the least inattention was punished. It was, I think, his way of proving us, for he always rewarded us in some way when an <b>extra</b> <b>hard</b> bit of work was over.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2010, the Neighbours sets {{underwent}} a makeover and a mezzanine level was added to Lassiter's Hotel. Bower and producer Neal Kingston revealed that {{this was to be}} {{the focal point of the}} [...] "Who Pushed P.R.?" [...] storyline. [...] The cast and crew shot the scenes for the 6000th episode celebration week in early June. Described by Bower as [...] "a monumental block", everyone had to work <b>extra</b> <b>hard</b> to get everything shot. An extra day was added to the filming schedule of both the location and studio shoots. Speaking to a Channel 5 reporter, Dennis said that it was hard to film the moment Paul fell from the mezzanine as there was no stunt involved. He commented that the scene was [...] "very cleverly filmed" [...] and if it was not for the lack of a falling body, viewers may have thought a stunt had been performed. The actor explained that the restrictive time-slot and G rating means Neighbours are not allowed to show a falling body. Dennis described the shoot as being [...] "no different from another day of shooting on Neighbours.|$|E

25|$|Other {{differences}} include intake ramps for {{the engines}} and two <b>extra</b> wing <b>hard</b> points for payload (for {{a total of}} 11), retaining previous hardpoints on the bottom centerline, wingtips, and two conformal fuselage positions. Among the most significant aerodynamic changes are the enlarged leading edge extensions (LEX) which provide improved vortex lifting characteristics in high angle of attack maneuvers, and reduce the static stability margin to enhance pitching characteristics. This results in pitch rates in excess of 40 degrees per second, and high resistance to departure from controlled flight.|$|R
50|$|The Caballeros {{have always}} {{exhibited}} {{a knack for}} making what they do on the field look easy, but in reality it has required many <b>extra</b> hours of <b>hard</b> work.

5000|$|The {{contrasting}} case of real quadratic fields is very different, {{and much}} less is known.

50|$|Channel 7, {{which for}} several years had already begun a {{tradition}} of scheduling news in (previously) untraditional time periods, broke further ground again {{with the addition of}} a half-hour 4p.m. newscast in June 1996, which gave Strong and Marshall additional anchor duties. The newscast was launched when WHDH sought an alternative to its previous efforts to program the 4:00 time slot (including Inside Edition through the end of the 1993-94 season, A Current Affair from September 1994 to January 1996 and finally, the WSVN-produced Deco Drive, the latter two programs of which had underperformed for the station). The 4p.m. newscast was originally separated from the existing early evening news block by Hard Copy, and later by <b>Extra</b> after <b>Hard</b> Copy ended its run in September 1999; after Extra moved to 7:30p.m. in September 2001, WHDH launched a 4:30p.m. newscast (the second in Boston, after a newscast on WFXT that launched three months earlier).|$|R
60|$|The {{conversation}} made Dave more uneasy in mind than before. He had {{not thought}} that the red men would consider him a spy.

Only two years before a spy had been caught by the Indians near the Great Lakes, and {{it was a matter of}} record that the red men had placed him upon the ground flat on his back and built a fire upon his breast, leaving him to burn slowly to death! The thought of this sent a cold shiver down Dave's backbone.|$|E
6000|$|It {{would seem}} that the feeling of disappointment, which Darwin so often {{experienced}} in comparing a book when completed, with the observations and speculations which had inspired it, was more keenly felt in the case of his volume on South America than any other.

6000|$|And the queer {{courtship}} began again. By Christmas she had consented, {{still under}} the impression that she was the mistress, not the slave--the cat, not the bird. Once or twice, when Fiorsen let passion out of hand and his overbold caresses affronted her, she recoiled almost with dread from what she was going toward. But, in general, she lived elated, intoxicated by music and his adoration, withal remorseful that she was making her father sad. She was but little at Mildenham, and he, in his unhappiness, was there nearly all the time, riding <b>extra</b> <b>hard,</b> and leaving Gyp with his sister. Aunt Rosamund, though under the spell of Fiorsen's music, had agreed with her brother that Fiorsen was [...] "impossible." [...] But nothing she said made any effect on Gyp. It was new and startling to discover in this soft, sensitive girl such a vein of stubbornness. Opposition seemed to harden her resolution. And the good lady's natural optimism began to persuade her that Gyp would make a silk purse out of that sow's ear yet. After all, the man was a celebrity in his way! ...|$|E
40|$|Radar {{trailing}} {{plays an}} important role inside the space of early warning and detection system, whose preciseness is closely connected with filtering rule. With the event of noise jam technology in sign, linear filtering becomes <b>extra</b> and <b>harder</b> to satisfy the strain of measuring device trailing, whereas nonlinear filtering can solve problems like non-Gaussian noises. There exist several nonlinear filtering algorithms at the current, and their characteristic of linear and nonlinear data filters are totally different, we tend to discover that KF is easy to implement and has been wide used. Therefore, we'll simulate and show the performance of the Kalman data filter (KF). One of the problems with the Kalman filter is that they will not sturdy against modeling uncertainties. The Kalman filter algorithmic rule is that the optimum filter for a system whereas not uncertainties. The performance of a Kalman filter is additionally significantly degraded if the actual system model does not match the model thereon the Kalman filter was based, thus needed a advance version of Kalman filter, This filter is thought as Adjustive/Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) ...|$|R

6000|$|The evening {{began with}} a game of ball in the large open space amongst the houses forming the village square. The {{implement}} was a roll of palm-coir tightly bound with the central fibre of the plantain-leaf. The players, two parties of some twenty slaves, {{of all ages and}} sizes, mingled, each side striving to catch the ball, and with many feints and antics to pass it on to a friend. When it fell out of bounds, the juniors ran to pick it up with frantic screams. It was interesting, as showing the difference between the highlander and the lowlander; one might pass years on the Congo plains without seeing so much voluntary exertion: yet a similar game of ball is described by the Rev. Mr. Waddell ("Twenty-nine years in the West Indies and Central Africa," [...] chap. xvii. London, Nelsons, 1863). The evening ended, as it often does before a march, when rest is required, with <b>extra</b> <b>hard</b> work, a drinking bout deep as the Rhineland baron's in the good old time, and a dance in which both sexes joined. As there were neither torches nor moon, I did not attend; the singing, the shouting, and the drumming, which lasted till midnight, spoke well for the agility and endurance of the fair montagnardes.|$|E

40|$|A rogue {{access point}} (AP) is an {{unauthorized}} AP plugged into a network. This poses a serious security threat. To detect an AP, a network manager traditionally takes the electric wave sensor across an entire protected place. This task is very labor-intensive and inefficient. This study presents a new AP detection method without <b>extra</b> hardware or <b>hard</b> work. This new method determines whether the network packets of an IP address are routed from APs, according to client-side bottleneck bandwidth. The network manager can perform his job {{from his office}} by monitoring the packets passing through the core switch. The accuracies remain above 99 % when the parameter, sliding window size, of the proposed algorithm is larger than 20, according to experimental results. The proposed method effectively reduces the network manager's workload, and increases network security. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
