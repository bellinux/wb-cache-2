6000|$|She pieced the <b>dim</b> <b>letters</b> together. They hadn't {{been there}} when she started out to bathe. Who?... She looked round. The beach was quite empty. And what was the meaning? [...] "O Clara d'Ellébeuse." [...] She took her bath-gown from the cabin, slipped on her sandals, and ran back towards the house {{as fast as she}} could. She felt most horribly frightened.|$|E
6000|$|Meantime Josie {{mounted the}} stairs, which were boarded in {{at one end}} of the building, being built on the outside to economize space, and entered the narrow upper hallway. A chatter of children's voices in the rear proclaimed that portion to be the {{quarters}} of the Jerrems family. Toward the front was a door on which, in <b>dim</b> <b>letters,</b> was the legend: [...] "H. Cragg. Real Estate." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{stopping}} at the post office, Arthur drove down a little side street to a weather-beaten, unprepossessing building which bore the word “Restaurant” painted in <b>dim</b> white <b>letters</b> upon its one window. Here he halted the machine.|$|R
40|$|We applied single-pulse {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the {{occipital pole}} of healthy subjects while they performed a forced-choice visual letter-identification task. We found three separate periods when TMS suppressed performance; the first period is best explained by TMS-induced blinking whereas the last two periods are best explained by TMS-induced disruption of letter-processing in the early visual cortex. Unexpectedly, {{we also found that}} TMS-induced suppression progressively disappeared during three weeks of repeated TMS experiments. However, it was only suppression during the last two periods that disappeared; suppression during the first period remained undiminished. When subjects were then presented with <b>dimmer</b> <b>letters,</b> suppression reappeared. The most likely explanation is a practice-induced increase in neuronal activity in the early visual cortex...|$|R
40|$|Attention plays a {{fundamental}} role in visual learning and memory. One highly established principle of visual attention {{is that the}} harder a central task is, the more attentional resources are used to perform the task and the smaller amount of attention is allocated to peripheral processing because of limited attention capacity. Here we show that this principle holds true in a dual-task setting but not in a paradigm of task-irrelevant perceptual learning. In Experiment 1, eight participants were asked to identify either bright or dim number targets at the screen center and to remember concurrently presented scene backgrounds. Their recognition performances for scenes paired with dim/hard targets were worse than those for scenes paired with bright/easy targets. In Experiment 2, eight participants were asked to identify either bright or <b>dim</b> <b>letter</b> targets at the screen center while a task-irrelevant coherent motion was concurrently presented in the background. After five days of training on letter identification, participants improved their motion sensitivity to the direction paired with hard/dim targets improved but not to the direction paired with easy/bright targets. Taken together, these results suggest that taskirrelevant stimuli are not subject to the attentional control mechanisms that task-relevant stimuli abide...|$|R
6000|$|First {{he seemed}} to see, and then not to see. Then he saw clearly little edges of foam {{pursuing}} each other, and a wide waste of weltering waters below him. Far away was a pilot boat with a big sail bearing <b>dim</b> black <b>letters,</b> and a little pinkish-yellow light, and it was rolling and pitching, rolling and pitching in a gale, while he could feel no wind at, all. Soon the sound of waters was loud and near. He was dropping, dropping--into the sea! ...|$|R
60|$|Except {{this early}} correspondence, {{very few of}} Schiller's letters {{have been given to}} the world.[70] In Doering's Appendix, we have found one written six years after the poet's {{voluntary}} exile, and agreeably contrasted in its purport with the agitation and despondency of that unhappy period. We translate it for the sake of those who, along with us, regret that while the world is deluged with insipid correspondences, and 'pictures of mind' that were not worth drawing, the correspondence of a man who never wrote unwisely should lie mouldering in private repositories, ere long to be irretrievably destroyed; that the 'picture of a mind' who was among the conscript fathers of the human race should still be left so vague and <b>dim.</b> This <b>letter</b> is addressed to Schwann, during Schiller's first residence in Weimar: it has already been referred to in the Text.|$|R
