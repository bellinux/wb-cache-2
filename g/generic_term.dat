5|$|During the 2nd century some {{units with}} the new names numerus ("group") and vexillatio ("detachment") appear in the diploma record. Their size is uncertain, but was likely smaller than the regular alae and cohortes, as {{originally}} they were probably detachments from the latter, acquiring independent status after long-term separation. As these units are mentioned in diplomas, they were presumably part of the regular auxiliary organisation. But numeri was also a <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> used for barbarian units outside the regular auxilia. (see section 2.4 Irregular units, below).|$|E

Kirby researched the game's development, taking depositions from designer Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi in Japan. Miyamoto claimed that he had in fact called his ape character King Kong at first, as that was a <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> in Japan for any large ape.|$|E

5|$|The organ {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{instruments}} still used in European classical music that has commonly been credited as having derived from Greece. Its earliest predecessors were built in Ancient Greece in the 3rd century BC. The word organ is derived from the Greek όργανον (organon), a <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> for an instrument or a tool, via the Latin organum, an instrument similar to a portative organ used in ancient Roman circus games.|$|E
5|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, Jannon's {{matrices}} {{had come to}} be known as the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). It has sometimes been claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested it might be a garbled recollection of Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's matrices at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> of the eighteenth century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.|$|E
5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, {{building}} on Wolfgang Pauli's work, Paul Dirac produced {{a model of}} the electron– the Dirac equation, consistent with relativity theory, by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field. In order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, Dirac developed in 1930 {{a model of the}} vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy, later dubbed the Dirac sea. This led him to predict the existence of a positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron. This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who proposed calling standard electrons negatrons, and using electron as a <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants.|$|E
5|$|Organic mercury {{compounds}} are historically important but are of little industrial {{value in the}} western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organo{{mercury compounds}} are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water. They arise by {{a process known as}} biomethylation.|$|E
5|$|The Saluki was {{historically}} bred in the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated. Images {{of running}} dogs with long, narrow bodies adorn pottery found in Susa {{that dates back}} to 6,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia, with one writer suggesting that these might depict the ancestor of the Saluki, despite the depictions bearing erect, pointed ears. Salukis and Greyhounds were increasingly depicted on Egyptian tombs from the Middle Kingdom (2134 BC–1785 BC) onward, however it was during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt that Salukis rose to prominence, replacing the Tesem (thought to be similar to modern Pariah dogs or a <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> for a dog) in ancient Egyptian art. The breed spread southward into the Sudan.|$|E

40|$|People {{refer to}} places and {{landscape}} features in various ways. Proper names, such as "Shiprock", refer to individual feature instances, while common nouns (<b>generic</b> <b>terms),</b> such as "hill" or "river", refer to categories of features or to generic category instances. It {{is important to}} understand the many ways of referring to places and landscape features, so that we can connect natural language to spatial data infrastructures geographic databases. Traditional knowledge systems must be linked to GIS data, in order to support mapping and effective GIS use by indigenous people. This paper reports early ethnophysiographic research with Navajo (Diné) in New Mexico and Arizona, and Yindjibarndi in Australia, comparing these results with common physiographic references in English and related languages. English makes heavy use of nouns referring to kinds of geographic features in both generic (eg., "his house is on a hill") and specific reference (eg., "Mount Washington"). Furthermore, European proper names of geographic places and features (toponyms) often include <b>generic</b> <b>terms</b> that indicate the kind of feature. Preliminary results suggest that both Navajo and Yindjibarndi speakers use specific (proper) names for places and land features more often than do English speakers. Also, Yindjibarndi proper names, which are not easily translatable, seldom include <b>generic</b> <b>terms.</b> However, Navajo <b>generic</b> and specific <b>terms</b> are often translatable literally (eg. "Reddish rock protrudes out"), but frequently lack <b>generic</b> landscape <b>terms.</b> The paper also discusses field interviews and initial general principles for use of toponyms and <b>generic</b> geographic <b>terms</b> in these languages...|$|R

5|$|The {{introduction}} of printed planar technologies greatly simplified {{the manufacture of}} many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when planar transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936. The inventor of printed stripline, however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951.Barrett, 1952,Niehenke et al., p.846. This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's stripline soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats, especially triplate and microstrip. The <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> stripline in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a <b>generic</b> <b>term,</b> required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{knew of the}} {{technique}} of distillation, {{but it was not}} practiced on a major scale in Europe until some time around the 12th century, when Arabic innovations in the field combined with water-cooled glass alembics were introduced. Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified, and the term aqua vitae ("water of life") was used as a <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> for all kinds of distillates. The early use of various distillates, alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; grape syrup mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and rose water was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for hand washing. Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing entremets (a type of entertainment dish after a course) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits. It would then be placed in the mouth of the stuffed, cooked and occasionally redressed animals, and lit just before presenting the creation.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclusive}} use of {{the term}} Wicca—referring to the entirety of Pagan Witchcraft religion—has been traced to Britain in the early 1960s, when it was used by various groups and publicised through use in adverts, magazines, and other literary sources. It was later adopted by figures like Alex Sanders and Gavin and Yvonne Frost, who took it to the United States. There, practitioners of British Traditional Wicca adopted it exclusively for themselves as a means to differentiate their practices from those of other Pagan Witches. This exclusive meaning was countered by its popularisation as a <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> by prolific authors such as Raymond Buckland, Scott Cunningham and Silver RavenWolf. As it entered popular culture, it gained an increasingly eclectic character in its usage. During the 1990s, some attempted to distance themselves from it by utilising the term Traditional Witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|In metapopulation terminology, {{migrating}} {{individuals are}} classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A {{site is a}} <b>generic</b> <b>term</b> that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.|$|E
