Cysteine {{is made in the}} chloroplast (the proplastid too) but it is also synthesized in the cytosol and mitochondria, probably because it has trouble crossing membranes to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> it is needed. The chloroplast is known to make the precursors to methionine but it is unclear whether the organelle carries out the last leg of the pathway or if it happens in the cytosol.|$|E

Grimsby released him on 30 April 2009 and in retrospect he commented [...] "It has been a wake-up call if I am honest.

The album is dedicated to Mikey Bronsnan, who helped them get started in Philadelphia, PA. In November 2008, Bronsnan {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. According to drummer Chris Adler, [...] "Without Mikey, we'd very well might not be a band today." [...] Drummer Chris Adler was quoted saying [...] "This album is going to surprise a lot of people. Typically bands that <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> we are in our career begin to slack off, smell the roses and regurgitate. We chose a different path. No one wants to hear another band member hyping a new record. ‘Wrath’ needs no hype. We have topped ourselves and on February 24 you will feel it."

Following the release of Can't Be Tamed, Cyrus officially parted ways with longtime record label Hollywood Records. With Hannah Montana now officially over, Cyrus announced that she planned to take a hiatus from music to focus on her film career. She commented, [...] "I've not taken, like, acting lessons or anything, but it doesn't mean I don't need to because I'm sure I do... I'm probably going to go book an acting coach." [...] She later confirmed {{she would not be}} going to college for the time being, stating that [...] " [...] a firm believer that you can go back at any age you want", and that she [...] " [...] worked hard to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> [...] now, and [...] to enjoy it while it lasts".|$|E
500|$|Despite her {{crimes and}} faults, Global TV {{describes}} Sharon {{as a central}} heroine who has endured many challenges to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> she is. She is considered a fan favorite on the soap opera, but also a [...] "love-her-or-hate-her character", and has divided viewer opinions. In an early observation of the character, Kathleen Sloan of the Toronto Star noted that Sharon's [...] "angelic demeanor" [...] could mask a [...] "devil in disguise". Tommy Garrett of Canyon News describes Sharon as an [...] "ever-suffering heroine, who can't find a break in life", stating that she has [...] "faced it all". In 2009, Luke Kerr of Daytime Confidential noted that all of Sharon's love interests—including Jack, Brad and Nicholas—"seem to think" [...] that she is [...] "the perfect woman". Jamey Giddens (also from Daytime Confidential) described her as soap operas' [...] "hottest mess". Case herself opined that Sharon was a damsel in distress and [...] "wasn't very colorful", {{which is why the}} writers chose to have her do [...] "bad things" [...] over the years. Former head writer Charles Pratt, Jr. likened Sharon's story to The Perils of Pauline (1914).|$|E

500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E

"Someday (Place in the Sun)" [...] {{is about}} how Tinie started in the cold, harsh streets of London and had to face many {{obstacles}} to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> he is today (his 'place in the sun'). [...] "Don't Sell Out" [...] incorporates elements of Tamil Cinema that meld into the hip hop and trap genres throughout the song. Tinie wrote it after hearing [...] "Kalasala Kalasala" [...] by Vaali and S. S. Thaman and thinking the words sounded like 'don't sell out'. Balistiq sampled the song and sent the track to Tinie, who used this {{as a basis for}} the song. He decided to create a song poking fun at the term [...] "selling out", due to how frequently and foolishly it is used. [...] "Looking Down the Barrel" [...] follows on from where Disc-Overy track [...] "Obsession" [...] left off: it's the second track where Tempah's spoken his random thoughts on fame, life, relationships and success. He decided to fill the track with 'random retorts and different tangents he was going off on'. The song was produced by Tom Rowlands of The Chemical Brothers, and the song's sample was selected by Rowlands.|$|E

It was added on the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4, which was released in late November 2011. The video begins with Beyoncé onstage in a shimmery silver minidress, giving the crowd {{a bit of a}} windup about where [...] "I Was Here" [...] came from. She says: [...] "It's taken {{a lot of hard work}} to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> I am. I searched all around the world, and I found myself. You all are my inspiration. I want to sing this last song and dedicate it to all of you guys." [...] The video then turns into a career retrospective in the form of Beyoncé's home movies and her professional highlights. It splices poignant memories throughout Beyoncé's life, from her childhood, to partying and vacations with her family, to most of the locations she visited around the world, to her rise with Destiny's Child into solo stardom and her love story with Jay-Z. Also containing footage from major performances and awards shows, the clip begins with a young Beyoncé thanking the judges in a talent show and later doing the snake in her living room, performing in her TLC-inspired neon overalls.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy and {{directed}} by Bradley Buecker. Two months before it aired, Murphy confirmed at PaleyFest 2011 {{that there was a}} death planned {{before the end of the}} season, but that it would not be recurring character Dave Karofsky, despite rumors that his death would be paving the way for Kurt's return to McKinley High. Further details were eventually supplied by entertainment reporter Michael Ausiello, who reported on April 19, 2011 that a [...] "beloved character" [...] would be dying in the [...] "season's penultimate episode", and one week later that the character was female. Morrison confirmed in late April that there would indeed be a death, and added: [...] "The episode right before the finale is called 'Funeral'. We were actually at a funeral home yesterday, shooting all day. It was a very taxing day." [...] The day the episode aired, Lynch revealed in an interview that Murphy had conferred with her before proceeding with the storyline: [...] "He took me aside at a party and said 'I want your blessing on this before we move forward.' I said, 'It sounds like a really great storyline.' It’s the thing that will break Sue Sylvester’s heart and <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> she lives."

500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by Kai Ebel, a German TV reporter, Lewis Hamilton stressed {{that it was}} important to him to [...] "strike back" [...] after his retirement in Singapore. Later on in the press conference, he commented on equalling Ayrton Senna's number of victories: [...] "Also knowing that this would be the race that I would equal Ayrton, who won here and who had quite an interesting [...] here. So, yeah, quite an emotional day. But to be honest I'm not a teary guy, so I'm just full of joy and happiness and light and I'm really grateful for [...] all the people who have helped me <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> I am today and this team, because without them I would not be here." [...] Nico Rosberg acknowledged that [...] "it's going the wrong way" [...] in terms of his championship hopes as he would have needed a victory and declared: [...] "Just need to try to win next time out." [...] Sebastian Vettel lamented his chances at second place, as he said that he could have stayed in front of Rosberg had he made a pit stop a lap earlier during the second round of stops, However, he stated that [...] "with hindsight, it's always easy so, nevertheless, it's a great day". Hamilton followed up on his delight at matching Senna later on, saying: [...] "For me to win here at a race where I loved watching Ayrton drive and to match his wins, it doesn't feel real at the moment." [...] Senna had won his three world championship titles at Suzuka.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning {{an effort}} to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders {{selected}} John Tavares with the first-overall pick of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. Tavares went into the draft as the top prospect {{in the majority of}} scouting reports, and it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares, Victor Hedman, and Matt Duchene. NHL Central Scouting Bureau's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, [...] " [...] is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening. The way he reads the play and can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> he figures the rebounds will be and bangs in the rebound. He's a real smart player." [...] They traded up twice in the first round to also select defenseman Calvin de Haan with the 12th overall pick, as well as Casey Cizikas and Anders Lee in later rounds, all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster by the 2014–15 season.|$|E

2500|$|Responding to this criticism, Karen Mead of Japanator.com disagreed, {{writing that}} [...] "in Asuna's case, her actions are {{instrumental}} {{to her own}} rescue; if she hadn't broken out of her cell and gone exploring late in the show, Kirito wouldn't have gotten the card he needed to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> she was and rescue her", thus invalidating {{her role as a}} damsel in distress technically, though the criticism itself was still seen as valid. The claim that Kirito serves as a [...] "Gary Stu" [...] type character was also contested, citing his relationship with Asuna. Nevertheless, Eisenbeis praised the fourth arc of Sword Art Online as it focuses primarily on Asuna's point of view – an [...] "excellent choice" [...] in his opinion, as it [...] "allows Asuna, who suddenly went from strong female lead to weak damsel in distress in the series’ second arc, to once again come into her own and develop as a character."
