40|$|This paper {{describes}} a web-based information system for plant <b>disease</b> <b>forecast</b> {{that was developed}} for crop growers in Gyeonggi-do, Korea. The system gene-rates hourly or daily warnings at the spatial resolution of 240 m× 240 m based on weather data. The system consists of four components including weather data acquisition system, job process system, data storage system, and web service system. The spatial resolution of <b>disease</b> <b>forecast</b> is high enough to estimate daily or hourly infection risks of individual farms, so that farmers can use the forecast information practically in determining if and when fungicides are to be sprayed to control <b>diseases.</b> Currently, <b>forecasting</b> models for blast, sheath blight, and grain rot of rice, and scab and rust of pear are available for the system. As for the spatial interpolation of weather data, the interpolated temper-ature and relative humidity showed high accuracy {{as compared with the}} observed data at the same locations. However, the spatial interpolation of rainfall and leaf wetness events needs to be improved. For rice blast forecasting, 44. 5 % of infection warnings based on the observed weather data were correctly estimated when the <b>disease</b> <b>forecast</b> was made based on the interpolated weather data. The low accuracy in <b>disease</b> <b>forecast</b> based on the interpolated weather data was mainly due to the failure in estimating leaf wetness events...|$|R

40|$|Weather {{data for}} <b>disease</b> <b>forecasts</b> are usually derived from {{automated}} weather stations (AWS) {{that may be}} dispersed across a region in an irregular pattern. We have developed an alternative method to simulate local scale, high-resolution weather and plant disease in a grid pattern. The system incorporates a simplified mesoscale boundary layer model, LAWSS, for estimating local conditions such as air temperature and relative humidity. It also integrates special models for estimating of surface wetness duration and <b>disease</b> <b>forecasts,</b> such as the grapevine downy mildew forecast model, DMCast. The system can recreate weather forecasts utilizing the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis database, which contains over 57 years of archived and corrected global upper air conditions. The highest horizontal resolution of 0. 150 km was achieved by running 5 -step nested child grids inside coarse mother grids. Over the Finger Lakes and Chautauqua Lake regions of New York State, the system simulated three growing seasons for estimating the risk of grape downy mildew with 1 km resolution.

5000|$|In {{most cases}} the host can be {{suitably}} defined as resistant or susceptible, {{and the presence of}} the pathogen may often be reasonably ascertained based on previous cropping history or perhaps survey data. The environment is usually the factor that controls whether disease develops or not. Environmental conditions may determine the presence of the pathogen in a particular season through their effects on processes such as overwintering. Environmental conditions also affect the ability of the pathogen to cause disease, e.g. a minimum leaf wetness duration is required for grey leaf spot of corn to occur. In these cases a <b>disease</b> <b>forecasting</b> system attempts to define when the environment will be conducive to disease development.|$|E
5000|$|Forecasting {{systems may}} {{use one of}} several {{parameters}} {{in order to work}} out disease risk, or a combination of factors. One of the first forecasting systems designed was for Stewart's wilt and based on winter temperature index as low temperatures would kill the vector of the disease so there would be no outbreak. An example of a multiple disease/pest forecasting system is the EPIdemiology, PREdiction, and PREvention (EPIPRE) system developed in the Netherlands for winter wheat that focused on multiple pathogens. USPEST.org graphs risks of various plants diseases based on weather forecasts with hourly resolution of leaf wetness. Forecasting models are often based on a relationship like simple linear regression where x is used to predict y. Other relationships can be modelled using population growth curves. The growth curve that is used will depend {{on the nature of the}} epidemic. Polycyclic epidemics such as potato late blight are usually best modelled by using the logistic model, whereas monocyclic epidemics may be best modelled using the monomolecular model. [...] Correct choice of a model is essential for a <b>disease</b> <b>forecasting</b> system to be useful.|$|E
5000|$|Fungicides for {{the control}} of potato blight are {{normally}} only used in a preventative manner, optionally in [...] with <b>disease</b> <b>forecasting.</b> In susceptible varieties, sometimes fungicide applications may be needed weekly. An early spray is most effective. The choice of fungicide can depend {{on the nature of}} local strains of P. infestans. Metalaxyl is a fungicide that was marketed for use against P. infestans, but suffered serious resistance issues when used on its own. In some regions of the world during the 1980s and 1990s, most strains of P. infestans became resistant to metalaxyl, but in subsequent years many populations shifted back to sensitivity. To reduce the occurrence of resistance, it is strongly advised to use single-target fungicides such as metalaxyl along with carbamate compounds. A combination of other compounds are recommended for managing metalaxyl-resistant strains. These include mandipropamid, chlorothalonil, fluazinam, triphenytin, mancozeb and others. In the past, copper sulfate solution (called 'bluestone') was used to combat potato blight. Copper pesticides remain in use on organic crops, both in the form of copper hydroxide and copper sulfate. Given the dangers of copper toxicity, other organic control options that {{have been shown to be}} effective include horticultural oils, phosphorous acids, and rhamnolipid biosurfactants, while sprays containing [...] "beneficial" [...] microbes such as Bacillus subtilis or compounds that encourage the plant to produce defensive chemicals (such as knotweed extract) have not performed as well.|$|E
40|$|Global {{severity}} of potato late blight was estimated by linking two <b>disease</b> <b>forecast</b> models, Blitecast and Simcast, to a climate data base in a {{geographic information system}} (GIS). The <b>disease</b> <b>forecast</b> models indirectly estimate late blight severity by determining how many sprays are needed during a growing season {{as a function of}} the weather. Global zonation of estimated late blight severity was similar for both forecast models, but Blitecast generally predicted a lower number of sprays. With both forecast models, there were strong differences between potato production zones. Zones of high late blight severity include the tropical highlands, western Europe, the east coast of Canada and northern USA, south-eastern Brazil and central-southern China. Major production zones with a low late blight severity include the western plains in India, where irrigated potato is produced in the cool dry season, north-central China, and the north-western USA. Using a global GIS data base of potato production, the average number of sprays was calculated by country. These averages were compared with estimates of current fungicide use. The results using Blitecast and Simcast were correlated but only Blitecast estimates correlated with observed data for developed countries. The estimated number of sprays, whether from Blitecast or Simcast, did not correlate with the observed number of sprays in developing countries, and in a number of developing countries the predicted optimal number of sprays was much higher than the actual number observed. In these countries, increased access to host resistance and fungicides could have a strong economic impact...|$|R

40|$|International audienceYellow rust (YR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} diseases of wheat. To prevent the prevalence of the disease more effectively, it is important to forecast it at an early stage. To date, most <b>disease</b> <b>forecasting</b> models were developed based on meteorological data at a specific site with a long-term record. Such models allow only local disease prediction, yet have a problem to be extended to a broader region. However, given the YR usually occurs in a vast area, it is necessary to develop a large-scale <b>disease</b> <b>forecasting</b> model for prevention. To answer this call, in this study, based on several disease sensitive meteorological factors, we attempted to use Bayesian network (BNT), BP neural network (BP), support vector machine (SVM), and fisher liner discriminant analysis (FLDA) to develop YR forecasting models. Within Gansu Province, an important disease epidemic region in China, a time series field survey data that collected on multiple years (2010 - 2012) were used to conduct effective calibration and validation for the model. The results showed that most methods are able to produce reasonable estimations except FLDA. In addition, the temporal dispersal process of YR can be successfully delineated by BNT, BP and SVM. The three methods of BNT, BP and SVM are of great potential in development of <b>disease</b> <b>forecasting</b> model at a regional scale.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundA better {{characterization}} of the early growth dynamics of an epidemic is needed to dissect the important drivers of disease transmission, refine existing transmission models, and improve <b>disease</b> <b>forecasts.</b> Materials and methodsWe introduce a 2 -parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens in historic and contemporary populations, and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes. ResultsWe applied the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very slow growth (p= 0. 14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near exponential (p> 0. 9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918 pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided {{a unique opportunity to}} explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p= 0. 59, range: 0. 14 – 0. 97). The districts of Margibi in Liberia and Bombali and Bo in Sierra Leone had near-exponential growth, while the districts of Bomi in Liberia and Kenema in Sierra Leone displayed near constant incidences. ConclusionsOur findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon, especially for pathogens that are not airborne. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of “deceleration parameters” may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve <b>disease</b> <b>forecasts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Meteorological {{conditions}} are {{important factors in}} the development of fungal diseases in winter wheat and are the main inputs of the decision support systems used to <b>forecast</b> <b>disease</b> and thus determine timing for efficacious fungicide application. This study uses the Fourier transform method (FTM) to characterize temporal patterns of meteorological conditions between two neighbouring experimental sites used in a regional fungal <b>disease</b> monitoring and <b>forecasting</b> experiment in Luxembourg. Three meteorological variables (air temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation) were included, all conducive to infection of wheat by Zymoseptoria tritici cause of Septoria leaf blotch (STB) in winter wheat, from 2006 to 2009. The intraday, diurnal, dekadal and intra-seasonal variations of the meteorological variables were assessed using FTM, and the impact of existing contrasts between sites on the development of STB was analyzed. Although STB severities varied between sites and years (P ≤ 0. 0003), the results indicated that the two sites presented the same patterns of meteorological conditions when compared at larger temporal scales (diurnal to intra-seasonal scales, with time periods > 11 h). However, the intraday variations of all the variables were well discriminated between the sites and were highly correlated to STB severities. Our findings highlight and confirm the importance of intraday meteorological variation {{in the development of}} STB in winter wheat fields.
