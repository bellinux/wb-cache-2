5|$|The Second Crusade was {{announced}} by Pope Eugene III, {{and was the}} first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany, with help from a number of other European nobles. The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe. After crossing Byzantine territory into Anatolia, both armies were separately defeated by the Seljuk Turks. The main Western Christian source, Odo of Deuil, and Syriac Christian sources claim that the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos secretly hindered the crusaders' progress particularly in Anatolia, where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached Jerusalem and participated in 1148 in an ill-advised attack on Damascus. The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the Muslims. It would ultimately <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> influence on the fall of Jerusalem and give rise to the Third Crusade at the end of the 12th century.|$|E

A parcel locker for receipt of packages and a separate compartment for outgoing mail are usually built into the station. The mail carrier will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> to a large door on one side that reaches all the compartments, and the residents or tenants will each <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> to the door into their individual compartment on the other side.|$|E

Some BDO members <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> role in building the National People's Army, while others (like Seydlitz), were prosecuted as war criminals.|$|R

25|$|Fibers are {{terminated}} in connectors {{that hold}} the fiber end precisely and securely. A fiber-optic connector is basically a rigid cylindrical barrel surrounded by a sleeve that holds the barrel in its mating socket. The mating mechanism can be push and click, turn and latch (bayonet mount), or screw-in (threaded). The barrel is typically free to move within the sleeve, and may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> that prevents the barrel and fiber from rotating as the connectors are mated.|$|E
25|$|To {{say that}} they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> role to play is an understatement. Finance is {{connected}} to most, if not all, of the key business processes within the organization. It should be steering the stewardship and accountability systems that ensure that the organization is conducting its business in an appropriate, ethical manner. It is critical that these foundations are firmly laid. So often they are the litmus test by which {{public confidence in the}} institution is either won or lost.|$|E

25|$|Thymidine kinases <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> {{function}} in the synthesis of DNA and therefore in cell division, as {{they are part of}} the unique reaction chain to introduce thymidine into the DNA. Thymidine is present in the body fluids as a result of degradation of DNA from food and from dead cells. Thymidine kinase is required for the action of many antiviral drugs. It is used to select hybridoma cell lines in production of monoclonal antibodies. In clinical chemistry it is used as a proliferation marker in the diagnosis, control of treatment and follow-up of malignant disease, mainly of hematological malignancies.|$|E
25|$|According to {{professor}} Jan Arild Audestad, at the standardization process {{which started in}} 1982, A5/1 was originally proposed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> length of 128 bits. At that time, 128 bits was projected to be secure for at least 15 years. It is now believed that 128 bits would in fact also still be secure until the advent of quantum computing. Audestad, Peter van der Arend, and Thomas Haug says that the British insisted on weaker encryption, with Haug saying he {{was told by the}} British delegate that this was to allow the British secret service to eavesdrop more easily. The British proposed a key length of 48 bits, while the West Germans wanted stronger encryption to protect against East German spying, so the compromise became a key length of 54 bits.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} models of soprano {{saxophone}} that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> for high G, and most modern models of baritone saxophone have an extended bore and key to produce low A; {{it is also}} possible to play a low A on any saxophone by blocking the end of the bell, usually with the foot or inside of the left thigh. Low A keys however were not limited to just the baritone saxophone. For a short time Selmer Paris produced mark VI alto saxophones with the low A key. Notes above F are considered part of the altissimo register of any sax, and can be produced using advanced embouchure techniques and fingering combinations. Sax himself had mastered these techniques; he demonstrated the instrument as having a range of just beyond three octaves up to a (written) high B4. Modern saxophone players have extended this range to over 4 octaves on tenor and alto.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{alphanumeric}} keyboards have keys {{that are}} on three-quarter inch centers (0.750inches, 19.05mm), and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> travel of at least 0.150inches (3.81mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers {{and a variety of}} function keys. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the enter key is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard computer keyboard, although many manufacture imitate the keyboard of PCs. There are actually three different PC keyboard: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the enhanced keyboard with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of function keys, the control keys, the return key, and the shift key.|$|E
500|$|Tommy Smith, booked {{during the}} game for his tackle on Clarke, had been called to the hearing to give evidence. He {{condemned}} the whole affair as a farce. Smith confirmed that the initial foul on Keegan was committed by Johnny Giles, not Bremner, but Bremner was the first Leeds player Keegan saw {{when he turned to}} retaliate. Smith says that as soon as he came into the hearing, an unnamed FA official immediately accused him of starting all the trouble with his [...] "very first tackle of the game". Smith retorted that the man was not even at the game and so how could he know that? The FA official replied by saying: [...] "This is a democratic hearing of the evidence, you're not allowed to ask questions". Smith says he laughed out loud at the absurdity of that statement. At this point Matt Busby, who was on the FA committee, intervened and said: [...] "I saw what happened. That'll be all, Tommy, thanks for coming". Smith says he left the room [...] "wondering how it was possible that a person such as that committee member could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> role in the running of football in this country".|$|E

2500|$|During the occupation, the Germans {{constructed}} two 1700m concrete, {{all weather}} runways, aligned 05/23 and 10/28.

2500|$|Trip {{length and}} journey times are key factors {{affecting}} cycle use. Town planning may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> effect {{in deciding whether}} key destinations, schools, shops, colleges, health clinics, public transport interchanges remain within a reasonable cycling distance of the areas where people live. The urban form can influence these issues, compact and circular settlement patterns tending to promote cycling. Alternatively, the low-density, non-circular (i.e., linear) settlement patterns characteristic of urban sprawl tends to discourage cycling. In 1990, the Dutch adopted the [...] "ABC" [...] guidelines, specifically limiting developments that are major attractants to locations that are readily accessible by non-car users.|$|E
2500|$|Rising {{sea levels}} {{will reduce the}} {{stability}} of ice shelves, which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> role in reducing glacial motion. [...] Some Antarctic ice shelves are currently thinning by tens of metres per year, {{and the collapse of}} the Larsen B shelf was preceded by thinning of just 1metre per year. [...] Further, increased ocean temperatures of 1°C may lead to up to 10metres per year of basal melting. [...] Ice shelves are always stable under mean annual temperatures of −9°C, but never stable above −5°C; this places regional warming of 1.5°C, as preceded the collapse of Larsen B, in context.|$|E
