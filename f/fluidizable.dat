Among the various available coal-to-electricity pathways, IGCC power plants have the most potential with high thermal efficiency, simple system configuration, low emissions of SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x} and other contaminants, modular design, and low capital cost. Due to these advantages, the power plants of the 21 st century are projected to utilize IGCC technology worldwide.

The objective {{of this research was}} to develop sorbent-catalysts with the ability to simultaneously remove H{sub 2 }S and NH{sub 3 } from coal gas. Microreactor tests with HART- 49, a zinc-based sorbent-catalyst with Ni, Co, and Mo as catalyst additives, showed that this material had the potential to remove 90 % NH{sub 3 } and reduce H{sub 2 }S to < 20 ppmv at 1 atm and 550 to 700 C. HART- 49 was prepared in attrition-resistant <b>fluidizable</b> form (HART- 56) using up to 75 wt% binder.

Z-SORB sorbent is a ZnO-based regenerable sorbent for removing hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2 }S) and carbonyl sulfide (COS). RTI conducted a life-cycle test on this sorbent in the high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) semi-batch fluidized-bed reactor. This test consisted of 50 cycles of sulfidation and regeneration {{to demonstrate the}} long-term chemical reactivity and mechanical strength of the Z-SORB sorbent. A simulated air-blown gasifier coal gas was used at 20 atm and 538 {degree}C (1, 000 {degree}F). The Z-SORB sorbent exhibited excellent sulfur removal capability; the prebreakthrough H{sub 2 }S levels were below the detection limit of the analyzer (< 10 ppmv). The sulfur capacity of the sorbent at breakthrough (500 ppM H{sub 2 }S in reactor exit gas) was 20. 2 g S/ 100 g sorbent in Cycle 1 and was 10 g S/ 100 g sorbent in Cycle 50. The sorbent loss from the reactor due to fines generation was small. While no significant change in particle size was observed, the bulk density increased by 8 percent over 51 cycles. The attrition resistance of the sorbent after the 51 cycles was slightly lower than the fresh material. The thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) tests on fresh and reacted sorbents confirmed the sulfur capacity decline in the bench tests; however, the TGA data indicated {{no change in the}} H{sub 2 }S absorption rate between the fresh and reacted sorbents.

40|$|Advanced {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) power plants nearing completion, such as Sierra-Pacific, employ a circulating fluidized-bed (transport) reactor hot-gas desulfurization (HGD) process that uses 70 - 180 {micro}m {{average particle size}} (aps) zinc-based mixed-metal oxide sorbent for removing H{sub 2 }S from coal gas down to less than 20 ppmv. The sorbent undergoes cycles of absorption (sulfidation) and air regeneration. The key barrier issues associated with a fluidized-bed HGD process are chemical degradation, physical attrition, high regeneration light-off (initiation) temperature, and high cost of the sorbent. Another inherent complication in all air-regeneration-based HGD processes is the disposal of the problematic dilute SO{sub 2 } containing regeneration tail-gas. Direct Sulfur Recovery Process (DSRP), a leading first generation technology, efficiently reduces this SO{sub 2 } to desirable elemental sulfur, but {{requires the use of}} 1 - 3 % of the coal gas, thus resulting in an energy penalty to the plant. Advanced second-generation processes are under development that can reduce this energy penalty by modifying the sorbent so that it could be directly regenerated to elemental sulfur. The objective of this research is to support the near and long term DOE efforts to commercialize the IGCC-HGD process technology. Specifically we aim to develop: optimized low-cost sorbent materials with 70 - 80 {micro}m average aps meeting all Sierra specs; attrition resistant sorbents with 170 {micro}m aps that allow greater flexibility in the choice of the type of fluidized-bed reactor e. g. they allow increased throughput in a bubbling-bed reactor; and modified <b>fluidizable</b> sorbent materials that can be regenerated to produce elemental sulfur directly with minimal or no use of coal gas The effort during the reporting period has been devoted to development of an advanced hot-gas process that can eliminate the problematic SO{sub 2 } tail gas and yield elemental sulfur directly using a sorbent containing a combination of zinc and iron oxides...|$|E

The DSRP reacts the regeneration offgas with a small slipstream of coal gas to effect the desired reduction. In this project the DSRP was demonstrated with actual coal gas (as opposed to the simulated laboratory mixtures used in previous studies) in a 75 -mm, 1 -L size fixed-bed reactor. Integrated with this testing, a US Department of Energy/Research Triangle Institute (DOE/RTI) patented zinc titanate-based <b>fluidizable</b> sorbent formulation was tested in a 75 -mm (3 -in.) diameter fluidized-bed reactor, and the regeneration offgas from that test was treated with the bench-unit DSRP. The testing was conducted at the DOE Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC) -Morgantown in conjunction with test campaigns of the pilot-scale gasifier there. The test apparatus was housed in a mobile laboratory built in a specially equipped office trailer that facilitated moving the equipment from RTI in North Carolina to the West Virginia test site. A long duration test of the DSRP using actual coal gas and simulated regeneration offgas showed no degradation in efficiency of conversion to elemental sulfur after 160 h of catalyst exposure. An additional exposure (200 h) of that same catalyst charge at the General Electric pilot gasifier showed only a small decline in performance. That problem is believed to have been caused by tar and soot deposits on the catalyst, which were caused by the high tar content of the atypical fixed-bed gasifier gas.

In this work, a screening of different commercial supports in <b>fluidizable</b> particle size for impregnated Mn-based materials has been carried out. Different oxygen carriers have been prepared by incipient impregnation on ZrO 2, and CaAl 2 O 4, and evaluated {{with respect to their}} mechanical resistance, fuel gas reactivity and fluidization properties such as agglomeration and attrition rate. In a first step, particles showing high enough crushing strength values were selected for the reactivity investigation. The redox reactivity was evaluated through TGA experiments at suitable temperatures for the CLC process (i. e. 850 - 950 °C) using H 2, CO and CH 4. Multi cycle redox analysis and full physical and chemical characterization was also performed. In a second step, materials with high enough reactivity were prepared for fluidized bed evaluation. A batch fluidized bed installation with continuous gaseous fuel feed was used to analyze the product gas distribution during reduction and oxidation reactions at different operation temperatures, and agglomeration and attrition behavior of the selected materials. Results showed that an oxygen carrier impregnated using ZrO 2 as support, had high enough reactivity and low attrition rate.

Recently, DOE/NETL launched an alternative CO{sub 2 } mitigation program focused on beneficial CO{sub 2 } reuse to support the development of technologies that mitigate emissions by converting CO{sub 2 } into valuable chemicals and fuels. RTI, with DOE/NETL support, has been developing an innovative beneficial CO{sub 2 } reuse process for converting CO{sub 2 } into substitute natural gas (SNG) by using by-product hydrogen (H{sub 2) -containing fuel gas from petrochemical facilities. This process leveraged commercial reactor technology currently used in fluid catalytic crackers in petroleum refining and a novel nickel (Ni) -based catalyst developed by RTI. The goal was to generate an SNG product that meets the pipeline specifications for natural gas, making the SNG product completely compatible with the existing natural gas infrastructure. RTI's technology development efforts focused on demonstrating the technical feasibility of this novel CO{sub 2 } reuse process and obtaining the necessary engineering information to design a pilot demonstration unit for converting about 4 tons per day (tons/day) of CO{sub 2 } into SNG at a suitable host site. This final report describes the results of the Phase I catalyst and process development efforts. The methanation activity of several commercial fixed-bed catalysts was evaluated under fluidized-bed conditions in a bench-scale reactor to identify catalyst performance targets.
