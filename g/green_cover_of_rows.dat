40|$|Devido ao aumento no custo de produção com a utilização de cobertura morta com capim nas ruas da videira 'Niagara Rosada' e à dificuldade para sua aquisição, objetivou-se a possibilidade de substituí-la por plantas de cobertura intercalares. Em experimentos realizados em Indaiatuba e Jundiaí-SP, de 1999 - 2000 a 2003 - 2004, instalaram-se seis tratamentos nas entrelinhas, em blocos ao acaso e quatro repetições, constando de área no limpo; vegetação espontânea roçada; cobertura com capim seco de Brachiaria decumbens; cobertura verde de aveia preta (Avena strigosa); cobertura verde de chícharo (Lathyrus sativus); cobertura verde de tremoço (Lupinus albus), de março a outubro, seguidas de cobertura verde de mucuna anã (Mucuna deeringiana) de outubro a março. Determinaram-se massa, comprimento e largura do cacho, engaço e bagas, número total de bagas por cacho e diâmetro do pedicelo de bagas, comparando-se os valores médios pelo teste de Duncan ao nível de 5 %. Na média dos anos, os resultados com a cobertura verde foram similares ou mais favoráveis que os da cobertura com braquiária seca, podendo-se substituí-la por coberturas vegetais intercalares com gramínea e leguminosas, o ano todo, sem interferência negativa na qualidade {{comercial}} dos frutos. Grape vineyard in Southern Brazil utilize a {{large amount}} of mulch during autumn-winter season demanding extra efforts and costs, being its acquisition very difficult nowadays. In order to evaluate the possibility of replacing the tradicionally mulch by <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> species in the inter-row strip, two experiments were carried out in Indaiatuba and Jundiaí, SP, Brazil, from 1999 / 00 to 2003 / 04, with the table variety Niagara Rosada. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications and six treatments: 1) no weeded area; 2) cut spontaneous local vegetation; 3) mulch of Brachiaria decumbens; 4) <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> Avena strigosa from March to October followed by <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> Mucuna deeringiana from October to March; 5) <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> Lathyrus sativus from March to October followed by <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> M. deeringiana from October to March; and 6) Lupinus albus from March to October followed by <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> M. deeringiana from October to March. The weight, lengh and width of cluster, rachis and berries of grape, the total number of berries and its pedicel diameter were evaluated. The average values were compared by Duncan test at the level of 5 %. The results of all characteristics obtained with the <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> crops were equal or more favorable than those ones using grass mulch cover (B. decumbens), being possible to utilize green manure crops in the inter-rows of grape vineyard without any negative interference on some commercial characteristics of grape fruits...|$|R

40|$|Kentucky {{bluegrass}} (Poa pratensis L.) is {{a widely}} used, high-quality, sod-producing turfgrass. To maintain an {{acceptable level of quality}} and function requires irrigation in the semiarid regions of the western United States. Landscape water use, however, is coming under increased scrutiny, and reducing water inputs is a goal of many municipalities. To identify Poa germplasm that maintains green color under deficit irrigation over summer seasons, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the percent <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> 24 Kentucky bluegrass cultivars, accessions (including core collections), and other Poa species. Cultivars generally had a higher percent <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> in spring and fall, while several accessions and old U. S. cultivars showed higher <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> during summer months. Other Poa species did not have percent <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> values above any cultivars and as a group consistently performed the lowest. Core collections of Kentucky bluegrass, aimed at representing overall variability of the species with fewer accessions, had variance estimates equal to or higher than the overall group of accessions. Seven cultivars and accessions consistently had higher percent <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> than the Midnight cultivar check during the August data collection dates, highlighting the potential to improve Kentucky bluegrass <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> over summer seasons under deficit irrigation...|$|R

It sloped down into a wide hollow and up another bare slope. The ground was littered with bleached logs, trees that had been killed first by fire and then felled by wind. Here and there a lofty, spectral trunk still withstood the blasts. Across the hollow sloped a considerable area where all trees were dead and still standing--a melancholy sight. Beyond, and far round and down to the left, opened up a slope of spruce and bare ridge, where a few cedars showed dark, and then came black, spear-tipped forest again, leading the eye to the magnificent panorama of endless range on range, purple in the distance.|$|R

The Konkan on the windward side is also endowed with heavy rainfall, declining northwards. East of the Sahyadri, the rainfall diminishes to a meagre 70 cm. in the western plateau districts, with Solapur-Ahmednagar lying {{in the heart of}} the dry zone.

In an hour or two she would come back as usual, say [...] "Oh, Gee!" [...] in a tired sort of voice, and then Bill the parrot's day proper would begin. He was a bird who liked the sound of his own voice, and he never got the chance of a really sustained conversation till Nelly returned in the evening.|$|R
