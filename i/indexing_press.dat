5000|$|In this {{category}} {{the questions are}} all about free access to media and its protection. Here the MSI specifies the protection against economic threats and law restrictions. Whereas the Freedom of the <b>Press</b> <b>Index</b> just asks about it in general. The MSI also makes a distinction between local and international sources and only the Freedom of the <b>Press</b> <b>Index</b> differentiates between official and unofficial sources.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{estimates}} of Reporters Without Borders, India ranks 136th worldwide in <b>press</b> freedom <b>index</b> (<b>press</b> freedom <b>index</b> for India is 39.33 for 2007). The Indian Constitution, while not mentioning the word [...] "press", provides for [...] "the right to {{freedom of speech and}} expression" [...] (Article 19(1) a). However this right is subject to restrictions under subclause (2), whereby this freedom can be restricted for reasons of [...] "sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, preserving decency, preserving morality, in relation to contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to an offence".

5000|$|Only the Freedom of the <b>Press</b> <b>Index</b> differentiates {{between private}} and public payments. Overall the {{question}} about corruption is put more directly in the Freedom of the <b>Press</b> <b>Index</b> than in the MSI. The MSI asks in one question if the payment of journalists is high enough and if the quality standard of the journalists {{is good enough to}} prevent corruption. Put that way, the question concerning corruption seems less direct and aggressive in the MSI index.|$|R

50|$|Journalists are {{experiencing}} {{a period of}} relative freedom following the coup of 2005, which ended a military dictatorship. The laws governing media are the most liberal in the Sub-Saharan Africa region.

40|$|Abstract To {{elucidate}} the time course and processes underlying pre-movement modiWcation of planned actions, participants {{prepared to make}} an action {{at a time of}} their own choosing within a speciWed temporal window. In some conditions, participants prepared to make a single right <b>index</b> Wnger key <b>press,</b> whereas in others, they prepared to make a sequence of two key presses consisting of a right <b>index</b> Wnger key <b>press</b> followed by a right middle Wnger key press. On a proportion of trials, their internal preparation was interrupted by an auditory tone, in response to which they made either: the same action as they were intending, a diVerent action requiring an additional eVector (i. e. switch from preparing a single right <b>index</b> Wnger key <b>press</b> to exe-cuting a right index, middle Wnger sequence), or a diVerent action requiring one less eVector (i. e. switch from preparin...|$|R

5000|$|Both indices ask if {{everyone}} has the freedom to become a professional journalist. But MSI also raises the question if there are restrictions against or special laws in favour of freedom. The Freedom of the <b>Press</b> <b>Index</b> instead contains the question if professional groups {{have the freedom to}} support journalists. This is just one example {{for the fact that the}} MSI as well as the Freedom of the <b>Press</b> <b>Index</b> sometimes ask two questions in one, which makes it difficult for the panelists to score.|$|R
50|$|These freedoms are {{generally}} respected {{in practice and}} the press is considered relatively free. Laws concerning the media and political control over its content {{are generally}} considered to be moderate and there is little evidence of repressive measures against journalists. In consequence, South Africa is ranked 39th in Reporters Without Borders' worldwide <b>index</b> of <b>press</b> freedom 2015-2016.|$|R

Titles falling into categories such as leftist/Marxist politics, gay/lesbian, and labor are particularly underrepresented in library holdings, as are titles that are newsletters or magazines. The impact of these low holdings rates on scholars, students, and archival library collections is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Freedom House does {{two major}} surveys every year - Freedom in the World, and Freedom of the Press.

Unlike the MSI, it covers every country in the world, but does not do so in depth (though still provides a brief analysis of each country).|$|R
