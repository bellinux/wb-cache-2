40|$|We {{investigate}} secure routing in ad hoc {{networks in}} which security associations exist only between {{a subset of}} all pairs of nodes. We focus on source routing protocols. We show that to establish secure routes, it is in general not necessary that security associations exist between all pairs of nodes; a fraction of security associations is su#cient. We analyze the performance of existing proposals for secure routing in such conditions. We also propose a new protocol, designed specifically for ad hoc networks with an <b>incomplete</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> security associations between the nodes. We call this protocol BISS: a protocol for Building Secure Routing out <b>of</b> an <b>Incomplete</b> <b>Set</b> <b>of</b> Security Associations.

40|$|The strong {{sequential}} core for two-stage economies with a possibly <b>incomplete</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> {{assets in}} period zero and trade in commodities in period one consists of those goods allocatioans {{that are in}} the classical core and moreover, after realization of the state of nature, in the endowments. The strong sequential core coincides with the classical core when all possible state-contigent contracts may serve as an asset. For finance economies it is shown that the strong sequential core is generically empty when there is an <b>incomplete</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> assets. Outside the <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> finance economies, we show that the strong sequential core can be empty even if there is an complete <b>set</b> <b>of</b> assets. If the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> constrained feasible allocations resulting from trading in assets, is enlarged to include also allocations outside the agents'comsumption sets, then a complete <b>set</b> <b>of</b> assets is sufficient for the equivalence of the resulting semi-strong sequential core and the classical core. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the completability <b>of</b> an <b>incomplete</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> m-row orthogonal Latin rectangles (MOLRm) from a set theoretical viewpoint. We {{focus on the}} case of two rows, i. e. MOLR 2, and deﬁne its independence system (IS) and the associated clutter of bases, which is the collection of all MOLR 2. Any such clutter gives rise to a unique clutter of circuits which is the collection of all minimal dependent sets. To decide whether an <b>incomplete</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> MOLR 2 is completable, it sufﬁces to show that it does not contain a circuit therefore full knowledge of the clutter of circuits is needed. For the IS associated with 2 -row orthogonal Latin rectangles (OLR 2) we establish a methodology based on the notion of an availability matrix to fully characterise the corresponding clutter of circuits. We prove that [...] ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCraniometric {{measurements}} {{represent a}} useful tool for studying the differentiation of mammal populations. However, the fragility of skulls often leads to incomplete data matrices. Damaged specimens or <b>incomplete</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> measurements are usually discarded prior to statistical analysis. We assessed the performance of two strategies that avoid elimination of observations: (1) pairwise deletion of missing cells, and (2) estimation of missing data using available measurements. The effect of these distinct approaches on the computation of inter-individual distances and population differentiation analyses were evaluated using craniometric measurements obtained from insular populations of deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner, 1845). In our simulations, Euclidean distances were greatly altered by pairwise deletion, whereas Gower's distance coefficient corrected for missing data provided accurate results. Among the different estimation methods compared in this paper, the regression-based approximations weighted by coefficients of determination (r(2)) outperformed the competing approaches. We further show that <b>incomplete</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> craniometric measurements can be used to compute distance matrices, provided that an appropriate coefficient is selected. However, the application of estimation procedures provides a flexible approach that allows researchers to analyse <b>incomplete</b> data <b>sets...</b>|$|R
