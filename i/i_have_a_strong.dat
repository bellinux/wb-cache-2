[...] The Hollenbeck {{school was a}} departure for Rosenheim, considered [...] "modern" [...] by many at the time. [...] Rosenheim was reluctant to acknowledge the school as modern and wrote the following in the April 1939 issue of The Architect and Engineer:"I do not consider the buildings particularly 'modern' although the administration and assembly hall units may possess something akin to the so-called 'contemporary' style. [...] Personally, I do not hesitate to express the fervent hope that 'modernistic' architecture is not a permanent trend. [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> feeling {{that the bulk of}} modern work we see the country over has very little claim to architectural beauty. [...] In fact I am inclined to doubt whether it can strictly be regarded as architecture. ... But whatever one chooses to call the style of my Hollenbeck School, it seemed to appeal to the Board of Education and its architect." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I won't lie {{and give}} you the clichéd line of 'I've been working towards this all my life since I was a child' and all that stuff. <b>I</b> knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very <b>strong</b> artistic side to me, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> passion towards music, but I never thought I'd make {{a career out of}} it one day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's <b>a</b> man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> liking for, {{though on}} many matters our {{points of view}} were opposite. However, I dare say it's {{something}} {{to be thankful for}} that we're not all made alike." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{try to be}} just--it's {{sometimes}} hard." [...] His voice <b>had</b> <b>a</b> throb of pain in it as he went on: [...] "I was {{the friend}} of George Gladwyne--the one who perished. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> regard for him." ...|$|R

60|$|Lastly, <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> {{written to}} you--as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{inclination}} to do, {{and ought to}} have done, immediately after reading the book--but for a weak reason; of all {{things in the world}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost heart in one--I hope no other--I cannot, times out of calculation, make up my mind to write a letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I 've {{always been}} fond of you, my Polly, but I never {{realized}} how fond till just before I went away. I was n't free, you know, and besides <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> impression that you liked Sydney {{in spite of}} the damper which Fan hinted you gave him last winter. He 's such a capital fellow, I really don't see how you could help it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{taste for}} angling, and would sit {{for any number}} of hours on the bank of a river or pond {{watching}} the float; when at Maer (The house of his uncle, Josiah Wedgwood.) I was told that I could kill the worms with salt and water, and from that day I never spitted a living worm, though at the expense probably of some loss of success.|$|R
6000|$|... "And indeed, now I think again, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{impression}} that I have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and fellow-Sheep, who spoke {{of himself as}} pasturing in the country prisons; who was he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{this house}} can be stockaded in, {{in the time}} you mention; and, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{reluctance}} to leave the family before it is in security, with your permission I will remain and superintend the work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Being a woman, sir, I'm {{naturally}} of an inquiring turn; and I {{must confess}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{desire to know}} how it happens that you take your walks abroad, when you are supposed to be permanently engaged at home?' ...|$|E

"No doubt--no doubt," [...] {{answered}} the first; [...] "romance always finds votaries among young people, and this place may well excite romantic feelings {{in those who}} are older than these young men. Do you know, gentlemen, that ever since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known this island, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> desire to pass the remainder of my days on it? The idea <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just mentioned to you, therefore, {{is by no means}} one of a moment's existence." ...|$|R

Konop's father, Alan Sanford Konop, {{who was born in}} Michigan is a Toledo lawyer. His mother, Barbara Jane (Welch) Konop, was born in Ohio. [...] "We talked about politics around the kitchen table," [...] Konop told The Blade. [...] "Obviously, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Democratic upbringing." [...] Konop volunteered for then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> interest," [...] I said, [...] "in {{tracing the}} lost remembrance which Mr. Candy {{was unable to}} recall. May I ask whether you can suggest to me any method by which I might assist his memory?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ambushments, and surprises, {{and night}} forages, {{especially}} when they include Goats' Passes, don't suit me at all. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> antipathy to everything {{in the way of}} warfare, save a fair field and no favour under the satisfactory light of the sun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, my dear, if I don't, so sure as I am {{a living}} woman, that man will tire {{me out and}} marry me, and I dislike him, and don't want to marry him. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> will, but his is of iron." ...|$|E

5000|$|Scanlan {{has been}} HIV-positive since 1983, and was {{diagnosed}} with AIDS in 1995. He said: [...] "I never want to imply that I lived because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> life drive than the people who died. I've lost {{so many people who}} I knew to be passionate and committed to their lives." [...] Scanlan emphatically credits his rebound to the anti-HIV drug cocktail, but says, [...] "It is absolutely true that your outlook contributes to your longevity. I chose to keep investing in my future — even when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no future." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Bunkhouse Vol.I: Anchor Black Tattoo was {{recorded}} at Regan's home studio using a four-track recorder {{and a single}} microphone. Regan noted, [...] "I did {{quite a bit of}} touring on my own earlier this year supporting Feist and although the rooms were big, I felt very much at home on the stage and after that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> instinct to get right down to the brass tacks, back to the essence of what is it that I do as a songwriter, so that’s what I’ve done." ...|$|R
6000|$|BROADBENT. Yes: I know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{sense of}} humor which {{sometimes}} makes people doubt whether I am quite serious. That is why I have always thought I should like to marry an Irishwoman. She would always understand my jokes. For instance, you would understand them, eh? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, certainly. We {{had better}} {{leave her alone}} in our present conversation. Not but what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> regard for her." [...] Mr. Prosper had surely not thought of the opening he might be giving as to a future career for Miss Tickle by such an assertion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Donald, my boy, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{desire to}} be alone--that is, to try if I cannot go {{the rest of the}} way without guidance; so, if you will just give me a little direction, I'll let you go home, and many thanks for coming thus far. Now, point out the landmarks." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{three of}} us were summoned to the {{tribunal}} in the study, where my father and my mother sat in judgment on what they termed 'this preposterous business.' In our morning senses our impressions were much more vague than at midnight, and we betrayed some confusion; but Griff and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> instinct of sheltering Clarence, and we stoutly declared the noises to be beyond the capacities of wind, rats, or cats; that the light was visible and inexplicable; and that though we had seen nothing else, we could not doubt that Clarence did.|$|R
60|$|There {{was clearly}} nothing {{for me to}} do now but to shake hands again and take my leave. Yet I was so much {{impressed}} with the unreality of the whole scene that when I reached the front door <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> impulse to return suddenly and fall in upon them in their relaxed and natural attitudes. They could not keep up this pose between themselves; and I half expected to see their laughing faces at the window, as I glanced up before wending my perilous way to the street.|$|R
5000|$|Ishiguro left Japan in 1960 {{at the age}} of 5 and did {{not return}} to visit until 1989, nearly 30 years later, as a {{participant}} in the Japan Foundation Short-Term Visitors Program. In an interview with Kenzaburō Ōe, Ishiguro acknowledged that the Japanese settings of his first two novels were imaginary: [...] "I grew up with <b>a</b> very <b>strong</b> image in my head of this other country, a very important other country to which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> emotional tie ... In England I was all the time building up this picture in my head, an imaginary Japan." ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR OLD JOE,--I {{knew you}} {{would be likely to}} {{graduate}} into an ass if I came away; and so you have--if you have stopped smoking. However, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> faith that it is not too late, yet, and that the judiciously managed influence of a bad example will fetch you back again.|$|E
6000|$|Stephen laughed. “At {{any rate}} it {{is a good}} excuse for getting back again; and indeed I am quite ready to do so, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> desire to see what Jacopo has been up to in our absence, and would be willing to make a wager with you that we don’t find him at the hut.” ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{sure you}} know that there is no man living more {{attached}} to you than I am.

6000|$|... "From the {{information}} of old miners, who pointed {{out some of}} the localities on the northern coast of California, and indicated the position of places in Oregon in which they had dug for gold, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> corroboration of <b>an</b> opinion which I stated in one of my late letters--that the Fraser River diggings were a continuation of the great goldfield of California. The same miners <b>had</b> <b>a</b> theory that these northern mines would be richer than any yet discovered, because the more northern portions of California are richer than the central and southern portions.|$|R
