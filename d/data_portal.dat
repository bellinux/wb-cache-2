40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for metadata reconciliation, curation and linking for Open Governamental <b>Data</b> <b>Portals</b> (ODPs). ODPs have been lately the standard solution for governments {{willing to put}} their public data available for the society. Portal managers use several types of metadata to organize the datasets, {{one of the most}} important ones being the tags. However, the tagging process is subject to many problems, such as synonyms, ambiguity or incoherence, among others. As our empiric analysis of ODPs shows, these issues are currently prevalent in most ODPs and effectively hinders the reuse of Open Data. In order to address these problems, we develop and implement an approach for tag reconciliation in Open <b>Data</b> <b>Portals,</b> encompassing local actions related to individual portals, and global actions for adding a semantic metadata layer above individual portals...|$|R
