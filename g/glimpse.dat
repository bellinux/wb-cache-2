5|$|Based on {{his work}} for the 60 Minutes reports plus further {{investigation}} on his own, Thompson wrote A <b>Glimpse</b> of Hell. The book was published by W. W. Norton & Company. Thompson's book was extremely critical {{of most of the}} Navy personnel involved in the investigation, concluding that the Navy had orchestrated a cover-up to conceal the true cause of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|By {{featuring}} {{the life of}} John of Lancaster from early childhood to young adulthood, Heyer conveys a full <b>glimpse</b> of medieval life – court intrigues {{as well as the}} lives of ordinary people are part of the story. Furthermore, while near to major historical players, John's apartness from power allows Heyer to create a fuller depiction of his life without having to change major historical events.|$|E
40|$|The current {{experiment}} investigated whether better-ear <b>glimpsing</b> {{can explain}} the spatial release achieved by normal-hearing adults when situations are high in informational masking. Both modeling and behavioral methods were used. The speech reception thresholds of 38 young adults were measured for co-located, spatially separated and two better-ear <b>glimpsed</b> conditions. In the better-ear <b>glimpsed</b> conditions the binaural signals were processed so that in each time-frequency segment, the signal with the better SNR (left or right ear) was presented diotically. To investigate the effect of widening auditory filters on better-ear <b>glimpsing,</b> adjacent frequency bands were combined {{in one of the}} better-ear <b>glimpsing</b> conditions. Twenty-two participants were tested with maskers high in informational masking, while 16 participants were tested with maskers lower in informational masking. The mean speech reception thresholds achieved in the <b>glimpsed</b> conditions were significantly worse than in the spatially separated condition. This suggests that better-ear <b>glimpsing</b> can explain some but not all of the observed spatial release from masking. The difference between performance in the spatially separated and <b>glimpsed</b> conditions was largest when informational masking was high, suggesting better-ear <b>glimpsing</b> may release energetic rather than informational masking. Reducing the number of frequency bands sampled had a small effect on performance. 9 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Just as the 1630s replica {{has proven}} to be an {{accurate}} copy of the lost original, the panorama {{has proven to}} be a surprisingly reliable historical document offering a rare and detailed <b>glimpse</b> of medieval Stockholm. The landscape and a great number of notable buildings are correctly rendered in such great detail, that historical censorship, misinterpretations, and later restorations have not prevented modern research from repeatedly corroborating the painting's accuracy.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from exile, Æthelbald of Mercia succeeded Coelred and afterwards endowed {{the church at}} Crowland. Ælfwald's friendly stance towards Æthelbald helped to maintain peaceful relations with his more powerful neighbour. The Life of Guthlac, which includes information about Æthelbald during his period of exile at Crowland, is dedicated to Ælfwald. Later versions of the Life reveal the high quality of written Old English produced in East Anglia during Ælfwald's reign. He was a literate and devoutly Christian king: his letter written to Boniface in around 747 reveals his diplomatic skills and gives a rare <b>glimpse</b> {{into the life of}} a ruler who is otherwise shrouded in obscurity.|$|E
