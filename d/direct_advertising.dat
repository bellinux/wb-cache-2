40|$|We {{consider}} a market where a single seller must employ informative advertising {{to launch a}} new product of observable quality. The monopolist may use mass, targeted or customer <b>directed</b> <b>advertising.</b> We show that the choice of advertising strategy depends on the economic properties of the advertising technology. If this exhibits strong economies of targeting, customer <b>directed</b> <b>advertising</b> arises in equilibrium. Mass and targeted advertising arise under conditions that seem empirically quite restrictive. We also show that different advertising strategies have a bearing on the market outcome. While under mass and targeted advertising the price-quality choice of the monopolist equals that under full information, under customer <b>directed</b> <b>advertising</b> the seller brings fewer units to the market, and distorts {{the quality of the}} product and the price in a direction that depends on the nature of product quality...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a market where a single seller must employ informative advertising {{to launch a}} new product of observable quality. We formulate a fairly general advertising technology {{that allows us to}} study three promotional strategies —mass, targeted and customer <b>directed</b> <b>advertising.</b> We show that when the advertising technology exhibits strong economies of targeting, property that we find empirically plausible, both the private and social incentives to use distinct advertising strategies coincide and sales are promoted through customer <b>directed</b> <b>advertising.</b> This explains the reported correlation between economies of targeting and the use of customer <b>directed</b> <b>advertising</b> by the marketing managers. Further, the social planner reduces quantity and downgrades quality, whereas the monopolist sometimes upgrades the latter, as compared to the full information benchmark. This relationship between advertising strategy and product design strategy is novel in the literature and has interesting implications for social welfare. JEL Classification: L 12; L 15; M 3...|$|R

50|$|The Internet {{has made}} it easier for {{marketing}} managers to measure the results of a campaign. This is often achieved by using a specific website landing page directly relating to the promotional material. A call to action will ask the customer to visit the landing page, and the effectiveness of the campaign can be measured by taking the number of promotional messages distributed and dividing it into the number of responses. Another way to measure the results is to compare the projected sales or generated leads for a given term with the actual sales or leads after a <b>direct</b> <b>advertising</b> campaign.|$|E
50|$|Coffeeshops are {{no longer}} allowed to sell alcohol. Most coffeeshops advertise, and the {{constraint}} is more moderating than outright prohibitive. In a gesture of discretion still technically required, many coffeeshops keep the cannabis menu below the counter, even when the cannabis itself is in more-or-less plain view. Dutch coffeeshops often fly green-yellow-red Ethiopian flags, other symbols of the Rastafari movement, or depiction of palm leaves to indicate that they sell cannabis, {{as a consequence of}} the official ban on <b>direct</b> <b>advertising.</b> This aesthetic attracts many public artists who may be paid to create murals in the coffeeshops and use the Rastafari and reggae related imagery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>advertising</b> of mentholated tobacco {{products}} has had detrimental {{effects on the}} usage of cigarettes within the African American community. Advertising practices have been successful, {{and as a result of}} such targeting practices, the average African American adult has been exposed to about 892 ads and the youth, 559 ads. In addition, among both adult and youth smokers, Newport, Kool and Marlboro are the most popular brands. Moreover, about 42% of black adults smoke Newport, while 84% of young African Americans smoke this brand as well. This clearly shows the aggressive, targeted advertisement of mentholated cigarettes by tobacco companies has paid off. African Americans are the top consumer of all mentholated products.|$|E

40|$|With {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} full-color digital presses {{in the commercial}} printing industry, personalization has been enabled to create one-to-one marketing communication to enhance the effectiveness of print media advertising. Prior researches showed an increase in response rates with data-driven personalized direct mailings. However, the impact of image personalization on response rate of <b>direct</b> mail <b>advertising</b> is still unknown. This research used an experimental design to test the impact of image personalization on response rate of <b>direct</b> mail <b>advertising.</b> A <b>direct</b> mail postcard campaign was created with three levels of personalization (black-and-white name-only personalization, full-color name-only personalization, full-color name and image personalization) {{to test the hypothesis}} that there are no statistically significant differences between the response rates of <b>direct</b> mail <b>advertising</b> with name-only personalization and with image personalization. The Cost Per Response (CPR) for three levels personalization was also observed. The experimental results showed that the response rates for postcard with full-color name and image personalization was 2. 6 %, and 3. 0 % for full-color name-only personalization. There were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} levels personalization. Black-and-white name-only personalization postcard turned out to be the most cost effective <b>direct</b> mail <b>advertising</b> with a CPR of $ 20. 50 USD, lower than both full-color name-only personalization ($ 26. 33 USD), and full-color name and image personalization ($ 30. 07 USD) postcard in this case. The reasons for observing these results include consumer behavior towards personalized <b>direct</b> mail, <b>advertising</b> objective, postcard design, product category, timing, and limitations of the experiment. Based on the results, commercial printing companies, especially those provide marketing services need to make a Return-On-Investment (ROI) analysis before recommending the <b>direct</b> mail <b>advertising</b> campaign involving image personalization...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} informative advertising in which a firm builds a database using its historical sales records in order to directly target ads on those consumers who have a high probability of purchasing its products. We show that the firm can use this type of <b>direct</b> <b>advertising</b> as a screening mechanism to identify high demand consumers. As a result, <b>direct</b> <b>advertising</b> can work essentially as a device to increase a firm’s monopoly power. From a social point of view, this implies that the transition from traditional mass-advertising to <b>direct</b> <b>advertising</b> can generate a trade-off between higher advertising efficiency and greater monopoly power. We compute the model {{to shed light on}} the relative strength of these two forces, and find that while <b>direct</b> <b>advertising</b> might have a substantial negative impact on consumers, this advertising technology can only occasionally reduce welfare.
