By August 2008, all work rebuilding Cikobia after Cyclone Daman had been completed.|$|E

The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, {{in the absence of an}} alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on <b>external</b> <b>assistance.</b> Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy.|$|E

30|$|Specially, we {{consider}} a cooperative multiple-access communication {{scenario in which}} multiple source nodes communicate with the common destination with multiple half-duplex relays. Such a communication pattern is an important building block in wireless VANETs. For example, some proposals of intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) have introduced a variety of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside-infrastructure communications. In this case, cooperation can take place between vehicles or between vehicles and roadside stations. When some vehicles wish to send messages to a common roadside base-station, they can cooperate {{with each other and}} also obtain <b>external</b> <b>assistances</b> from more powerful roadside stations with multiple antennas.|$|R

25|$|Industry {{received}} little <b>external</b> <b>assistance</b> {{from the end}} of the war through 1995. Beginning in 1996-97, the government has become increasingly active in helping the industrial sector to restore production through technical and financial assistance, including loan guarantees, economic liberalization, and the privatization of state-owned enterprises. In early 1998, the government set up a one-stop investment promotion center and implemented a new investment code that created an enabling environment for foreign and local investors. An autonomous revenue authority also has begun operation, improving collections and accountability.|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{repeated}} small explosions, the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, {{and the possibility}} of larger explosions led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. During {{the early days of the}} accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for radiation safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling. The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered <b>external</b> <b>assistance.</b> Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.|$|E
25|$|India's {{reliance}} on <b>external</b> <b>assistance</b> and concessional debt has decreased since liberalisation of the economy, and the debt service ratio decreased from 35.3% in 1990–91 to 4.4% in 2008–09. In India, external commercial borrowings (ECBs), or commercial loans from non-resident lenders, are being permitted {{by the government}} for providing an additional source of funds to Indian corporates. The Ministry of Finance monitors and regulates them through ECB policy guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999. India's foreign exchange reserves have steadily risen from $5.8billion in March 1991 to $318.6billion in December 2009. In 2012, the United Kingdom announced an end to all financial aid to India, citing the growth and robustness of Indian economy.|$|E
25|$|During the Byzantine times Patras {{continued}} {{to be an important}} port as well as an industrial center. In 551 AD it was laid in ruins by an earthquake. In 807 AD it was able without <b>external</b> <b>assistance</b> to repulse a Slavonian siege, though most of the credit of the victory was assigned to St Andrew, whose church was enriched by the imperial share of the spoils, and whose archbishop was made superior of the bishops of Methone, Lacedaemon and Corone. Besides, one of the most scholarly philosophers and theologians of the time, Arethas of Caesarea was born at Patras, at around 860. In the 9th century there is a sign that the city was prosperous: the widow Danielis from Patras had accumulated immense wealth in land ownership, carpet and textile industry and offered critical support in the ascent of Basil I to the Byzantine throne.|$|E

On 26 August, the WHO shut down one of two laboratories after a health worker became infected. The laboratory was situated in the Kailahun district, one of the worst-affected areas.
