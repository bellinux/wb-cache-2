50|$|The Fend Flitzer was a {{three-wheeled}} <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> {{designed and}} built by Fritz Fend. The Flitzer established many of the basic concepts on which Fend's later Messerschmitt Kabinenroller microcars were developed.|$|R

25|$|Messerschmitt, {{temporarily}} {{not allowed}} to manufacture aircraft, had turned its resources to producing other commodities. In 1952, Fend approached Messerschmitt {{with the idea of}} manufacturing small motor vehicles. These were based on his Fend Flitzer <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s he was {{commissioned}} to do designs for specialist car production companies. These included the Jimp, {{a kind of}} mini Land Rover look alike, and the Salamander, intended {{as a replacement for}} the AC Cars <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Messerschmitt KR175 microcar (1953â€“1955) was {{the first}} vehicle built by Messerschmitt under its 1952 {{agreement}} with Fritz Fend. In concept, although not in actual design, it was an extended version of the Fend Flitzer <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b> Approximately 15,000 were built before it {{was replaced by the}} Messerschmitt KR200 in 1956.|$|R
50|$|Fend then {{designed}} the Flitzer, a larger, better-enclosed <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b> It was designed {{from the start}} to be powered by a gasoline engine. Whereas the earlier tricycle was both steered and powered by a single front wheel, the Flitzer {{had a pair of}} front wheels linked to the steering mechanism and a powered rear wheel.|$|R
25|$|When Tom Buxton was {{appointed}} Governor of South Australia, Kingston was angry {{that the government}} had not been involved in the decision about who should be the new Governor, so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family.

5000|$|In the UK {{mobility}} scooters {{are widely}} available with government subsidy under the Motability scheme. They are legally classified by the Use of <b>Invalid</b> <b>Carriages</b> on Highways Regulations 1988 as either Class II or Class III <b>Invalid</b> <b>Carriages</b> for legal purposes. A Class II scooter must be limited to 4 mph for use on a footway only, while a Class III scooter must be limited to 8 mph for road/highway use and have an additional 4 mph limiter for footway use. [...] a government consultation is under way {{to determine how the}} law should adapt to increasing scooter use, whether higher road speeds should be allowed and on a replacement for the archaic term [...] "invalid carriage". Due to concerns over safety issues and problems with bringing prosecutions against irresponsible users under existing laws, the consultation will also consider whether to make third party insurance mandatory, consider the introduction of compulsory training for users and discuss how to bring scooter users under wider road traffic legislations.|$|R
50|$|Fend then {{designed}} and built the Fend Flitzer, an <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> designed from the start to be powered by an engine. He reversed the layout of his original tricycle, giving the Flitzer two front wheels and one rear wheel. As with usual convention, the front wheels were steered while the rear wheel was powered. About 250 Flitzers were built between 1948 {{and the end of}} production in 1951.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, Fend, {{a former}} aeronatical {{engineer}} and technical {{officer in the}} Luftwaffe, began production of a tricycle <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> in his workshop in Rosenheim, Germany. The tricycle had a front wheel that was steered by handlebars and powered by a mechanism actuated by pushing {{back and forth on}} the handlebars. Shortly afterward, it was offered with a [...] Victoria two-stroke proprietary engine normally used for motorizing bicycles.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{discussed}} that robots with similar characteristics to <b>invalid</b> <b>carriages</b> (e.g. 10mph maximum, limited battery life) might be a workaround for certain classes of applications. If the robot was sufficiently intelligent and able to recharge itself using existing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure it would only need minimal supervision and a single arm with low dexterity might be enough to enable this function if its visual systems had enough resolution.|$|R
5000|$|After the Second World War, Fend, who {{had been}} a {{technical}} officer with the Luftwaffe, opened a workshop in Rosenheim, Germany. In 1948, he devised an <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> {{in the form of a}} tricycle. The front wheel of the tricycle was powered by pushing the handlebars back and forth. Originally designed with bicycle wheels, it was redesigned with scooter wheels in order to make the carriage lower. Fend later made a version that was powered by a [...] Victoria two-stroke engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} company {{founded by}} Bert Greeves MBE was the Invacar company. Greeves was mowing the lawns {{of his home}} in Worcestershire {{when he had the}} idea of fitting the lawnmower engine to his disabled cousin's wheelchair and invented the Invacar. Invacar Ltd was set up and won a major contract to provide motorised three-wheeled <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> vehicles to the UK Government Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. in 1952 from a small factory in Church Road, Thundersley not far from Southend on Sea in Essex.|$|R
50|$|The Kabinenroller was {{designed}} and developed by Fritz Fend for Messerschmitt AG. Fend had earlier designed and built a series of unpowered and powered <b>invalid</b> <b>carriages,</b> leading up to his Fend Flitzer. Fend noticed that able-bodied people were buying Flitzers for use as personal transport. This led him {{to believe that a}} mass-produced two-seat version of the Flitzer would have a ready market. A search for a manufacturer interested in the project led him to Messerschmitt, who had him develop the project for production in their Regensburg factory.|$|R
50|$|About 250 Flitzers {{had been}} built when {{production}} stopped in 1951. Many of these <b>invalid</b> <b>carriages</b> had been bought by able-bodied individuals seeking basic personal transport. This led Fend {{to believe that there}} would be a mass-market for a larger, transport-oriented version of the Flitzer. Fend began to design and develop a two-seat vehicle similar in concept to the Flitzer. He also began looking for a manufacturer to mass-produce this vehicle. He came to an agreement with Messerschmitt for them to build Fend vehicles in their factory at Regensburg Part of the agreement was that the cars carried the Messerschmitt name, with Fend's new design being designated the Messerschmitt KR175.|$|R
50|$|Richard Symons's {{documentary}} {{recounts the}} origins and rise to racing history of the AC Cobra, the car requested by Carroll Shelby. The film details {{the history of the}} Cobra and Carroll Shelby's racing career from its humble beginnings to the 1959 victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Roy Salvadori at the wheel of an Aston Martin DBR1. The story goes on to explain Shelby's motivation to take on the might of Ferrari with the help of Ford and AC of England (who were then manufacturing <b>invalid</b> <b>carriages</b> as well as sports cars) and why Carroll Shelby had to retire from racing.|$|R
50|$|When Buxton was {{appointed}} governor, the Premier of South Australia, Charles Kingston was angry that the South Australian government {{had not been}} involved in the decision about who should be the new governor, so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family. The governor's allowance was reduced and customs duty was charged on their household items (including his wife's <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage).</b> Buxton took up the job anyway, and later was described as the most genial, sociable and common-sense governor, due to his gentle and unassuming friendliness. He visited gaols and hospitals, and showed genuine interest in Aboriginal culture during his time as governor. He eventually returned to England due to the ill health of his wife.|$|R
60|$|Next {{day they}} carried him off in an {{ambulance}} through the crowded Strand, and presently he found himself at Liverpool Street, where he was put into an <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b> He asked the orderly where he was going, but the man {{did not seem to}} know, or had forgotten the name. So troubling no more about it he took a dose of medicine as he had been ordered, and presently went to sleep, as no doubt it was intended that he should do. When he woke up again it was to find himself being lifted from another ambulance into a house which was very dark, perhaps because of the lighting orders, for now night had fallen. He was carried in a chair up some stairs into a very nice bedroom, and there put to bed by two men. They went away, leaving him alone.|$|R
60|$|Young {{children}} of her own class were not exactly what her dream of usefulness had devised; but she had already a decided theory of education, and began to read up with all her might, whilst taking the lead in all the details of house taking, servant hiring, &c., to which her regular occupations of night school in the evening and reading to the lacemakers by day, became almost secondary. In due time the arrival of the ship was telegraphed, a hurried and affectionate note followed, and, on a bright east-windy afternoon, Rachel Curtis set forth to take up her mission. A telegram had announced the arrival of the Voluta, and the train which would bring the travellers to Avonchester. The Homestead carriage was sent to meet them, and Rachel in it, to give her helpless cousin assistance in this beginning of English habits. A roomy fly had been engaged for nurses and children, and Mrs. Curtis had put under the coachman's charge a parcel of sandwiches, and instructed him to offer all the appliances for making her own into an <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Gendron Iron Wheel Company {{was founded}} in 1872 in Toledo, Ohio by Peter Gendron (born Pierre Gendron 1844-1910). Gendron {{produced}} wire wheels for baby carriages originally.

6000|$|... "Dr. Pearson {{brought a}} Dr. Leeds here with him this morning. He {{says he is}} very clever. His term as house surgeon at Guy's or St. Bartholomew's, I forget which, has just expired, and as he had not made any {{definite}} plans {{he was glad to}} accept the doctor's offer to take charge of my uncle. He seemed, from what little I saw of him, a pleasant man, and spoke in a cheerful voice, which will be a great thing for uncle. I should think that he is six or seven and twenty. Dr. Pearson said he was likely to become a very distinguished man in his profession some day. He is going to begin at once. He will not sleep here, but will spend most of his time here, partly because he wants to study the case, and partly because he wants uncle to get accustomed to him. He will travel down with us, which will be a great comfort to me, for there is no saying how uncle may stand the journey. I suggested that we should have another <b>carriage,</b> as the <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> has room for only one inside besides the patient, but he laughed, and said that he would ride on the box with Tom Roberts; there will be room for two there, as we are going to post down. Of course, you and your aunt will go down by train, and be there to meet us; it will make it so much brighter and more cheerful having you to receive us than if we had to arrive all alone, with no one to say welcome." ...|$|R
50|$|The American Junior {{was made}} by American Motor Vehicle Company of Lafayette, Indiana from 1916 to 1920.
