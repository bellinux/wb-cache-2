25|$|Gerber {{is used in}} PCB <b>fabrication</b> data. PCBs are {{designed}} on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The CAD systems output PCB <b>fabrication</b> data to allow <b>fabrication</b> of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board <b>fabrication</b> equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the <b>fabrication</b> data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.|$|E
