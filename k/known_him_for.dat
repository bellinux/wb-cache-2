25|$|Her husband became both sleepy and inattentive {{as he got}} older. The {{sleepiness}} led to a {{car accident}} where {{no one was hurt}} but Henry was charged with dangerous driving. He became obsessed by the Norwegian ballerina Gerd Larsen and he would refuse to travel with West but wanted to return to London to be with Larsen. West initially considered this to be purely her husband's infatuation, but she came to think that Larsen was driven by money. At her husband's funeral she had the upsetting problem of Larsen's request to be amongst the mourners, even though she had only <b>known</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> 18 months. Henry's will left £5,000 for Larsen.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have <b>known</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E
500|$|At the time, Spare {{had fallen}} into poverty, living in obscurity in a South London flat. Although making some money {{as an artist and}} art tutor, he was largely financially {{supported}} by his friend Frank Letchford, whom he affectionately referred to as his [...] "son". There was some animosity between Letchford and Grant, although it is apparent that Spare preferred the former, having <b>known</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> 12 years longer, and placing him first in his will. Grant desired a closer relationship, and in 1954 began signing his letters to Spare [...] "thy son." [...] Letchford claimed that Spare often told the Grants [...] "white lies... to boost a flagging ego." [...] Grant's first published work represented a brief [...] "appreciation" [...] of Spare's work that was included in a catalogue for the artist's exhibition held at Temple Bar in London in 1949.|$|E

No. You look like David Baddiel. Now kindly piss off". Kay Ribeiro from Heat said, [...] "We like new boy AJ. Not only is he a laugh [...] but he's providing light relief during [...] and 's split, which is making us sad." [...] Laura Morgan from All About Soap hoped that AJ would become a permanent character after his initial appearances. In October 2012, Allison Jones from Inside Soap said, [...] "AJ has proved the perfect tonic for a family almost constantly dogged with crisis [...] his tenacious ability to wind up Zainab never fails to entertain! AJ may have only been in Walford for a few months, but it already feels as if we've <b>known</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> ages." [...] She also called Sharma and Ganatra, [...] "a killer on-screen pairing". Nathan Bevan from Welsh newspaper Western Mail praised Sharma's role in EastEnders, naming {{him as one of}} [...] "50 things you should look forward to in Wales" [...] in 2013, saying, [...] "Anyone who injects a little sunshine into the 'Chekhov with a covered market' drudgery of EastEnders should be automatically given an Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting Award in our book. So well done Newport's very own Phaldut Sharma who, since arriving in Walford as Masood Ahmed's gregarious but aggro-magnet brother AJ, has helped break up the unrelenting, bicker-filled misery of Albert Square." [...] Bevan later said that Sharma has [...] "shaken up the residents of Walford as the wise-cracking, wheeler-dealing AJ Ahmed", adding, [...] "He's the gregarious, trouble-magnet who's brought some much needed sunshine to the sombre, squabble-filled soapiness of Albert Square." [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com said AJ was a [...] "find" [...] but thought the writers might not be sure {{what to do with the}} character. Vicky Prior from the Metro said AJ [...] "has lit up the square with his gently laddish behaviour." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had <b>known</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The only way I could would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And you beat up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E
