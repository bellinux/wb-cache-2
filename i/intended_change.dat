50|$|Typical {{levels of}} {{beryllium}} that industries may release {{into the air}} are {{of the order of}} 0.01 µg/m3, averaged over a 30-day period, or 2 µg/m3 of workroom air for an 8-hour work shift. Compliance with the current U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit for beryllium of 2 µg/m3 has been determined to be inadequate to protect workers from developing beryllium sensitization and CBD. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), which is an independent organization of experts in the field of occupational health, has proposed a threshold limit value (TLV) of 0.05 µg/m3 in a 2006 Notice of <b>Intended</b> <b>Change</b> (NIC). This TLV is 40 times lower than the current OSHA permissible exposure limit, reflecting the ACGIH analysis of best available peer-reviewed research data concerning how little airborne beryllium is required to cause sensitization and CBD.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{typically}} include headlamps {{and tail}} lights. Headlamps are white or selective yellow lights {{placed in the}} front of the vehicle, designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible. Many manufactures are turning to LED headlights as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional headlamps. Tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle's direction of travel to following drivers. White rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle's transmission has been placed in the reverse gear, warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards, or about to do so. Flashing turn signals on the front, side, and rear of the vehicle indicate an <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> of position or direction. In the late 1950s, some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars' speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements.|$|E
50|$|Melafopulos (2008) {{presented}} {{two modes}} or approaches to development communication: the monologic mode and the dialogic mode. The monologic mode {{is linked to}} the standpoint of ‘diffusion’ following the one-way model of communication. The purpose of this mode is to disseminate information and messages to persuade its recipients about the <b>intended</b> <b>change.</b> In short, communication is positioned to (1) inform and (2) persuade. In this model, the feedback is enhanced and canned allowing the sender to refine its persuasive message. On the other hand, dialogic mode is related with the participatory paradigm which follows a two-way communication model. It seeks to create a conducive environment where stakeholders are involved in all stages of the project from the definitions down to the implementation of solutions. This model seeks to make use of communication (1) to assess and (2) to empower. The use of dialogic communication paves the way for building of trust and understanding which is the key to participation and eventually for the empowerment {{of the people in the}} grassroots.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a letter}} to Joseph Ellicott in 1804, Hoops {{discusses}} the name Olean from the local Oil Springs and the Latin word oleum:Canandaigua, N.Y., April 15, 1804"To Joseph ELLICOTT, Esq., Batavia, New York.Dear Sir,―It was proposed to me at New York to drop the Indian name of Ischue or Ischua (it is also spelt other ways). Confusion might arise from the various spellings, of which to obviate all risk I have concluded so to do as proposed. The neighborhood of the oil spring suggests a name different in sound, though perhaps not different in meaning, which I wish to adopt,―it is [...] "Olean." [...] You will {{do me a favor}} by assisting me to establish this name. It may easily be done now by your concurrence. The purpose will be most effectually answered by employing the term, when occasion requires, without saying anything of an <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> of name. To begin, you will greatly oblige me by addressing the first letter you may have occasion to write to me, after I receive the survey, to the Mouth of Olean. The bearer being properly instructed, there will be thereafter no difficulty. Your co-operation in the matter (the effect of which, though not important in itself, may be so on account of precision) will oblige. Your servant, A. HOOPSThe Post Office recognized the new town as [...] "Olean Point". The site was surveyed by 1808, and a map from that year shows a basic street pattern that still survives, along with most of the modern street names. In 1823, the city is called Olean, without the [...] "Point", on county maps.|$|E
40|$|Landshypotek {{is today}} Sweden’s largest lending {{institution}} for land and forest owners with loan assets around 50 billion SEK. “Landshypotek AB” {{is owned by}} an economic association consisting of 52 000 members and has 19 offices all over Sweden. Its market share of first mortgage loans to land and forest owners is 38 percent. To be a member in Landshypotek ownership of land or forest are compulsory and the members have to place their mortgage in Landshypotek. Landshypotek’s equity for 2010 was barely 3, 4 billion SEK which has been built up through patronage refunds on the borrowers (members) interest payments. The members’ contributed capital constitutes just over 1 billion of the equity and the rest (2, 4 billion) is Landshypotek’s unallocated equity. The equity is enough to balance today’s lending but since the market is expanding a demand for capital and Landshypotek’s future growth strategy more equity is needed. Landshypotek is therefore considering introducing {{a change in the}} financial model {{at the beginning of the}} year 2012. In comparison with investor-owned firms, cooperatives are at a disadvantage in raising equity capital. The cooperative equity is not marketable because the distribution of earnings in cooperatives is based on patronage and not investment. As a result there are no incentives for non patrons to invest in a cooperative and cooperatives are therefore restricted to its members to raise equity. But members may be reluctant to increase their illiquid stake in a cooperative because of the non marketability of the equity. The possibility to raise equity through retained earnings may also be met with resistance from the cooperative’s members because it translates into higher costs and lower revenues for the patrons. The aim of the study is to answer the following questions, hence the issue is if Landshypotek’s members be negative towards increasing their illiquid stake? Is the <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> of contributed capital likely to reduce the risk of free-rider problems? Are members with a long time left in Landshypotek likely to be more positive towards the <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> of contributed capital than those with a short time left? Will members terminate their business relationship with Landshypotek due to the <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> of contributed capital? How will the <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> of contributed capital affect a member’s cost of capital? The thesis is conducted as a qualitative case study. The empirical material consists of qualitative research interviews with twelve members in Landshypotek and a study of four scenarios regarding the members’ cost of capital. The conclusion is that Landshypotek’s members will not be negative towards increasing their illiquid stake. The members, regardless of their expected time horizon, are also positive towards the <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> of contributed capital and the members with long time left in Landshypotek are more positive towards the possibility to actively contribute with capital. The <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> of contributed capital is likely to reduce the risk of free-rider problem. It is also revealed that the members will not terminate their business activities with Landshypotek due to the <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> of contributed capital as long as Landshypotek is meeting the objective of ten percent dividend on contributed capital. Finally, the <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> of contributed capital tends to increase the cost of capital for non investing members and decrease it for investing members...|$|E
40|$|Intellectual Capital Reporting (ICR) has {{garnered}} increasing {{attention as}} a new accounting technology that can engender significant organisational changes. However, when ICR was first recognised as a management fashion, the <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> it heralded in stable environments was criticised for having limited impact {{on the state of}} practice. Conceiving ICR through a lens predicated on the notion of discursive practice, we argue that ICR can enable substantive change in emergent conditions. We empirically demonstrate this process by following the implementation of ICR in one organisation through interviews, documents and observations over 30 months. The qualitative analysis of the data corpus shows how situated change, subtle but no less significant, can take place in the name of intellectual capital as actors appropriate ICR into their everyday work practices while improvising variations to accommodate different logics of action. The paper opens up a new avenue to examine the specific roles of ICR in relation to the types of change enacted. It thus demonstrates when and how ICR may transcend a mere management fashion and the <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> it sets in motion through altering organisational actors’ ways of thinking and doing within the confines of their organisation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{objective}} of the research was to align the 3 -part habit routine to intended organisational change initiatives that use discrete methodologies like Lean Six Sigma to achieve outcomes that are more successful than change initiatives deployed only from a technical systematic approach. Design/methodology/approach – An infield quantitative experiment designed to measure the longitudinal effects of mindfulness, organisational routines, and job satisfaction. Findings – This study does not provide empirical proof that the outcome to <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> initiative have improved with contextual cues over the predetermined time horizon. Research limitation/implications – The results suggest the 20 -day time horizon {{of the study was}} insufficient to establish automaticity.

40|$|Background: Trauma courses {{have been}} shown to improve {{clinical}} knowledge and patient outcomes. However, {{little is known about the}} individual drivers of change in practice amongst course participants in their home clinic environment. Methods: Front-line healthcare workers participated in a two-day Primary Trauma Care (PTC) course. Immediately after the course participants completed an evaluation survey on <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> in the management of trauma patients. Six months after the course, participants completed a survey on actual changes that had occurred. Results: A total of 451 participants were sampled, with 321 responding at 6 months, from 40 courses across East, Central and Southern Africa. The most commonly reported <b>intended</b> <b>change</b> was the adoption of an ABCDE/systematic approach (53 %). Six months after the course, 92. 7 % of respondents reported that they had made changes in their management, with adoption of an ABCDE/systematic approach (50. 0 %) remaining most common. 77 % of participants reported an improvement in departmental trauma management, 26 % reported an increase in staffing, 29 % an increase in equipment and 68 % of participants had gone on to train other healthcare workers in PTC. Conclusion: The findings suggest that PTC courses not only improve individual management of trauma patients but also but is also associated with beneficial effects for participants’ host institutions with regards to staffing, equipment and training...|$|E
