40|$|BACKGROUND Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) is frequently performed during follow-up {{in patients with}} known lumbar-disk herniation and persistent symptoms of sciatica. The association between findings on MRI and clinical outcome is controversial. METHODS We studied 283 patients in a randomized trial comparing surgery and prolonged conservative care for sciatica and lumbar-disk herniation. Patients underwent MRI at baseline and after 1 year. We used a 4 -point scale to assess <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> on MRI, ranging from 1 for "definitely present" to 4 for "definitely absent. " A favorable clinical outcome was defined as complete or nearly complete disappearance of symptoms at 1 year. We compared proportions of patients with a favorable outcome among those with a definite absence of <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> and those with a definite, probable, or possible presence of <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> at 1 year. The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve {{was used to assess}} the prognostic accuracy of the 4 -point scores regarding a favorable or unfavorable outcome, with 1 indicating perfect discriminatory value and 0. 5 or less indicating no discriminatory value. RESULTS At 1 year, 84 % of the patients reported having a favorable outcome. <b>Disk</b> <b>herniation</b> was visible in 35 % with a favorable outcome and in 33 % with an unfavorable outcome (P = 0. 70). A favorable outcome was reported in 85 % of patients with <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> and 83 % without <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> (P = 0. 70). MRI assessment of <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> did not distinguish between patients with a favorable outcome and those with an unfavorable outcome (area under ROC curve, 0. 48).

Local differences between hospitals may exist, but conferences, professional journals, and national boards for certification are mechanisms that should act to maintain homogeneity within a professional group. It could be expected that commonly utilized treatment approaches within a well defined group of sub-specialists should converge.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare a T 2 * {{weighted}} 2 D spoiled gradient echo multiecho sequence (MEDIC) with magnetization transfer saturation pulse versus lumbar myelography and postmyelographic {{computed tomography}} (pCT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 84 disk levels in 27 patients were examined. The vertebral bodies, intervertebral disks, neural foramina, cauda equina, ligamentum flavum, and narrowing of the spinal canal were investigated using an evaluation scale. In addition, the pCT and the MEDIC sequence were evaluated {{for assessing the}} narrowing of the neural foramina in a phantom study using a cadaver preparation of the lumbar spine. RESULTS: A total of 28 <b>disk</b> <b>herniations,</b> 11 cases of osteophytes narrowing the spinal canal or the neural foramina, and 7 spinal canal stenoses were detected. The pCT was significantly better in visualizing the cauda equina. The MEDIC sequence was significantly superior in visualizing {{the extension of the}} ligamentum flavum. No statistical differences between either image modality were found concerning assessment of the narrowing of the neural foramina and the spinal canal, nor regarding evaluation of the vertebral disk and the vertebral body. Measurements of the phantom study showed that the MEDIC sequence did not overestimate narrowing of the neural foramina. CONCLUSIONS: The T 2 * MEDIC sequence has proved to be as accurate as pCT in evaluating osteophytes and narrowing of the neural foramina.

40|$|Background and Objective: In {{addition}} to the ex-pected appearance of degenerated disks which be-come dehydrated, hydrated intervertebral disk herni-ations are sometimes encountered in radiologic prac-tice. This study was undertaken to evaluate the clini-cal manifestations and MRI findings of hydrated and dehydrated herniated intervertebral disks. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional single institution study included 73 patients with dehy-drated (group I) and hydrated (group II) lumbar <b>disk</b> <b>herniation.</b> The criteria for hydrated and dehydrated <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> was a subjective criteria compared to the normal signal of intervertebral disks. A herniated disk has been regarded to be hydrated if more than 2 / 3 of it was hypersignal in T 2 -weighted images, while more than 2 / 3 of a dehydrated disk was hy-posignal on T 2 -weighted images. Results: Mean weight of patients in group I was greater than patients in group II (69. 3 vs. 64. 2, P< 0. 05). In addition, patients in group I tend to be older than group II (35. 2 vs. 28. 9, P< 0. 05). Consider-ing physical activity, {{a greater number of}} patients in group II had intense physical activity compared to group I (25 % vs. 13. 2 % respectively, P< 0. 05).

Conclusion: Hydrated intervertebral <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> tends to be associated with younger age, lighter body weight, shorter duration of radicular pain and more intense physical activity compared to dehydrated in-tervertebral <b>disk</b> <b>herniation.</b> These findings may sug-gest other mechanisms rather than degenerative changes for hydrated <b>disk</b> <b>herniation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging findings {{in patients with}} acute whiplash injury with those in matched control subjects. Materials and Methods: In a prospective multicenter controlled study, from 2005 to 2008, 100 consecutive patients underwent 1. 5 -T MR imaging examinations of the cervical spine within 48 hours after a motor vehicle accident. Findings in these patients were compared {{in a blinded fashion}} with those in 100 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Four blinded independent readers assessed the presence of occult vertebral body and facet fractures, vertebral body and facet contusions, intervertebral <b>disk</b> <b>herniations,</b> ligamentum nuchae strains, ligamentum nuchae tears, muscle strains or tears, and perimuscular fluid. Accuracy (as compared with clinical findings) and interobserver reliability were calculated. Results: Accuracy of MR imaging and interreader reliability were generally poor (sensitivity, 0. 328; specificity, 0. 728; positive and negative likelihood ratios, 1. 283 and 1. 084, respectively). MR imaging findings significantly associated with whiplash injuries were occult fracture (P <. 01), bone marrow contusion of the vertebral body (P =. 01), muscle strain (P <. 01) or tear (P <. 01), and the presence of perimuscular fluid (P <. 01). While 10 findings thought to be specific for whiplash trauma were significantly (P <. 01) more frequent in patients (507 observations), they were also regularly found in healthy control subjects (237 observations).

T 1 -weighted, T 2 -weighted and diffusion weighted (DWI) MR images of 100 consecutive patients admitted to the spinal surgery service were assessed. ADC maps were generated from DWI images using Osyrix software. The ADC values and characteristic ADC maps were assessed in the regions of interest over the different pathological entities of the lumbar spine. The study included 452 lumbar vertebral segments available for analysis of ADCs. Characteristic ADC map features were identified for protrusion, extrusion and sequester types of lumbar <b>disk</b> <b>herniations,</b> spondylolisthesis, reactive Modic endplate changes, Pfirrmann grades of IVD degeneration, and compromised spinal nerves. Compromised nerve roots had significantly higher mean ADC values than adjacent (p < 0. 001), contralateral (p < 0. 001) or adjacent contralateral (p < 0. 001) nerve roots. Compared to the normal bone marrow, Modic I changes showed higher ADC values (p = 0. 01) and Modic 2 changes showed lower ADC values (p = 0. 02) respectively. ADC values correlated with the Pfirrmann grading, however differed from herniated and non-herniated disks of the matched Pfirrmann 3 and 4 grades. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of ADC mapping may provide additional useful information regarding the fluid dynamics of the degenerated spine and may complement standard MRI imaging protocol for the comprehensive assessment of surgical patients with lumbar spine pathology.

No laboratory data were obtained. The patient experienced several episodes of transient right ar...|$|E
40|$|Title of the thesis: Physiotherapeutic {{treatment}} of a patient with disc herniation at l 4 /l 5 Author: Falidas Konstantinos Work placement: Ustředni Vojenská Nemocnice in Prague. Summary In this bachelor thesis which was written and organized by myself, it is divided in two parts. The general part and the special part. The general part, which is the theoretical part, it includes all the anatomy of the lower back, specifically the vertebrae of the spine, the muscles, the lumbosacral plexus, joints, ligaments and fasciae of the lower back. The biomechanics of the lumbar spine and intervertebral disk. The kinesiology of the lumbar spine. Then, it is explained in details what is low back pain and <b>disk</b> <b>herniation.</b> Mentioning the common causes, etiology, symptoms, risk factors, physiotherapy examination, conservative and non-conservative treatment. The {{second part of the}} thesis, which it's the special part, it includes the whole case of my patient with low back pain due to <b>disk</b> <b>herniation.</b> In this parts it is also included the whole anamnesis/history of my patient, the whole examination (initial and final examination), and the therapy sessions which were 6. And finally the evaluation of the effect of the therapy sessions. Keywords Case study, low back pain, <b>disk</b> <b>herniation,</b> conservative treatment, [...] .

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} diagnostic findings, surgical technique, {{and outcome}} in 3 striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) {{with a history}} of paraparesis. Study Design: Case series. Animals: Skunks (n = 3) with paraparesis. Methods: Neurologic examination revealed upper motor neuron disease (T 2 -L 2) in 2 skunks and lower motor neuron disease (L 3 -S 3) in 1 skunk. Diagnostic imaging included radiography, myelography, CT, and MRI and confirmed intervertebral <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> (IVDH) in each skunk. Because initial treatment with pain medication and cage rest did not result in lasting improvement, spinal surgery was performed. Results: Hemilaminectomy (2 skunks) and dorsal laminectomy (1 skunk) was performed with removal of extruded diskmaterial. The skunks improved after surgery but all had minor residual neurologic deficits when examined at various times postoperatively. Conclusion: Thoracolumbar intervertebral <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> occurs in skunks, and must be included in the differential diagnosis of paraparesis...|$|E
40|$|Objectives This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with spinal stenosis and lumbar vertebral disk degeneration, and the correlation of diabetes with these diseases. Study Design This is a cross-sectional study. Methods This case–control study was performed during 2012 – 2014 with 110 patients suffering from lumbar spinal stenosis and 110 patients with lumbar <b>disk</b> <b>herniation,</b> who were diagnosed using clinical and radiological evidences. Additionally, 110 participants who were referred to the clinic and did not show clinical signs of degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine entered the study as a control group. Demographic data and medical histories of the patients were collected using checklists. Results A total of 50 patients (15. 2 %) were diagnosed with diabetes, which comprised 32 (29. 1 %) in the stenosis group, 7 (6. 4 %) in the lumbar <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> group, and 11 (10 %) in the control group. The prevalence of diabetes in women with spinal stenosis and women with lumbar <b>disk</b> <b>herniation</b> was 35. 9 % and 10. 3 %, respectively, whereas prevalence of diabetes in women was 10. 9 % in the control group. This difference was statistically significant in the spinal stenosis group {{in comparison with the}} controls (P < 0. 0001). Conversely, no significant difference was found in men. Conclusions There is an association between diabetes and lumbar spinal stenosis. Diabetes mellitus may be a predisposing factor for the development of lumbar spinal stenosis...|$|E
