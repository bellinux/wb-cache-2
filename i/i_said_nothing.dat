"What do {{the people}} who worked in those two World Trade Center towers, along with {{thousands}} of employees, women and men, have to do with war that is taking place in the Middle East? ? ... Therefore we condemned this act—and any similar act we condemn. ... <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about the Pentagon, meaning we remain silent. We neither favored nor opposed that act .... Well, of course, the method of Osama bin Laden, and the fashion of bin Laden, we do not endorse them. And many of the operations that they have carried out, we condemned them very clearly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russell was {{referenced}} in a 1956 {{episode of}} the Honeymooners. Ralph Kramden (played by Jackie Gleason) arrives home [...] "dead" [...] tired, vowing {{to go straight to}} bed after dinner, quipping, [...] "If Jane Russell were throwing a party upstairs, I wouldn't go!" [...] Later, Kramden becomes aware that his best friend and neighbor, Ed Norton, is in fact throwing a party upstairs and did not invite him. After being reminded by his wife, Alice, of his reluctance to attend even a party that Jane Russell were throwing, an insulted Kramden rants, [...] "I was talking about Jane Russell: <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about any party that Norton's running!" ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{afternoon}} of November, 1868, in the Park at Hawarden, I {{was standing by}} Mr. Gladstone holding his coat on my arm while he, in his shirt sleeves, was wielding an axe to cut down a tree. Up came a telegraph messenger. He took the telegram, opened it and read it, then handed it to me, speaking only two words, namely, 'Very significant', and at once resumed his work. The message merely stated that General Grey would arrive that evening from Windsor. [...] This, of course, implied that a mandate {{was coming from the}} Queen charging Mr. Gladstone with the formation of his first Government. [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> but waited while the well-directed blows resounded in regular cadence. [...] After a few minutes the blows ceased and Mr. Gladstone, resting on the handle of his axe, looked up, and with deep earnestness in his voice, and great intensity in his face, exclaimed: My mission is to pacify Ireland. He then resumed his task, and never said another word till the tree was down.|$|E
2500|$|RTÉ {{journalist}} Philip Boucher-Hayes said {{other media}} sources had misreported his words {{in order to}} erroneously claim that nuns had deliberately starved children to death: [...] "Today on BBC TV I said malnutrition was listed as cause of death at other mother-and-baby homes. Several outlets [...] now quoting me as [...] source for the unsupportable claim that ‘nuns starved 800 babies to death’ before dumping them in a septic tank. So just in case this needs clarification, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> of the sort." [...] Boucher-Hayes also spoke of embarrassment felt by locals at the revelations: [...] "Talk to anybody else and there's a bit of hand wringing, there's a bit of chest beating {{and a lot of}} 'ah sure, those were the times, weren't they, what's the point in going and unearthing it now'. And I think that that is an embarrassment about our past that is probably replicated in so many places where there were industrial schools, where there were mother and baby homes and where there is now the suspicion in Cork, in Westmeath, in Tipperary that there are very, very large communal graves of unmarked bodies, unknown about, un-commemorated, discarded bodies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918. [...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What {{do you want me to}} do? [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - to point out that the condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] How else can it be that entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances. [...] That is the explanation for the great March offensive, and now [...] Operation Georgette, not progressing further.|$|E

2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track. Jam stated, [...] "She sang me the melody, {{and then asked}} [...] "well, {{what do you think}} it needs?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>Nothing.</b> Go write some lyrics, it's fine," [...] adding, [...] "She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best." [...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> even to Jane {{about the}} {{discovery}} I'd just made. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> to anybody till {{we sat down}} at dinner. Then, {{in the course of}} conversation, I got on the subject of Devonshire.|$|E

60|$|I {{wanted to}} offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I {{reckoned}} {{maybe it was just}} as safe to not to. So <b>I</b> never <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I gulped. Then <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it was <b>nothing.</b> Then <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it was <b>nothing</b> much. Then <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Oh, well, it {{was this}} way." [...] And, after a few brief remarks about Jimmy Pinkerton, I told her all about it. And all the while Idiot Freddie stood there gaping, without a word.|$|R

6000|$|I thought I could, {{but it did}} {{not seem}} to me that it would be modest to speak out, in the circumstances. So <b>I</b> diffidently <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> Stevenson noticed, and said-- ...|$|R
