25|$|Over 840 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} in Costa Rica. As is the case in much of Central America, the avian species in Costa Rica are a mix of North and South American species. The country's abundant fruit trees, many of which bear fruit year round, are hugely important to the birds, some of whom survive on diets that consist only of one or two types of fruit. Some of the country's most notable avian species include the resplendent quetzal, scarlet macaw, three-wattled bellbird, bare-necked umbrellabird, and the <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan.</b> The Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad is allowed to collect royalties on any biological discoveries of medical importance. Costa Rica is a center of biological diversity for reptiles and amphibians, including the world's fastest running lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis).|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} flower is {{the black}} orchid (Prosthechea cochleata, also known as Encyclia cochleata). The national tree is the mahogany tree (Swietenia macrophylla), which inspired the national motto Sub Umbra Floreo, which means [...] "Under the shade I flourish". The national animal is the Baird's tapir and the national bird is the <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan</b> (Ramphastos sulphuratus).|$|E
2500|$|The canopy is {{the primary}} layer of the forest forming a roof over the two {{remaining}} layers. It contains {{the majority of the}} largest trees, typically 30–45 m in height. Tall, broad-leaved evergreen trees are the dominant plants. [...] The densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest canopy, as it often supports a rich flora of epiphytes, including orchids, bromeliads, mosses and lichens. [...] These epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. It is suggested that the total arthropod species richness of the tropical canopy might be as high as 20 million. Other species habituating this layer include many avian species such as the yellow-casqued wattled hornbill (Ceratogymna elata), collared sunbird (Anthreptes collaris), African gray parrot (Psitacus erithacus), <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan</b> (Ramphastos sulfuratus), scarlet macaw (Ara macao) as well as other animals like the spider monkey (Ateles sp.), African giant swallowtail (Papilio antimachus), three-toed sloth (Bradypus tridactylus), kinkajou (Potos flavus), and tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla).|$|E
50|$|Amazonia is a {{rainforest}} exhibit {{that opened}} in 2008. The exhibit added more than 150 animals to the zoo including jaguars, Baird's tapir, capybaras, <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucans,</b> macaws, bats, iguanas, howler monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and yellow-spotted river turtles.|$|R
50|$|Small flocks, usually {{consisting}} of 3-12 birds, {{move through the}} forest with an undulating flight, rarely travelling more than 100 m at a time. This species is primarily an arboreal fruit-eater, but will also take insects, lizards, eggs, and frogs. Flocks will follow <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucans</b> to exploit their sources of food.|$|R
50|$|<b>Keel-billed</b> <b>toucans</b> have zygodactyl feet (or {{feet with}} toes facing in {{different}} directions) - two toes face forward and two face back. Because toucans spend {{a large portion}} of time in the trees, this helps the birds to stay on the branches of the trees and jump from one branch to another.|$|R

50|$|The diet of <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucans</b> {{consists}} {{mostly of}} a wide range of fruit, but may also include insects, eggs, nestlings and lizards. The bill, surprisingly dexterous, allows this toucan to utilize a large variety of fruit that might not otherwise be reached. When eating the fruit, it uses its bill to dissect the fruit, and then tosses its head back to swallow the fruit whole.|$|R
5000|$|The area {{is home to}} {{thousands}} of plant and insect species as well as hundreds of species of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The list of animals include three monkey species (white-face capuchins, mantled howlers and spiders), pacas and aguotis, <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucans,</b> white-crowned parrots, strawberry poison-dart frogs, eyelash vipers and green iguanas. The Research Station and surrounding forests and farm were purchased by the Molina family in 1987. Since it was established in 1993, La Suerte has attracted over 550 students from across the United States, Canada, Latin America, India and Japan to study tropical rainforest ecology and conservation.http://www.lasuerte.org/lasuerte.html ...|$|R
5000|$|Like many <b>toucans,</b> <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucans</b> {{are very}} social birds, rarely seen alone. They fly in small flocks of {{approximately}} six to twelve individuals through lowland rainforests. Their flight {{is slow and}} undulating, consisting of rapid wing beats (six to ten), then a glide with the bird's beak extending forward and dipping downward as though pulling {{the rest of the}} bird. Their feet are drawn up forward in flight. The flight distances are typically short. They live together in groups, often sharing cramped living quarters of holes in trees. There is a family structure within the group. Birds often [...] "duel" [...] with each other using their bills, and throw fruit into each other's mouths. They 'play ball', one throwing a fruit in the air and a second seizing it.|$|R

5000|$|The {{national}} flower is {{the black}} orchid (Prosthechea cochleata, also known as Encyclia cochleata). The national tree is the mahogany tree (Swietenia macrophylla), which inspired the national motto Sub Umbra Floreo, which means [...] "Under the shade I flourish". The national animal is the Baird's tapir and the national bird is the <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan</b> (Ramphastos sulphuratus).|$|E
50|$|Including its bill, the <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan</b> ranges {{in length}} from around 42 to 55 cm. Their large and {{colorful}} bill averages around 12 - 15 cm, {{about one-third of}} its length. It typically weighs about 380 - 500 g. While the bill seems large and cumbersome, {{it is in fact}} a spongy, hollow bone covered in keratin, a very light and hard protein.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecosystems}} {{attract and}} provides home for many organisms. The preserve {{is home to}} 270 birds, 19 amphibian, 20 fish, 59 mammals and 57 reptiles. Some of the animals inhabiting the preserve are the jaguar, puma, ocelot, paca, kinkajou, margay and iguana. Many threatened and endangered wildlife also inhabits this area. An example of a threatened species is the Baird's tapir. Examples of endangered species are the Central American spider monkey, <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan</b> and the West Indian manatee.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to its {{variety of}} {{habitats}} and its geographic position between the drier Yucatan and more humid Central American forests types, Shipstern hosts {{a large number}} of bird species, many of which are Yucatan endemics and can, in Belize, only be seen in Shipstern. Extensive research has shown that close to 300 species inhabit the area, among which the <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan,</b> the lineated woodpecker or the Yucatan jay (in Belize commonly known as Yucatan blue jay).|$|E
5000|$|The 600-acre (242-ha) reef {{is known}} to have at least 35 species of coral, 140 species of molluscs, 44 species of crustaceans, and 123 species of fish. The outer reef is about 4 km long. [...] On land there are many types of animal as well {{including}} northern tamanduas, pacas, white-nosed coatis, raccoons, sloths, agoutis, mantled howlers and white-headed capuchins.It has a variety of birds as well including the green ibis, green-and-rufous kingfisher and <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sexes {{are alike}} in appearance, mainly black with maroon hints to the head, upper back and lower breast. The face and upper breast are bright yellow, with narrow white and broader red lines forming a lower border. The upper tail {{is white and}} the lower abdomen is red. The legs are blue. The body plumage {{is similar to that}} of the smaller <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan,</b> but the bill pattern is quite different, being diagonally divided into bright yellow and maroon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan</b> can {{be found}} from Southern Mexico to Venezuela and Colombia. It roosts in the {{canopies}} of tropical, subtropical, and lowland rainforests, up to altitudes of 1900 m. It roosts in holes in trees, often with several other toucans. This can be very cramped, so the birds tuck their tails and beaks under their bodies to conserve space while sleeping. Adding {{to the lack of}} space, the bottoms of the holes are often covered with pits from the fruit the toucans have eaten.|$|E
50|$|Like the <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan,</b> the {{toco toucan}} is {{sometimes}} kept in captivity, {{but has a}} high fruit diet and is sensitive to haemochromatosis (an iron storage disease). Also, pet toco toucans must {{not be permitted to}} eat mouse (or rat) meat, due to a risk of bacterial infection. There is an ongoing population management plan that should help to revert the decreasing captive population of the toco toucan for Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) member institutions. This is the second management plan that is occurring since 2001.|$|E
50|$|Native {{species of}} bird include the rufous-capped warbler, common crossbill, pine siskin, eastern bluebird, stygian owl, king vulture, ocellated turkey, acorn woodpecker, Lesson's motmot, plumbeous vireo, <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan</b> and red-lored parrot. Winter {{visitors}} include the hepatic tanager and chipping sparrow. Orange-breasted falcons {{are more common}} in the area than elsewhere in Belize. Other fauna present in the reserve are the frog species Rana juliani (which is restricted to the Maya Mountains) and Eleutherodactylus sandersoni, and the fish species Poecilia teresae. The pine forest has been seriously damaged by the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis, with 80% of the trees showing signs of attack.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan</b> {{will lay}} 1-4 white {{eggs in a}} natural or already-made tree cavity. The male and female share in the caring of the eggs, both taking turns incubating. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 15-20 days after being laid. After hatching, {{the male and female}} again take turns feeding the chicks. When the chicks hatch, they have no feathers, and have their eyes closed for approximately 3 weeks. The chicks have adequately formed heel pads, which assist on the pit-covered bottom of the nest. The chicks stay in their nest for approximately eight to nine weeks while their bills develop fully and they are ready to fledge from the nest.|$|E
50|$|Curi Cancha Wildlife Refuge is a {{wildlife}} {{refuge in the}} central part of Costa Rica, which forms part of the Arenal Tilaran Conservation Area and protects cloud forest in the Cordillera de Tilarán near Juntas.The refuge entrance is about a kilometer before the famous Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve.The lower portion is drier, with few epiphytes, but the upper portion is cloud forest.While the forest is not quite so pristine as Monteverde, the most spectacular birds are much easier to see.The refuge is particularly good for the resplendent quetzal, the most sought-after bird of the cloud forest. The refuge is also a good place to find <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan,</b> Lesson's motmot, orange-bellied trogon, and three-toed sloth, as well as monkeys.|$|E
5000|$|Cecropia fruit, {{known as}} snake fingers, are a popular food of diverse animals however, {{including}} bats like the common fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) or Carollia species, the Central American squirrel monkey (Saimiri oerstedii), and birds like the green aracari (Pteroglossus viridis), the <b>keel-billed</b> <b>toucan</b> (Ramphastos sulfuratus), the peach-fronted conure (Eupsittula aurea), the bare-throated bellbird (Procnias nudicollis) and particularly nine-primaried oscines. The seeds are not normally digested and thus {{these animals are}} important in distributing the trees.Some birds [...] - [...] e.g. the common potoo (Nyctibius griseus) [...] - [...] nest in Cecropia trees. The elfin-woods warbler (Setophaga angelae) is notable for using Cecropia leaves as nesting material, which no other New World warbler (family Parulidae) seems to do.|$|E
