[...] According to Hit-boy, he had [...] "made the beat a couple months ago, just in a session messing around" [...] and that Kanye [...] "just did the record maybe {{a week and a}} half ago.

[...] It just makes me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E

The Office of Strategic Influence was a highly secret {{organization}} set up three weeks after the September 11 attacks. Part of its mission was to spread misinformation and plant false news items in the media in order to [...] "influence {{the hearts and minds of}} the opposition." [...] After The New York Times ran a story on the Office in February 2002, it was forced to shut, although many of its operations were later transferred to the Information Operations Task Force. [...] "The funny thing about it was the government and administration was saying it's so embarrassing that they had to name it the 'Office of Strategic Influence,' we couldn't <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in a room in the Pentagon and name it whatever the room number is," [...] Moore said.

[...] "The really left-of-center artists, you really wonder about them. Can the world catch up? Can the culture meet them in the middle? That’s what the adventure is. It doesn’t always happen, but it should and it could." [...] Richard Russell, head of XL Recordings, states, [...] "You've got to bend culture around to suit you, and I think M.I.A has done that" [...] adding that M.I.A.'s composition and production skills were a major attraction for him. As a vocalist, M.I.A. is recognisable by her distinctive whooping, chanting voice, which {{has been described as}} having an [...] "indelible, nursery-rhyme swing." [...] She has adopted different singing styles on her songs, from aggressive raps, to semi-spoken and melodic vocals. She has said of the sometimes [...] "unaffected" [...] vocals and delivery of her lyrics, [...] "It is what it is. Most people would <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down to me being lazy.

500|$|Conrad {{first met}} MacFarlane while {{recording}} a [...] clip {{for the season}} five episode [...] "Prick Up Your Ears". She had watched Family Guy for years and considered Stewie her favorite character. Conrad stuck to the script and did not do any improvisation while recording for this episode. In an interview with People, she revealed that she has no plans on getting into acting, and even calls herself an [...] "awful actor" [...] and admits that she cannot memorize lines. However, she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines. Even though she enjoyed the experience, she said that [...] " [...] not really something I'm interested in." [...] She {{had to do a}} lot of research before recording, because [...] "there were a lot of facts and a lot of big words" [...] and she [...] "had to say it as if it was coming to [...] very easily."

[...] MacFarlane commented on this, saying, [...] "She made an effort , so let me <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> that way." [...] He ultimately praised her performance, calling it [...] "surprisingly fantastic", and said: [...] "She came in, and she'd prepared before she even arrived. She hired an acting coach, with her own money, and she nailed it. She never once complained, and it was a long session. There was a lot of dialog. Her stamina was astonishing." ...|$|E

The hook {{was written}} about Desiigner's {{affinity}} for the BMW X6, and also mentions that he has [...] "got broads in Atlanta", likely a nod to his Southern-inspired style of rap. Explained by Desiigner, lyrically, [...] "the panda is the black X6 and the white X6. The black X6 look like a Phantom, the white X6 look like a panda. I'm <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> in a greater way of how I say and the way I live."

When asked by a reporter where in the United States that Sharia law was being practiced, Moore said [...] "Well, there's Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana — up there. I don't know."

2500|$|Closing track, [...] "Tomorrow's Food", was {{the first}} song written for the album. Einziger stated that the song was {{conceived}} in 2009 with Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band and [...] "was written {{at a time when}} I didn’t know whether or not {{we were going to go}} back and start working on new music for a new album. I’d been off at Harvard for a while and Brandon was really focusing on painting and for a little while there we didn’t have all that much communication. I just sort of wrote that guitar part, the chord progression and the changes and stuff and Brandon just sort of responded to it. We kind of <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> aside and then when we started working on new music for this album, I think we always knew that we wanted to record it in the studio and make it really great. But that actually was one of the last things that we did for this album." ...|$|E

(Society of Automotive Engineers) convention (February, 1964 in Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan) and everybody was steamed up about it! But the thing that killed the Tarpon was the fact that we didn't have a V-8 for it at that time.... Roy Abernethy didn't like little cars. Never did. He liked big cars, because he was a big guy -- hell of a nice guy. And he felt that this car was too small, so he said, [...] "Well, heck, Teague, why don't you <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on the Rambler Classic wheel-base? That way you've got V-8 availability and you've got more room inside it." [...] And then on top of that he added an inch to the roof while I was in Europe.

2500|$|Lupe Fiasco was {{supposedly}} {{going to release}} a triple album, titled LupE.N.D. as his third and final record, but his contract with Atlantic Records prevented him from doing so. From then he postponed LupE.N.D. indefinitely and intended on releasing an album tentatively titled The Great American Rap Album in June 2009. Instead, the album was also postponed and he announced that a new album was in the works, originally titled We Are Lasers and then changed to Lasers. [...] "Lasers" [...] is a backronym for [...] "Love Always Shines Everytime, Remember 2 Smile". Referring to {{the title of the}} album, Fiasco has stated: [...] "I've always had that word in my head, I'm a word guy. And I thought 'lasers' would be a dope name for an album, so when I came up with it I <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in my 'think-tank' and let it evolve and came up with different meanings for it. That’s why I made it an acronym [...] to give it a new mould, a new understanding, but still playing off the idea that it's bringing light to different circumstances which is what I try and do - bringing understanding and light and awareness to different projects that are going on in the world, and 'L.A.S.E.R.S' is no different.|$|E

Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E
