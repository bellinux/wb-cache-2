5|$|Corky (Gina Gershon), an ex-con who has <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> five-year jail sentence, {{arrives at}} an {{apartment}} building to start work as a painter and plumber. On her {{way up to the}} apartment, she encounters the couple who live next-door, Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). After Caesar has gone out, Violet flirts with Corky and asks her to help retrieve an earring that has fallen down her sink. After Corky extracts the earring, Violet admits she lost it on purpose in order to get closer to Corky, and starts to seduce her. They are interrupted by the arrival of Caesar and Corky goes back to work. When she leaves for the day, Violet follows her to her truck. They go to Corky's apartment and have sex. The next morning, Violet tells Corky that Caesar is a money launderer for the Mafia and they have been together for five years.|$|E
5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E

25|$|A less amusing {{incident}} {{for which}} Holding is also remembered was kicking over the stumps in anger at an umpiring decision in New Zealand in 1979/80. The tour had gone poorly {{almost from the}} beginning: West Indies had <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> long tour of Australia, and were perhaps resentful about having a tour to unglamorous New Zealand immediately afterwards (their leading batsman of the time, Viv Richards, refused to tour). West Indies felt that the umpiring had been incompetent and against them throughout. After an appeal for caught behind was turned down, Holding turned and kicked the stumps in frustration.|$|E

25|$|Another campus {{focal point}} is the main plaza, around {{which can be found}} Lory Student Center and Morgan Library, as well as several {{academic}} buildings. The Lory Student Center, named for former CSU president Charles Lory, houses Student Media, numerous organization offices, Student Government, and spaces to eat, drink and study. The Morgan Library was originally constructed in 1965 and named for former CSU president William E. Morgan. Following the flood of '97, this facility went through an extensive improvement project that included an addition to the main building and a renovation of the existing structure, with works completed in 1998. Current holdings include more than 2 million books, bound journals, and government documents. Morgan Library <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> 13,000 square-foot addition called the Study Cube that will seat 80 additional patrons and is designed for 24-hour access. With a university issued ID card, students and staff will be able to access the Cube after hours. To accommodate, the Loan and Reserve desk will check out laptops and other accessories over night if checked out less than six hours prior to closing.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, Paige {{returned}} to Pittsburgh where Greenlee acquiesced to Paige's salary demands {{and gave him}} a $600-per-month contract, by far the highest in the Negro leagues. In games for which complete box scores are available, Paige went 5–0, allowed 3.21 runs per game, and struck out 47 in 47 innings. At the end of the season, Tom Wilson arranged with the other NNL owners to assemble an all-star team that would enter the lucrative Denver Post tournament. The team included Paige, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, Leroy Matlock, Buck Leonard, Felton Snow, Bill Wright and Sammy Hughes. They swept the tournament in seven games to win the $5,000 prize, with Paige winning three of them. In the title game against an overmatched semi-pro team from Borger, Texas, Paige pitched a 7–0 shutout, striking out 18. The Negro league all-stars then barnstormed, playing a series against a team of major leaguers led by Rogers Hornsby. One match-up featured Paige facing the 17-year-old Bob Feller, who had <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> half-season with the Cleveland Indians. Each pitched three innings and gave up one hit, with Feller striking out eight and Paige seven. Later in the game, the Negro league team pulled out a win.|$|E
25|$|The feature {{event and}} main selling {{point of the}} 2012 Sin Piedad event {{was the result of}} the storyline feud between CMLL and a group of wrestlers {{primarily}} associated with CMLL's main rival AAA known as Los Invasores. The Invasores storyline began on April 12, 2010 when a contingent of former AAA wrestlers including Psicosis, Histeria, Maniaco, El Alebrije and Cuije appeared during a CMLL show in Puebla, Puebla. The group drown into the arena in a black SUV and attacked La Sombra, El Hijo del Fantasma and La Máscara after they had <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> match. In the following months the storyline became the main focus of CMLL's storlines and involved a number of different wrestlers. In the months leading up to the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show Rey Bucanero and the rest of La Peste Negra (El Felino and Negro Casas) facing off the Invasores trio of Charly Manson, Héctor Garza and the recently returned Mr. Águila. At the show La Peste Negra won the match, with Bucanero taking the deciding fall for his team. It was originally believed that Bucanero would face off against Charly Manson from Los Invasores, but instead Bucanero and Mr. Águila began focusing their efforts on each other, usually on opposite sides of various six-man tag team matches. In the weeks leading up to Sin Piedad Bucanero challenged Mr. Águila to put his hair on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match between the two. Águila agreed and the two signed the contract for the main event a few weeks before the Sin Piedad event.|$|E

500|$|When Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He had <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> {{university}} degree and {{was moving to}} London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, {{and it is clear}} from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: [...] "I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together." ...|$|E
500|$|When he {{graduated}} from high school in 1997, Youkilis weighed about 227 pounds and was 6' 1". He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I looked at him and said, Well, we need somebody", said Cleary. [...] "I'd love to tell you I saw something no one else did, but he was just better than what we had." ...|$|E
500|$|Stimson, who had <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} {{arguments}} with the British {{about the need}} for an invasion of France, was reluctant to appear to disagree with them about everything, and spoke in conciliatory terms {{about the need for}} good post-war relations between the two countries. For his part, Churchill disavowed interest in the commercial applications of nuclear technology. The reason for British concern about the post-war cooperation, Cherwell explained, was not commercial concerns, but so that Britain would have nuclear weapons after the war. Anderson then drafted an agreement for full interchange, which Churchill re-worded [...] "in more majestic language". News arrived in London of Roosevelt's decision on 27 July, and Anderson was dispatched to Washington with the draft agreement. Churchill and Roosevelt signed {{what became known as the}} Quebec Agreement at the Quebec Conference on 19 August 1943.|$|E

The season was produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Frederator Studios. The season was the last to feature creative director Patrick McHale in a full-time capacity. [...] He was still credited with being part of the story writing team with the premiere of season three, but his level of contribution was more limited than it had been for the first two seasons.|$|E
500|$|Voice actress Jen Taylor {{said that}} she {{remained}} somewhat distanced from the character, and she attended only one fan convention in six years {{after the release of}} Halo: Combat Evolved. Despite her role in voicing other video game characters, including Princess Peach, she is not a gamer. She felt that portraying Cortana was occasionally challenging because the character lacks a physical form and is [...] "a computer". Interviewed about Cortana in Halo 3, Taylor said that [...] "There's a lot more drama and a lot less technical jargon this time around. I actually <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> couple of lines that nearly had me in tears." [...] When choosing a voice actor for the character, Bungie originally wanted Cortana to have a British accent. Although this idea was later discarded, Cortana still uses British colloquialisms in Halo: Combat Evolved.|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, it was {{reported}} that Stanton would reprise her role as Jill.

She's already picturing me standing in the dock" [...] in the 29 December episode. Marsden returned to investigate the murder of Archie Mitchell. A source told Digital Spy, [...] "Marsden has a score to settle with Phil. She was never far behind Phil when he put a foot out of place all those years ago and she's back with a vengeance...With so many people in the frame for Archie's murder, Marsden has a difficult job on her hands if she wants to pin it on Phil." [...] Of her return she said, [...] "It came completely out of the blue, and knocked me for six."...I really thought Marsden was no more. It was a really great surprise because I’d <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> year’s run at the National Theatre, appearing in a new play called England People Very Nice – so it couldn’t have come at a better time."

500|$|In Pasadena, Cameron {{ran into}} a former colleague, who invited her to visit the large American Craftsman-style house where he was {{currently}} lodging, 1003 Orange Grove Avenue, also known as [...] "The Parsonage". The house was so-called because its lease was owned by Jack Parsons, a rocket scientist {{who had been a}} founding member of the JPL and who was also a devout follower of Thelema, a new religious movement founded by English occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904. Parsons was the head of the Agape Lodge, a branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). Unbeknownst to Cameron, Parsons had <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> series of rituals using Enochian magic with his friend and lodger L. Ron Hubbard, all with the intent of attracting an [...] "elemental" [...] woman to be his lover. Upon encountering Cameron with her distinctive red hair and blue eyes, Parsons considered her to be the individual whom he had invoked. After they met at The Parsonage on January 18, 1946, they were instantly attracted to each other and spent the next two weeks in Parsons' bedroom together. Although Cameron was unaware of it, Parsons saw this as a form of sex magic that constituted part of the Babalon Working, a rite to invoke the birth of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth in human form.|$|E
500|$|Jennings' work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks {{contributed to}} his {{decision}} in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. [...] "I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways," [...] he said. [...] "And when {{we were working on}} the America project I {{spent a lot of time}} on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future."

[...] "Can you imagine I, who <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. [...] "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching.

500|$|Panther Group {{supported}} by Red Group overcame minimal resistance {{at the cemetery}} and Rybka established his headquarters behind the cemetery walls. However, {{there was no sign}} of Tito or his headquarters. Greifer Group and Brecher Group were also unsuccessful as the British and American groups had moved following the aerial reconnaissance on 23 May. Parts of Stürmer Group landed their gliders in a field immediately south of the Drvar cave and came under fire from members of the Tito Escort Battalion on the high ground in the area of the cave. The Draufgänger Group landed their gliders at the [...] "Western Cross", then assaulted a building they believed was the Partisan communications centre. However, the building was actually the office of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia Central Committee, who resisted fanatically until the building was levelled using satchel charges. Both Blue Group and Green Group, consisting of parachute troops that landed in the eastern part of Drvar where most of the population lived, were also engaged in heavy fighting. The Young Communist League of Yugoslavia had <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> conference in Drvar, and many of the delegates were still staying in the town.
