40|$|Global {{increases}} in energy demand will inevitable {{lead to increased}} {{oil and gas exploration}} in areas not considered economically viable today. In these areas with large depths and hostile conditions subsea system solutions will be beneficiary. Modifications of power electronic components not intended <b>for</b> <b>subsea</b> <b>use</b> might yield good solutions with decreased overall cost. One suggested solution for subsea converters is to encapsulate the power electronics in a vessel with flexible walls and filled with dielectric oil, allowing the pressure on the inside to equal the ambient pressure at sea bed. This solution will reduce overall cost and increase gas field recovery. Theoretical studies on various topics associated with subsea power electronics have been carried out. Among these are topics about subsea processing systems, considerations of condition assessment and working principle of semiconductors with emphasis on the insulated gate bipolar transistor, IGBT. The switching characteristics, including turn-on and turn-off transients and power loss calculations, of an IGBT module operated with two different gate drivers are obtained from double pulse tests with high voltage and current in an H-bridge leg converter set up. Thorough testing of the IGBT module and documentation of results have been performed to achieve well documentation of how the module behaves in air to use as a reference for later testing purposes with module submerged in dielectric oil and high pressure. </p...|$|E
40|$|As per now, Oceaneering {{does not}} have a 38 000 Nm torque tool with torque {{feedback}} for subsea application. As one of Oceaneerings competitors delivers this type of tool with torque feedback within +/- 10 % accuracy, it is essential for Oceaneering to develop a functioning reliable tool with higher accuracy to be able to regain lost market share for these products. The objective of this thesis has been to develop an alternative concept to an already existing concept for torque feedback. Testing of an old 17 000 Nm torque tool with the existing concept revealed high deviation in accuracy (+/- 20 %) which is not acceptable. The condition of the strain gauges in the tool is unknown. Several concepts were evaluated during concept phase. The concept with the assumed highest accuracy was not chosen as it was estimated to be too expensive to develop and produce. The chosen concept was a new idea and no similar solutions were found during research. Both HBM and Scansense found the concept very exciting and interesting. Further, FEM analyses of the new concept and the existing concept were performed to determine the accuracy regarding strain distribution in the geometry. Due to the torque tool planetary gear system, the strain distribution changes with the position of the gear. For this reason, the torque feedback concept design has to be minimally affected by this effect. The target accuracy was set to +/- 5 % of read value. The results from the analyses of the existing concept revealed more accurate results than first anticipated based on the test results from the existing tool with torque feedback. The results showed a deviation of 0. 7 % between the gear simulated in position one and position two, and a deviation of 1. 7 % between the gear simulated in position two and position three. These results are within accuracy target and it is recommended to perform additional analyses in different positions and to further investigate the condition of the existing tool. The results from the analyses of the new concept are promising. The same positions as for the existing concept were analyzed and the accuracy was 0. 3 % for both positions. The theory the concept is based on adds up with the analyses results, and these results deliver a higher accuracy than the existing concept. Due to the low cost associated with investigating the existing tool and equip it with 8 - 10 strain gauges to achieve higher accuracy, this is recommended. Some technical challenges do exist regarding use of strain gauges for subsea application. However, Termo Tight does have experience with use of polypropylene for molding the strain gauges. As long as the strain gauges are exposed to hydrostatic pressure, these issues will be present independently of the concept. As a result of this thesis, two valid concepts have been investigated and issues regarding strain gauges <b>for</b> <b>subsea</b> <b>use</b> have been revealed. With this work as basis, Oceaneering will have a very good starting point for developing a functioning solution for a torque tool with torque feedback...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for assessing internal flow-induced vibrations (FIV) in subsea piping systems. Finite Element (FE) models are constructed {{for the subject}} piping systems, including insulation, internal hydrocarbon weight and added mass of the surrounding sea water. Operating vibration data are measured using ROV-deployable accelerometer loggers clamped directly to the piping systems. The measured data are processed, analyzed and used for two purposes: model verification and dynamic response correlation. Modal parameters are extracted from the measured data and compared to the modal parameters computed from the structural FE model. The model is refined until the frequencies and mode shape errors are within the desired tolerance. The measured data are then used to derive a representative forcing function for use with frequency-domain random response analysis. The forcing function is derived such that {{the properties of the}} predicted vibration spectrum match those of the measured vibration spectrum for all measurement locations. The method presented herein provides a novel semi-empirical technique for calibrating FE models to make fatigue life predictions <b>for</b> <b>subsea</b> piping systems <b>using</b> measured vibration data...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} {{different}} topics {{regarding the use}} of Commercial off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software <b>for</b> <b>subsea</b> control systems. COTS basically means every product which is commercially available. The idea of using COTS is that it is supposed to reduce the development costs, and ensure a shorter time to market. When doing a COTS based software development, there are many issues that need to addressed. The main issues are discussed in this report. Because of the high reliability requirements on subsea control systems, future systems might have to be certified to IEC 61508 Safety Integrity Level 3 (SIL 3). IEC 61508 regulates Functional Safety of electrical/electronic/-programmable electronic safety-related systems, and a summary of the standards software requirements for SIL 3 are presented. To make a SIL 3 certified control system one needs a SIL 3 certified controller. A broad search was performed to identify SIL 3 certified controllers, suitable <b>for</b> <b>subsea</b> installation. Twenty three products were found, but only five came close to meeting the requirements <b>for</b> <b>subsea</b> installation. Many subsea control systems incorporate real time operating systems. In this thesis we perform a general evaluation of the four common COTS real time operating systems OSE, Windows CE, QNX and VxWorks. The evaluation showed that all four are good alternatives. The thesis was completed by developing a <b>subsea</b> control system <b>using</b> the COTS controller CompactRIO, from National Instruments. The control system was based on the Tyrihans subsea raw seawater injection pumping system, to see if the CompactRIO would be suitable for replacing the two programmable controllers used in the Tyrihans setup, a task it is believed to be capable of. </p...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{costs of}} subsea {{production}} systems on the Norwegian Continental Shelf has escalated. In combination with a plunging oil price, {{this has led}} to reduced margins for the companies. In order to survive the Norwegian subsea industry need to change from being technology driven, to being cost efficient through the use of standardization, simplification and smarter ways of working. With the cyclic nature of the Oil & Gas industry, cost escalations after periods of high oil price has been a returning problem. Several initiatives has been raised to facilitate standardization of materials and testing, which has {{led to the development of}} the NORSOK standards, and later the ISO 13628 standard <b>for</b> <b>subsea</b> production systems. Even if most of the major upstream companies operating on the Norwegian Continental shelf have contributed to the development of the NORSOK standards, they still apply their own set of technical requirements and test requirements for their equipment. This thesis investigates cost implications that arise from use of customer specific requirements, and barriers preventing use of common standards through use of methods from exploratory case studies. The study focuses on fasteners, one of the most basic components of any system, in order to give an understanding of the challenges that exists for standardization. The findings are discussed for how they can be relevant for other types of equipment <b>used</b> in the <b>subsea</b> industry. Fasteners are by their nature ideal for mass production. However, the market <b>for</b> fasteners in <b>subsea</b> <b>use</b> is rather small on a global scale. This makes standardization and well-considered fastener selection critical in order to achieve benefits of scale. The findings indicate that the requirements imposed by the oil companies are not the most decisive cost drivers. Rather it is the lack of coordinating of requirements between companies and standards, and the large number of different fasteners in use that are found to be the main cost drivers. In addition, the procurement strategy applied by most companies promotes low volume orders, and thus does not give room for production to achieve production optimum quantities. In the period 2010 - 2011 the price of one of the analyzed fasteners increased 60 times. This coincides with the launch of revision 2 of Statoil TR 3101. Parts of these costs were related to the introduction of fastener traceability, which had not been sufficient before the release of the TR. The price has declined as fastener manufacturers has become familiar with the new requirements. However, the average price is still over ten times the original for the part numbers analyzed...|$|R
