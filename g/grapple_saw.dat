Operation <b>Grapple</b> <b>saw</b> Valiant bombers testing the dropping of hydrogen bombs over Christmas Island. Advances in electronic countermeasures were also {{applied to the}} V bombers {{over the same period}} and the remaining V bombers came into service in the late 1950s. During the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, Bomber Command aircraft maintained continuous strip alerts, ready to take off at a moment's notice, and the Thor missiles were maintained at advanced readiness. The Prime Minister did not disperse Bomber Command aircraft to satellite airfields, lest that be viewed as an aggressive step.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the criticism, the UFC increased cooperation with state athletic commissions and redesigned its rules to remove the less palatable elements of fights while retaining the core elements of striking and <b>grappling.</b> UFC 12 <b>saw</b> the introduction of weight classes and the banning of fish-hooking. For UFC 14, gloves became mandatory, while kicks {{to the head of}} a downed opponent were banned. UFC 15 saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes {{to the back of the}} neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes. With five-minute rounds introduced at UFC 21, the UFC gradually re-branded itself as a sport rather than a spectacle.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} a full tree {{harvesting system}} operationally and economically of a eucalyptus plantation, envisaging {{the improvement of}} the production system. The study was developed in a forest company located in Goias State. The wood harvesting system was composed by feller buncher, skidder, <b>grapple</b> <b>saw</b> and forest loader. The technical analysis consisted in motion and time study for the continuous method, which the operations were divided in working cycle, productivity determination, mechanical availability and operational efficiency. The economic analysis included the operational parameters cost and production cost. The results indicated that the equipment with lower operational efficiency (35. 6 %) and lower mechanical availability (47. 1 %) occurred in the feller buncher, due to interruptions occurred in working cycle. The regression analysis indicated that the feller buncher productivity was influenced by wood volume, while the skidder by distance, the <b>grapple</b> <b>saw</b> by wood volume and forest loader by wood volume...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} levels of pressure and compaction induced by forest harvesting operations in a Red Latosol (LV) under planted eucalyptus. Undisturbed soil {{samples were collected}} from layers 0 - 3 and 15 - 18 cm and then used in a uniaxial compression test. Sampling was done before and after harvesting operations. Equipment being evaluated included: harvester, feller buncher, forwarder, self-loading adapted tractor, standard truck, wide-tire truck and <b>grapple</b> <b>saw.</b> Average pressures induced by the <b>grapple</b> <b>saw</b> were 320 kPa and 272 kPa, causing compaction in 80 % and 20 % of samples respectively from layers 0 - 3 cm and 15 - 18 cm, which indicates substantial degradation of soil structure in areas where timber is processed. In layer 0 - 3 cm, average pressures induced by the harvester and by the feller buncher were 240 kPa and 263 kPa respectively, while in layer 15 - 18 cm pressures were 234 kPa and 239 kPa respectively. The feller buncher caused higher soil compaction than the harvester in layer 0 - 3 cm, yet in layer 15 - 18 cm they had similar behavior. All timber forwarding equipment led to soil compaction. The wide-tire truck was the forwarding implement promoting {{the highest rate of}} compaction, in both residue conditions. Traffic intensity 7 promoted the highest rate of soil compaction...|$|E
