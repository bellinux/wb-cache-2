This grouping {{was based on the}} theory that the first men to exit should be those more skilled and in the best physical condition, as they would be better equipped to escape unaided {{in the event of a}} capsule malfunction or shaft collapse. They were also thought more able to communicate clearly any other problems to the surface rescue team. The second group included miners with medical problems, older men and those with psychological issues. The final group comprised the most mentally tough, as they had to be able to <b>endure</b> <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> of the wait; in the words of Minister Mañalich [...] "they don't care to stay another 24 hours inside the mine".|$|E

50|$|The {{turn of the}} 20th {{century was}} a period of great {{cultural}} and political transformation within Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it was also a time when Džemaludin Čaušević emerged as an individual who was well-versed and capable in both traditional Islamic theology as well as modern science and thought. Bosnian Muslim society struggled to <b>endure</b> <b>the</b> psychological <b>anxiety</b> of being ruled by traditionally antagonistic forces (both Austria and later, Serb-dominated Yugoslavia). As a result tens of thousands of Bosnian Muslims abandoned their homeland, seeking refuge in hicret, or immigration, to lands still under Muslim rule.|$|R
40|$|This {{case report}} {{describes}} {{the treatment of}} an older woman with a longstanding, severe specific phobia for whom evidence-based practice was implemented. Clinical practice guidelines, responsive to the scientific literature, indicate that in vivo exposure is the treatment of choice for a specific phobia. However, treatment tailoring may be necessary for older patients not willing to <b>endure</b> <b>the</b> acute <b>anxiety</b> sometimes associated with in vivo exposure. The present case is one such individual who refused in vivo exposure, but benefited from relaxation therapy and systematic desensitization. Treatment outcome {{studies are needed to}} develop an evidence base for specific phobia treatment among older persons...|$|R
6000|$|What {{would you}} think, Mr. Wade, {{of a man}} who, having abused and {{ridiculed}} you, should openly declare {{that he had heard}} all that your enemies had to say against you, but had scorned to inquire the truth from any one of your friends? Would you think him an honest man? I am sure you would not. Yet such are all the Infidels whom I have known. They talk of a subject, yet are proud to confess themselves profoundly ignorant of it. Dr. Darwin would have been ashamed to reject Hutton's theory of the Earth without having minutely examined it;--yet what is it to us, how the earth was made, a thing impossible to be known? This system the Doctor did not reject without having severely studied it; but all at once he makes up his mind on such important subjects, as whether we be the outcasts of a blind idiot called Nature,[2] or the children of an All wise and Infinitely Good God!--whether we spend a few miserable years on this earth, and then sink into a clod of <b>the</b> valley; or <b>endure</b> <b>the</b> <b>anxieties</b> of mortal life, only to fit us for the enjoyment of immortal happiness! These subjects are unworthy a philosopher's investigation! He deems that there is a certain self- evidence in Infidelity, and becomes an Atheist by intuition. Well did St. Paul say, [...] "ye have an evil heart of unbelief".|$|R
