25|$|World War I {{motivated}} Polish-Americans {{to contribute}} to the cause of defeating the Germans, freeing their homeland, and fighting for their new home. Polish Americans vigorously supported the war effort during World War I, with large numbers volunteering for or drafted into the United States Army, working in war-related industries, and buying war bonds. A common theme was to fight <b>for</b> <b>America</b> <b>and</b> for the restoration of Poland as a unified, independent nation. Polish Americans were personally affected by the War because they heard reports of Poles being used as soldiers for both the Allied and Central Powers, and Polish newspapers confirmed fatalities for many families. Communication was very difficult to their families in Poland and immigration was halted.|$|E

500|$|Norma Lois Peterson, in {{her book}} on Tyler's presidency, {{suggested}} that Tyler's general lack of success as president was due to external factors that would have affected whoever was in the White House. Chief among them was Henry Clay, who was determined to realize the vision he had <b>for</b> <b>America,</b> <b>and</b> who would brook no opposition. In the aftermath of Jackson's determined use of {{the powers of the}} Executive Branch, the Whigs wanted the president to be dominated by Congress, and Clay treated Tyler as a subordinate. [...] Tyler resented this, leading to the conflict between the branches that dominated his presidency. Pointing to Tyler's advances in foreign policy, she deemed Tyler's presidency [...] "flawed... but... not a failure".|$|E
500|$|In October, Booth made an unexplained trip to Montreal, {{which was}} then a {{well-known}} center of clandestine Confederate activity. He spent ten days in the city, staying for a time at St. Lawrence Hall, a rendezvous for the Confederate Secret Service, and meeting several Confederate agents there. No conclusive proof has linked Booth's kidnapping or assassination plots to a conspiracy involving {{the leadership of the}} Confederate government, although historians such as David Herbert Donald have said, [...] "It is clear that, at least at the lower levels of the Southern secret service, the abduction of the Union President was under consideration." [...] Historian Thomas Goodrich concluded that Booth entered the Confederate Secret Service as a spy and courier.

500|$|The Bond novels also {{dealt with}} the {{question}} of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West. In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not focus on this directly, instead creating [...] "an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action". Author and journalist Christopher Hitchens observed that [...] "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment <b>for</b> <b>America</b> <b>and</b> Americans". Although Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, he did not focus on it strongly. Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, pointed out that [...] "Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he".|$|E

500|$|Motion City Soundtrack {{was formed}} in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1997 by singer-songwriter Justin Pierre and guitarist Joshua Cain. By 1997, the duo had already played {{in a number of}} bands. Prior to {{founding}} Motion City Soundtrack, Cain was in a group named the Saddest Girl Story and Pierre was working on local productions. After other members left, Cain recruited Pierre to join the band as a singer. After Cain moved on from Boxcar, they founded Motion City Soundtrack together. The band's name, as well as the name of their debut album, were created by Cain's brother, Brian. Their early days were difficult, as they found it hard to break out of their local Minneapolis scene. When they could get weeks off from their jobs, they would tour. According to Cain, the members of the band soon realized that there [...] "wasn't really anywhere to play [...] in Minneapolis", and {{that they would have to}} [...] "tour all the time" [...] to rise in popularity. The band went through several lineup changes. Through these, Cain and Pierre would often have to take over keyboard duties during shows. The group's first release was a 7" [...] single, [...] "Promenade / Carolina", released in 1999. Their next two releases, both extended plays—Kids <b>for</b> <b>America</b> <b>and</b> Back to the Beat—were released the following year.|$|E
