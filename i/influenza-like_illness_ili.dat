40|$|<b>Influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses</b> (<b>ILIs)</b> {{are caused}} by several {{respiratory}} pathogens.

Using ratios of the estimated regression parameters, relative measures of the under-reporting of pathogens were obtained. Influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) significantly contributed to explain the seasonal variation in ILI consultations. We also found that RSV was the least and influenza virus A is the most underreported pathogen in Belgian laboratory surveillance.

40|$|AbstractSyndromic {{surveillance}} {{is a novel}} automated {{approach to}} monitoring influenza activity, {{but there is no}} consensus regarding the most informative data sources for use within such a system. By comparing physician billing data from Quebec, Canada and hospital admission records, we assessed the timeliness of medical visits for <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses</b> (<b>ILI)</b> to two types of outpatient healthcare settings. Overall, ILI visits by children aged 5 – 17 years at community-based settings were the most strongly correlated with hospital admissions and gave the greatest lead over hospital admissions. However, a degree of year-to-year variation suggests that syndromic surveillance of influenza should not focus on just a single subgroup. These findings reveal the richness of these real-time data for epidemic monitoring and demonstrate the flexibility of syndromic surveillance. By using real-time data, an evolving epidemic can be rapidly characterized by its epidemiological patterns, which is not possible with traditional surveillance systems...|$|R

In Senegal, the network has recently been enhanced (i) to include epidemiological data from Dakar and other regions and (ii) to extend virological surveillance to other respiratory viruses. Epidemiological data from the sentinel sites is transmitted daily by mobile phone. The data include those for other febrile syndromes similar to <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses</b> (<b>ILI),</b> corresponding to integrated approach. Also, clinical samples are randomly selected and analyzed for influenza and other respiratory viruses.

Influenza viruses were the second most frequent cause of ILI (20 %), after adenoviruses (21 %) and before rhinoviruses (18 %) and enteroviruses (15 %).

Previous research on the lagged relationship between respiratory viruses and pneumococcal disease incidence is inconclusive, and studies correcting for temporal autocorrelation are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the temporal relation between <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses</b> (<b>ILI)</b> and IPD, correcting for temporal autocorrelation. METHODS: Weekly counts of ILI {{were obtained from the}} Sentinel Practices of NIVEL Primary Care Database. IPD data were collected from the Dutch laboratory-based surveillance system for bacterial meningitis from 2004 to 2014. We analysed the correlation between time series, pre-whitening the dependent time series with the best-fit seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to the independent time series. We performed cross-correlations between ILI and IPD incidences, and the (pre-whitened) residuals, in the overall population and in the elderly. RESULTS: We found significant cross-correlations between ILI and IPD incidences peaking at lags - 3 overall and at 1 week in the 65 + population. However, after pre-whitening, no cross-correlations were apparent in either population group.
