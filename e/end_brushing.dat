40|$|ABSTRACT One of {{the major}} {{proteins}} of the chicken intestinal microvillus is a calmodulinbinding protein of 105 - 110 kdaltons which has been tentatively identified as the bridge linking the microvillar filament bundle laterally to the membrane. We have treated isolated, membrane-intact brush borders with ATP and obtained solubilization of the 110 -kdalton protein, calmodulin (CM), myosin, and lesser amounts of several other cytoskeletal proteins. Electron micrographs of ATP-extracted brush borders showed loss of the linkers between the actin filament bundle and the microvillar membrane, with "ballooning " of the membrane away from the filament bundle, particularly at the tip <b>end.</b> In <b>brush</b> borders treated with calcium and trifluoperazine to solubilize CM, precise arrangement and morphology of lateral bridges was unperturbed, but ATP treatment would no longer solubilize the 110 -kdalton protein.

A 110 -kdalton protein-CM complex, with 110 -kdalton protein:CM ratios of 1 : 1 - 2, was partially purified from ATP-extracts of brush borders by a combination of gel filtration and hydroxylapatite chromatography.
