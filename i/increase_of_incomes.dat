While {{most of the studies}} carried out before the Financial crisis tend to answer the question with 'yes', recent empirical work provides evidence that the opposite is true. We study these new findings in detail, applying GMM and 3 SLS estimations of simultaneous equation models that cover a comprehensive set of growth determinants proposed by theory and recent empirical work. It turns out that finance in general exerts a positive influence but this influence vanishes in the development process and eventually becomes negative.

This approach to evaluation of customers' profitability changes order of customers listed acordingly to profit they generate.

Besides determining the function of the territory, authors have conducted a diagnostic analysis which underlines the favourable factors of tourism, indicating, at the same time, the necessary measures to insure the best development. Thus, given the conditions of massive cut backs in the major economic sectors, the local development of tourism is of a crucial importance.

Owing to a rational policy {{in the area of}} the consolidation of production and distribution, they may boast of a better use of the means of transport. The purpose of this article is to present the activities {{in the area of the}} eco-friendly CSR aspect in the activities of TSL companies taking into consideration particularly logistic operators. The research methods used in the study include an analysis of secondary data, observations and comparative analyses. Road transport in the shipping structure comes first and it constitutes 84 % of freights. In the year 2009, in Poland greenhouse gas emissions from road transport amounted to 42. 5 million tons (4. 84 % of the EU member states) and CO emissions were 41. 9 million tons (analogically, 4. 83 % of environment pollutions in the European Union). This causes an emission of fumes into the atmosphere. The policy of sustainable development pursued by logistic operators under corporate social responsibility is a response to the abovementioned data. They take decisions concerning social and environmental aspects. The activities of TSL companies under CSR need to provide an answer to customer expectations and needs, and they have to cause an increase of competitiveness on the market. The selected four largest logistic operators conduct the following eco-friendly activities on the highest level: fume emission reports and the control of these emissions, transport of hazardous goods (ADR), voluntary services in the scope of environmental protection and cooperation with eco-friendly organizations. There are those activities which call for improvement: a limitation of the emission of fumes, waste management and sewage treatment policy...|$|E

The model is based on zero-dimensional energy and mass balances for all {{the components of the}} system. Shell and tube heat expanders with single shell and double tube pass have been chosen. Pump and expander have been considered only form a thermodynamic point of view, with constant compressor and expansion efficiency. The simulations have been carried out in order to find different optimization criteria to use as preliminary design tools, especially for the organic fluid choice and the heat exchanger design. Firstly, the ORC performances have been evaluated for different organic medium, varying the temperature of the heat source. The global efficiency of the plant, the net electric power generation and the volumetric expansion ratio has been considered as evaluation parameters. The simulation results show that two hydrocarbons demonstrate good performance for low, medium and high heat source, namely Isobutene, n-Butene; R 245 fa can add to them for the exploitation of heat source up to 170 Â°C. Additional simulations have been carried out to discover an optimization criterion for the heat exchanger design. The plant performances have been first evaluated varying one by one the following parameters: tube length, tube number and shell diameter. Then a global optimization was also performed using the Golden Search technique. The total cost of the plant has been considered as objective functions. With respect to the objective function, higher the boiling heat transfer area higher the electric power generation and the economical benefit. The optimal configuration, compared to the initial one, shows an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> and mechanical power equal to 60. 1 and 48. 2 % respectively, against a decrease of global efficiency equal to 10. 9 %...|$|E

The financial innovation within the banking industry, especially the one regarding the off-balance-sheet instruments has effects as the risk focus and the increase of volatility within the entire banking industry. As it is proved by the economic crisis, the financial stability plays an important role within the financial system as well as within the economy as a whole. At the moment, as the number of active financial institutions is getting higher and higher in one or more countries or on one or more continents, the financial stability at a worldwide level became even more important. The objective of this work is to emphasize {{the way in which the}} European banks were affected once with the global financial crisis. The economic crisis was triggered by the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers â€˜ Investment Bank, in the autumn of 2008 and its effects were felt at the level of the European financial markets, a series of cross-border groups claiming interventions of the state in order for them to be saved. The intensity of the crisis was felt and it affected many states, the impact of these ones being influenced by a series of specific factors which outlined the situation of their financial system, at the moment of the crisis release. At the level of the European Union, a series of measures have been established in order to extinguish the identified dysfunctions at a financial field level, among which we mention: the improvement of the surveillance framework of those financial institutions having cross-border activity, the expansion of the communication and cooperation among the EU surveillance authorities and the ones outside the Union, etc. The conclusions of the study of this paper work in regards to the activity of the main European banks, especially to the ones from Western Europe, is the fact that during the crisis period, they intensified their cross-border activities and increased their incomes. The <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> was generated by both the fast efficient measures taken by the state and the volatility of the emergent markets.
