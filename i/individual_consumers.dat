Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to <b>individual</b> <b>consumers.</b> Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper {{has been focused on}} developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy for allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 14th century, the {{position}} of fairs began to decline. The larger merchants, particularly in London, began to establish direct links with the larger landowners such as the nobility and the church; rather than the landowner buying from a chartered fair, they would buy directly from the merchant. Meanwhile, the growth of the indigenous England merchant class in the major cities, especially London, gradually crowded out the foreign merchants upon whom the great chartered fairs had largely depended. The crown's control over trade in the towns, especially the emerging newer towns towards {{the end of the}} 15th century that lacked central civic government, was increasingly weaker, making chartered status less relevant as more trade occurred from private properties and took place all year around. Nonetheless, the great fairs remained of importance well into the 15th century, as illustrated by their role in exchanging money, regional commerce and in providing choice for <b>individual</b> <b>consumers.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to identify what determinants influence an <b>individual</b> <b>consumer's</b> intention to adopt online shopping. One of the main branches of Internet business is online shopping. In academic literature, online shopping is often studied as a new retailing channel in marketing literature. By viewing online shopping as a new kind of IT, this paper attempted to explain and predict customers' intention of adopting online shopping. Ten proposed hypotheses were then empirically tested by using data collected from survey. The results indicate that the relative advantage of online shopping, the compatibility of online shopping, the voluntariness of <b>individual</b> <b>consumer's</b> doing online shopping, customers' prior experience, and consumer innovativeness are positively correlated with <b>individual</b> <b>consumer's</b> intention of adopting online shopping. On contrary, both the transaction cost involved in purchasing goods online and a customer's sensitivity to risk have negative correlation relationship with his/her adoption intention.

25|$|Congress {{had passed}} the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in 1986, which {{addressed}} issues raised {{as more and more}} companies stored records with highly personal data about <b>individual</b> <b>consumers</b> in off-site databases operated by third parties. A key section, known as the Stored Communications Act (SCA), distinguished between electronic communications services which actively transmitted and received data and remote communications services whose only role was to archive and backup transmitted data for at least some period of time. The former could release transmitted data only to its sender or recipient; the latter could also release that information to the subscriber regardless of who had sent or received it.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung– ZPO) {{does not}} provide for a special {{proceeding}} for complex class action litigation. However, Austrian consumer organizations (Verein für Konsumenteninformation/VKI and the Federal Chamber of Labour/Bundesarbeitskammer) have, in recent years, brought claims on behalf of hundreds or even thousands of consumers. In these cases the <b>individual</b> <b>consumers</b> assigned their claims to one entity, who has then brought an ordinary (two party) lawsuit over the assigned claims. The monetary benefits were redistributed among the class. This technique, soon labelled as “class action Austrian style”, allows for a significant reduction of overall costs.

25|$|Because {{under this}} {{approach}} land cannot be sown but existing plants can be tended and harvested, {{the approach is}} applied to orchards, vineyards, and other perennial crops. A beit din, or rabbinical court supervising the process, hires farmers as its agents to tend and harvest the crops, and appoints the usual distributors and shopkeepers as its agents to distribute them. <b>Individual</b> <b>consumers</b> appoint the court and its designees as their agents and pay monies to court-appointed designees as agents of the court. Thus, under this approach, a legal arrangement is created whereby the crops themselves are never bought or sold, but rather people are merely paid for their labor and expenses in providing certain services. In modern Israel, the badatz is notable for adapting and supervising such arrangements.|$|E
25|$|In doing so, {{the company}} faced several {{simultaneous}} challenges: creating {{a lot of}} intricate user-facing software from scratch or from existing code which must target all the disparate Linux environment versions; integrating a corporate personality into the existing and outspoken volunteer community of the GNOME desktop environment; building upon a very small nascent market of Linux desktop users amongst an already widely served and monopolized desktop computing market; and monetizing free software for <b>individual</b> <b>consumers</b> by creating essential business services. In other words, Eazel sought to switch a groundswell of users from Macintosh and Windows to a new and immature system that free software users would want to pay for. Of the two predominant free desktop environments for Linux, the choice to target GNOME instead of KDE was made {{largely because of the}} questionable legality of the Qt license upon which KDE was based.|$|E
25|$|Consumers {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often {{are not willing to}} pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say {{they would be willing to}} pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after <b>individual</b> <b>consumers</b> dropped off postcards asking for it.|$|E

The cost of the mandate would be the forgone net value of settlements and damages in such cases. A search of the literature suggests that few, if any, of those types of lawsuits have been brought against <b>individual</b> <b>consumers.</b> Because such claims would probably be uncommon {{in the future and}} the damage awards allowed in such cases would be relatively small, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate would be small and fall below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandate ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). If the Librarian of Congress decides to broaden the exemption allowed under the bill to cover other types of mobile devices, such an action would eliminate additional rights of action. The cost of that expansion would depend on what devices the Librarian would include under the exemption and the forgone net value of settlements and damages. CBO has no basis to estimate the cost of such mandates as it would depend on the regulatory actions taken by the Librarian.|$|E
