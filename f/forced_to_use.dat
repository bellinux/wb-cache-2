5|$|In 1871, eight {{main line}} {{railways}} existed in Berlin, with terminal stations at the city's edge {{or outside the}} city limits. This was very impractical for many passengers, who were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> hackney carriages to transfer from one train to another. Therefore, a railway line was planned to connect these terminuses with each other.|$|E
5|$|Season 4, set 18 months later, {{begins at}} 7:00a.m. Jack must {{save the lives}} of his new boss, Secretary of Defense James Heller, and Heller's {{daughter}} Audrey Raines (with whom Jack is romantically involved) when they are kidnapped by terrorists. However, Habib Marwan uses this as a disguise to launch further attacks against America, and Jack is <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> unorthodox methods to stop him, which results in long-term consequences for both Jack and the United States.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{at their}} own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden Ore ran 11yards for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal put the Hokies into scoring position. After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> its timeouts to stop the clock and the first half from ending before {{they had a chance}} to score. On a 3rd-and-7 from the Boston College 13-yard line, Glennon finally connected with wide receiver Josh Hyman, who crossed into the end zone for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game, 1616.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, Michigan was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} Sugar Bowl against the Virginia Tech Hokies. It was Michigan's first BCS bowl game since the 2006 season, when Michigan was defeated by the USC Trojans in the 2007 Rose Bowl. The meeting between the Hokies and the Wolverines was the first between the two schools. Virginia Tech was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> its third-string kicker during the game, as first-string kicker Cody Journell was suspended for the game {{as a result of an}} arrest for breaking-and-entering, while second-string kicker Tyler Weiss was suspended from the game and sent home for missing curfew.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass escapes {{the plant}} in a gas mask and meets up with Leo, whom he finds {{unconscious}} in his car nearby. With little time left to prevent more ammonids returning in meteorites, he and Leo are <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Quatermass II to attempt to destroy the asteroid, despite the known flaws in the rocket's design and its liability to explode. They return to the Rocket Group, but British Paratroopers led by Johnny Dillon {{take control of the}} firing base.|$|E

5|$|The serial sees Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group {{being asked}} to examine strange {{meteorite}} showers. His investigations lead to his uncovering a conspiracy involving alien infiltration {{at the highest levels}} of the British Government. As even some of Quatermass's closest colleagues fall victim to the alien influence, he is <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his own unsafe rocket prototype, which recently caused a nuclear disaster at an Australian testing range, to prevent the aliens from taking over mankind.|$|E
5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, to lighten it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. When even that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E
5|$|As the two armies {{faced the}} {{stalemate}} of trench warfare at Petersburg in July 1864, Burnside {{agreed to a}} plan suggested by a regiment of former coal miners in his corps, the 48th Pennsylvania: dig a mine under a fort named Elliot's Salient in the Confederate entrenchments and ignite explosives there to achieve a surprise breakthrough. The fort was destroyed on July 30 in {{what is known as}} the Battle of the Crater. Because of interference from Meade, Burnside was ordered, only hours before the infantry attack, not to use his division of black troops, which had been specially trained for this mission. He was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> untrained white troops instead. He could not decide which division to choose as a replacement, so he had his three subordinate commanders draw lots.|$|E

5|$|Luthor sends his moll, Kitty, to {{distract}} Superman, {{allowing him to}} steal a sample of kryptonite from a museum. Still investigating the earlier power outage, Lois tracks the hypocenter to the mansion Luthor recently inherited and, along with her son, explores the yacht docked there. Discovering Luthor, she is held captive as the yacht heads out into the Atlantic. Luthor {{plans to use the}} Kryptonian crystal technology Superman used to create his Fortress of Solitude to create a massive new continent which would swallow some of the current land masses bordering the Atlantic. The world will then be <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his new land. Placing a crystal inside a shell of refined kryptonite, Luthor triggers the new land growth by launching it into the sea.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{machine guns}} {{continued}} to assault the American lines, and Americans who had expended their ammunition were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> their weapons as clubs. Of 667 men in 3rd Battalion, over 60 percent became casualties, including the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carl Jensen, {{and much of}} the battalion staff. Shattered, 3rd Battalion was forced to withdraw in small groups, many of its soldiers already captured or forced to escape on foot through the countryside back to American lines. Most of the retreating men were also captured. Remaining soldiers formed a provisional company of 150 for the retreat. In total 90 percent of the battalion's equipment, including weapons and helmets, was lost. Another four of the M24 tanks were also destroyed without disabling any of the North Korean T34s.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday morning {{sessions}} {{were held in}} damp weather conditions with intermittent rain. Häkkinen set the third session's fastest time, a 1:44.144, one-tenth of a second quicker than Pedro de la Rosa. Coulthard was third fastest, ahead of Frentzen and Salo. Trulli, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, Villeneuve and Fisichella rounded out the top ten fastest drivers. In the final practice session, Häkkinen set the fastest time of the day, a 1:41.658; Coulthard finished with the third-fastest time. The Ferrari drivers were again quick—Michael Schumacher in second and Barrichello in fourth. Frentzen slipped to fifth, with Fisichella sixth fastest and was happy with his car's feel. Button was seventh fastest, in front of Salo. Villeneuve and Trulli completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Fisichella's car suffered an engine failure in the closing seconds of the session and a crash by Michael Schumacher after the session concluded meant that the German was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his team's spare car for qualifying.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} of the United States set up the National Helium Reserve in 1925 at Amarillo, Texas, {{with the goal of}} supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime. Because of the Helium Control Act (1927), which banned the export of scarce helium on which the US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of the gas, the Hindenburg, like all German Zeppelins, was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> hydrogen as the lift gas. The helium market after World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel (among other uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{news that}} {{powerful}} air support {{was on its}} way to bolster the 6th Army boosted German morale. Army commanders, such as Paulus and Bock, placed so much confidence in the Luftwaffe that they ordered their forces not to risk an attack without air support. In the meantime, Fliegerkorps VI, was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> every available aircraft. Although meeting more numerous Soviet air forces, he achieved air superiority and limited the German ground forces' losses to Soviet aviation, but with some crews flying more than 10 missions per day. By 15 May, Pflugbeil was reinforced and received Kampfgeschwader 27 (Bomber Wing 27, or KG 27), Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51), Kampfgeschwader 55 (KG 55) and Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) equipped with Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 bombers. Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 (Dive Bomber Wing 77, or StG 77) also arrived to add direct ground support. Pflugbeil now had 10 bomber, six fighter and four Junkers Ju 87 Stuka Gruppen (Groups). Logistical difficulties meant that only 54.5 per cent were operational.|$|E
5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} {{can use a}} variety of weapons, {{including}} dual pistols, dual Uzis, a Desert Eagle, a shotgun, an MP5 submachine gun, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and a harpoon gun for underwater use. The dual pistols have infinite ammunition and are Lara's default weapons, while the other weapons have finite ammunition and must be found in the levels. At one point in the game, Lara will be stripped of all her weapons, leaving the player defenceless and <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> stealth, before recovering her pistols later. Lara has a certain amount of health that decreases if she falls from a great height or when she is attacked by enemies. If Lara's health is fully depleted, the player must start the game again from a previous save point. Saving the player's progress on the PlayStation version of the game requires a memory card and consumes a Save Crystal from Lara's inventory. These can be found throughout each level and do not require the player to save the game at the pick-up spot.|$|E

5|$|With the Canary Islands' {{power grid}} {{substantially}} disrupted, the Unelco-Endesa power company was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> temporary generators to boost power at sub-stations {{far from the}} main grid. In La Corujera in Santa Úrsula, these generators were poorly received and over 1,000local residents claimed {{to be affected by}} the noise and pollution. Children, the elderly and people with respiratory problems suffered most acutely. Roughly €25million (US$37.25million) was allocated by the government of the Canary Islands in relief and reconstruction funds. Of this total, €22.5million (US$33.5million) was used to repair infrastructure and utilities; €1.5million (US$2.2million) was used for agricultural relief; and €1million (US$1.5million) was used in home repairs. Due to the severity of crop losses, farmers would be given a grant from the government that would cover 50% of their losses, including infrastructural. A tax break was also given to most residents who suffered damage from Delta.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in the game, Florida State was fully {{committed}} to running down the clock and executed three straight rushing plays to keep the time running out. Virginia Tech was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> two of its timeouts to stop the clock, but was eventually successful in forcing a Seminole punt. The kick rolled inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line before being downed, pinning the Hokies deep in their territory. The first play of Tech's drive was almost a disaster for Virginia Tech, as Marcus Vick fumbled the ball while attempting to avoid a sack. Fortunately for the Hokies, the ball was leapt on by Tech's Duane Brown and the drive stayed alive. Virginia Tech moved the ball downfield through the air with difficulty. Due to the limited time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to rely mainly on passing plays, which stopped the clock when incomplete or were completed for a first down. A 14-yard pass to Josh Morgan and a 10-yard throw to Cedric Humes moved the Hokies to their 47-yard line. Vick then completed a 19-yard pass to Jeff King and Florida State committed a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty on Marcus Vick, which was tacked onto the end of the play. After the penalty, Virginia Tech's offense was deep in Florida State territory, and two plays later, Marcus Vick ran into the end zone on a one-yard quarterback scramble. Rather than attempt another two-point conversion, the Hokies kicked the extra point, and with 1:44 remaining, Virginia Tech had closed the gap to 2722.|$|E
5|$|Following the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} to cut Nebraska's lead before halftime. The Hokies started at their 20-yard line after a touchback, and Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 20-yard throw to Bryan Jennings after Oxendine was stopped for no gain on a carry to the left. From the Tech 40-yard line, Oxendine carried the ball 39 yards for another first down deep inside Nebraska's {{half of the}} field. Nebraska committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but Virginia Tech was stopped for short gains on the two plays following the penalty. Virginia Tech was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a timeout {{in order to stop}} the clock from moving and to allow time to plan the third-down play. With 57 seconds remaining in the first half, Parker ran the remaining two yards for a first down at the Nebraska 11-yard line. Druckenmiller then completed a five-yard pass to Cornelius White, but because White was unable to get out of bounds or cross the goal line, Tech was again forced to call a timeout to stop the clock with 25 seconds remaining. On the next play, Druckenmiller completed a six-yard pass to Shawn Scales for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The score came with 19 seconds remaining in the first half, and the extra point was good, cutting Nebraska's lead to 1714.|$|E
