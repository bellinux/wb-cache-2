5|$|In 1984, a {{candidate}} for a Roman fort was identified by aerial photography at Easter Galcantray, south west of Cawdor. The site was excavated between 1984 and 1988 and several features were identified which are supportive of this classification. Roman pottery similar to that found at Inchtuthill Roman fort has been discovered. If confirmed, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the most northerly known Roman forts in the British Isles.|$|E

On the 25th of February 2016, the band posted on their Facebook page, a CDR bearing their name in marker pen.|$|E
5|$|Oganesson is {{expected}} to have by far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, almost double that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it {{is expected}} that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This {{is very different from the}} previously estimated values of 263K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under standard conditions, and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases.|$|E

5|$|With Jock in {{increasingly}} {{poor health}} after the war, the Smith family briefly considered sending Ian {{to start a}} life in the United States {{with the help of}} Jock's brother Elijah, who had become a prosperous New York businessman. Smith showed little interest in leaving Rhodesia, however, and decided that he would finish at university, then come home and buy his own farm. He returned to Rhodesia in early-1946 to find the campus swamped with veterans like himself—there were 400 of them out of barely 1,000 students. Smith became spokesman for the university's ex-servicemen, senior student of his hall and Chairman of the students' representative council. He turned down the presidency of the rowing club, saying <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> administrative commitment too many, but agreed to coach the crew. Training the rowers under strict military-style discipline, he led them to victory at the 1946 South African Inter-Varsity Boat Race at the Vaal Dam south of Johannesburg, upstaging the well-fancied Wits crew, and subsequently received national-standard varsity honours for rowing, the first Rhodes student ever to do so. At the end of the year, having passed the exams to gain his commerce degree ("by some miracle", he recalled), he returned to Southern Rhodesia to study farming at Gwebi Agricultural College, near Salisbury.|$|E

25|$|In 1891, Douglas met Oscar Wilde; {{although}} the playwright was {{married with two}} sons, they soon began an affair. In 1894, the Robert Hichens novel The Green Carnation was published.

However, following delays to {{the launch of the}} HD DVD format (which pushed back the release of many of the initially announced titles), Constantine eventually made its debut on HD DVD on June 6, 2006. Warner Home Video released a Blu-ray Disc version of the film on October 14, 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Coronation in Saint-Denis is {{the last}} scene on the North End of the West Wall, showing the {{completion}} of Marie's divinely assisted preparation. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of two paintings most visually apparent upon entrance into the gallery through the southeast corner. Rubens composes The Coronation in Saint-Denis for distanced viewing by employing accents of red. For example, the robes of two cardinals near the right edge.

25|$|On November 17, 1998, museum {{trustees}} {{announced plans}} to expand the museum yet again. Museum personnel had been in discussion with Philip Johnson for some time regarding the need to alter Johnson’s 1977 addition. Johnson’s solution was to demolish both the 1964 and 1977 additions and create a new, much larger structure behind the 1961 building. Philip Johnson spearheaded the new design in collaboration with his partner Alan Ritchie. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the last projects on which Johnson worked. In August 1999 the museum was {{closed to the public}} for an extended period while the 1961 building was refurbished, the 1964 and 1977 additions were removed, and the new addition constructed.|$|E
25|$|Wednesday 16 February— Ash Wednesday on the Christian calendar—dawned {{as another}} unrelentingly hot, dry day. The weather early on Ash Wednesday was complex {{and did not}} signify how the day would develop. A front {{separated}} hot, dry air {{coming in from the}} interior to the north, from cooler air moving eastwards from the Southern Ocean. Ahead of the front were hot, turbulent, gale force northerly winds. Temperatures around Melbourne and Adelaide quickly rose above 43°C, with winds gusting up to 100km/h and relative humidity plunging to as low as 6 per cent. From mid-morning, McArthur's fire danger index was in excess of 100 in several places in Victoria and South Australia. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the worst fire weather days in south-east Australia since the disastrous Black Friday bushfires in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Melias soon {{occupied}} {{the old and}} deserted fortress of Lykandos, refortified it and made it his seat. Emperor Leo soon raised it and its surrounding region to a kleisoura. Settled by Armenian immigrants, for the next decades, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the main Byzantine bases of attack against the Arabs. In a similar manner, Melias proceeded to occupy the mountainous regions of Tzamandos and Symposion, which became a kleisoura and a tourma respectively. The threat that this new province and Melias's activities posed on the Arab emirates of the frontier zone (Thughur) is recognized in Arab sources, where Melias is mentioned as sahib al-Durub ("Lord of the Passes"). In 909 or 912, a major assault led by Rustam ibn Baradu was launched against him, but was repulsed. In 914/5, the Arabs of Tarsus launched an attack on Tzamandos, which they took and razed, but in retaliation Melias and his men raided Arab territory as far as Marash (Germanikeia, modern Kahramanmaraş), reportedly bringing back 50,000 captives.|$|E
