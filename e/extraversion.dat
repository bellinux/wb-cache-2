25|$|Myers–Briggs {{literature}} {{uses the}} terms <b>extraversion</b> and introversion as Jung first used them. <b>Extraversion</b> means literally outward-turning and introversion, inward-turning. These specific definitions differ somewhat {{from the popular}} usage of the words. Note that <b>extraversion</b> is the spelling used in MBTI publications.|$|E
25|$|There are two higher-order {{factors that}} both {{taxonomies}} clearly share: <b>extraversion</b> and neuroticism. Both approaches broadly accept that <b>extraversion</b> {{is associated with}} sociability and positive affect, whereas neuroticism is associated with emotional instability and negative affect.|$|E
25|$|As earlier stated, extraverts {{are often}} {{found to have}} higher levels of {{happiness}} and positive affect than introverts. An influential review article concluded that personality, specifically <b>extraversion</b> and emotional stability, was the best predictor of subjective well-being. As examples, Argyle and Lu (1990) found that the trait of <b>extraversion,</b> as measured by <b>Extraversion</b> Scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), was positively and significantly correlated with happiness, as measured by the Oxford Happiness Inventory. Using the same happiness and <b>extraversion</b> scales, Hills and Argyle (2001) found that happiness was again significantly correlated with <b>extraversion.</b> Also, the study by Emmons and Diener (1986) showed that <b>extraversion</b> correlates positively and significantly with positive affect but not with negative affect. Similar results were found in a large longitudinal study by Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992), which assessed 14,407 participants from 100 areas of continental United States. Using the abbreviated General Well-Being Schedule, which tapped positive and negative affects, and Costa and McCrae's (1986) short version of the NEO's <b>Extraversion</b> scale, the authors reported that extraverts experienced greater well-being at two points in time, during which data were collected: first between 1971 and 1975, and later between 1981 and 1984. Furthermore, Larsen and Ketelaar (1991) showed that extraverts respond more to positive affect than to negative affect, since they exhibit more positive-affect reactivity to the positive-affect induction, yet they do not react more negatively to the negative-affect induction.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{interactions}} between <b>extraversion,</b> neuroticism, and conscientiousness have demonstrated significant impacts on subjective-well being. In one study, researchers used three scale to assess subjective well-being. They found that <b>extraversion</b> only {{served as a}} predictor for one assessment, in conjunction with neuroticism, while the other two assessment outcomes were better predicted by conscientiousness and neuroticism. In addition {{to the importance of}} including other factors in happiness assessments, this study also demonstrates the manner in which an operational definition of well-being changes whether <b>extraversion</b> emerges as a salient predictive factor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extraversion</b> and {{introversion}} – {{personality traits}} of degrees of openness or reserve contributing to psychological type.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extraversion</b> {{has also}} been linked to {{physiological}} factors such as respiration, through its association with surgency.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{instrumental}} view, {{one explanation for}} greater subjective well-being among extraverts could be that <b>extraversion</b> helps {{in the creation of}} life circumstances, which promote high levels of positive affect. Specifically, the personality trait of <b>extraversion</b> is seen as a facilitator of more social interactions, since the low cortical arousal among extraverts results in them seeking more social situations in order to increase their arousal.|$|E
25|$|Though <b>extraversion</b> and {{neuroticism}} seem to {{have the}} largest effect on personal happiness, other Big 5 personality factors have also been shown to correlate with happiness and subjective well-being. For example, one study showed that conscientiousness and agreeableness correlated about 0.20 with subjective well-being. While the effect of these traits was not as strong as <b>extraversion</b> or neuroticism, it is clear that they still have some impact on happiness outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{explanation}} of the high correlation between <b>extraversion</b> and happiness comes from the study by Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen (2002). They suggested that the core element of <b>extraversion</b> {{is a tendency to}} behave in ways that attract, hold, and enjoy social attention, and not reward sensitivity. They claimed that one of the fundamental qualities of social attention is its potential of being rewarding. Therefore, if a person shows positive emotions of enthusiasm, energy, and excitement, that person is seen favorably by others and he or she gains others' attention. This favorable reaction from others likely encourages extraverts to engage in further extraverted behavior. Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen's (2002) study showed that their measure of social attention, the Social Attention Scale, was much more highly correlated with <b>extraversion</b> than were measures of reward sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Consumers' {{choices in}} music {{have been studied}} {{as they relate to}} the Big Five {{personality}} traits: openness to experience, agreeableness, <b>extraversion,</b> neuroticism, and conscientiousness. In general, the plasticity traits (openness to experience and <b>extraversion)</b> affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness). Gender has been shown to influence preference, with men choosing music for primarily cognitive reasons and women for emotional reasons. Relationships with music preference have also been found with mood and nostalgic association.|$|E
25|$|Big Five {{personality}} traits, ("the five-factor model"). Many psychologists currently {{believe that}} five factors are sufficient: neuroticism, <b>extraversion,</b> openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.|$|E
25|$|In {{multiple}} studies, neuroticism {{has been}} shown to have an equal, if not larger, impact on happiness and subjective well-being than <b>extraversion.</b> One study classified school children into four categories based on their scores in assessments of <b>extraversion</b> and emotional stability (neuroticism). The results showed {{no significant difference between the}} happiness levels of stable introverts and stable extraverts, while unstable extraverts and introverts both demonstrated significantly less happiness than their counterparts. In this study, neuroticism appeared to be the more salient factor for overall well-being.|$|E
25|$|Eysenck {{compared}} this trait to {{the four}} temperaments of ancient medicine, with choleric and sanguine temperaments equating to <b>extraversion,</b> and melancholic and phlegmatic temperaments equating to introversion.|$|E
25|$|A study {{comparing}} the TCI {{to the five}} factor model of personality found that reward dependence was substantially positively associated with <b>extraversion</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent openness to experience.|$|E
25|$|The two {{personality}} dimensions <b>extraversion</b> and neuroticism {{were described}} in his 1967 book Dimensions of Personality. It is {{common practice in}} personality psychology {{to refer to the}} dimensions by the first letters, E and N.|$|E
25|$|Though <b>extraversion</b> has {{consistently}} {{been shown to}} have a strong correlation with happiness and well-being, these findings are complicated by the presence of other personality traits that act as strong indicators of happiness.|$|E
25|$|In some {{theories}} and systems, traits are something a person either has {{or does not}} have, but in many others traits are dimensions such as <b>extraversion</b> vs. introversion, with each person rating somewhere along this spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Myers and Briggs {{added another}} {{dimension}} to Jung's typological model by identifying that people {{also have a}} preference for using either the judging function (thinking or feeling) or their perceiving function (sensing or intuition) when relating {{to the outside world}} (<b>extraversion).</b>|$|E
25|$|Other cultures, such as Japan {{and regions}} where Orthodox Christianity, Buddhism, Sufism etc. prevail, prize introversion. These {{cultural}} differences predict individuals' happiness in {{that people who}} score higher in <b>extraversion</b> are happier, on average, in particularly extraverted cultures and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have found that SWB {{constructs}} are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the five factor model. Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable. Specifically, neuroticism predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst <b>extraversion,</b> agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A meta-analysis found that neuroticism, <b>extraversion,</b> agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.|$|E
25|$|Acknowledging that {{introversion}} and <b>extraversion</b> {{are normal}} variants of behavior {{can help in}} self-acceptance and understanding of others. For example, an extravert can accept his/her introverted partner's need for space, while an introvert can acknowledge his/her extraverted partner's need for social interaction.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to define {{introversion}} and <b>extraversion</b> in a psychological context. In Jung’s Psychological Types, he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, Apollo and Dionysus. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extrovert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. Jungian introversion and <b>extraversion</b> is quite different from the modern idea of introversion and extroversion. Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness etc.) whereas Jungian introversion and <b>extraversion</b> is expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world subjectively, whereas extraverts interpret the world objectively.|$|E
25|$|The four {{functions}} {{operate in}} conjunction with the attitudes (<b>extraversion</b> and introversion). Each function is used in either an extraverted or introverted way. A person whose dominant function is extraverted intuition, for example, uses intuition very differently from someone whose dominant function is introverted intuition.|$|E
25|$|In this book, Eysenck {{suggests}} that political {{behavior may be}} analysed in terms of two independent dimensions: the traditional left-right distinction, and how 'tenderminded' or 'toughminded' a person is. Eysenck {{suggests that}} {{the latter is a}} result of a person's introversion or <b>extraversion</b> respectively.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{in later}} studies, {{researchers}} used assessment scales {{to test for}} categories such as self-esteem and life-goal orientation, which they had positively correlated with happiness. Participants’ responses to these scales suggested that neuroticism actually had a larger impact than <b>extraversion</b> in measures of well-being.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that people high in agreeableness are more emotionally {{responsive}} in social situations. This effect was measured on both self-report questionnaires and physiological measures, and offers evidence that <b>extraversion</b> and neuroticism {{are not the only}} Big Five personality factors that influence emotion. The effect was especially pronounced among women.|$|E
25|$|Many lower-order factors, or facets, {{are similar}} {{between the two}} taxonomies. For instance, both {{approaches}} contain factors for sociability/gregariousness, for activity levels, and for assertiveness within the higher order factor <b>extraversion.</b> However, there are differences too. First, the three-factor approach contains nine lower-order factors and the five-factor approach has six.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have found}} a {{correlation}} between <b>extraversion</b> and self-reported happiness. That is, more extraverted people tend to {{report higher levels of}} happiness than introverts. Other research has shown that being instructed to act in an extraverted manner leads to increases in positive affect, even for people who are trait-level introverts.|$|E
25|$|Eysenck {{originally}} {{suggested that}} <b>extraversion</b> {{was a combination}} of two major tendencies, impulsiveness and sociability. He later added several other more specific traits, namely liveliness, activity level, and excitability. These traits are further linked in his personality hierarchy to even more specific habitual responses, such as partying on the weekend.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} <b>extraversion</b> and {{introversion}} is most commonly assessed through self-report measures, although peer-reports and third-party observation {{can also be}} used. Self-report measures are either lexical or based on statements. The type of measure is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties and the time and space constraints of the research being undertaken.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} importance of nature versus environment in determining the level of <b>extraversion</b> is controversial and the focus of many studies. Twin studies have found a genetic component of 39% to 58%. In terms of the environmental component, the shared family environment appears to be far less important than individual environmental factors that are not shared between siblings.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the central}} {{concepts}} of analytical psychology is individuation—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation {{of the self}} out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered {{it to be the}} main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the psychological complex, and <b>extraversion</b> and introversion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extraversion</b> and Neuroticism in the Big Five {{are very}} similar to Eysenck's traits of the same name. However, what he calls the trait of Psychoticism {{corresponds}} to two traits in the Big Five model: Conscientiousness and Agreeableness (Goldberg & Rosalack 1994). Eysenck's personality system did not address Openness to experience. He argued that his approach was a better description of personality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extraversion</b> {{has been}} linked to higher {{sensitivity}} of the mesolimbic dopamine system to potentially rewarding stimuli. This in part explains the high levels of positive affect found in extraverts, since they will more intensely feel the excitement of a potential reward. One consequence of this is that extraverts can more easily learn the contingencies for positive reinforcement, since the reward itself is experienced as greater.|$|E
25|$|For {{those with}} an overall {{preference}} for <b>extraversion,</b> the function with the extraverted attitude will be the dominant function. For example, for an ESTJ type the dominant function is the judging function, thinking, and this is experienced with an extraverted attitude. This is notated as a dominant Te. For an ESTP, the dominant function is the perceiving function, sensing, notated as a dominant Se.|$|E
25|$|Although neither {{introversion}} nor <b>extraversion</b> is pathological, psychotherapists {{can take}} temperament {{into account when}} treating clients. Clients may respond better to different types of treatment depending on where they fall on the introversion-extraversion spectrum. Teachers can also consider temperament when dealing with their pupils, for example acknowledging that introverted children need more encouragement to speak in class while extraverted children may grow restless during long periods of quiet study.|$|E
