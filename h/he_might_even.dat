25|$|Crowned (1989) tackles {{a similar}} theme, {{but from the}} {{perspective}} of the founding fathers. The film, based on a play by author Yaakov Shabtai (adapted by Ephraim Sidon and Ram Loevy), is an intense comedy based on the final days of the biblical King David. As his life approaches its end, he faces the most difficult task of his forty-year reign—giving up his crown to the next generation. Or perhaps <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> find a way to keep the crown for himself. The fact that this film was aired when Israel was itself forty years old was not lost on its audience.|$|E
25|$|Even in the {{earliest}} times the chief qualifications demanded of the hazzan, in addition to knowledge of Biblical and liturgical literature {{as well as the}} prayer motifs (known as steiger), were a pleasant voice and an artistic delivery; for the sake of these, many faults were willingly overlooked. The hazzan was required to possess a pleasing appearance, to be married, and to have a flowing beard. Sometimes, according to Isaac of Vienna (13th century), a young hazzan having only a slight growth of beard was tolerated. Maimonides decided that the hazzan who recited the prayers on an ordinary Sabbath and on weekdays need not possess an appearance pleasing to everybody; <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> have a reputation not wholly spotless, provided he was living a life morally free from reproach {{at the time of his}} appointment.|$|E
500|$|Early in April, Philip Schuyler had {{approached}} Arnold {{with the possibility}} of giving him the command at West Point. Discussions had not borne fruit between Schuyler and Washington by early June. Arnold reopened the secret channels with the British, informing them of Schuyler's proposals and including Schuyler's assessment of conditions at West Point. He also provided information on a proposed French-American invasion of Quebec that was to go up the Connecticut River (Arnold did not know that this proposed invasion was a ruse intended to divert British resources). On June 16, Arnold inspected West Point while on his way home to Connecticut to take care of personal business, and he sent a highly detailed report through the secret channel. When he reached Connecticut, Arnold arranged to sell his home there and began transferring assets to London through intermediaries in New York. By early July, he was back in Philadelphia, where he wrote another secret message to Clinton on July 7 which implied that his appointment to West Point was assured and that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> provide a [...] "drawing of the works ... by which you might take [...] without loss".|$|E

2500|$|After {{only nine}} first grade games, in 1970–71 Hughes was {{included}} in the Western Australian Sheffield Shield squad. Described at the time by Test wicket-keeper Rod Marsh as [...] "a technically perfect batsman", the Perth press speculated <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> make his first-class cricket debut later that season. Instead, Hughes suffered from the [...] "second-year blues" [...] and struggled for runs, averaging only 23 for the season.

In this time he managed to retain selection in the state colts team; in one match against the Victorian colts scoring a dashing 97, before being caught on the boundary attempting to make his century from a six. It would be four years after his maiden first grade century that Hughes would make his second, against North Perth.|$|E
2500|$|Künneth's {{reply to}} Harnack's cultured successors is to explain Aberglaube neither in pietistic {{terms of a}} natural Jesus, nor in Bultmann's existential manner of {{essential}} myth. His apologetic for the Resurrection, then, is dogmatic and historical at once : he appeals to the Jewish materialistic understanding of the totality of death in judgement, {{as well as the}} philosophical inadequacy of ethic-moral explanations that presume upon the immortality of the soul. Künneth absolutely accepted an empty tomb, but he thought that most modern problems with the Resurrection began as dogmatic misconceptions. Künneth would have accepted few of the modern Church's efforts to defend the Resurrection, whether in Van Til's presuppositions, retreatist Pietism that avoids debating the central fact of the religion, or liberal accommodations to the spirit of free inquiry. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> have disagreed with Alvin Plantinga's formulation of the Resurrection as something that is [...] "plausible might have happened". Künneth seemed to have believed that Time itself was without any meaning unless it had, as its absolute reference point, the unleashing of the exalted Christ out of the tomb.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{the belief}} that God exists but is not wholly good, or that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> be evil. The {{opposite}} concept is eutheism, the belief that God exists and is wholly good. Eutheism and dystheism are straightforward Greek formations from eu- and dys- + theism, paralleling atheism; [...] in the sense of [...] "godless, ungodly" [...] appearing e.g. in Aeschylus (Agamemnon 1590). The terms are nonce coinages, used by University of Texas at Austin philosophy professor Robert C. Koons in a 1998 [...] According to Koons, [...] "eutheism is the thesis that God exists and is wholly good, [...] dystheism is the thesis that God exists but is not wholly good." [...] However, many proponents of dystheistic ideas (including Elie Wiesel and David Blumenthal) do not offer those ideas in the spirit of hating God. Their work notes God's apparent evil or at least indifferent disinterest in the welfare of humanity, but does not express hatred towards him because of it. A notable usage of the concept that the gods are either indifferent or actively hostile towards humanity is in the Cthulhu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft.|$|E

60|$|He {{was not an}} ill-disposed young man, unless to {{be rather}} cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected; for he {{conducted}} himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties.

2500|$|Livy is {{the only}} source for the events of 297 BC. He wrote that envoys from Sutrium, Nepete (Romans colonies) and Falerii in {{southern}} Etruria arrived in Rome with news that the Etruscan city-states were discussing suing for peace. This freed both consuls, who marched on Samnium, Quintus Fabius by way of Sora and Publius Decius through {{the land of the}} Sidicini. A Samnite army had prepared to confront them in a valley near Tifernum, but it was defeated by Quintus Fabius. [...] Meanwhile, Publius Decius had camped at Maleventum where an Apulian army would have joined the Samnites in the battle against Quintus Fabius had Publius Decius not defeated it. The two consuls then spent four months ravaging Samnium. [...] Fabius also seized Cimetra (location unknown). [...] There are no major problems with Livy's account, but no parallel sources survive to confirm it either. Fabius' route via Sora to Tifernum is convoluted, but not insurmountable. [...] The appearance of an Apulian army at Maleventum is surprising since nothing is known of Apulian hostility to Rome since the conclusion of peace in 312 BC. [...] However the Apulians might have been divided in their alliance with Rome or have been provoked to war by the campaign of Barbatus the previous year. Publius Decius' campaign fits within the larger pattern of Roman warfare in south-eastern Italy; <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> have wintered in Apulia. No triumphs are recorded in this year for either of the consuls, hence they are unlikely to have had any victories of great significance or made any deep inroads into Samnium.|$|E
2500|$|Holland and Smith {{disagreed}} {{about which}} actor {{should have the}} part of Ali; Holland preferred Bilginer, while Smith preferred Salih. Holland believed Bilginer possessed the right [...] "look" [...] and that Salih was not tall or tough-looking enough, [...] "he didn't have the sort of physical presence that put you on your guard." [...] He also believed that Sandy Ratcliff, the actress playing Ali's wife Sue, would have [...] "made mincemeat of [...] ". Additionally, Holland visioned Ali with a moustache, and unlike Bilginer, Salih was unable to grow one. Conversely, Smith felt that Salih was [...] "the genuine article. Not Turkish, but Turkish-Cypriot. He would have so much actual knowledge {{to bring to the}} character [...] He wouldn't have to act the part, he was the part." [...] Both actors were given a script reading with the actress who would play Ali's wife, Sandy Ratcliff, who arrived for the reading 45 minutes late. Bilginer read with Ratcliff first, and Holland and Smith have commented that he [...] "had obviously thought about the part [...] because there was much more physical power in his performance. At one stage Julia and Tony were worried that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> hit Sandy!" [...] Salih read next, and after being introduced to Ratcliff who apologised for her tardiness, to which Salih replied [...] "Not to worry. Typical bloody woman!" [...] His quip impressed Holland and Smith; they have since commented that Salih almost got the part on the strength of that line alone, as the felt it typified the character perfectly. Salih was eventually given the part of Ali, but as there were only two suitable Turkish speaking actors available, and as Ali would need a brother, Bilginer was given the part of Mehmet Osman.|$|E
