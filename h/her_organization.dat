25|$|Dot Robinson {{was born}} April 22, 1912 in Australia. James Goulding, Robinson's father, was a {{motorcyclist}} {{who worked as}} a sidecar designer and an amateur racer. When Robinson was about six years old her father moved him and his family to the United States in 1918 in hopes to expand his sidecar designing business. Robinson was almost destined to ride a motorcycle because Robinson's father was into the business and ran a motorcycle dealership, so at a young age Robinson became well acquainted with operating a bike. In high school Dot met her future husband Earl who she would eventually marry in 1931 and together they partook in multiple races. Dot entered herself in a Jack Pine National Endurance Championship in 1934, and by 1940 she won Jack Pine and became known as the first woman to win an AMA national competition. In 1935 Harley-Davidson asked Dot and her high school sweetheart, Earl, to run a dealership. Shortly after Davidson requested they help him by opening a dealership the Robinsons moved to Detroit where they operated a successful Harley-Davidson dealership until 1971. Linda Dugeau and Dot Robinson met in 1940 at the Laconia national and within months the Motor Maids organization was in full motion. Dot was president of the organization and Linda secretary of the organization. The motorcyclist image was always black with leather until Dot Robinson changed the attire allowing women to continue to have their femininity. Robinson was always seen as a very classy lady and she wanted all women who were included in <b>her</b> <b>organization</b> to have the same image. The change Dot made the attire of <b>her</b> <b>organization</b> made a statement of empowerment while still feminine. When the Robinsons retired from the dealership in 1971 they begin to travel together by motorcycle until Earl died I 1996. Even after Dot's husband died she continued to ride and explore until 1998 when a knee replacement slowed her down, and on October 8, 1999 Dot Robinson died at age 87.|$|E

25|$|Milk and White forge {{a complex}} working relationship. Milk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White's first child, and White asks for Milk's {{assistance}} in preventing {{a psychiatric hospital}} from opening in White's district, possibly in exchange for White's support of Milk's citywide gay rights ordinance. When Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed, and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. Milk also launches an effort to defeat Proposition 6, an initiative on the California state ballot in November 1978.
