Under both scenarios, accelerated quota growth is the main device for phaseout. Country quotas, in the first approach, and <b>global</b> <b>quotas</b> in the second, will have to expand in such a way to avoid a"shock"when they are abolished {{at the end of the}} phaseout. The second most important element in the phaseout proposals, besides expanding quotas and abolishing them at the end of the phaseout period, is scrapping them along the way according to some predetermined criteria and scheme. In the proposals, this is defined in terms of country characteristics, specific products, product characteristics, or some criterion pertaining to the historical record, such a quota use. The historical record reveals that growth in highly utilized quotas was significantly lower compared with unfilled quotas. There is one important virtue in a phaseout based on the current structure of the MFA. Not only are the mechanisms in place familiar to the negotiating parties, but so are the magnitudes of most of the parameters: current quota levels, quota growth rates over the last few years, and their use ratios.

The ICO set Uganda's annual export quota at only 4 percent of worldwide coffee exports. During December 1988, a wave of coffee buying pushed the ICO price up and triggered two increases of 1 million (60- kilogram) bags each in worldwide coffee production limits. The rising demand and rising price resulted in a 1989 <b>global</b> <b>quota</b> increase to 58 million bags. Uganda's export quota rose only by about 3,013 bags, however, bringing it to just over 2.3 million bags. Moreover, Uganda's entire quota increase was allocated to arabica coffee, which was grown primarily in the small southeastern region of Bugisu. In revenue terms, Uganda's overall benefit from the world price increase was small, as prices for robusta coffee—the major export—remained depressed.|$|E

Ill. map (some col.) Many {{accounts of the}} globalization of production in the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries focus on the boom of new foreign direct investment in so-called global factories in the global South. Global Displacements shifts the focus of academic inquiry to an equally pervasive moment of transnational capitalist production: the collapse of labourintensive employment strategies and the restructuring of spatial and social divisions of labour in their wake. Drawing on ethnographic methods and historical accounts of economic change in the Dominican Republic’s northern Cibao region, I consider the restructuring of the country’s export apparel industry, the most long-standing and successful in the circum-Caribbean. Over the past decade, facing increased competition for US market share and a new regime of trade regulation without <b>global</b> <b>quotas,</b> garment firms in the Dominican Republic undertook a process of restructuring, including the retrenchment {{of the majority of}} the country’s garment workforce. I explore this process from the perspective of four sociospatial locations: Dominican firms integrated into transnational production assemblages, the embodied labour geographies of former garment workers, the layered histories of accumulation and disinvestment of the Cibao region and its border with Haiti, and my own position as a researcher. Bringing the insights of deconstruction and Marxist and feminist theory to bare on a critical ethnography of industrial restructuring, I examine geographies of production as constituted by displacements: that is, the complex mechanism of inclusion in and exclusion from circuits of capital accumulation that reproduce subjects and places with difference. My study of displacements in the Dominican Republic illustrates how accumulation proceeds through the reproduction of hierarchies of labour, premised upon reworking the violent abstractions of race, gender and nation along existing and new spatial contours of profit-making and disinvestment. Geographies of work and industrial restructuring in the Dominican Republic reveal problematic assumptions that lie behind much contemporary analysis of industrial change. Many accounts frame global industrial restructuring since the 1970 s as a process of outward capitalist expansion, incorporating new places and new subjects into transnational labour processes. Such a framing reduces complex, nonlinear experiences of industrial transformation to a teleological sequence, where industrialization serves a marker of “development,” signifying a measure of one’s closeness or distance from Eurocentric modernity. By decentering teleological assumptions of industrialization, the geography of displacements presented in the following pages demonstrates industrial restructuring to be an on-going reworking of industrial and deindustrial processes irreducible to fixed and sequential categories of the postindustrial, newly industrializing, or so-called developing worlds...|$|R

The US Pacific Whiting {{fishery is}} a large {{industrial}} fishery with landings over 260 thousand metric tons valued at $ 64 million in 2014. A catch share system was implemented in the fishery in 2011 with IFQs for shoreside vessels and allocations to a mothership and a catcher-processor cooperative. Bycatch {{is a very small}} percentage of total catch, but it includes overfished and protected species with bycatch caps that could potentially close the fishery. Under catch shares, quotas for most bycatch species are allocated to individual shoreside vessels and to the cooperatives. A <b>global</b> bycatch <b>quota</b> is set for Chinook salmon. Bycatch tends to be fairly rare and lumpy creating substantial uncertainty in individual vessel bycatch. Consequently, vessels in each of the sectors have used contractual agreements that pool bycatch quota but require pool members to follow rules designed to reduce bycatch. The structure of these agreements differs by sector. In this presentation we discuss the structure of these risk pool agreements and analyze fishing behavior with respect to the stated rules of the agreements. We examine whether fishing behavior has changed with implementation of these agreements and whether the rules employed appear to be effective at reducing bycatch in comparison to pre-catch share fishing...|$|R

Random fluctuations of cpues around an exponential decrease (i. e. the reference model when fishing efficiencies are constant) lead to modelling fishing efficiency as a random variable. Based on the observations of the ratio between two consecutive catches, a method is developed to estimate the probability density function of fishing efficiencies. The significant decrease of average fishing efficiency between the start of the fishery and its full exploitation phase is explained by a change in regulations (from <b>global</b> to individual <b>quotas).</b> (c) 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.
