5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>race</b> norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of oil on her family's cotton plantation made Hogg very wealthy, {{and she used}} this income to benefit the people of Texas. In 1929, she founded the Houston Child Guidance Center, which provides counseling for children with mental health problems or diagnoses and their families. Through her brother's will, she established the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin in 1940. Hogg successfully ran for {{a seat on the}} Houston School Board in 1943, where she worked to remove <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>race</b> as criteria for determining pay and established art education programs for black students. Hogg never married, and died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in Texas.|$|E
30|$|Despite these factors, active {{learning}} pedagogies may hold promise in addressing underrepresentation.

25|$|The {{construction}} of the Pentagon was done {{during a time when}} parts of the U.S. were under legally-mandated racial segregation. This had structural consequences to the design of the building. Under the supervision of colonel Leslie Groves, the decision to have separate eating and lavatory accommodations for white persons and black persons was made and carried out. The dining areas for black persons were put in the basement and on each floor there were double toilet facilities separated by <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> These measures of segregation were said to have been done in compliance with the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia's racial laws. The Pentagon as a result has twice the number of toilet facilities needed for a building of its size.|$|E
25|$|Women editors such as Margaret Farrar were {{influential}} {{in the first few}} decades of puzzle-making, and women constructors such as Bernice Gordon and Elizabeth Gorski have each contributed hundreds of puzzles to The New York Times. However, in recent years the number of women constructors has declined, and crossword editors at most major papers are all male. During the years that Will Weng and Eugene Maleska edited the New York Times crossword (1969-1993), women constructors accounted for 35% of puzzles, while during the editorship of Will Shortz (1993–present), this percentage has gone down, with women constructors (including collaborations) accounting for only 15% of puzzles in both 2014 and 2015, and 17% of puzzles published in 2016. Several reasons have been given for the decline in women constructors. One explanation is that the gender imbalance in crossword construction is similar to that in related fields, such as journalism, and that more freelance male constructors than females submit puzzles on spec to The New York Times and other outlets. Another explanation is that computer-assisted construction and the increased influence of computational approaches in generating word lists may be making crossword construction more like STEM fields in which women are underrepresented for a number of factors. However, it has also been argued that this explanation risks propagating myths about gender and technology. Some have argued that the relative absence of women constructors and editors has had an influence on the content of the puzzles themselves, and that clues and entries can be insensitive regarding language related to <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> Several approaches have been suggested to develop more women in the field, including mentoring novice women constructors and encouraging women constructors to publish their puzzles independently.|$|E

25|$|By the Second World War and the Labour {{government}} of Clement Attlee, trade union membership was well established and collective agreements covered over 80 per {{cent of the}} workforce. With the British Empire in rapid dissolution, immigration from Commonwealth countries, and record levels of female workplace participation the character of Britain's workforce was changing fast. Though the common law was sometimes comparatively progressive, sometimes not, the first statutes to prohibit discrimination focused on <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>race</b> emerged in the 1960s as the Civil Rights Act was passed in the United States. Discrimination in employment (as in consumer or public service access) was formally prohibited on grounds of race in 1965, gender in 1975, disability in 1995, sexual orientation and religion in 2003 and age in 2006. A complicated and inconsistent jamboree of Acts and statutory instruments was placed into a comprehensive code in the Equality Act 2010. Much discrimination law is now applicable throughout the European Union, to which the UK acceded in 1972. Although labour laws in the early European Treaties and case law were scant, the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty brought employment rights squarely into the EU's jurisprudence. Meanwhile, starting from the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, workers gained {{a growing list of}} minimum statutory rights, such as the right to reasonable notice before a fair dismissal and a redundancy payment. Labour governments through the 1960s and 1970s were troubled by reform of the unwieldy trade union system. Despite producing reports such as In Place of Strife and the Report of the committee of inquiry on industrial democracy which would have made unions accountable to their members and created more direct workplace participation, reform did not take place.|$|E

500|$|Disagreeing with Douglass, {{and despite}} the racist {{language}} she sometimes resorted to, Stanton firmly believed in a universal franchise that empowered blacks and whites, men and women. Speaking on behalf of black women, she stated that not allowing them to vote condemned African American freedwomen [...] "to a triple bondage that man never knows," [...] that of slavery, <b>gender,</b> <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> She was joined in this belief by Anthony, Olympia Brown, and most especially Frances Gage, {{who was the first}} suffragist to champion voting rights for freedwomen. In her work The Slave’s Appeal, written in 1860, Elizabeth Cady Stanton brings awareness not only to feminism, but also to the issues and struggles of slavery. Although not African American, to convey her message best, she wrote from the perspective of one to show that she viewed women’s suffrage as something that should not be limited to only Caucasian women.|$|E

500|$|In Angelou's {{favorite}} poem, [...] "Still I Rise", which shares {{its title}} with a play {{she wrote in}} 1976, she refers to the indomitable spirit of Black people, using repetition and the categorization of injustices against them. She quoted it during interviews and often included it in her public readings. Despite adversity and racism, Angelou expresses her faith that one will overcome and triumph. Hagen compares [...] "Still I Rise" [...] with spirituals that express hope. As she does in [...] "Phenomenal Woman" [...] and throughout her poetry and autobiographies, Angelou speaks not only for herself, but for her entire <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> [...] Reviewer Ellen Lippmann calls [...] "Still I Rise" [...] a [...] "proud, even defiant statement of behalf of all Black people". [...] Angelou, during an interview in 1997, stated that she used the poem to help sustain her during hard times, and that many people, both Black and white, used {{it in the same}} way.|$|E
500|$|Angelou explores many of {{the same}} themes {{throughout}} all her writings, in both her autobiographies and poetry. [...] These themes include love, painful loss, music, discrimination and racism, and struggle. Her poetry cannot easily be placed in categories of themes or techniques. [...] It has been compared with music and musical forms, especially the blues, and like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. [...] Many of her poems are about love, relationships, or overcoming hardships, as expressed in poems of hers such as [...] "Still I Rise", I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, and Million Man March Poem. [...] The metaphors in her poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for meanings understood by other Blacks, but her themes and topics apply universally to all races. [...] Angelou uses everyday language, the Black vernacular, Black music and forms, and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language, the occasional use of profanity, and traditionally unacceptable subjects. [...] As she does throughout her autobiographies, Angelou speaks not only for herself, but for her entire <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> Her poems continue the themes of mild protest and survival also found in her autobiographies, and inject hope through humor. [...] Tied with Angelou's theme of racism is her treatment of the struggle and hardships experienced by her race.|$|E
500|$|As {{she does}} {{throughout}} her autobiographies, Angelou speaks {{not only for}} herself, but for her entire <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> Her poems continue the themes of mild protest and survival also found in her autobiographies, and inject hope through humor. Many of Angelou's poems are personal in nature, especially those in Diiie and Oh Pray, but the theme of racism and connected to it, liberation, is present in her poems and autobiographies. According to DeGout, [...] "a particular gift of the Angelou muse is the translation of personal experience into political discourse". Scholar Kathy M. Essick calls most of the poems in Diiie Angelou's [...] "protest poems". The poems in the second section of Diiie, for example, are militant in tone; according to Hagen, the poems in this section have [...] "more bite" [...] than {{the ones in the}} first section and express the experience of being Black in a white-dominated world. DeGout states, however, that Angelou's poems have levels of meaning, and that poems in the volume's first section present the themes of racism, women's power, and liberation more subtly. DeGout views [...] "A Zorro Man" [...] as an example of Angelou's ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse and the textured liberation she places in all her poetry. Many of Angelou's poems, especially those in Diiie, focus on women's sexual and romantic experiences, but challenge the gender codes of poetry written in previous eras. She also challenges the male-centered and militaristic themes and messages found in the poetry of the Black Arts movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, leading up to the publication of Diiie. DeGout cites [...] "The Couple", which appears in Oh Pray, as another example of Angelou's strategy of combining liberation ideology and poetic techniques.|$|E
