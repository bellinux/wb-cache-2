5|$|Modern historians <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> an {{alliance}} between the Franks and Mongols would {{have been successful in}} shifting {{the balance of power in}} the region, and if it would have been a wise choice on the part of the Europeans. Traditionally, the Mongols tended to see outside parties as either subjects or enemies, with little room in the middle for a concept such as an ally.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> the Ming dynasty had {{sovereignty over}} Tibet. Some {{believe it was}} a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{meaning of}} Keynes's {{work has been}} long debated. Even the {{interpretation}} of Keynes's policy prescription for unemployment, {{one of the more}} explicit parts of General Theory, {{has been the subject of}} debates. Economists and scholars <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> Keynes intended his advice to be a major policy shift to address a serious problem or a moderately conservative solution to deal with a minor issue.|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> pterosaurs ambulated as quadrupeds or as bipeds. In the 1980s, paleontologist Kevin Padian suggested that smaller pterosaurs with longer hindlimbs, such as Dimorphodon, might have walked or even run bipedally, {{in addition to}} flying, like road runners. However, {{a large number of}} pterosaur trackways were later found with a distinctive four-toed hind foot and three-toed front foot; these are the unmistakable prints of pterosaurs walking on all fours.|$|E
5|$|Historians <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> Washington {{preferred}} to fight major battles or to utilize a Fabian strategy to harass the British with quick, sharp attacks {{followed by a}} retreat so that the larger British army could not catch him. His southern commander Greene did use Fabian tactics in 1780–81; Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples. By summer 1777 Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.|$|E

5|$|Historians <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> {{early modern}} {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that would enable them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E
5|$|However, {{throughout}} the history of Christianity a number of relics attributed to Jesus have been claimed, although doubt has been cast on them. The 16thcentury Catholic theologian Erasmus wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics and the number of buildings that could have been constructed from the wood claimed to be from the cross used in the Crucifixion. Similarly, while experts <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> Jesus was crucified with three nails or with four, at least thirty holy nails continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.|$|E
5|$|On the boat, Mulder and Smith <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> {{they should}} save Mulder’s mother Teena, despite {{the risk of}} Men in Black {{awaiting}} them. Mulder ultimately agrees {{that it would be}} too dangerous to visit her. Instead, they head towards Canada, where Smith says Mulder will find his sister, Samantha. Meanwhile, the First Elder (Don S. Williams) meets with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in Teena's hospital room, confronting him with photos of his prior meeting with her, taken by X (Steven Williams). They realize that there is a leak, and plan to smoke out its source by releasing false information about Teena being in danger.|$|E

5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can expand and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E
5|$|Scholars <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> Macbeth's {{vision of}} Banquo is real or a {{hallucination}}. Macbeth {{had already seen}} a hallucination before murdering Duncan: a knife hovering in the air. Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all, heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad, since the audience cannot see what he claims to see. Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual, ghosts of murdered victims are more believable, having a basis in the audience's superstitions. Spirits in other Shakespeare plays—notably Hamlet and Midsummer Night's Dream—exist in ambiguous forms, occasionally even calling into question their own presence.|$|E
5|$|The early Viking threats {{may have}} speeded {{a long term}} process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic {{language}} and customs. There was a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns, although historians continue to <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> it was a Pictish takeover of Dál Riata, or the other way around. This culminated {{in the rise of}} Cínaed mac Ailpín in the 840s, who brought to power the House of Alpin who were leaders of a combined Gaelic-Pictish kingdom for almost two centuries.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave her fate open {{in order for the}} audience to <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> or not she survived the hotel explosion {{at the end of the}} episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, questioning whether or not Ros survived the hotel explosion.|$|E
5|$|The nearby hill forts of Figsbury Ring, Quarley Hill, and Bury Hill were {{probably}} established {{around the same}} time as Danebury. All of a similar size, the hillforts were generally equally spaced, commanding similar sized territories and resources. There is some <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> hill forts were purely defensive structures, and to what extent they were occupied. Cunliffe interprets the ramparts as essentially defensive, although he concedes that they may have been a means of displaying wealth and power, as Danebury would have been visible for miles around.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael spreads a rumor about Stanley having an affair, then spreads a series of false rumors to try to convince everyone the original rumor was not true. The rumors cause Andy to question his sexuality, and Pam and Jim to <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> or not to tell the office that Pam is pregnant.|$|E

5|$|The two armies met near Peritheorion on 7 July 1345. Momchil {{tried to}} seek refuge behind the city's walls— {{scholars}} <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> he actually held {{the city or}} not— but they were shut against him and his men by the locals. The locals did let in Momchil's cousin Rayko along with 50 men, which they hoped would persuade Momchil not to take vengeance on the city if he defeated his opponents. In the subsequent battle before the city walls, Momchil's forces used the Peritheorion's ruined old fortifications as a first line of defence, with the city walls behind them.|$|E
5|$|There are extant liturgical vestments {{containing}} embroidered figures, {{including that}} of St. Barbara, in Lochner's style and with similar facial types. This has led to some speculation whether Lochner provided the models. In addition a number of contemporary stained glass panels are similar in style, {{and there has been}} <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> he might have been responsible for church murals; the over-life size figures of the Dombild and Virgin with the Violet indicate his ability to work on a monumental scale.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} over the clan's origins, Samuel undoubtedly descended from a distinguished family, since an unnamed sister of Stephen I, who had in 1000 or 1001 been crowned the first King of Hungary, {{was given in}} marriage {{to a member of}} the Aba clan around 1009. However, historians still <b>debate</b> <b>whether</b> Samuel himself or Samuel's father married the royal princess. If Samuel was her husband, he must have been born before 990 and converted either from Judaism or paganismto Christianity when he married Stephen I's sister. His Christian credentials are further evidenced by Samuel's establishment of an abbey at Abasár which was recorded by Hungarian chronicles. According to Gyula Kristó and other historians, Samuel's conversion coincided with the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eger encompassing his domains.|$|E
