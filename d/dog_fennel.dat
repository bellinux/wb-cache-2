50|$|Rush County {{was formed}} from the unorganized Delaware County April 1, 1822. On July 29 town lots were sold {{and the town}} started to form. A school had already been started in 1821 by Dr. W.B. Laughlin, {{who was a member}} of the Legislature when the county was formed, and is {{considered}} the founding father of the town. A jail was built, Charles Veeder, was the first postmaster in 1822, and a courthouse was built in 1823. The <b>Dog</b> <b>Fennel</b> Gazette was published in 1823.

40|$|During {{the past}} few years a large amount of butter {{manufactured}} in the Middle West has been criticised for weedy flavors. This increase in weedy flavors unquestionably has resulted from a number of successive dry years. Some of the most common weed defects in this section are wild onion (Allium cernuum), ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) and <b>dog</b> <b>fennel</b> (Anthemis cotula L.). The defects resulting from skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus (L.)), french weed (Thalaspi arvense L.) and peppergrass (Lepidium verginicum L.) (2) are apparently less common. Feed flavors are more important than weed flavors in this section. It has been recognized for some time that silage and alfalfa hay, when fed to dairy herds in fairly large quantities, cause definite milk flavors that are apparent in the butter. Changes in feeding procedures designed to lower fat production costs have, in many cases, increased the problems of the buttermaker. Sweet clover, rye pasture, wheat pasture, soybean hay and cane silage, flavor milk {{to such an extent that}} they affect the quality of the resulting butter...|$|E
40|$|Background/PurposePollen allergy is {{believed}} to be less common in East Asia, Latin America, and tropical areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the role of pollen allergy in Taiwan. MethodsPatients with clinically diagnosed allergic rhinitis were enrolled. All subjects received a 30 -item skin test panel that included perennial allergens (house dust mix, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, dog epithelium, cat hairs, cockroach mix, and Candida albicans) and pollen allergens (acacia, pine mix, eucalyptus, beefwood, juniper mix, willow, mulberry mix, pepper tree, cedar, Johnson grass, Bermuda grass, ragweed mix, Timothy grass, spiny pigweed, cocklebur, sage mix, sheep sorrel, <b>dog</b> <b>fennel,</b> pigweed mix, English plantain, castor bean, alfalfa, and dandelion). ResultsA total of 419 patients were recruited. A total of 313 (74. 7 %) had a positive skin test. A total of 288 patients (68. 7 %) were sensitive to perennial allergens, and 11 8 patients (28. 2 %) were sensitive to pollen allergens. However, 93 pollen-sensitive patients were also sensitive to perennial allergens, and only 25 were sensitive to pollen allergens alone. The most common allergens were D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, house dust mix, and cockroach, but the most common pollen allergens were spiny pigweed, Johnson grass, and sheep sorrel. All nasal symptoms tended to be more severe in patients who were sensitive to perennial allergens than in those who were sensitive to pollen allergens alone. ConclusionMost patients with allergic rhinitis in Taiwan are sensitive to perennial allergens, and pollens are a less common allergen...|$|E
