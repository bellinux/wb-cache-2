40|$|Among the Renormalization Group Theory scaling rules {{relating}} critical exponents, {{there are}} <b>hyperscaling</b> rules involving {{the dimension of}} the system. It {{is well known that}} in Ising models <b>hyperscaling</b> breaks down above the upper critical dimension. It was shown by M. Schwartz [Europhys. Lett. 15, 777 (1991) ] that the standard Josephson <b>hyperscaling</b> rule can also break down in Ising systems with quenched random interactions. A related Renormalization Group Theory <b>hyperscaling</b> rule links the critical exponents for the normalized Binder cumulant and the correlation length in the thermodynamic limit. An appropriate scaling approach for analyzing measurements from criticality to infinite temperature is first outlined. Numerical data on the scaling of the normalized correlation length and the normalized Binder cumulant are shown for the canonical Ising ferromagnet model in dimension three where <b>hyperscaling</b> holds, for the Ising ferromagnet in dimension five (so above the upper critical dimension) where <b>hyperscaling</b> breaks down, and then for Ising spin glass models in dimension three where the quenched interactions are random. For the Ising spin glasses there is a breakdown of the normalized Binder cumulant <b>hyperscaling</b> relation in the thermodynamic limit regime, with a return to size independent Binder cumulant values in the finite-size scaling regime around the critical region.

40|$|We study {{corrections}} to the conformal <b>hyperscaling</b> relation in the conformal {{window of}} the large Nf QCD by using the ladder Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation as a concrete dynamical model. From the analytical expression of {{the solution of the}} ladder SD equation, we identify the form of the leading mass correction to the <b>hyperscaling</b> relation. We find that the anomalous dimension, when identified through the <b>hyperscaling</b> relation neglecting these corrections, yields a value substantially lower than the one at the fixed point γ_m^* for large mass region. We further study finite-volume effects on the <b>hyperscaling</b> relation, based on the ladder SD equation in a finite space-time with the periodic boundary condition. We find that the finite-volume corrections on the <b>hyperscaling</b> relation are negligible compared with the mass correction. The anomalous dimension, when identified through the finite-size <b>hyperscaling</b> relation neglecting the mass corrections as is often done in the lattice analyses, yields almost the same value as {{that in the case of}} the infinite space-time neglecting the mass correction, i. e., a substantially lower value than γ_m^* for large mass. We also apply the finite-volume SD equation to the chiral-symmetry-breaking phase and find that when the theory is close to the critical point such that the dynamically generated mass is much smaller than the explicit breaking mass, the finite-size <b>hyperscaling</b> relation is still operative. We also suggest a concrete form of the modification of the finite-size <b>hyperscaling</b> relation by including the mass correction, which may be useful to analyze the lattice data.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the <b>hyperscaling</b> violation on the holographic superconductors. In the s-wave model, we find that the critical temperature decreases first and then increases as the <b>hyperscaling</b> violation increases, and the mass of the scalar field will not modify the value of the <b>hyperscaling</b> violation which gives the minimum critical temperature. We analytically confirm the numerical results by using the Sturm-Liouville method with the higher order trial function and improve the previous findings in J. High Energy Phys. 09, 048 (2013). However, different from the s-wave case, we note that the critical temperature decreases with the increase of the <b>hyperscaling</b> violation in the p-wave model. In addition, we observe that the <b>hyperscaling</b> violation affects the conductivity of the holographic superconductors and changes the expected relation in the gap frequency in both s-wave and p-wave models.

40|$|We {{study the}} quasinormal modes of scalar field {{perturbations}} {{in the background}} of non-Abelian <b>hyperscaling</b> violating Lifshitz black holes. We find that the quasinormal frequencies have no real part so there is no oscillatory behavior in the perturbations, only exponential decay, that is, the system is always overdamped, which guarantees the mode stability of non-Abelian <b>hyperscaling</b> violating Lifshitz black holes. We determine analytically the quasinormal modes for massless scalar fields for a dynamical exponent z= 2 and <b>hyperscaling</b> violating exponent θ̃>- 2. Also, we obtain numerically the quasinormal frequencies for different values of the dynamical exponent and the <b>hyperscaling</b> violating exponent by using the improved asymptotic iteration method.

40|$|In systems {{belonging}} to the universality class of the random field Ising model, the standard <b>hyperscaling</b> relation between critical exponents does not hold, but {{is replaced by a}} modified <b>hyperscaling</b> relation. As a result, standard formulations of finite size scaling near critical points break down. In this work, the consequences of modified <b>hyperscaling</b> are analyzed in detail. The most striking outcome is that the free energy cost Δ F of interface formation at the critical point is no longer a universal constant, but instead increases as a power law with system size, Δ F proportional to L^θ, with θ the violation of <b>hyperscaling</b> critical exponent, and L the linear extension of the system. This modified behavior facilitates a number of new numerical approaches {{that can be used to}} locate critical points in random field systems from finite size simulation data.

40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years all {{software}} applications and Operating Systems (OSes) which {{make use of}} persistent storage architectures {{have been designed to}} work with HDDs. However, SSDs are physically and architecturally different from HDDs; in particular, SSDs need to execute a specific algorithm for translating host commands: the Flash Translation Layer (FTL). Basically, the main role of FTL it to mimic the behavior of a traditional HDD and to enable the usage of SSDs in any electronic systems without acting on the software stack. The main drawback of FTL is the Write Amplification Factor (WAF) which reduces both drive bandwidth and NAND flash reliability. Especially in the enterprise market and <b>hyperscale</b> data centers, performance and reliability losses induced by WAF are not tolerable. To deal with the above mentioned challenges, {{in the past few years}} software developers of <b>hyperscale</b> data centers have shown a growing interest for Software-Defined Flash (SDF), which leverages a new SSD design approach called Host-based FTL (HB-FTL). Thanks to SDF and HB-FTL it is possible to establish a native communication between the host system and the SSD. Basically, NAND flash memories can be directly addressed by the host without any further translation or manipulation layer. As a result, the write amplification phenomenon is removed and both performance and reliability are improved. However, according to the Open-Channel specifications, to enable the use of HB-FTL in SDF, the design of the SSD controller has to be slightly modified and its internal architecture has to be exposed to the host system. In this regard, the Open-Power initiative helps to provide a clear path to the HBFTL execution, whereas the Open-Channel approach tries to define a standard for future SSD controllers, custom designed for SDF. This chapter describes a simulation model that can be used to simulate SDF architectures exploiting the Open-Channel standard proposed by the Open-Power initiative...|$|E
40|$|Here I look {{at three}} {{stages in the}} {{evolutionary}} development of mammalian brains. Chapter one addresses how connectivity in neocortex scales with brain size. This is of evolutionary interest because it helps define the basic mammalian condition. Neocortical white matter increases disproportionately in large brains. This might reflect increases {{in the number of}} connections per neuron. It might also reflect scaling in axon diameter. I compare these hypotheses by examining white matter-gray matter scaling in cerebellum. Because the white matter of cerebellum lacks cortico-cortical connections, the connectivity theory predicts that cerebellar white matter should not <b>hyperscale</b> relative to gray matter. I have measured white matter and gray matter volume in a large sample of mammals and I find that cerebellar white matter does not <b>hyperscale.</b> This supports the proposition that neocortical hyperscaling reflects {{an increase in the number}} of connections per neuron in large brains. In chapter two I use independent contrasts analysis to examine the scaling of frontal cortex in a large sample of mammals. I find significant differences in scaling between primates and carnivores. Primate frontal cortex hyperscales relative to the rest of neocortex and the rest of the brain, and the primate slope is significantly greater than that for carnivores. This suggests that there are substantial differences in frontal cortex structure and development between the two groups. Combined with with anatomical differences, it suggests that primates have evolved a number of unique adaptations in frontal cortex. Chapter three examines the evolution of brain size in anthropoid primates. Living anthropoids have larger brains than strepsirrhines. What about early anthropoid fossils? I measure brain size in the early anthropoid Parapithecus grangeri using computed tomography. I find that relative to the living anthropoids, Parapithecus had a small brain for its body size. Thus large brains did not develop at the same time as a number of other anthropoid adaptation...|$|E
40|$|We {{perform a}} study of {{possible}} instabilities of the infrared AdS 2 × R^ 2 region of solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton systems which exhibit an intermediate regime of <b>hyperscaling</b> violation and Lifshitz scaling. Focusing on solutions that are magnetically charged, we probe {{the response of the}} system to spatially modulated fluctuations, and identify regions of parameter space in which the infrared AdS 2 geometry is unstable to perturbations. The conditions for the existence of instabilities translate to restrictions on the structure of the gauge kinetic function and scalar potential. In turn, these can lead to restrictions on the dynamical critical exponent z and on the amount of <b>hyperscaling</b> violation θ. Our analysis thus provides further evidence for the notion that the true ground state of ‘scaling’ solutions with <b>hyperscaling</b> violation may be spatially modulated phases...|$|R
