40|$|International audienceThe few {{attempts}} to produce artificial hybrids in the genus Hieracium s. str. have usually failed {{due to the}} use of polyploid parental taxa reproducing via agamospermy. Presented {{here for the first time}} are data on artificial hybridization in Hieracium s. str. which may help in understanding the microevolutionary processes resulting in the great morphological and genetic diversity in this genus. Diploid, sexually reproducing species (H. alpinum. H. pojoritense, H. transsilvanicum and two stable morphological types of H. umbellatum - of a low altitude and a high mountain type) were used as parent plants in experimental crosses. In most cases true hybrids, with intermediate morphology,were obtained. All the hybrids tested were diploid and produced a high amount of stainable pollen (65 - 92 %). Hybrid progeny resulting from one cross exhibited a large range of morphological variation due to the combination of alleles from unrelated parental species. The percentage of well-developed achenes per capitulum, in capitula with at least one well-developed achene, in hybrids, ranged from 1. 9 to 12. 5 % after <b>free</b> or controlled <b>pollination,</b> with an average of 4 - 5 % per capitulum. Similar results (1. 9 - 12. 1 %) were obtained from triple-cross hybrids. However, most of the capitula of hybrid progeny (either 171 or triple) were completely sterile after <b>free</b> or controlled <b>pollination.</b> Sterility is probably caused by genome incompatibility of unrelated parental taxa belonging to different sections. In two crosses, where strictly allogamous diploid plants of H. umbellantum (both morphotypes) were used as mother plants and F I hybrids as pollen donors, some matroclinal progeny were obtained. This is a further example of the previously reported mentor effect. Diploid hybrids may be involved as pollen donors in gene flow as they produce uniformly sized and viable pollen. They are probably substantially less important as seed parents...|$|R

40|$|In plant-pollinator {{communities}} many pollinators {{are potential}} generalists and their preferences for certain plants can change quickly {{in response to}} changes in plant and pollinator densities. These changes in preferences affect coexistence within pollinator guilds as well as within plant guilds. Using a mathematical model, we study how adaptations of pollinator preferences influence population dynamics of a two-plant-two-pollinator community interaction module. Adaptation leads to coexistence between generalist and specialist pollinators, and produces complex plant population dynamics, involving alternative stable states and discrete transitions in the plant community. Pollinator adaptation also leads to plant-plant apparent facilitation that is mediated by changes in pollinator preferences. We show that adaptive pollinator behavior reduces niche overlap and leads to coexistence by specialization on different plants. Thus, this article documents how adaptive pollinator preferences for plants change the structure and coexistence of plant-pollinator communities.

40|$|Programmed {{cell death}} (PCD) {{has been found}} to be induced after {{pollination}} both in papillar cells and in self-incompatible pollen in the olive (Olea europaea L.). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) are known to be produced in the pistil and pollen during pollination but their contribution to PCD has so far remained elusive. The possible role of ROS and NO was investigated in olive pollen–pistil interaction during <b>free</b> and controlled <b>pollination</b> and it was found that bidirectional interaction appears to exist between the pollen and the stigma, which seems to regulate ROS and NO production. Biochemical evidence strongly suggesting that both O 2 ˙− and NO are essential for triggering PCD in self-incompatibility processes was also obtained. It was observed for the first time that peroxynitrite, a powerful oxidizing and nitrating agent generated during a rapid reaction between O 2 ˙− and NO, is produced during pollination and that this is related to an increase in protein nitration which, in turn, is strongly associated with PCD. It may be concluded that peroxynitrite mediates PCD during pollen–pistil interaction in Olea europaea L. both in self-incompatible pollen and papillar cells...|$|R
40|$|Yield {{of common}} {{buckwheat}} (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) {{tends to be}} low and unstable. This is because common buckwheat is an allogamous crop and thus many such factors in the pollination process as meteorological conditions or behavior of pollinator affect yield. Ogasahara et al. (1993) investigated the dynamism of pollen transfer and load on stigma with special reference {{to the relationship between}} meteorological conditions and pollinator behavior. Namai and Ohsawa (1986) reported that seed-setting of common buckwheat is restricted when pollen load was very low. It is very important to remove obstacles in the process of pollination and fertilization for the enhancement of yield of common buckwheat. When pollen grains of two different species or varieties are cultured on a same medium or loaded on a same stigma, pollen grains of one species or variety may influence the growth of the others. This is known as mixture effect (lwanami 1970) or Mentor effect. In the former Russia, Mentor effect has been investigated for quite a long time. Many Russian researchers have reported the promoted pollen tube elongation by mixed pollination of different species or varieties. This experiment was conducted aiming the yield enhancement of common buckwheat after a research in Russia reporting that <b>free</b> inter-varietal <b>pollination</b> in common buckwheat resulted in a couple of tens percent ofyield increase.

40|$|Se estudió una población polimórfica de Phaseolus vulgaris var. aborigineus que crece en el Noroeste de Argentina. Para dilucidar el origen de este polimorfismo fueron coleccionadas algunas plantas que pertenecían a la var. aborigineus, otras que exhibían dimorfismo floral y plantas que presentaban ciertos caracteres particulares. Luego de realizarles tratamientos de fecundación libre y autopolinización, se sembraron las semillas producidas en un invernáculo, aisladas del acceso de visitantes potencialmente polinizadores. Se siguió el crecimiento de cada planta hasta su fructificación. Se registró el número de plantas que se murieron {{debido a}} las infecciones. El número de plantas que florecieron y fructificaron fue registrado con el fin de estudiar su éxito reproductivo. Se analizaron los caracteres florales y se realizaron mediciones de las legumbres y sus semillas. Con los resultados obtenidos, las autoras concluyeron que los individuos que exhibían el dimorfismo floral probablemente sean el resultado de hibridación e introgresión entre la var. aborigineus y cultivares primitivos. Esta hipótesis se sustenta por la presencia de segregación divergente, observada en la descendencia que exhibía esta segregación. Otros cultivares permiten un flujo génico entre las entidades parentales, con la consecuencia del establecimiento de una población híbrida coexistente con sus entidades parentales. Quizás como resultado de la introgresión, los ejemplares de la línea con características diferenciales exhiben caracteres diferentes a los de sus {{progenitor}}es. Los resultados de la autopolinización y de la fecundación libre en los individuos asignados a lavar. aborigineus, demuestran que la fecundación libre aporta una gran plasticidad genética, porque las generaciones posteriores persisten y son resistentes a las infecciones. Se hizo un seguimiento de la descendencia de la F 1. Las plantas que pertenecían a la var. aborigineus, sometidas a fecundación libre, exhibieron crecimiento rápido y fueron saludables, mientras que la descendencia de los individuos con el dimorfismo floral mostraron características que permitieron concluir la posible existencia de degeneración de la progenie híbrida; estas características fueron: radícula recurvada con cotiledones que nunca surgen, ápice de las plántulas que se muere rápidamente, desarrollándose luego ramas en la axila uno de los cotiledones, y muerte de las plántulas después de algunas semanas. La degeneración de la progenie híbrida indica que un flujo génico no deseado en el área podría conducir a la disminución poblacional de la variedad silvestre en el área de estudio. El vigor, alto éxito reproductivo y resistencia a enfermedades de los ejemplares correspondientes a la var. aborigineus cuyo progenitor fue tratado para fecundación libre, y la progenie de la línea diferente estabilizada, son indicadores de la necesidad de preservar este germoplasma para evaluar su potencial agronómico a breve plazo. Los análisis de ADN ya iniciados permitirán confirmar las hipótesis aquí planteadas A polymorphic population of Phaseolus vulgaris var. aborigineus growing at the Northwest of Argentina was studied. In order {{to know the}} origin of this polymorphism, some plants belonging to the var. aborigineus, other plants showing floral dimorphism and other individuals with particular characters were collected. Their seeds, obtained after field-work treatments of autogamy and <b>free</b> <b>pollination,</b> were sown in a green-house, isolated of the access of pollinators. The growth of each plant was followed until its fructification, and the number of plants that died due to infections was recorded. The number of plants that flowered and fructified was registered in order to study their reproductive success. The floral, fruit and seed qualitative and quantitative characters were documented. With the results obtained, the authors concluded that those individuals that showed floral dimorphism are probably a result of hybridization and introgression between the var. aborigineus and "old cultivars". This hypothesis is supported by the presence of divergent segregation, observed in the offspring of the plants with this segregation. Other crops should allow the genic flow between the parental entities, with the consequence of the establishment of an hybrid population coexistent with their ancestors. Perhaps, as a result of introgression, the stabilized lines exhibit characters different from their parental varieties. The results of autopollination and <b>free</b> <b>pollination</b> in those individuals assigned to var. aborigineus, showed that <b>free</b> <b>pollination</b> brings a great genetic plasticity, because next generations can persist and resist infections. The offspring of the F 1 was followed. The plants that belonged to var. aborigineus, product of <b>free</b> <b>pollination,</b> exhibited fast growth and were healthy, while the descendant of the individuals with the floral dimorphism showed characteristics that allowed to conclude the possible existence of degeneration of the hybrid progeny; this characteristics were: curled radicles with cotyledons that never emerge, plantule’s apex that soon die with the following development of branches from the cotyledon’s axil, and death after some weeks. This degeneration indicates that an unwanted gene flow in the area could lead to a decline in the wild bean population. The vigor, high reproductive success and resistance to illnesses of the individuals corresponding to the var. vulgaris, whose progenitor was treated for free fecundation, and the offspring of the plants with cultivated characteristics, are indicative of the necessity of preserving this germplasm to evaluate its agronomic potential to brief term. The DNA analyses already initiated, will allow the confirmation of the hypotheses outlined in this wor...|$|E

Generally, polycross reduced population density of thrips and percentage of injury...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{degradation}} and loss can reduce size and genetic variability of natural populations, increasing individual homozygosity and average relatedness between individuals. While the resulting inbreeding depression {{may be reduced}} by natural selection under prevailing environmental conditions, it may increase again under environmental stress. To investigate the effect of environmental stress on offspring performance and the expression of inbreeding depression, we hand-pollinated maternal plants in small (400 flowering plants, n= 5) of the rare plant Cochlearia bavarica (Brassicaceae) and raised the offspring under experimentally manipulated water and light regimes (normal or reduced supply). In addition to considering natural variation in inbreeding levels due to population size, we manipulated pollen donor provenance and diversity. Maternal plants were pollinated with nine donors from a different population or with one or nine donors from the same population. One further inflorescence of each maternal plant was exposed to <b>free</b> <b>pollination.</b> Offspring growth and survival were monitored over 300 days. Offspring performance varied significantly among populations and maternal plants. Environmental stress interacted significantly with these factors. However, there was no general indication that offspring from small populations were more negatively affected. In seven out of 10 populations, offspring derived from between-population pollination performed better than offspring derived from within-population pollination. Also, in five out of 10 populations, average offspring size was higher after within-population pollination with nine than after pollination with one pollen donor. These results suggest low genetic diversity within C. bavarica populations, both smaller and larger ones. Interactions between environmental stress and pollination treatment indicated that using pollen donors from outside a population or {{increasing the number of}} pollen donors can reduce inbreeding depression, but that this beneficial effect is impaired under stressful conditions...|$|E

Foram estudados a biologia floral e os requerimentos de polinizaÃÃo das cultivares; o comportamento de pastejo e avaliaÃÃo dos frutos apÃs 100 dias dos tratamentos de polinizaÃÃo. Os resultados mostraram que Apis mellifera foi a espÃcie mais freqÃente nas flores (9 Â 0, 42, n = 455) seguida de Trigona fulviventris (4 Â 0, 52, n = 206), Melipona rufiventris (4 Â 0, 42, n = 151), Nannotrigona sp. (3 Â 0, 48, n = 148), Trigona spinipes (3 Â 0, 43, n = 157) e Xylocopa grisescens (2 Â 0, 78, n= 38). ApÃs 100 dias dos tratamentos de polinizaÃÃo (polinizaÃÃo livre, restrita com saco de papel, restrita com saco de organza, polinizaÃÃo cruzada manual e geitonogamia) verificamos diferenÃas significativasThe {{survey was}} {{conducted}} on the farm SÃo SebastiÃo, located in the city of Mulungu - CE. Data were collected and studied during the period November 2009 to June 2010 with the aim of studying the floral visitors and pollination of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) and green shade of Mundo Novo and Maragogipe. We studied the floral biology and pollination requirements of the cultivars, the grazing behavior and evaluation of fruit after 100 days of pollination. The results showed that Apis mellifera was the most frequent in the flowers (9 Â 0. 42, n = 455) followed by Trigona fulviventris (4 Â 0. 52, n = 206), Melipona rufiventris (4 Â 0. 42, n = 151), Nannotrigona sp. (3 Â 0. 48, n = 148), Trigona spinipes (3 Â 0. 43, n = 157) and Xylocopa grisescens (2 Â 0. 78, n = 38). After 100 days of pollination (open pollination, with narrow paper bag, with narrow organza bag, manual cross-pollination and geitonogamy) showed significant differences (Mundo Novo X 2 = 44. 9495, DF= 4,p< 0. 005; Maragogipe: X 2 = 59. 8649, df = 4, p < 0. 005) between treatments with respect to viable fruits. The open pollinated differed significantly (P < 0. 05) of all treatments for Mundo Novo. In the cultivar Maragogipe, the <b>free</b> <b>pollination,</b> manual cross-pollination and geitonogamy presented the highest number of viable fruits and did not differ. However, these treatments differed significantly (P < 0. 05) than treatment with restricted pollination bag and this in turn also differed from the restricted pollination treatment with organza bag. The total weight of 100 days after the pollination treatments showed no significant differences between cultivars at a significance level of 5 %. It is concluded that the Arabic coffee can produce fruits under any circumstances tested. Despite being selfcompatible, also supports the cross-pollination that leads to an increase in productivity. The wind and gravity did not favor an increase in fruit set fruit. Species Apis mellifera, Melipona rufiventris and Xylocopa grisescens recorded behavior of potential pollinators...|$|E
40|$|EN] Among the {{offspring}} of triploids of Narcissus bulbocodium (3 x = 21) obtained by means of artificial pollination, are found individuals with 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 26, 30, 32, 33 and 34 chromosomes. From <b>free</b> <b>pollination</b> between these plants, arise individuals with 14, 21, 22, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 54 chromosomes. It was found that, putting the diploids aside, the chromosome number was not always the same in all the equatorial plates from the same root, samll oscillations occurring towards either more or less relative to the numbers cited above, which were the most frequent. Analysis of the interphasis nuclei of the F 1 and of the F 2 showed that he most of the individuals that are not diploids possessed chromocentres whose number was, as a rule, difficult to determine. The presence of these chromocentres revealed the existence of heterochromatinosomes whose number was established in certain plants not only by counting {{the maximum number of}} chromocentre, but also, thanks to the fact that these chromosomes lose their colour more rapidly than the euchromatinosomes in the root tip meristems fixed in Navashin's solution and stained with gentian violet. The determination of the number of heterochromatinosomes present allowed us to {{come to the conclusion that}} the most of the plants that, from their chromosomic constitution, apeared to be in genetical unbalance were not so, since the supernumerary chromosomes corresponded to the heterochromatinosomes which are inert or posses a very weak genic activity. Plants were found with 21 and 22 chromosomes provided, respectively, with 7 and 8 heterochromatinosomes, as well as one with 42 which had 14. In certain plants and in certain mitoses, the heterochromatinosomes, if not all at least some, have a retarded behaviour, placing themselves on the equatorial plate after the euchromatinosomes have began their poleward movement. In these conditions, they often suffer misdivision of the centromere, thus giving rise to telocentric chromosomes and afterwards to isochromosomes. Other types may eventually arise by translocation with the euchromatinosomes. Sometimes the heterochromatinosomes do not come to be incorporated in the polar groups, being eliminated, which explains the variation found in the numer of chromosomes. All the observed facts can be explained on the assumption that in at least one triploid employed in the initial crossings there was present a dominant H gene determining the heterochromatinization of the supernumerary chromosomes that alter the genic balance. Furthermore, everything leads to the belief that the H factor acts not only in the zygote but also in the pollen and embryo sac. The progeny of these crossings is in a realty almost composed only of balance plants corresponding to diploids, triploids, tetraploids, pentaploids, etc. provided with heterochromatinosomes. The appearance in this progeny only of a few plants with supernumerary euchromatinosomes is explained by the selection of gametes with heterochromatinosomes and by the non-viability or small viability of the zygotes and of the genetically unbalanced plants. Althought also related to a mechanism of genic balance, the heterochromatinization of one of the chromosomes X of the females of Mammals seems to be determined by factors which act in a different manner from that of the H gene of N. Bulbocodium. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in July 2010 in the town of ChorÃ- CE, to evaluate the bees visiting the flowers of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. CNPA - 7 MH) in two agroecological crops. To do so, assessed the diversity of insects in two areas, their frequency, foraging behavior and potential pollinators of the culture, and studied the floral biology and pollination requirements of the specie CNPA - 7 mH. Twenty-three species of bees visited the flowers of cotton, but Apis mellifera L. was not collected. Among the 22 species collected, eleven were common to both areas, only four in Area I and Area II in only seven. In area I the most represented families in number of species were Apidae and Halictidae, with 46. 67 % each. The least represented was Megachilidae, with 6. 67 % of the species. In Area II, Halictidae were the most represented, with 66. 67 % of the species, followed by Apidae, with 27. 78 %, and Megachilidae the least represented with 5. 56 %. Regarding the number of individuals, the most abundant family in the area I was APID with 48. 00 % of the subjects, followed by Megachilidae Halictidae with 32. 00 % and 20. 00 %. In Area II, APID was also the most abundant, with 39. 62 % of the specimens, followed by the Halictidae with 35. 85 % and Megachilidae with 24. 53 %. Diversity indices (Shannon-Weaver) of bees visiting the flowers of the cotton plant showed significant difference (p < 0. 05) among the areas. The observations of frequency and foraging behavior showed that only A. mellifera L., Lithurgus huberi Ducke and species of Halictidae Ceratinini when grouped and presented expressive activity. The results showed statistical differences (p < 0. 05) for the frequency of visitation among the bees and among the areas throughout the day. Observations of floral biology of the specie have shown that the anthesis flowers occurred from 7 : 00 pm and the stigmas were receptive at the time of anthesis and throughout the morning. Concerning to the requirements of pollination it was observed that there were significant differences (p < 0. 05) for the treatments, with <b>free</b> <b>pollination</b> and manual cross they did not differ from each other, but both avenging significantly more fruit than the manual self-pollination and restricted pollination. It was concluded that the expressive richness of bees visiting the flowers of the cotton areas was influenced by the agro-ecological cropping system and conservation of areas surrounding the plantations and that although the plantations of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. CNPA - 7 MH) is an autogamous species, spontaneous self-pollination is able to produce economically viable crops regardless of biotic pollinators, they are able to promote cross-pollination and contribute to increases the pollination of this crop. In addition, the cultivation of agroecological cotton proved being important for Lithurgus huberi as a food source but also as a place of rest, shelter and mating, being necessary to investigate the negative impacts of traditional crops of cotton on populations of this and other solitary bee species. O presente trabalho foi realizado no mÃs de Julho de 2010 no municÃpio de ChorÃ â CE, objetivando estudar as abelhas visitantes florais do algodoeiro (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. CNPA â 7 MH), em dois plantios agroecolÃgicos. Para tanto, avaliaram-se a diversidade destes insetos nas duas Ãreas, suas freqÃÃncias, comportamentos de forrageio e potencial polinizador da cultura, bem como estudaram-se a biologia floral e os requerimentos de polinizaÃÃo da cultivar CNPA â 7 MH. Vinte e trÃs espÃcies de abelhas visitaram as flores do algodoeiro, mas Apis mellifera L. nÃo foi coletada. Entre as 22 espÃcies coletadas, onze foram comuns Ãs duas Ãreas, quatro exclusivamente na Ãrea I e sete apenas na Ãrea II. Na Ãrea I as famÃlias mais representadas em quantidade de espÃcies foram Apidae e Halictidae, com 46, 67 % cada uma. A menos representada foi Megachilidae, com 6, 67 % das espÃcies. Na Ãrea II, Halictidae foi a mais representada, com 66, 67 % das espÃcies, seguida de Apidae, com 27, 78 %, sendo Megachilidae a menos representada com 5, 56 %. Quanto ao nÃmero de indivÃduos, a famÃlia mais abundante na Ãrea I foi Apidea com 48, 00 % dos indivÃduos, seguida de Megachilidae com 32, 00 % e Halictidae com 20, 00 %. Na Ãrea II, Apidea tambÃm foi a mais abundante, com 39, 62 % dos espÃcimes, seguida por Halictidae com 35, 85 % e Megachilidae com 24, 53 %. Os Ãndices de diversidade (Shannon-Weaver) de abelhas visitantes florais do algodoeiro apresentaram diferenÃa significativa (p< 0. 05) entre as Ãreas. As observaÃÃes de freqÃÃncia e comportamento de forrageio mostraram que apenas A. mellifera L., Lithurgus huberi Ducke e espÃcies de Halictidae e Ceratinini quando agrupadas apresentaram atividade expressiva. Os resultados mostraram diferenÃas estatÃsticas (p< 0, 05) para as freqÃÃncias de visitaÃÃo entre as abelhas e entre as Ãreas ao longo do dia. As observaÃÃes da biologia floral da cultivar mostraram que a antese das flores acontecia a partir das 7 : 00 h e os estigmas se mostravam receptivos no momento da antese e durante toda a manhÃ. No que se refere aos requerimentos de polinizaÃÃo observou-se que houve diferenÃas significativas (p < 0, 05) para os tratamentos, com a polinizaÃÃo livre e a cruzada manual nÃo diferindo entre si, mas ambas vingando significativamente mais frutos que a autopolinizaÃÃo manual e a polinizaÃÃo restrita. Concluiu-se que a expressiva riqueza de abelhas visitantes florais do algodoeiro nas Ãreas estudadas foi influenciada pelo sistema de cultivo agroecolÃgico e conservaÃÃo dos entornos dos plantios e que apesar do algodoeiro (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. CNPA - 7 MH) ser uma espÃcie autÃgama, de autopolinizaÃÃo espontÃnea e capaz de produzir colheitas economicamente viÃveis independentemente de agentes polinizadores biÃticos, estes sÃo capazes de promover polinizaÃÃo cruzada e contribuir para incrementos na polinizaÃÃo desta cultura. AlÃm disso, o cultivo de algodÃo agroecolÃgico mostrou-se importante para Lithurgus huberi como fonte de alimento, mas tambÃm como local de descanso, abrigo e acasalamento, sendo necessÃrio investigar os impactos negativos de cultivos tradicionais de algodÃo sobre as populaÃÃes dessa e de outras espÃcies de abelhas solitÃrias...|$|E
