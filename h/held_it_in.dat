5|$|Royal {{power was}} restricted, as the king lost {{the power to}} give titles and {{positions}} of military officers, ministers and senators, and the starostwo territories for Crown lands, most {{of which would be}} awarded through an auction. In return, the king received four starostwa for personal possession. The royal (free) election was confirmed, with stipulations that future kings had to come from the Polish nobility, and sons and grandsons of any king could not succeed him to the throne till two others had <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the interim.|$|E

5|$|The Kingston Lacy estate {{originally}} formed {{part of a}} royal estate {{within the}} manor of Wimborne. The original house stood {{to the north of}} the current house. It was built in the medieval period and was used as a hunting lodge in connection with the deer park to its northwest. Leased to those who found favour with the monarch, lessees included the de Lacys, Earls of Lincoln, who <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> addition to estates at Shapwick and Blandford Forum. In the 15th century the property was leased to John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, whose daughter Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of King Henry VII, was brought up at Kingston Lacy.|$|E
5|$|In 1309 Sir Nicholas de Boys {{granted the}} manor of Shalden to Robert de Kendale and his wife, Margaret, {{along with her}} heirs. The manor was then held by Ralph le Mareschal indefinitely. He was still holding it in 1310, however it had passed to Robert de Kendale {{sometime}} before 1316. Robert died in 1330, and his son Edward succeeded to the manor, but it was held by his widow Margaret until her death in 1347. Sir Edward de Kendale died in 1373, leaving a widow and a son as his heir for the manor of Shalden. Edwards's son and his brother, Thomas, both died without issue in 1375. Sir Robert Turk and his wife, Beatrice, conveyed the manor in 1376–7 to Sir William Croyser and William Bukbridge, trustees of Sir Edward de Kendale, to whom they transferred {{it in the same}} year. Edward's widow Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Croyser, soon married Sir Thomas Barre, and died in 1420. Her heir was her grandson, but the manor of Shalden passed to John de Kendale, who <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1428.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall, {{but by the time he}} got out, his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including plywood paddles and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E

5|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the painting}} is unclear, and there is doubt as to which painting is referred to in some early inventories. An Anhalt prince, likely Leopold Friedrich Franz (d.1817) of Wörlitz, near Dessau, Germany, <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the early 19th century, after which {{it is likely to}} have passed to Leopold Friedrich (d.1871). The painting was loaned for exhibition in 1902, when it was shown at the Hôtel de Gouvernement Provincial, Bruges at the Exposition des primitifs flamands et d'art ancien. It was held by a Duke of Anhalt until 1926 when he sold it to the art dealers Duveen Brothers. They in turn sold it that year to Andrew W. Mellon. It was loaned the following year to the Royal Academy of Arts, London, for an exhibition covering six centuries of Flemish and Belgian art. Mellon willed the work to his Educational and Charitable Trust in 1932, which in 1937 donated it to the National Gallery of Art where it is on permanent display.|$|E

25|$|In 1758, {{the manor}} of Marbury was {{purchased}} by the Knight family, who still <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1810. The Poole family gained in influence during the 18th century, and were regarded as the local squires throughout the 19th century {{until the end of}} the Second World War. The Pooles inhabited the Jacobean Marbury Old Hall at Tapley's Craft by the church, building the present Marbury Hall in around 1805–10. The Old Hall was unoccupied and partly ruined by 1888, and has now been demolished. Cudworth Halstead Poole served as the High Sheriff of the county in 1880.|$|E

25|$|The Global Honored Crown (GHC) Tag Team Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling tag team title in Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling Noah. It was created on October 19, 2001, when Scorpio and Vader defeated Jun Akiyama and Akitoshi Saito in a tournament final. Though it is typically contested among heavyweights (>), some junior heavyweights such as Naomichi Marufuji and Yoshinari Ogawa have <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the past. It is currently one of two tag team titles in Noah, along with the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship (reserved for junior heavyweights).

25|$|In the meantime, {{during the}} bishopric of Richard Joseph Fitzgerald, {{extensive}} {{developments in the}} Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned were accomplished. Bishop Fitzgerald decided to replace the statue of Our Lady of Europe {{in order to make}} the two side-altars symmetrical. As the right altar had an upright statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a similar statue was desired for the left one (where the old statue of Our Lady of Europe was placed). The new statue was manufactured in France, and put in the altar where the old statue stood, but the faithful never <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the same esteem as the old one, which was stored away. In 1965, Charles Caruana (later Bishop of Gibraltar, then the priest responsible of the Cathedral's sacristy) rediscovered the lost statue in a store. It was however, damaged due to humidity and an arm and hand had become detached. After restoration, the statue was placed in the Cathedral sacristy. It was Bishop Bernard Devlin who in 1986 reinstalled the statue in its original location, where it remains to this day.|$|E
25|$|The ring had a {{great effect}} on the human bearers who <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the interim. It granted them {{indefinite}} life; though the effort of living became more difficult as time went on, for it did not grant new life. If they wore it, it made them invisible, enhanced their hearing, and made the shadowy world of the wraiths visible to them. It exerted a malicious influence; Gandalf mentions that though a bearer might begin with good intentions, the good intentions would not last. The Ring would give its bearer a fraction of Sauron's power, proportionate with the bearer's strength and force of will. Gollum, Bilbo, Sam, and Frodo only became invisible, although when Frodo bound Gollum to his service in The Two Towers he indicated that he could use the Ring to control Gollum (because the Ring had mastered Gollum long ago). Gandalf and Galadriel, however, recognized that they could use the full power of the Ring, becoming even more powerful than Sauron himself, but they resisted, knowing {{that in the end}} the Ring would corrupt them. Gandalf explained to Frodo that, with great concentration and training, even he could tap into the Ring's power, but probably at the cost of his sanity.|$|E
