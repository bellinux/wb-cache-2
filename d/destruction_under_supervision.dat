40|$|This report {{contains}} {{information on}} both {{the number of young}} people <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> on an average day and the number of young people <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> during the year. In Australia, responsibility for juvenile justice lies with the states and territories and involves both juvenile justice agencies and other justice agencies such as the police and the courts. Each year, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare collects data on young people <b>under</b> juvenile justice <b>supervision</b> from the states and territories and publishes the results in the Juvenile justice in Australia reports. This report contains the main tables from Juvenile justice in Australia 2008 – 09 (AIHW forthcoming). For more detailed analyses, please see the forthcoming report. The number of young people <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> on an average day is calculated by summing the number of days each young person spends <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> during the year and dividing this total by the number of days in the financial year. The number of young people <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> during the year is calculated by counting each distinct young person <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> during the financial year. Each young person is counted only once, even if they entered and exited supervision multiple times during the year...|$|R
