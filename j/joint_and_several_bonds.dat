40|$|This article {{provides}} a framework for such interpretation {{and implementation of the}} new innocent spouse laws. The author presents an overview of the current tax law treatment of married joint filers under which <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability is imposed unless relief is available under the new innocent spouse laws. The article then examines the tax rationales that have traditionally been offered for imposing <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability. The author concludes that because the fiction of marital unity is deeply embedded in our tax system, <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability for married joint filers is likely to remain the law. While it can sometimes promote legitimate goals of fairness and efficiency, as an examination of <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability in tort, agency and fraudulent conveyance law reveals, it can also produce unjust or irrational results. The author’s interpretive framework is necessary to alleviate these injustices and irrationalities...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares, in {{the context}} of {{hazardous}} waste generation, the effects of <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability on capital and production decisions to the effects of several only liability. Our main result shows that increased potential liability causes firms to decrease asset exposure, but may also lead firms to create less waste. First, we find that both <b>several</b> only <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability induce firms to go bankrupt more often and create more waste than is socially optimal. Then we find that, for a given level of funds, <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability induces firms to go bankrupt more often and create more waste than several only liability. This implies that society will be responsible for a larger share of cleanup under <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability than under several only liability.

40|$|Major {{accounting}} {{firms in the}} United States have singled out elimination of <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability {{as one of the}} most needed legal reforms in the country. The recent legislation of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 replaced <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability with proportionate liability. This paper develops a simple model to analyze the economic consequences of such a change in the legal environment facing public accountants. In particular, we examine the incentive effects induced by the proportionate liability rule on the auditor's effort and financial statement users' litigation decisions. Our analysis demonstrates that replacing <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability with proportionate liability can decrease the equilibrium audit effort, lawsuit probability, market price of the firm, and audit fee. More important, even though the proportionate liability rule reduces the equilibrium audit effort, we show that it can actually increase social welfare. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Recent theoretical research by Kornhauser and Revesz finds that <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability may either encourage or discourage settlement, depending on the correlation of outcomes at trial across defendants. We extend their two-defendant model to a richer framework with N defendants. This extension allows us to test the theoretical model empirically using data on Superfund litigation. We find that <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability does not discourage settlements and may even encourage them. Our results support the model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions {{about the effects of}} several variables, such as the degree of correlation in trial outcomes...|$|R

Contrary to popular belief, we show that transferring liability can actually increase the seller's incentive to invest in pollution abatement.
