5|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of <b>green</b> <b>timber,</b> their hulls were starting to rot after {{a decade or more}} in service, but their engines were still generally sound. As the older ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines from the older gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough freeboard to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for these ships and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be framed in iron with wooden planking.|$|E
5|$|Arguments soon {{broke out}} between the Crown and the {{corporation}} over the deal. The Crown argued that the corporation was not adequately maintaining the castle and blockhouses. The Earl of Sussex complained in 1569 {{that they were in}} need of repair, and a 1576 survey stated that their gun platforms were in poor condition and that the ditches had become clogged with earth, while coastal erosion had undermined the South Blockhouse. Queen Elizabeth I provided 300 trees to help the repair work and a new jetty was built to protect {{the southern end of the}} defences from the sea. The Crown gave 60 trees to the town to help with further repairs in 1581. Fears of a Spanish invasion resulted in fresh repairs being carried out, and the threat of the Armada in 1588 resulted in proposals to build additional earthworks around the blockhouses, but nothing appear to have actually been carried out. The dispute over maintenance between the Crown and the town finally came to court in 1588; the corporation argued that <b>green</b> <b>timber</b> had been used in the original construction work and claimed that they had spent £2,893 between 1552 and 1587 on the defences: the Crown's case failed.|$|E

30|$|Eighty <b>green</b> round <b>timbers</b> (each {{measuring}} 16 – 20  cm {{in diameter}} {{at the top}} end, and about 5  m in length) were procured. The dynamic Young’s modulus for all <b>green</b> round <b>timbers</b> was obtained by using the longitudinal vibration method. The density of round timber was calculated according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard for logs [2]. The average Young’s modulus obtained by the longitudinal vibration method was 8.20 kN/mm 2, with minimum and maximum values of 5.88 and 9.71 kN/mm 2, respectively. <b>Green</b> round <b>timbers</b> {{were divided into two}} groups of 40 specimens by the Young’s modulus obtained by the longitudinal vibration method for that average, with largely uniform standard deviation.

30|$|As for the {{compressive}} test {{parallel to}} the grain results, there was no significance seen in the average Young’s modulus obtained by the longitudinal vibration method for air-dried round <b>timbers</b> and <b>green</b> round <b>timbers.</b> Significance was seen in average compressive strength {{parallel to the}} grain at the 5  % significance level for air-dried round <b>timbers</b> and <b>green</b> round <b>timbers.</b> The 5  % PTL of compressive strength parallel to the grain was higher in air-dried round <b>timber</b> than <b>green</b> round <b>timber.</b> In terms of average, the strength ratios of dry/green round timbers were larger in compressive strength parallel to the grain than in bending strength, {{as well as the}} other timbers [5, 6] and small clear specimens [7].|$|R

A private letter, that was brought in by a {{privateer}} that had captured a merchantman, on her way, gave the garrison an idea of the method in which the attack was to be made. It stated that ten ships were to be fortified, six or seven feet thick, with <b>green</b> <b>timber</b> bolted with iron, and covered with cork, junk, and raw hides. They were to carry guns of heavy metal, and to be bombproof on the top, with a descent for the shells to slide off. These vessels, which they supposed would be impregnable, were to be moored within half gunshot of the walls with iron chains; and large boats, with mantlets, were to lie off at some distance, full of troops ready to take advantage of occurrences; that the mantlets of these boats were to be formed with hinges, to fall down to facilitate their landing. There would, by that time, be forty thousand men in camp, but the principal attack was to be made by sea, to be covered by a squadron of men-of-war with bomb ketches, floating batteries, gun and mortar boats, etc.; and that the Comte D'Artois--brother to the King of France--with other great personages, was to be present at the attack.|$|E

30|$|To {{expand the}} use of wood that {{includes}} thinned round timber, wood should be used not only for construction products but also for civil engineering products. One use of wood products for civil engineering would be for underground bearing piles. Wooden bearing piles would {{be used in the}} form of round timber without lumbering. When round timber is used underground, it must always be under a green condition. The strength of a small clear specimen and that of timber are known to decrease in line with higher moisture content [1]. The strength data of <b>green</b> round <b>timber</b> was very poor, however, when compared with that of a small clear specimen and timber. In this study, static bending tests and compressive tests parallel to the grain of sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica) <b>green</b> round <b>timber</b> were conducted to confirm whether its strength would satisfy the referenced strength determined by the Construction Ministry. The strength of <b>green</b> round <b>timber</b> and air-dried round timber were also compared for bending and compression parallel to the grain.

60|$|This {{city and}} most of the middle and {{northern}} counties are insurrectionary,--burning bridges, destroying telegraph lines, etc.,--and can be kept down only by the presence of troops. A large portion of the foreign troops organized by General Fremont are unreliable; indeed, many of them are already mutinous. They have been tampered with by politicians, and made to believe that if they get up a mutiny and demand Fremont's return the government will be forced to restore him to duty here. It is believed that some high officers are in the plot I have already been obliged to disarm several of these organizations, and I am daily expecting more serious outbreaks. Another grave difficulty is the want of proper general officers to command the troops and enforce order and discipline, and especially to protect public property from robbery and plunder.

Carley had never gazed upon a scene like this. Hostile and prejudiced, she yet felt wrung from her an acknowledgment of beauty and grandeur. But wild, violent, savage! Not livable!
