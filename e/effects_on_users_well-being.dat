While prior schemes explored both static and dynamic challenge questions to improve security, they do not systematically investigate the problem of designing challenge questions and its <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>user</b> recall performance. Interestingly, as answering different styles of questions may require different amount of cognitive effort and evoke different reactions among users, we argue that the style of challenge questions itself can have a significant <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>user</b> recall performance and usability of such systems. To address this void and investigate the effect of question types <b>on</b> <b>user</b> performance, this paper explores location‐based challenge question generation schemes where different types of questions are generated based on users’ locations tracked by smartphones and presented to users. For evaluation, we deployed our location tracking application on users’ smartphones and conducted two real‐life studies using four different kinds of challenge questions. Each study was approximately 30 days long and had 14 and 15 users respectively. Our {{findings suggest that the}} question type can have a significant <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>user</b> performance. Finally, as individual users may vary in terms of performance and recall rate, we investigate and present a Bayesian classifier based authentication algorithm that can authenticate legitimate users with high accuracy by leveraging individual response patterns while reducing the success rate of adversaries.|$|R

Also, it is essential to ensure that knowledge management systems (KMS) can be implemented successfully. This paper examines several variables which may influence user involvement and KMS implementation success. In particular, corporate culture, organizational climate, and individual characteristics are key factors. One hundred and eighty-five responses from nine organizations, which had installed KMS, were used for analysis. The results indicate that: (1) A positive relationship exists between corporate culture and user involvement, which is especially strong for a supportive corporate culture. (2) Organizational climate has a negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>user</b> involvement; that is, more structured climate will lead to lower user involvement in the KMS implementation. (3) A negative relationship exists between user’s computer self-efficacy and user involvement. In addition, a positive relationship exists between user’s cognitive style and user involvement. Therefore, individual characteristics are demonstrated to have <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>user</b> involvement in KMS implementation.

For this, we set up the study models and hypotheses based on studying previous literature. In order to verify this, we carried out survey for 20 s- 30 s users. Besides this, we also aim to verify the effects and <b>user's</b> reaction based <b>on</b> the quantitative data from large scaled promotion using digital signage through implementing digitalization. In the result of the study, first, the interactive factors of digital signage are shown to have <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>user</b> satisfaction. The responsiveness, two-way communication, pleasure and personalization among interactive factors have <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>user</b> satisfaction. However, user's control is not shown to have <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>user</b> satisfaction. This means that users expect the full implementation of digitalization into digital signage while the most of the current signage system is lack of it. From this, we can forecast that such factors like two-way communication and personalization will play core roles. This result also shows that these factors including real-time, two-way, and personalization which are used to be ignored can play such important roles. After expanding the possible service areas in digital signage, the supply of various contents and user's convenience should be improved to increase user's interaction. And personal innovation partially has <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> interaction and satisfaction. Personal innovation is shown to be meaningful for the effect which user control and two-way communication have on satisfaction. This means that users feel high satisfaction when they can form and control something easy to deal with. The satisfaction also could be higher when users can find solutions for the questions easily with the content changed suitable for user's demand. This study aims to understand the media characteristics by analyzing the interactive factors about digital signage service...|$|R
