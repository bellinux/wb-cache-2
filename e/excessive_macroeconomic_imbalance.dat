40|$|In {{the light}} of the lessons learned from the euro area {{sovereign}} debt crisis, the EU fiscal and macroeconomic governance framework was overhauled in 2011. Against this background, this paper analyses whether the broadened surveillance of fiscal and macroeconomic indicators under the strengthened governance framework would have facilitated the identification of emerging imbalances, had it been in place before the crisis. The findings suggest that the strengthened governance framework would have given earlier signals about emerging <b>excessive</b> fiscal and <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances.</b> Euro area countries thus would have been obliged to take preventive and corrective action at an earlier stage, provided that the stricter rules had been effectively implemented. At the same time, the paper concludes that the increased reliance of the EU fiscal governance framework on unobservable magnitudes such as the structural budget balance, which are difficult to measure in real time, will continue to impede the timely identification of underlying fiscal imbalances. It is suggested that the new <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalance</b> procedure could have given earlier indications about the emergence of <b>excessive</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances,</b> which in turn posed risks for fiscal sustainability. Looking forward, these preliminary findings suggest possible synergies between the, until now largely unrelated, fiscal and macroeconomic governance frameworks...|$|R

30|$|The {{standard}} potential output methodology considers CPI inflation a sufficient statistic of all <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances.</b> Therefore, one required property of {{standard potential}} output estimates {{would be for}} them to be unrelated to other <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances.</b> Another desirable property of real time potential growth estimates is that they should be unrelated to ex-post output gaps. Both properties would, in principle, entail relatively minor revisions of potential growth estimates when new information arrives.

40|$|The {{synchronised}} {{economic downturn}} in the U. S., Euro area and Japan in 2001, mainly caused by a correction in the global IT sector and the events of September 2001, sharply reduced the export demand in most SEACEN countries causing deterioration in external trade activities. The resulting economic contraction in most SEACEN countries demonstrated the vulnerability of these countries to external trade shocks. However, {{in comparison with the}} 1997 financial crisis, the impact has been less severe. Availability of policy options to minimise the impact of global slowdown largely depends on the soundness of macroeconomic fundamentals in the individual economy. For example, countries with strong macroeconomic fundamentals were able to use stimulus monetary and fiscal policies successfully to minimise the impact of global slowdown. Even member countries with some fiscal constraints were able to use monetary policy effectively to mitigate the impact. However, countries with <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances</b> had fewer options. Policy priority for these countries should be given to address structural rigidities by expediting the implementation of necessary structural reforms that help address existing <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances.</b> This would also help improve the effectiveness of policy responses. In an environment of increasing global integration, countries with <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances</b> would continue to be vulnerable to fluctuations of the global economy. ...|$|R

Contrary to conventional wisdom that interprets fiscal stress in terms of fiscal sustainability, we focus on short-term fiscal vulnerability as reflected by the conditions of debt refinancing in the sovereign bond markets. We find that market-based indicators capturing risk perceptions of sovereign debts have been influenced by the indicators defined in the European <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Imbalance</b> Procedure (MIP) and by variables of financial vulnerability.

40|$|<b>Macro{{economic}}</b> <b>imbalances</b> {{can lead}} to economic crises. This {{is especially true in}} a monetary union due to the restrictions it imposes on the tools available to economic policymakers. The years leading up to the outbreak of the global economic crisis were characterized by divergent macroeconomic developments within the euro area, which meant that the impact of the crisis varied from Member State to Member State and that, subsequently, unexpected challenges have arisen for the single monetary policy and coordinated fiscal and economic policy. In order to prevent such developments in future, a procedure for preventing and correcting <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances,</b> analogous to the Stability and Growth Pact, was created {{within the framework of the}} European semester. The preventive arm of the procedure is designed to detect and analyze potential macroeconomic problems. If the procedure flags up “excessive” imbalances for a Member State, the corrective arm will come into effect, under which the relevant Member States will be required to submit plans for corrective measures. If Member States then fail to comply with the recommended corrective actions, sanctions may be imposed. The new procedure constitutes a considerable boost to economic policy coordination within the EU and the euro area. Nonetheless, it has yet to prove itself in practice. <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances,</b> competitiveness, fiscal policy, structural policy, European Union, euro area...|$|R
40|$|<b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances</b> {{increase}} {{the probability of}} economic crisis, even more so in a monetary union with limited economic policy tools available. In the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU, euro area or eurozone), <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances</b> have accumulated since the euro introduction and they have significantly contributed {{to the emergence of}} the recent crisis with serious impacts on several Member States and hereby on the whole euro area. In order to improve the proper functioning of the EMU and prevent possible future crisis, a governance reform has been undertaken in the European Union (EU) in 2011, including introduction of a new procedure for preventing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances- the <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Imbalance</b> Procedure (MIP). It starts with an alert mechanism based on a set of eleven macroeconomic indicators with their threshold values (the so-called scoreboard), which this paper mainly focuses on. The first part of the paper provides an overview on the functioning of the preventive and corrective arm of the new procedure within the EU. The second part deals with the economic reasons for establishing respective MIP indicators. Finally, the third part aims to test appropriateness of the composition of the scoreboard for anticipation of the recent crisis by analysing the development of the indicators in the twelve euro area countries in period 2004 - 2007, i. e. prior to the outbreak of the crisis...|$|R

We look into patterns of structural change and sectoral competitiveness in all EU member countries and assess their linkages by means of a descripitve analysis as well as through econometric estimations. Our results broadly support the hypothesis. Structural policies alone to foster new competitive export-oriented industries in Southern Europe in order to reduce <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances</b> in the EMU would not be efficient without accompanying adjustments in relative labour costs...|$|R

The main assumption is that bilateral trade imbalances result from the aggregate trade imbalance.
