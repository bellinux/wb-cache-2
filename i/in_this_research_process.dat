This paper analyzes a joint experiment as a multi-stakeholder process and contributes {{to understand how the}} way of organizing social learning affects stakeholders’ ownership of process outcomes. Design/Methodology/Approach:A learning group composed of the different stakeholders of the oil palm seed system in Benin was set around a joint experiment. We use a detailed account of the group dynamics to understand the social process. Findings: The way the process is designed and conducted has a great effect on the ownership by the participants. Methodological steps taken <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>process</b> showed its efficacy to produce quick and positive feedback mechanisms. Stakeholders’ perspectives on what constitutes a quality oil palm seedling varied widely. Participants, mainly nursery holders, learned new production practices.

The school plays {{a central role in}} the {{socialisation}} of a child and it is critical that schools offer a safe environment in which learning can take place. This study attempts to investigate school stakeholder perceptions of the Safe Schools Programme of the WCED and its impact on the learning environment of one primary school in the Mitchell's Plain district. The study as a whole is set against the research literature on crime and violence in schools. The literature surveyed covered the following aspects: (I) What constitutes crime and violence in schools; (2) The effects of crime and violence on the school environment; and (3) Approaches to reducing crime and violence in schools. This research project is a case study of school stakeholder perceptions of the Safe Schools Programme of the WCED as implemented in one primary school. Qualitative research techniques were employed and data was collected by means of individual semi-structured interviews with the acting principal and the safety officer of the school. A focus group interview was held with a group of educators and support staff members.

A Narrative approach was used to gather data from the community. I listened to the stories of those people who live in poverty. Seven movements were used as the methodology for this research (Muller 2005 : 81 - 86). As a practical theologian, I positioned myself within postfoundationalist theology. In this position I avoided foundation epistemology which seeks the absolute truth as well as anti or nonfoundational epistemology which promotes relativism. As I mentioned earlier postfoundationalist practical theology is always thinking in a specific context and can also go beyond that specific context into interdisciplinary thinking. Starting from a specific context into an interdisciplinary context, we found that the concept of poverty {{has been described as a}} discourse meaning that it went from poverty as a lack of resources into linguistic, poverty as lack of capabilities or poverty being political. By taking multidimension method to eradicate poverty one needs to apply a multidimensions approach. The stories from Nellmapius affirmed that poverty influences identity formation. The following effects were identified: low self-esteem, stress, depression, lack of self-acceptance and hopelessness. The church has the capacity as the biggest membership and with the most awareness organization in most communities that has the attention of many people. The church is able to preach hope for people in what seems to be hopelessness and encourage the poor to rise out of their poverty. It can facilitate the poor and the government to work together to change their lives. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Practical Theologyunrestricte...|$|E

40|$|Background: Now-a-days, {{the forces}} of {{globalization}} derive firms to go to international market. When a firm thinks to expand its business outside of the home market, it needs to explore the form of operation through which it will enter into the foreign market. International entry mode research deals with this matter. (Brouthers et. al. 2007). Selection of an optimal entry mode strategy is very important because {{it is very difficult}} to change or correct and have a long-term impact on the firm’s foreign operation (Pedersen, Petersen, & Benito, 2002). Actually, it is very difficult for a firm to serve in the market on a permanent basis without a well formulated entry strategy. (Pehrsson A. 2008). Market entry mode strategies are influenced by both firm and country level factors and a firm must take into consideration these factors in choosing an appropriate entry mode. Purpose: The basic purpose is to gain a deep knowledge about the critical factors in selecting an optimal international market entry mode strategy to enter into an emerging market. The minor purpose is to justify the suitability of the target market. Methodology: Due to the dependency on subjective interpretation of text or other visual material and small sample was used to investigate the specific phenomena, qualitative method has been practised <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>process.</b> Secondary data has been mainly collected from e-sources, and primary data has been collected through phone interview with the three foreign mobile telecom companies in Bangladesh.

Implications: The study has showed that international entry mode strategy is affected by various organizational, economical, Institutional, and sociological factors (categorized as country and firm level factors). This research has also provided relevant information to the potential foreign firms about which country and firm level factors should consider in formulating a well entry mode strategy in perspective of an emerging market...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} 10 years, {{construction}} {{was the leading}} industry of occupational fatalities {{when compared to other}} goods producing industries in the US. This is partially attributed to ineffective safety management strategies, specifically lack of automated construction equipment and worker monitoring. Currently, worker safety performance is measured and recorded manually, assessed subjectively, and the resulting performance information is infrequently shared among selected or all project stakeholders. Accurate and emerging remote sensing technology provides critical spatio-temporal data that has the potential to automate and advance the safety monitoring of construction processes. This doctoral research focuses on pro-active safety utilizing radio-frequency location tracking (Ultra Wideband) and real-time three-dimensional (3 D) immersive data visualization technologies. The objective of the research is to create a model that can automatically analyze the spatio-temporal data of the main construction resources (personnel, materials, and equipment), and automatically measure, assess, and visualize worker's safety performance. The research scope is limited to human-equipment interaction in a complex construction site layout where proximities among construction resources are omnipresent. In order to advance the understanding of human-equipment proximity issues, extensive data has been collected in various field trials and from projects with multiple scales. Computational algorithms developed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>process</b> the data to provide spatio-temporal information that is crucial for construction activity monitoring and analysis. Results indicate that worker's safety performance of selected activities can be automatically and objectively measured using the developed model.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between women's contraceptive experiences {{and the social}} relations in which they take place has been little explored to date, either empirically or theoretically. The importance of such an approach lies {{in its ability to}} perceive women's contraceptive concerns, capacities and problems, as socially and politically derived rather than as the consequence of individual/couple/group inadequacies. The position of women in society is central to this perspective. The search for a theoretical framework which allows for visibility of the social relations between women and men, and the potential for explanation, is as significant <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>process</b> as the gathering of empirical data. A small scale qualitative study was undertaken to explore the experiences of women with sexuality and contraception. The decisions and actions women took regarding contraception, the problems they encountered and the information they received provided the focus for data collection and analysis. In—depth, semi—structured interviews with a random sample of fifty women postgraduate full—time students at the University of Warwick were conducted in the Summer Term of 1977. The sample was deliberately highly selective for motivation, access to information, alternative career possiblities and experience with contraception. The purpose of this selection was to highlight the experiences and difficulties with contraception faced by even those women in a relatively good social position, and thereby to indicate the problems in contracepting likely to affect all women. Data analysis revealed three major areas of social relations to influence the conditions in which women made decisions and took actions: first, the arena of personal sexual relationships; second, {{the quantity and quality of}} information received about sexuality and contraception; and third, the field of contraceptive health care services encountered. The sex—based division engendering social relations of male domination and female subordination were seen to be operable in each of these areas. The social and political relations of this sexual hierarchy emerged as central to the understanding of the experiences of women in the study with sexuality and contraception...|$|E
40|$|A {{brand is}} defined as a {{consistent}} and clearly stated promise to deliver unique, focused and relevant benefit that differentiates an offering from those competitors. The function of branding is to create preference by managing consumer’s awareness and expectations of the brand. This is accomplished by developing a brand strategy that outlines rules and guidelines to ensure tha 6 the brand owner’s goals and objectives are met. The role of branding has become the integral part of business strategy as it defines a realistic and manageable brand promise, dealing what the brand owner must deliver as what consumers expect of the brand. The study entitled “A study on brand management of Louise Philippe brand” of Madura Fashion and Lifestyle among its customer’s aims to understand more about the brand managing activities in today’s dynamic business environment. The primary interest in choosing this area of study is to gain more information about the current trends related to the topic. Perception can be created in the mind of target markets if the brand is effectively managed. Branding is creating that right perception. The perception of the target market has to be analyzed and that has to be adjusted with the companies positioning statements so that perceptions match. This enjoys higher brand equity in the market place. The main objective of the study is to know about the brand management of Louise Philippe of Madura Fashion and Lifestyle. In this research study the size of sample selected is 100 customers from the population of customers of Trissur. Data is collected with the help of structured questionnaire, which includes open end and closed end questions. Here the hypothesis is done {{with the help of the}} chi-square test; this is done to know the relation between age group and brand loyal customers and also to know the relation between age group and online purchase of LP. The next important step <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>process</b> is analysis and interpretation of data collected from respondents. The analysis and interpretation is done with the help of graphs and tabulation. From data analysis and interpretation, findings were drawn and some suggestions also been given to help Louise Philippe showroom to improve their strategies...|$|E
40|$|Process {{control and}} {{monitoring}} {{is a common}} problem in high value added chemical manufacturing industries where batch processes are used to produce wide range of products on the same piece of equipment. This results in frequent adjustments on control and monitoring schemes. A chemical toner manufacturing process is representative of an industrial case which is used in this thesis. Process control and monitoring problem of batch processes have been researched, mostly through the simulation, and published in the past. However, the concept of applying the subject to chemical toner manufacturing process or to use a single indicator for multiple pieces of equipment have never been visited previously. In the case study of this research, {{there are many different}} factors that may affect the final quality of the products including reactor batch temperature, jacket temperature, impeller speed, rate of the addition of material to the reactor, or process variable associated with the pre-weight tank. One of the challenging tasks for engineers is monitoring of these process variables and to make necessary adjustments during the progression of a batch and change controls strategy of future batches upon completion of an existing batch. Another objective of the proposed research is the establishment of the operational boundaries to monitor the process through the usage of process trajectories {{of the history of the}} past successful batches. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>research,</b> <b>process</b> measurements and product quality values of the past successful batches were collected and projected into matrix of data; and preprocessed through time alignment, centering, and scaling. Then the preprocessed data was projected into lower dimensions (latent variables) to produce latent variables and their trajectories during successful batches. Following the identification of latent variables, an empirical model was built through a 4 -fold cross validation that can represent the operation of a successful batch. The behavior of two abnormal batches, batch 517 and 629, is then compared to the model by testing its statistical properties. Once the abnormal batches were flagged, their data set were folded back to original dimension to form a localization path for the time of abnormality and process variables that contributed to the abnormality. In each case the process measurement were used to establish operational boundaries on the latent variable space...|$|E

Strip {{continuous}} casting by twin roll method is a rapidly solidifying process, which can directly produce thin strips,reduce energy consumption and product cost of various metal materials. However, the casting of {{magnesium alloys with}} large solidifying ranges lead to some problems such as surface and internal defect, variation of solidification finish point for Mg sheet. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>research,</b> the <b>process</b> conditions for a twin roll caster are analyzed by thermal flow simulation. The effect of type and dimension of delivery nozzles on production of Mg alloy are studied. A proper match of the setback distance of thin nozzle and casting speed is studied by thermal flow simulation, based {{on the characteristics of}} Mg melt handling, flow dynamics control and solidification...|$|R

In order to save time and cost, services could be employed for integrating and extracting relevant up-to-date geo-information. For this purpose, semantics of geo-information should be explicitly defined. This paper presents our initial results in applying an approach for semantic annotation of existing geo-datasets. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> the <b>process</b> of injecting semantic descriptions into geodatasets (information integration) is called semantic annotation.
