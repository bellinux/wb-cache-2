25|$|WSET-TV {{discontinued}} regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, {{the official}} date in which full-power television {{stations in the}} United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. In October 2009, the station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 34 to VHF channel 13. The station's over-the-air coverage {{in much of the}} western part of the market, especially the New River Valley, is somewhat marginal due in part to the mountainous terrain. W05AA was converted to <b>digital</b> <b>operation</b> in late 2009, which helped to fill in coverage holes in Roanoke.|$|E
25|$|Some modern amateur {{transceivers}} have embedded {{computers with}} firmware which is executed {{to provide the}} functions and features of the transceiver. This software must be provided by the original manufacturer of the equipment. Another type of software is that required to control a receiver (or transceiver) without a front panel provided. Examples of this are the Kenwood TS-B2000 and the Ten-Tec Pegasus; both transceivers are sold with PC software to provide the human interface for operation. Most transceivers with front control panels (and many receivers popular among shortwave listeners) have a computer interface such as a serial port, USB or Ethernet port. These ports are useful for satellite-tracking frequency control (Doppler tuning), station logging, <b>digital</b> <b>operation,</b> internet and special-needs accessibility. In many cases, the software adds improved or extra functions and features beyond that provided by the original design. For this reason, some operators purchase radio-control software for non-computerized operation even if their radio has a front control panel.|$|E
