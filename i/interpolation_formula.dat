Firstly, {{one of the}} important relationships between the bandpass signals in the Fourier domain and the bandpass signals in the LCT domain is derived. Secondly, two <b>interpolation</b> <b>formulae</b> from uniformly sampled points at half of the sampling rate associated with the bandpass signals and their generalized Hilbert transform or the derivatives in the LCT domain are obtained.

25|$|The Nyquist–Shannon {{sampling}} theorem {{provides a}} sufficient {{condition for the}} sampling and reconstruction of a band-limited signal. When reconstruction is done via the Whittaker–Shannon <b>interpolation</b> <b>formula,</b> the Nyquist criterion is also a necessary condition to avoid aliasing, {{in the sense that}} if samples are taken at a slower rate than twice the band limit, then there are some signals that will not be correctly reconstructed. However, if further restrictions are imposed on the signal, then the Nyquist criterion may no longer be a necessary condition.|$|E

The results obtained by applying the shifted- 1 /N method are compared with those obtained by using an accurate numerical technique, showing that the relative error is reasonably small, although the first method consistently underestimates the correct values. The approximate ground-state Hartree-Fock and local-density Kohn-Sham energies, estimated using the shifted- 1 /N method, are compared with accurate numerical self-consistent solutions.

40|$|Interpolation of {{functions}} {{on the basis}} of Lagrange’s polynomials is widely used. However in the case when the function has areas of large gradients, application of polynomials of Lagrange leads to essential errors. It is supposed that the function of one variable has the representation as a sum of regular and boundary layer components. It is supposed that derivatives of a regular component are bounded to a certain order, and the boundary layer component is a function, known within a multiplier; its derivatives are not uniformly bounded. A solution of a singularly perturbed boundary value problem has such a representation. <b>Interpolation</b> <b>formulas,</b> which are exact on a boundary layer component, are constructed.
