5|$|While near peak intensity, Fantala passed {{near the}} Farquhar Group of the Seychelles, {{damaging}} {{most of the}} buildings in the small archipelago. By 18 April, Fantala had weakened to an intense tropical cyclone and slowed its forward motion, eventually reversing its <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> After fluctuating in strength, the disorganized system reversed direction again, making its closest approach to Madagascar. Fantala degenerated into a remnant low on 24 April, and the remnants continued toward Tanzania. There, heavy rainfall resulted in flooding that washed away roads and houses, killing 13people. Rains extended further into Kenya, with similar effects.|$|E
5|$|Vera {{developed}} on September20 between Guam and Chuuk State, and initially tracked westward {{before taking a}} more northerly course, reaching tropical storm strength the following day. By this point Vera had assumed a more westerly <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> and had begun to rapidly intensify, and reached its peak intensity on September23 with maximum sustained winds equivalent {{to that of a}} modern-day Category5 hurricane. With little change in strength, Vera curved and accelerated northward, resulting in a landfall on September26 near Shionomisaki on Honshu. Atmospheric wind patterns caused the typhoon to briefly emerge into the Sea of Japan before recurving eastward and moving ashore Honshu for a second time. Movement over land greatly weakened Vera, and after reentering the North Pacific Ocean later that day, Vera transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September27; these remnants continued to persist for an additional two days.|$|E
25|$|This {{pattern of}} deflection, and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> is called Buys-Ballot's law. In the atmosphere, {{the pattern of}} flow is called a cyclone. In the Northern Hemisphere the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> around a {{low-pressure}} area is anticlockwise. In the Southern Hemisphere, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> is clockwise because the rotational dynamics is a mirror image there. At high altitudes, outward-spreading air rotates in the opposite direction. Cyclones rarely form along the equator due to the weak Coriolis effect present in this region.|$|E

25|$|In non-vector terms: {{at a given}} rate of {{rotation}} of the observer, {{the magnitude of the}} Coriolis acceleration of the object is proportional to the velocity of the object and also to the sine of the angle between the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> of the object and the axis {{of rotation}}.|$|E
25|$|Drumlins are asymmetrical, canoe shaped hills made {{mainly of}} till. Their heights vary from 15 to 50meters {{and they can}} reach a {{kilometer}} in length.

25|$|In a {{study of}} the lamprey tectum {{published}} in 2007, they found electrical stimulation could elicit eye movements, lateral bending movements, or swimming activity, and the type, amplitude, and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> varied {{as a function of the}} location within the tectum that was stimulated. These findings were interpreted as consistent with the idea that the tectum generates goal-directed locomotion in the lamprey.|$|E
5000|$|Ploy is an {{abstract}} strategy board game {{for two or}} four players, played on a 9x9 board {{with a set of}} 15 pieces (2-handed) or 9 pieces (4-handed and partnership games) per player. Pieces have various horizontal, vertical or diagonal moves somewhat like chess pieces, except <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> are limited; pieces change <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> by [...] "rotating". Object of the game is to capture the opponent's Commander (analogous to the king in chess), or all of his other pieces.|$|R

25|$|<b>Direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> is {{indicated}} via an operator symbol. A plus sign {{is used to}} indicate forward movement. A minus sign is used to indicate backwards movement. A dot or period or equal sign is used to indicate horizontal or lateral movement. For a piece that moves diagonally (such as the horse or elephant), the plus or minus sign is used rather than the period.|$|E
25|$|Note: Taking {{the trace}} {{tells you that}} only closed orbits contribute, the {{stationary}} phase approximation gives you restrictive conditions each time you make it. In step 4 it restricts you to orbits where initial and final momentum are the same i.e. periodic orbits. Often {{it is nice to}} choose a coordinate system parallel to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> as it is done in many books.|$|E
25|$|Rectilinear-coordinate outputs (both sine and cosine, typically) {{came from}} two slotted plates, each slot fitting {{on the block}} just mentioned. The plates moved in {{straight}} lines, the movement of one plate {{at right angles to}} that of the other.

25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted {{in a direction}} that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not the}} <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a 2000s {{consumer}} 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement),</b> Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to {{this approach is that}} it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar. More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system. All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.|$|E
25|$|Purse seiners {{are very}} {{effective}} at targeting aggregating pelagic species near the surface. The seiner circles the shoal {{with a deep}} curtain of netting, possibly using bow thrusters for better manoeuvrability. Then {{the bottom of the}} net is pursed (closed) underneath the fish shoal by hauling a wire running from the vessel through rings along the bottom of the net and then back to the vessel. The {{most important part of the}} fishing operation is searching for the fish shoals and assessing their size and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> Sophisticated electronics, such as echosounders, sonar, and track plotters, may be used are used to search for and track schools; assessing their size and movement and keeping in touch with the school while it is surrounded with the seine net. Crows nests may be built on the masts for further visual support. Large vessels can have observation towers and helicopter landing decks. Helicopters and spotter planes are used for detecting fish schools. The main types of purse seiners are the American seiners, the European seiners and the Drum seiners.|$|E

40|$|The gliding {{bacterium}} Mycoplasma mobile {{adheres to}} plastic surfaces, and moves around vigorously. However, {{it has not}} been possible to control the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> on plain surfaces. Here we report that, on patterned lithographic substrates, M. mobile cells are unable to climb tall walls, and move along the bottom edge of the walls. This property to move persistently along walls enabled us to design patterns that control <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements,</b> resulting in uni-directional circling or one-way gating between two areas. Furthermore, cells loaded with streptavidin beads following biotinylation of surface proteins moved at normal speeds. These bacteria could be useful as living microtransporters, carrying cargo around within micrometer-scale spaces...|$|R
50|$|Traffic {{controllers}} use {{the concept}} of phases, which are <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> grouped together. For instance, a simple crossroads may have four vehicle movement phases: North, East, West and South. There may be additional phases for pedestrian movements as well.|$|R
500|$|The Cooke and Wheatstone {{telegraph}} {{consisted of}} a number of magnetic needles which could be made to turn a short distance either clockwise or anti-clockwise by electromagnetic induction from an energising winding. [...] The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> was determined by the direction of the current in the telegraph wires. [...] The board was marked with a diamond shaped grid with a letter at each grid intersection, and so arranged that when two needles were energised they would point to a specific letter.|$|E
500|$|Non-stochastic {{mathematical}} models may be purely qualitative (for example, models {{involved in}} some aspect of social choice theory) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with hyperbolic coordinates, and/or specific forms of functional relationships between variables). [...] In some cases economic predictions of a model merely assert the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only in a qualitative sense: for example, {{if the price of}} an item increases, then the demand for that item will decrease. [...] For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.|$|E
500|$|A derecho (from Spanish: [...] "" [...] meaning [...] "straight") is a {{widespread}} and long-lived, violent convectively induced straight-line windstorm {{that is associated with}} a fast-moving band of severe thunderstorms usually taking the form of a bow echo. Derechos blow in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> of their associated storms, similar to a gust front, except that the wind is sustained and generally increases in strength behind the [...] "gust" [...] front. [...] A warm weather phenomenon, derechos occur mostly in summer, between May and August in the Northern hemisphere.

40|$|The spatial {{summation}} {{processes of}} single neurones of cat 2 ̆ 7 s pretectal region were investigated with moving and stationary visual stimuli. The {{results indicate that}} the majority of the investigated neurones changed their responses essentially at the gradual increase of size of the applied stimuli (i. e. showed negative or positive summation). Particularly, direction non-sensitive neurones showed symmetrical changes of spatial summation curves in response to two opposite <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> By contrast, in some direction sensitive neurones different characteristics of responses for the two opposite <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> were observed. Thus the number of discharges in the responses to the preferred direction could increase or decrease at the gradual increase of the moving stimulus size, while the responses to the null direction could remain stable or vice versa. The same was observed for the 2 ̆ 2 ON 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 OFF 2 ̆ 2 responses in the ON-OFF neurones. Thus, it appears that the pattern of responses of a given neurone to different <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> and to the 2 ̆ 2 on 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 off 2 ̆ 2 periods of stationary stimulation are shaped by independent mechanisms...|$|R
