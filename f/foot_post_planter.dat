50|$|Colvin {{joined the}} Baltimore Police Department around 1973 (according to Season 3, he had 30 years on) patrolling his home {{neighborhood}} in the Western District; one of his early posts was at Pensey and Fremont. Over his tenure, he advanced {{to the rank of}} District Commander (Major) in the Western District. Colvin's philosophy of policing involves protecting the community he serves by making quality arrests through the use of trusted informants on his <b>foot</b> <b>post.</b> As a commander he insists that his men learn their sense of direction, their <b>foot</b> <b>post,</b> and urged them to focus on doing real police work. Toward the end of his career, he began seeing the war on drugs as an ineffective waste of time and resources in his district that brought about too many unnecessary deaths.|$|R

25|$|Stone {{throwing}} {{played an}} important, if secondary role, after firearms, in the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine (thawra) against the British Mandatory government. In October 1936 a Collective Punishment Ordinance was invoked to impose punitive measures on villages implicated in stone-throwing against passing vehicles. The Nablus District Commissioner Hugh <b>Foot</b> <b>posted</b> a notice warning {{that not only}} boy stone-throwers but also their fathers and guardians would be punished.|$|R

50|$|Oral {{tradition}} has the location {{with the name}} Negro Foot as early as 1770, but the earliest documentation of the place name {{was found to be}} approximately 1830. At that time there was an old Negro Foot Road and after the Civil War, a Negro <b>Foot</b> <b>Post</b> Office. The Virginia Business Directory and Gazetteer, published in 1877, lists the place name in Hanover Country also. Apparently a small business community existed at that time. (From Old Homes of Hanover County Virginia, published by the Hanover County Historical Society of Hanover, Va. Published in 1984).|$|R

If the Centre and the State send {{request to the}} Indian Navy seeking to utilize the runway for civil aviation aircraft, the runway length will be increase to 6,000 <b>feet.</b> <b>Post</b> completion as many as 30 warships can be anchored at the base {{and it would have}} a hangar to hold as many military aircraft. The Indian Navy, through the State government, has acquired 11,334 acres of land which includes 8,661 acres of forest land.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to generate raster Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from terrain mass point data sets too large to fit into memory, such as those obtained by LIDAR. We describe prototype tools for streaming DEM generation that use memory and disk I/O very efficiently. From 500 million bare-earth LIDAR double precision points (11. 2 GB) our tool can, in just over an hour on a standard laptop with two hard drives, produce a 50, 394 × 30, 500 raster DEM with 20 <b>foot</b> <b>post</b> spacing in 16 bit binary BIL format (3 GB), using less than 100 MB of main memory and less than 300 MB of temporary disk space. ...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001, BTOs were unarmed {{unless they were}} the desk officer, a supervisor, making an arrest, or {{transporting}} revenue money. The reason for officers being unarmed was due to customer service concerns. A BTO's main responsibility was toll collection, with limited law enforcement tasks. BTOs mainly stood <b>foot</b> <b>posts</b> on the plaza, and RMP patrols were limited.Since September 11, the TBTA force's responsibilities and operation has increased dramatically. All officers, sergeants, lieutenants and captains are now armed at all times and the force is proactive in law enforcement responsibilities. The formation of several units also took place over this time, and many new law enforcement posts were created for day-to-day operations.|$|R

25|$|Among Saint-Domingue's 40,000 white colonials in 1789, European-born Frenchmen monopolized {{administrative}} <b>posts.</b> The sugar <b>planters,</b> the grands blancs, were chiefly minor aristocrats.

A colleague of twenty years ago, Queenie Hennessy, has cancer and is in a hospice in Berwick-upon-Tweed. The doctors say {{there is nothing more}} that can be done for her. He writes her a feeble and brief note and goes to post it, has second thoughts, and walks to the next post box, and the next. He phones the hospice from a call box and leaves a message. He is coming and she should wait, stay alive while he makes the journey. A girl at the petrol filling station where he stops for a snack says something that acts as a catalyst for his nascent project. He tells her he is on <b>foot,</b> <b>posting</b> a letter to someone with cancer. 'If you have faith you can do anything’ she replies, but quickly disclaims any religious reference.|$|R
50|$|The Golden Bed {{is a large}} bed, {{measuring}} 2.28 m long, 1.93 m {{high and}} 1.57 m wide. It is made from wood, gilded gold.

50|$|After {{the opening}} of the Warrington and Newton Railway four policemen were placed {{constantly}} on duty at Newton Junction, at the potentially dangerous points where the two lines met. Initially a gilt arrow was used to point towards Warrington to indicate that the points were set in that direction, with a green lamp visible from the L&MR line being used to indicate this at night. Later a fixed signal was used, with red and white chequered boards on 12 <b>foot</b> high <b>posts</b> being turned to face trains from one direction if another train was ahead.|$|R
60|$|There {{was much}} {{that had been}} {{overlooked}} during the hurry and excitement of the previous day, which {{could be done to}} strengthen the palisade, as, for example, driving stakes at the <b>foot</b> of such <b>posts</b> as were not standing firmly, and securing the tops of others with braces on the inside.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} a distant noise of barking and growling, which the {{traveller}} had {{for some time}} heard, became extremely loud and furious, and made the knight suppose that the hermit, alarmed by his threat of making forcible entry, had called the dogs who made this clamour to aid him in his defence, out of some inner recess {{in which they had}} been kennelled. Incensed at this preparation on the hermit's part for making good his inhospitable purpose, the knight struck the door so furiously with his <b>foot,</b> that <b>posts</b> as well as staples shook with violence.|$|R

50|$|With the American War of Independence, Bermuda {{began to}} assume an {{importance}} to the Admiralty that would see it become {{the base of the}} North America and West Indies Squadron, and the site of the only full naval dockyard west of Portsmouth.
