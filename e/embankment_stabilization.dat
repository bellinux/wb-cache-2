The reuse of waste material is an important topic {{from the point of}} sustainability. Some types of waste such as tyre bales, construction and demolition materials, recycled glass and biosolids were studied to investigate the possibility for reuse in highway construction. It was found that tyre bales are useful for <b>embankment</b> <b>stabilization</b> especially on highly compressible soil, construction and demolition material such as brick and and recycled glass were found to be suitable for embankment and pavement base applications. Preliminary studies on biosolids indicate they are useful as embankment material provided which can be treated with suitable additives.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} carried out on clay soil stabilized with pond ash (PA), rice husk ash (RHA) and cement. Modified Proctor compaction tests were performed in order to investigate the compaction behavior of clay, and California bearing ratio (CBR) tests were performed to determine the strength characteristics of clay. For evaluation purpose, the specimens containing different amounts of admixtures were prepared. Clay was replaced with PA and RHA at a dosage of 30 %– 45 % and 5 %– 20 %, respectively. The influence of stabilizer types and dosages on mechanical properties of clay was evaluated. In order to study the surface morphology and crystallization characteristics of the soil samples, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out, respectively. The results obtained indicated a decrease in the maximum dry density (MDD) and a simultaneous increase in the optimum moisture content (OMC) with the addition of PA and RHA. Multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) showed that the predicted values of CBR tests are in good agreement with the experimental values. Developed stabilized soil mixtures showed satisfactory strength and can be used for construction of <b>embankments</b> and <b>stabilization</b> of sub-grade soil. The use of locally available soils, PA, RHA, and cement in the production of stabilized soils for such applications can provide sustainability for the local construction industry...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} using polymer stabilization in creating a new nanocomposite material with clay soil. Various tests with different polymer contents were performed to study the effect of using polypropylene as a stabilizing agent on both microstructure and geotechnical clay properties. These experiments showed that the resulting nanocomposites acted as nanofiller materials which decreased the plasticity and compressibility parameters of the treated clay. The initial structural analysis helped in {{a better understanding of}} the modified microstructure and the measured size of induced nanocomposites. The constructed inclusions filled the inter-assembling pores thus notably producing a higher vertical effective yield stress which again reduced the volumetric shrinkage and created isotropic and compressible materials with a lesser extent of desiccation cracks. It also increased the tensile and the shear strength of the stabilized clay with an increase in the nanocomposites size. This technique can be effectively used for road <b>embankments</b> and slope <b>stabilization...</b>|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion {{has become}} a {{critical}} issue facing our global society. A total of 99. 7 % of the cropland is shrinking by more than 10 million hectares a year due to soil erosion. One rainstorm can wash away 1 mm of soil. It would take 13 tons of topsoil for one hectare – or 20 years, if left to natural processes, to replace that loss (Greenfield, 2010). As a result of erosion over the past 40 years, 30 % of the world's arable land has become less productive. Because of the uncontrolled runoff there is insufficient potable water for world needs and this situation is getting worse, {{as a result of}} increasing population which aggrandizes the demand on land for more food, fiber and fuel, and aggravates rural environment. Although there are many methods for soil erosion control, over a decade of experience has showed that vetiver grass is the ideal plant for soil and moisture conservation, <b>embankment</b> <b>stabilization</b> and environmental rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Vetiver {{has been}} used very {{successfully}} in erosion control in many countries. It is therefore an excellent plant for slope works. In addition, it is much cheaper using vetiver grass than alternative measures. The cost of <b>embankment</b> <b>stabilization</b> with conventional engineering methods can be reduced by 90 % when vetiver is used as an alternate. But Vetiver grass has a weakness that is brown off in winter; {{as a result the}} landscape effect is not effective. So some Highway Administrative Departments have not accepted Vetiver grass. In order to solve this problem, a mixed planting technique combining Vetiver and native plants was conducted in Baiyun District, Guangzhou. Eight native species were selected mainly for their suitability to grow on exposed sites and in poor soil conditions. Based on the survival and growth rate of the seedlings, the trial indicated that the Vetiver and Native Plants Technique (VNPT) is a simple, practical, low maintenance and very effective method for slope works...|$|E

New clearing of marginal lands for food production on the steep slopes, deforestation for commercial timber production, and large scale construction of highways, railways, dams, mining, quarrying and buildings have caused this problem. Natural forests can conserve water very effectively, but man-made forests consisting of newly planted young {{trees on the}} degraded land can hardly conserve any water, {{which can lead to}} severe erosion. Vetiver grass can grow quickly and control erosion very efficiently. Since 1988, comprehensive research has been conducted through out the country on vetiver, and the grass is now widely used for farmland protection, agricultural infrastructures protection, river bank and coastal protection, sandy dune stabilization and revegetation, highway <b>embankment</b> <b>stabilization,</b> etc. Soil Erosion and Natural Disasters Soil erosion has been a problem ever since man started to cultivate land. It became more critical with increasing population. It was estimated that the soil loss reached 76 900 mill. t. each year in the world.

The chemical properties included in this study were: pH, Electrical conductivity, Organic carbon, and Cation exchange capacity. A physical property such as specific gravity was determined. Four samples of coal fly ash were analysed for the presence of As, Cr, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni and Co. We made comparison between concentration of heavy metals in coal fly ash in Macedonia and concentration of these metals in coal fly ash from Spain, Greece, India, Philippines and the UK, given in literatures. The concentration of As in the fly ash from thermal power plant MEC - Bitola in Macedonia is lower than the contents of this element in the fly ash in thermal power plants from the Philippines and the UK. The contents of other heavy metals is in the range same as theirs. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and ammonium exchange capacity (AEC) values for fly ash from investigation thermal power plant are in the range of 0. 19 - 0. 28 meq/ g for CECs and 0. 17 - 0. 33 meq/g for AECs.

40|$|Western Research Institute, in {{conjunction}} with the Electric Power Research Institute, Foster Wheeler International, Inc. and the US Department of Energy, has undertaken a research and demonstration program designed to examine the market potential and the technical feasibility of ash use options for PFBC ashes. Ashes from the Foster Wheeler Energia Oy pilot-scale circulating PFBC tests in Karhula, Finland, combusting (1) low-sulfur subbituminous and (2) high-sulfur bituminous coal, and ash from the AEP's high-sulfur bituminous coal-fired bubbling PFBC in Brilliant, Ohio, were evaluated in laboratory and pilot-scale ash use testing at WR 1. The technical feasibility study examined the use of PFBC ash in construction-related applications, including its use as a cementing material in concrete and use in cement manufacturing, fill and <b>embankment</b> materials, soil <b>stabilization</b> agent, and use in synthetic aggregate production. Testing was also conducted to determine the technical feasibility of PFBC ash as a soil amendment for acidic and sodic problem soils and spoils encountered in agricultural and reclamation applications. The results of the technical feasibility testing indicated the following conclusions. PFBC ash does not meet the chemical requirements as a pozzolan for cement replacement. However, it does appear that potential may exist for its use in cement production as a pozzolan and/or as a set retardant. PFBC ash shows relatively high strength development, low expansion, and low permeability properties that make its use in fills and embankments promising. Testing has also indicated that PFBC ash, when mixed with low amounts of lime, develops high strengths, suitable for soil stabilization applications and synthetic aggregate production. Synthetic aggregate produced from PFBC ash is capable of meeting ASTM/AASHTO specifications for many construction applications. The residual calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate in the PFE 3 C ash {{has been shown to be}} of value in making PFBC ash a suitable soil amendment for acidic and sodic problem soils and mine spoils. In conclusion, PFBC ash represents a viable material for use in currently established applications for conventional coal combustion ashes. As such, PFBC ash should be viewed as a valuable resource, and commercial opportunities for these materials should be explored for planned PFBC installations...|$|R

As an effective way for the soil stabilization, the technique is used today in a variety of applications ranging from retaining structures and <b>embankments</b> to subgrade <b>stabilization</b> beneath footings and pavements. Nowadays, randomly distributed fiber reinforced soils have attracted increasing attention in geotechnical engineering. A series of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) Test were done in this study. River sand and wire mesh fiber was selected as material for this testing. There are various laboratories testing for determination of soil classification that take place before CBR testing. For the sample preparation, 1 mm diameter of wire mesh fiber was cut in a range of 0. 5 - 1 cm length. Different percentage of fibers that used for the testing are included 1 %, 3 %, and 5 %. Fibers were mix homogeneously with fine sand. In the current study, optimum moisture content (10 %), + 2 % of moisture content (8. 5 %), and - 2 % of moisture content (11. 24 %) were used as control moisture for the testing. Optimum moisture content was developed from Standard Proctor Compaction Test. Results indicates that the CBR value increases with increasing percentage of fiber. For the reinforced soil, the results show that it is higher in CBR value compared to unreinforced soil. Besides that, according to bearing capacity of fiber reinforced soil in the CBR value, the optimum value of fiber content is 3 %. The addition of 3 % fiber shows the most obvious of the increases value of CBR. Inclusion of further higher fiber content will not provide the soil more strength than optimum value. In addition, sample with optimum moisture content (10 %) shows the greatest gain. Very high moisture content will reduce the strength of the soil. In order to improve the result, the other test for determining of bearing capacity can be done such as plate load test which is require big scale test. Small scale size of the CBR test apparatus limits the amount of the fiber inclusion...|$|R

Woven Synthetic geotextiles are not environmental friendly and as imported these are often found to be costly. Jute geotextiles (JGT) are indigenous and have got enough potential for use as initial reinforcement and moisture absorption accelerator in road subgrades, for river bank protection via facilitating establishment of inverted filter formation and for top soil erosion control of exposed slope surfaces. By employing different modification techniques, JGTs may be converted into designed biodegradable material without changing its environmental friendly properties. In the present study two types of JGTs (untreated 627 gsm and untreated 724 gsm) have been used. The samples are supplied by Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) and Bangladesh Jute Research Institute (BJRI). The most important properties of JGT, i. e., tensile strength and strain at maximum load have been evaluated for both types of samples at different strain rate.

40|$|Degrading {{permafrost}} conditions {{around the}} world are posing stability issues for infrastructure constructed on them. Railway lines have exceptionally low tolerances for differential settlements associated with permafrost degradation due to the potential for train derailments. Railway owners with tracks in permafrost regions therefore make it a priority to identify potential settlement locations so that proper maintenance or <b>embankment</b> <b>stabilization</b> measures can be applied to ensure smooth and safe operations. The extensive discontinuous permafrost zone along the Hudson Bay Railway (HBR) in Northern Manitoba, Canada, has been experiencing accelerated deterioration, resulting in differential settlements that necessitate continuous annual maintenance to avoid slow orders and operational interruptions. This paper seeks to characterize the different permafrost degradation susceptibilities present at the study site. Track geometry exceptions were compared against remotely sensed vegetation indices to establish a relationship between track quality and vegetation density. This relationship was used as a proxy for subsurface condition verified by electrical resistivity tomography. The established relationship was then used to develop a three-level degradation susceptibility chart to indicate low, moderate and high susceptibility regions. The defined susceptibility regions can be used to better allocate the limited maintenance resources and also help inform potentially long-term stabilization measures for the severely affected sections...|$|E

This stockpile was created for dry FGD by-product material {{to be held in}} reserve for a land application uses field demonstration. High volume, beneficial uses of dry FGD by-products, such as for mine reclamation and <b>embankment</b> <b>stabilization,</b> will require temporary stockpiling of the by-product. Purpose for constructing this pile was to study changes with time in the LIMB by-product material when exposed to weathering. This by-product material was studied over a 2 1 / 2 year period. The water to control fugitive dust was added in the ash conditioner at the power plant while being loaded into dump trucks. Amount of water normally added in the conditioning process is close to the optimum moisture content of 40 [...] 50 % (dry weight basis), to construct a compacted road embankment or road base. Four environmental operating permits required for construction of the storage pile were obtained, three from Ohio EPA (air, water and solid waste), and one from the Ohio Division of Reclamation (revised reclamation area permit). There was no significant environmental impacts from storm runoff or leachate water from the LIMB ash stockpile during the initial 18 month period through December, 1992. After 2 1 / 2 years of storage, the potential value of the LIMB material for use as a road embankment material or soil conditioner has declined significantly. Ettringite formation occurs.

Orange Jasmine is a small tropical evergreen shrub which has deep root systems and {{is considered to be a}} drought-tolerant plant that adapts well to a wide range of climatic and soil conditions. It can also grow in infertile soils, limestone soils or loam. Vetiver grass has been widely cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world for soil and water conservation, land rehabilitation, and <b>embankment</b> <b>stabilization.</b> Vetiver grass has deep roots (2 – 4 m) and adapts well under extreme conditions of temperature, soil, moisture, soil acidity, and alkalinity. The role of Orange Jasmine and Vetiver grass in minimizing rainwater infiltration, for improving the stability of slopes, was investigated on a soil slope in Singapore with its tropical climate. Two slope sections, covered with Orange Jasmine and Vetiver grass, were instrumented with tensiometers, installed at different depths within the slope, and a rainfall gauge. The instruments were connected to a real-time monitoring system to study the pore-water pressure, the rainfall, and the groundwater level in the slope throughout a one-year period. The pore-water pressure characteristics within the slope sections covered with Orange Jasmine and Vetiver grass are analyzed and presented in this paper. The analyses indicate that both Orange Jasmine and Vetiver grass played a significant role in reducing rainwater infiltration into the slope, minimizing the loss of matric suction, and hence, the shear strength of the soil during rainfall and, as a result, maintained the stability of the slope. Vetiver grass and Orange Jasmine appeared to be similar in effectiveness in terms of reducing the rainwater infiltration into the slope...|$|E
40|$|The {{mainline}} {{railway track}} between Dublin and Belfast in Northern Ireland was constructed during the 1850 's. Substantial lengths of railway embankment were constructed over poor-quality peaty soils. This was accomplished using tree trunk fascines placed {{directly on the}} natural ground surface; with poor-quality local peaty soils used as light weight fill. In recent years, Northern Ireland Railways have noticed that these sections of railway track have been deteriorating more rapidly than sections of the track where the foundations are more competent. The magnitudes of displacement of the track under train loading appear to be increasing gradually over time and train speeds {{have had to be}} reduced. This thesis is based on the research done to monitor the response of these railway track and embankment structures to dynamic train loading. The displacements were monitored for two different embankments under a variety of loading conditions and for various seasonal conditions. These displacements were recorded using a sensor created for this task. The sensor consisted of a photo-sensitive array mounted on the sleepers and a laser, which was placed outside the area of influence of train loading, and shone on the photo-sensitive array. Analytical (Winkler) modelling was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} train speed and the cause of the large train-induced displacements. Analytical and finite element modelling were used to determine the effectiveness of alternative methods of <b>embankment</b> <b>stabilization.</b> The results from the analytical modelling suggest that the deformation of the embankment under train loading was not due to dynamic excitation, but static deformation of the poor-quality fill and soft foundation materials. From both the analytical and finite element modelling of possible remediation techniques, methods that stiffen the embankment and foundation material are shown to be the most effective at reducing the train induced deflection of the embankment...|$|E
