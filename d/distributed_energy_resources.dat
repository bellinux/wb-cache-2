40|$|AbstractThis paper aims at {{modelling}} an electronically coupled <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> with {{an adaptive}} protection scheme. The electronically coupled <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> is a microgrid framework formed by coupling the {{renewable energy source}} electronically. Further, the proposed adaptive protection scheme provides a suitable protection to the microgrid for various fault conditions irrespective of the operating mode of the microgrid: namely, grid connected mode and islanded mode. The outstanding aspect of the developed adaptive protection scheme is that it monitors the microgrid and instantly updates relay fault current according to the variations {{that occur in the}} system. The proposed adaptive protection scheme also employs auto reclosures, through which the proposed adaptive protection scheme recovers faster from the fault and thereby increases the consistency of the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive protection is studied through the time domain simulations carried out in the PSCAD⧹EMTDC software environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – As {{the power}} grids are {{integrated}} into one big umbrella called a “smart grid,” communication protocol {{plays a key}} role in successful operations. The successful deployment of smart grid interoperability is a major hurdle that must be overcome. The micro grid, a small power system that <b>distributes</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource,</b> is operated in diverse regions. Different vendors use different communication protocols in the operation of the micro grid. Recently, the IEC 61850 has been legislated to solve the interoperability problems in power utility automation. The present paper presents a micro grid system based on the IEC 61850 protocol. It consists of a micro grid monitoring system, a protocol converter that transforms serial data to IEC 61850 data, and <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> controllers for diverse DER nodes. A developed communication gateway can be deployed for DER controllers with serial links to exchange data with IEC 61850 -based devices. The gateway can be extended to IEC 61850 -based distribution automation systems, substation automation systems, or SCADA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—With {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} distributed genera-tion {{in the distribution}} networks (DN), the secure and optimal operation of DN has become an important concern. In this paper, an iterative quadratic constrained quadratic programming model to minimize voltage deviations and maximize <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> (DER) active power output in a three phase unbalanced distribution system is developed. The optimization model {{is based on the}} linearized sensitivity coefficients between controlled variables (e. g., node voltages) and control variables (e. g., real and reactive power injections of DERs). To avoid the oscillation of solution when it is close to the optimum, a golden search method is introduced to control the step size. Numerical simulations on modified IEEE 13 nodes test feeders show the efficiency of the proposed model. Compared to the results solved by heuristic search (harmony algorithm), the proposed model converges quickly to the global optimum.
