During this period, Lee's mother died in Sacramento, and Lee's brother Chew-Mon Lee died at the rank of colonel in the US Army while serving as an attache in Taiwan. His brother Chew-Fan Lee advanced in his career as <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacist.</b> In 1975, Lee began working as a regulatory compliance coordinator for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association; a position he held for almost two decades. Lee was married twice, producing no children. He had a step-daughter from his second marriage. Lee retired from his civilian career, living near Washington, D.C. in Arlington, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Adoption of telepharmacy in Canada {{began as}} a {{response}} to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in Cranbrook, British Columbia, in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacist</b> in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation. Remote dispensing machines for medication began operation in Ontario, Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the dispensing machine, the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone videoconference to a pharmacist at a remote site. The pharmacist reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes. As of 2009, a hospital in Ontario, Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on-site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is most helpful.|$|E

It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a department store in Columbus, Georgia. The two quietly married in a Roman Catholic seminary in Holy Trinity, Alabama on June 19, 1938. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local newspaper. They had two sons.

50|$|Charles B Macgibbon {{played an}} {{important}} role in developing the hospital pharmacy profession in Australia. He was the Chief Pharmacist at the Royal Melbourne Hospital from 1938.

Charles realised that by joining together, <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in Victoria could strengthen the profession and contribute to better quality pharmacy services. Charles and Fred J.

40|$|Orientation: <b>Hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in South Africa are {{experiencing}} increased stress {{because of the}} high demand for their services, a lack of resources in hospital pharmacies, and the shortage of pharmacists in South Africa. Research purpose: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether job stress and coping strategies could predict the work-related well-being (burnout and work engagement) of <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in South Africa. Motivation for the study: Information about the work-related well-being and coping strategies of <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> could be used to plan individual and organisational interventions which can be used to retain them and to manage their well-being and performance. Research design, approach and method: A survey design was used. A stratified random sample (N = 187) of pharmacists in South African hospitals was studied. The Maslach Burnout Inventory – Human Services Survey, Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, Pharmacist Stress Inventory and the COPE questionnaire were administered. Main findings: The results showed that job related stress and three coping strategies (approach coping, avoidant coping, and turning to religion) predicted burnout and work engagement of South African <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists.</b> Practical implications: Job stressors that are in the main responsible for the unfavourable work environment and that lead to the development of burnout amongst <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> should be addressed. It is also important to enhance the coping capabilities of the <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists.</b> Contribution/value-add: The findings of this study provide insight into the factors impacting on the work-related well-being of <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in South Africa. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this issue}} of the CJHP, Al Hamarneh and others 1 report aninteresting study in which they {{assessed}} hospital pharmacists’ own perceptions of their role. The study involved asking <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in Alberta, “What does a pharmacist do?” The majority of responses referred to activities that focused on either drugs or drug distribution; only a minority of responses related to patient-centred activities.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the PHAR-QA (Quality assurance in European pharmacy education and training) project was to investigate how competence-based learning {{could be applied to}} a healthcare, sectoral profession such as pharmacy. This is the first study on evaluation of competences from the pharmacists’ perspective using an improved Delphi method with a large number of respondents from all over Europe. This paper looks at the way in which <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> rank the fundamental competences for pharmacy practice. European <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> (n = 152) ranked 68 competences for pharmacy practice of two types (personal and patient care), arranged into 13 clusters. Results were compared to those obtained from community pharmacists (n = 258). Generally, <b>hospital</b> and community <b>pharmacists</b> rank competences in a similar way. Nevertheless, differences can be detected. The higher focus of <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> on knowledge of the different areas of science as well as on laboratory tests reflects the idea of a hospital pharmacy specialisation. The difference is also visible in the field of drug production. This is a necessary competence in hospitals with requests for drugs for rare diseases, as well as paediatric and oncologic drugs. <b>Hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> give entrepreneurship a lower score, but cost-effectiveness a higher one than community pharmacists. This reflects the reality of pharmacy practice where community pharmacists have to act as entrepreneurs, and <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> are managers staying within drug budgets. The results are discussed in the light of a “hospital pharmacy” specialisation...|$|R

40|$|Supply {{problems}} of drugs are an increasing and worldwide problem, also in Belgium. <b>Hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> try to manage drug supply problems {{to minimize the}} impact on patient care. This study aims to quantify in a detailed manner how much time employees of 17 Belgian hospital pharmacies spend on drug supply problems. During six months, employees of Belgian hospital pharmacies filled in the daily time spent on drug supply problems using a template containing all steps which can be executed to manage drug supply problems. Additionally, Belgian <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> were asked to report the drugs which experienced drug supply problems together with the solution for this problem. <b>Hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> spent a median of 109 minutes a week on drug supply problems, {{with a minimum of}} 40 minutes per week and a maximum of 216 minutes per week. Fifty-nine percent of the total time spent on drug supply problems was executed by <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 27 % by pharmacy technicians; the rest was performed by logistic or administrative personnel. About one third of the total time spent was invested in gathering information on the supply problem. About two third of the supply disruptions caused drug shortages, meaning there was a need to switch to another (generic) therapeutic alternative. For most drug shortages, a Belgian generic medicine could be found. However in some cases, the alternative had to be ordered abroad or for some drug shortages, no alternative was available. These exploratory results on time spent by <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacists</b> on drug supply problems in Belgium highlight the economic impact of drug supply problems for hospital pharmacies.
