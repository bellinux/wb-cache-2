25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E
500|$|During this period, Warner {{showed little}} {{foresight}} in {{his treatment of}} the studio's cartoon operation. [...] Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, [...] "were always stepchildren at Warner Bros." [...] As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, [...] "Jack Warner...considered cartoons {{no more than an}} extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers." [...] In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio's cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn't [...] "even know where the hell the cartoon studio is", and Harry added, [...] "The only thing <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we make Mickey Mouse," [...] a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions. Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece. [...] As Thomas noted, [...] "They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. People remember who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{took the}} {{instrument}} into her hand. What passed {{between her and}} the person at the other end I had, of course, no means of telling.

60|$|All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{he disliked}} me {{and had some}} {{contempt}} for my person. Why? Apparently because his ship had been delayed three hours on my account. Who was I {{to have such a}} thing done for me? Such a thing had never been done for him. It was a sort of jealous indignation.|$|R

500|$|Soon after Bannister {{pronounced}} Hendrix dead, {{a hospital}} spokesperson told the press: [...] "We don't know where, how, or why he died, but {{he died of}} an overdose." [...] By that evening, many newspapers in London and New York had printed sensationalized headlines that exploited the death-from-overdose account. Hendrix's public relations manager, Les Perrin, granted an interview on Dutch radio soon after the hospital announcement. He commented: [...] "Well, all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Hendrix's body was taken to St. Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London, at 11:45 this morning, and he was certified to be dead on arrival." [...] At 2 p.m., BBC Radio 1 reported: [...] "Jimi Hendrix, regarded by millions {{as one of the}} most talented and original performers in modern rock music, is dead." [...] That evening, The New York Times described him as [...] "a genius black musician, a guitarist, singer and composer of brilliantly dramatic power. He spoke in gestures and big as he could imagine and create." ...|$|E
500|$|Tucci {{was one of}} {{the last}} actors cast; he agreed to play Nigel only three days before {{shooting}} started. The filmmakers reportedly had auditioned Barney's creative director Simon Doonan and E!'s Robert Verdi, both openly gay men highly visible as media fashion commentators, for the part; the BBC's Graham Norton also auditioned. Verdi would later claim there was no intention to actually hire him and the producers had just used him and Doonan to give whoever they ultimately did cast some filmed research to use in playing a gay character (he would end up with a walk-on part as a fashion journalist in Paris). Tucci claims he was unaware of this: [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> someone called me and I realized this was a great part." [...] He based the character on various people he was acquainted with, insisting on the glasses he ultimately wore. Daniel Sunjata had originally read for Tucci's part, rather unenthusiastically since he had just finished playing a similar character, but then read the Holt part and asked if he could audition for it. Simon Baker auditioned by sending a video of himself, wearing the same self-designed green jacket he has on when he and Andrea meet for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Yusef is {{introduced}} {{as part of}} a storyline involving the Masood family. Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef {{is introduced}} to Tamwar's parents Masood and Zainab, Masood [...] "explodes" [...] with anger at the sight of him, recognising him as a man from their past. Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: [...] "we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it {{from his point of view}} that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I went back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire'." [...] Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist. In March2011, Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011, and would [...] "see from there". He made his first appearance on 23November2010. Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying,"He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - for someone to come and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play." ...|$|E

All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I'm in love with Myra [...] I love her completely and {{want to spend the}} rest of my life with her." [...] Fox said that she had been reluctant to come out because, having already dealt with obsessed fans and stalkers, she feared fans' possible reactions. In 2009, she announced her plans to form a civil partnership with Stratton.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926 Briggs was {{appointed}} assistant director {{for research and}} testing by National Bureau of Standards Director George Kimball Burgess. On Burgess's death in 1932, Briggs was nominated by US President Herbert C. Hoover to Burgess {{as director of the}} National Bureau of Standards. However, none of Hoover's nominations were acted on by the US Congress before he left office. After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as president in 1933 he was pressed to name [...] "a good Democrat" [...] as director of the National Bureau of Standards. Roosevelt, not wishing to make a patronage appointment, replied, [...] "I haven't the slightest idea whether Briggs is a Republican or a Democrat; all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he is the best qualified man for the job." ...|$|E

[...] The fire, which started in Spokane River gorge, was {{approaching}} the campus when the sisters tacked Durocher's picture to trees and prayed to her for help. [...] Flames were reportedly within 15 feet of the chapel, with smoke filling the interior, when the fire changed direction. [...] Similarly, in 1979, Frank Carr, {{the owner of a}} lake resort in Tonasket, Washington, observed an uncontrolled wildfire change direction after he tossed a picture of Durocher into the flames. [...] Said Carr, [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we threw in the picture and the wind changed.

2500|$|Due to {{the notoriety}} {{surrounding}} how {{the band was}} signed with Durst, the band is often asked regarding their relationship with him. Scantlin criticized Durst {{in an interview in}} 2004 with Canada's Chart magazine. He stated, [...] "He doesn't write our songs, he doesn't produce our songs, he doesn't do anything for us. He doesn't do our videos anymore. He doesn't do anything for this band. I don't know what he's doing, I don't know what the guy's like.

[...] He added, [...] "And for me to do interviews all the time and be asked about this certain individual... People think he writes music with me or something. He does not do that.

2500|$|The {{difference}} in musical style and composition in Love Is Dead compared to Kerli's second album's material is significant.

Maybe I'll be totally depressed and write another really dark album. I have no idea where I'm going to go.

2500|$|The {{possibility}} of Indiana Jones 5 {{continued to be}} discussed through 2009 and 2010. Reports speculated in June 2009 that the next installment would start filming in 2011 with a plot involving the Bermuda Triangle, although these rumors were later described as [...] "completely false" [...] by Frank Marshall on his Twitter page. Speaking to BBC journalist Lizo Mzimba in June 2009, LaBeouf confirmed that [...] "Steven [...] just said that he cracked the story on it , I think they're gearing that up." [...] Lucas stated {{he was working on}} the film as of December 2009. In November 2010, Ford said that he and Spielberg were waiting for Lucas to present an idea to them. In March 2011, the Deadbolt website interviewed Karen Allen and asked her about the fifth film's status. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there's a story that they like", said Allen, [...] "which is a huge step forward. I heard this about six months ago, that they have a story that they like and they're working on it."

It's not on until there is a writer on the project. There is no writer on Indy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Facing {{withering}} {{criticism from}} groups that had questioned {{aspects of the}} book, publisher Henry Holt and Company suspended printing as Pellegrino [...] "had relied on a fraudulent source {{for a portion of}} the book and possibly fabricated others". Pellegrino said that he had trusted Joseph Fuoco, who had claimed to be a replacement flight engineer on one of the planes that escorted the Enola Gay to Hiroshima. John Macrae, who edited the book for the publisher, said that he had questioned and received confirmation of hundreds of sections of the book. Macrae said that he had heard claims from scientist friends that the original atomic bomb had been involved in an accident and that his focus had been on confirming aspects of the book involving survivors, including efforts to speak with double survivor Yamaguchi. Richard Rhodes, author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb said that he would have sought stronger confirmation for aspects of Pellegrino's story that represented [...] "a radical change in the historical record". Pellegrino also faced questions about the existence of Father Mattias, a priest who was said to have survived the bomb in Hiroshima, and of John MacQuitty, who the book said officiated at his funeral. However, director James Cameron defended Pellegrino, saying [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Charlie would not fabricate so there must be a reason for the misunderstanding" [...] and believes that it was caused by [...] "elaborate deception to create a false account." ...|$|E
