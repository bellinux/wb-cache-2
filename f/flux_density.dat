5|$|The {{rotation}} of PSR B1937+21, {{along with other}} millisecond pulsars discovered later, are very stable in their rotation. They are capable of keeping {{time as well as}} atomic clocks. PSR B1937+21 is unusual in that it is one of few pulsars which occasionally emits particularly strong pulses. The <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> of the giant pulses emitted by PSR B1937+21 are the brightest radio emission ever observed. These properties of PSR B1937+21, and its unexpected discovery, are credited with helping revitalize research on pulsars.|$|E
5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E

The distribution function depends only on the global level of magnetic activity, and it is used to study how relations between magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> and radiative <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> from different temperature regimes in the outer atmosphere (derived from spatially resolved solar observations) transform into relations between surface-averaged <b>flux</b> <b>densities.</b> It is found that the transformation to surface-averaged fluxes preserves the power-law character of relations between radiative and magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> for spatially resolved data...|$|R
5000|$|Such locally defined {{gradients}} {{of intensive}} macroscopic variables are called 'thermodynamic forces'. They 'drive' <b>flux</b> <b>densities,</b> perhaps misleadingly often called 'fluxes', which are dual to the forces. These quantities are {{defined in the}} article on Onsager reciprocal relations. Establishing the relation between such forces and <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> {{is a problem in}} statistical mechanics. <b>Flux</b> <b>densities</b> (...) may be coupled. The article on Onsager reciprocal relations considers the stable near-steady thermodynamically non-equilibrium regime, which has dynamics linear in the forces and <b>flux</b> <b>densities.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Evaluation {{of initial}} heat <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> during {{quenching}} {{is very important}} for the practice. They are needed to predict heat transfer modes appearing at the initial time of quenching. Initial heat <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> were evaluated for cylindrical specimens on the basis of CFD modeling during intensive quenching. It is shown that initial heat <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> are significantly less as compared with the critical heat <b>flux</b> <b>densities.</b> That is why there is no film boiling in these conditions. It was assumed that Fourier law is true after creation of boiling layer at the surface of steel parts. The duration of establishing of such layer is within 0. 1 second. It was established in the previous experiments. It is underlined that true initial heat <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> can be evaluated also on the basis of solving the inverse problem using hyperbolic heat conduction equation.

25|$|Electric {{machines}} with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current {{on either side}} of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core <b>flux</b> <b>density,</b> which would otherwise lead to core saturation.|$|E
25|$|To {{minimize}} {{overall weight}} and size, miniature PM motors may use high energy magnets made with neodymium or other strategic elements; most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy. With their higher <b>flux</b> <b>density,</b> electric machines with high-energy PMs {{are at least}} competitive with all optimally designed singly-fed synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles (to ensure starting, regardless of rotor position) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} {{torque density}} of conventional electric machines {{is determined by}} the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt PMs, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or PM damage.|$|E

The new technique of the determination of critical heat <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> in non-stationary conditions of heat transfer is suggested.

40|$|The {{relation}} between compact radio core and X-ray emission in extragalactic radio sources, suggested by Worral et al. (1987) and Kembhavi et al.

It {{was found that the}} radio to X-ray spectral index distribution had a small dispersion, whereas the log-log plot of the <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> showed no correlation. This implies that the basic level of X-ray emission is determined by the radio-core emission, but that the exact value depends on other parameters...|$|R

25|$|In {{collaboration}} with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Dr. Donald MacRae established a radio astronomy observatory on the observatory grounds in 1956. The DDO work led to the 1963 measurement of the absolute <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> of Cassiopeia A at 320MHz, a radiometric standard. The DDO also built an 18m radio telescope in Algonquin Park in northern Ontario, co-locating it {{at the site of}} the larger Algonquin Radio Observatory. This instrument was actively used until 1991, when budget cuts led to it being abandoned. It was later used by a private group as part of a SETI project, Project TARGET, and has reported moved to a site outside Shelburne, Ontario.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an axially-symmetric magnet {{spinning}} at constant velocity, the distribution of the magnetic field intensity B of the magnet is constant with time, even after accounting for the relativistic corrections to B, and therefore by the Maxwell–Faraday equation the electric field induced by the rotation of the magnet is curl-free, which is caused purely by length contraction of the electric fields of its constituting subatomic particles. This means that in this particular example with a rotating magnetic disk and a stationary conducting disk, the induced electric field cannot be described by the Maxwell–Faraday equation, which describes the curl of the electric field induced by a changing magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>density.</b>|$|E
25|$|When optimally {{designed}} {{within a}} given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap <b>flux</b> <b>density,</b> all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) {{within a given}} air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by magnetic core saturation or safe operating temperature rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.|$|E

The resulting N 2 O <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> show a strong seasonality reflecting the wind-driven seasonality of the upwelling: N 2 O <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> are highest {{in the northern part}} (19. 5 °– 21 °N) and show a decreasing trend towards the south. The summer periods with no upwelling (and thus associated with no or negligible N 2 O <b>flux</b> <b>densities)</b> are most pronounced in the southern part (16 °– 17 °N). The mean seasonally and regionally weighted annual N 2 O emissions from the Mauritanian upwelling were estimated to 1. 0 Gg N.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{geometric}} phases and <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> for the metastable states of hydrogen with {{principal quantum number}} n= 2 being subjected to adiabatically varying external electric and magnetic fields. Convenient representations of the <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> as complex integrals are derived. Both, parity conserving (PC) and parity violating (PV) <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> and phases are identified. General expressions for the <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> following from rotational invariance are derived. Specific cases of external fields are discussed. In a pure magnetic field the phases are given by the geometry of the path in magnetic field space. But for electric fields in presence of a constant magnetic field and for electric plus magnetic fields the geometric phases carry information on the atomic parameters, in particular, on the PV atomic interaction. We show that for our metastable states also the decay rates can {{be influenced by the}} geometric phases and we give a concrete example for this effect. Finally we emphasise that the general relations derived here for geometric phases and <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> are also valid for other atomic systems having stable or metastable states, for instance, for He with n= 2. Thus, a measurement of geometric phases may give important experimental information on the mass matrix and the electric and magnetic dipole matrices for such systems.

500|$|The UBV {{photometric}} system {{measures the}} magnitude of stars through ultraviolet, blue, and yellow filters, producing U, B, and V values, respectively.

The mean magnitudes for these six stars were defined as: [...] = [...] =0. In effect, the magnitude scale has been calibrated so that {{the magnitude of}} these stars is the same in the yellow, blue, and ultraviolet parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus, Vega has a relatively flat electromagnetic spectrum in the visual region—wavelength range 350–850 nanometers, most of which can be seen with the human eye—so the flux densities are roughly equal; 2000–4000Jy. However, the <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> of Vega drops rapidly in the infrared, and is near 100 Jy at 5micrometers.|$|E
