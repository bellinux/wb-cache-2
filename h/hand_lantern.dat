60|$|Caterham's private {{secretary}} {{came to him}} from the other carriage and told him that half a mile farther the line had been wrecked, and {{that the rest of the}} journey was to be made in a motor car. Redwood descended upon a platform lit only by a <b>hand</b> <b>lantern</b> and swept by the cool night breeze. The quiet of that derelict, wood-set, weed-embedded suburb--for all the inhabitants had taken refuge in London at the outbreak of yesterday's conflict--became instantly impressive. His conductor took him down the steps to where a motor car was waiting with blazing lights--the only lights to be seen--handed him over to the care of the driver and bade him farewell.|$|E

50|$|The legal {{proceedings}} investigating {{the cause of}} the accident carried on for a year. The exact sequence of events could not be determined, as the dispatcher of the station died in a car accident shortly after the train crash. It was proven that the car accident was not caused by the dispatcher, ruling out suicide. The driver of the freight train, who survived the accident, testified in court that he saw a green light from the dispatcher's <b>hand</b> <b>lantern,</b> signalling him to pass through the station without stopping.|$|E

5000|$|The Radstock {{telegraph}} clerk sent on the [...] "up" [...] {{relief train}} without receiving any crossing order or ascertaining {{the location of}} the [...] "down" [...] train. Shortly before midnight, the driver of the [...] "up" [...] train pulled up at the Foxcote signal box. The signalman there, Alfred Dando was barely literate and not physically strong enough to work his signal levers, so the signal arm was somewhere between [...] "safe" [...] and [...] "caution". The signal lamp was out (as he was not given enough oil to light it), so Dando was waving a <b>hand</b> <b>lantern.</b> After a few minutes, Dando allowed the train to proceed. The clerk at Wellow had already sent the [...] "down" [...] stock train on, but without using his block instruments to alert Dando. The [...] "down" [...] train driver could not see the Foxcote distant signal, as it too was unlit. He saw the home signal against him, and also saw the other train, too late to avoid a collision.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the incident, the Deutsche Bundesbahn removed the blind on the <b>hand</b> <b>lanterns,</b> which could previously be switched between showing a green and a red light. The rules were changed so that a train which was to make an unscheduled stop at a station without exit signals had to be stopped at the entry signal before it could enter the station. The accident also caused criticism of the lightweight construction of the railbus, whose units dated back to the 1950s. Their replacements, the DB Class 628 railcars that were built from the mid-1970s on, were constructed considerably more sturdily.|$|R

Her list was about 28Â° and water was on her main deck when the remainder of her crew boarded PC-550, at no small risk to the submarine chaser which then remained by Sentinel until she capsized at 1030 and went under at 1045.|$|R

50|$|In ancient times, weddings (Honrye) {{were held}} in the bride's yard or house. The groom {{traveled}} by horse to the bride's house and after the wedding ceremony took his wife in a palanquin (sedan chair) to his parents' house to live. The bride and groom wore formal court costumes for the wedding ceremony. Ordinary people were permitted to wear the luxurious clothes only on their wedding day. <b>Hand</b> <b>lanterns</b> are used for lighting {{the way from the}} groom's home to the bride's home on the night before the wedding. Traditionally, the groom's family would carry a wedding chest filled with gifts for the bride's family. Wedding geese are a symbol for a long and happy marriage. Cranes are a symbol of long life and may be represented on the woman's sash. Pairs of wooden Mandarin duck carvings called wedding ducks are often used in traditional wedding ceremonies because they represent peace, fidelity, and plentiful offspring.|$|R

50|$|For heroism on {{the evening}} of April 30, 1967 while engaged in searching for two teen-age boys {{reportedly}} stranded at the Duluth Entry North Breakwater Light, Minnesota. Twin 16-year-old boys and a 17-year-old brother had been seen running along the jetty challenging the 10- to 15-foot waves when witnesses observed a huge wave sweep one boy into the water. When two boys were reported stranded at the light, Petty Officer CULBERTSON and two comrades volunteered to attempt the rescue. Lashing themselves together, the three men proceeded, with <b>hand</b> <b>lanterns</b> as the only illumination, {{to the end of the}} breakwater. Despite the high waves, winds gusting to 40 knots, driving rain and 36-degree water, the rescue party diligently searched the breakwater and light but found no trace of the boys. While returning to the beach a 20-foot wave swept Petty Officer CULBERTSON off his feet and hurled him up to and over the breakwater parapet into the sea. Despite the strenuous efforts of his teammates, Petty Officer CULBERTSON perished in this gallant rescue attempt. His outstanding courage, intrepidity, initiative, and unselfish actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.|$|R

When the postilion put them back in their places {{on the front of the}} coach, the light shone down on the road before us, so that the way where the horses were going was as bright as day.|$|R
50|$|Schonland's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:For extreme heroism {{and courage}} {{above and beyond}} the call of duty as damage control officer of the U.S.S. San Francisco in action against greatly superior enemy forces in the battle off Savo Island, 12-13 November 1942. In the same violent night engagement in which all of his superior officers were killed or wounded, Lt. Comdr. Schonland was fighting valiantly to free the San Francisco of large quantities of water flooding the second deck compartments through numerous shell holes caused by enemy fire. Upon being informed that he was commanding officer, he ascertained that the conning of the ship was being efficiently handled, then directed the officer who had taken over that task to continue while he himself resumed the vitally important work of maintaining the stability of the ship. In water waist deep, he carried on his efforts in darkness illuminated only by <b>hand</b> <b>lanterns</b> until water in flooded compartments had been drained or pumped off and watertight integrity had again been restored to the San Francisco. His great personal valor and gallant devotion to duty at great peril to his own life were instrumental in bringing his ship back to port under her own power, saved to fight again in the service of her country.|$|R

Without hesitation he turned and rode back again and, in a few minutes, met a dark body of men coming along at a rapid run.|$|R

Petty Officer CALLAHAN in attempting to retrieve his fellow Coastguardsman suffered a broken wrist and severe body bruises. In spite of excruciating pain, through sheer determination, Petty Officer CALLAHAN and his companion managed to pull their teammate onto the beach, where all efforts to revive him failed.

60|$|When he {{came back}} to the brook, he found that he could not make any more bubbles come up; but instead of that, his {{attention}} was attracted by some curiously colored pebbles near the shore. He put his hand down into the water, and took up two or three of them. He thought they were beautiful. Then he took his dipper, which had, all this time, been lying forgotten by the side of a log, on the shore, and walked along--the dipper full of raspberries in one <b>hand,</b> the <b>lantern</b> in the other, and his bright and beautiful pebbles in his pocket.|$|R

However, Carol rejects the idea that Hal is dead as the link between her heart and his which she can sense via her ring is still intact, with her ring's visions informing her that Kyle must unite the powers of all seven Corps in himself to stop this latest threat.|$|R
