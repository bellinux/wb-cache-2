25|$|ETFs have a {{reputation}} for lower costs than traditional mutual funds. This will be evident as a lower <b>expense</b> <b>ratio.</b> This is mainly from two factors, the fact that most ETFs are index funds and some advantages of the ETF structure. However, this needs to be compared in each case, since some index mutual funds also have a very low <b>expense</b> <b>ratio,</b> and some ETFs' expense ratios are relatively high. An index fund is much simpler to run, since it does not require some security selection, and can be largely done by computer. Not only does an ETF have lower shareholder-related expenses, but because it does not have to invest cash contributions or fund cash redemptions, an ETF does not have to maintain a cash reserve for redemptions and saves on brokerage expenses. Mutual funds can charge 1% to 3%, or more; index fund expense ratios are generally lower, while ETFs are almost always less than 1%. Over the long term, these cost differences can compound into a noticeable difference.|$|E

A paradox emerges. High <b>expense</b> <b>ratios</b> are associated with better performance. Unsurprisingly, in light of studies of US funds, when we benchmark performance against stock indexes with the same style, we find that {{the performance of}} most mutual funds does not beat the collection of indexes that most closely track the fund. Also, unsurprisingly, we find fund families with high <b>expense</b> <b>ratios</b> serve investors less well than those with low <b>expense</b> <b>ratios,</b> and, unsurprisingly in light of research on the US mutual fund market, the return reduction is larger than can be accounted for by the difference in <b>expense</b> <b>ratios.</b> Surprisingly, for most mutual funds we find high and similar <b>expense</b> <b>ratios.</b> We rank the mutual fund companies from best to worst, and we name names to help investors pick relatively good fund companies.

This study provides comparisons of <b>expense</b> <b>ratios</b> of domestic and international open-end and closed-end equity funds. A univariate analysis of <b>expense</b> <b>ratios</b> indicates that domestic open-end funds generally have higher <b>expense</b> <b>ratios</b> than domestic closed-end funds.

50|$|There {{are three}} broad {{investment}} categories for mutual funds (equity, bond, and money market - in declining order of historical returns). That is an over simplification but adequate {{to explain the}} effect of expenses. In an equity fund where the historical gross return might be 10%, a 1% <b>expense</b> <b>ratio</b> will consume approximately 10% of the investor's return. In a bond fund where the historical gross return might be 8%, a 1% <b>expense</b> <b>ratio</b> will consume approximately 12.5% of the investor's return. In a money market fund where the historical gross return might be 5%, a 1% <b>expense</b> <b>ratio</b> will consume approximately 20% of the investor's historical total return.

Second, I explore {{the impacts of}} nonprofit program <b>expense</b> <b>ratios</b> and fundraising <b>expenses</b> on foundation grantmaking. This analysis focuses on the relative "prices" of donations to competing nonprofit organizations, represented by these <b>expense</b> <b>ratios,</b> and the impact prices have on foundation grant decisions relative to the impact that nonprofit marketing has. Finally, I examine whether greater competition in grants markets increases the importance of program <b>expense</b> <b>ratios</b> and firm marketing behavior for grant selection.

The study covers the period 1988 - 1992 and examines a sample of 41 UK life offices, including 14 mutuals.

50|$|Because the {{composition}} of a target index is a known quantity, relative to actively managed funds, it costs less to run an index fund. Typically expense ratios of an index fund range from 0.10% for U.S. Large Company Indexes to 0.70% for Emerging Market Indexes. The <b>expense</b> <b>ratio</b> of the average large cap actively managed mutual fund as of 2015 is 1.15%.

50|$|Fixed costs (such as rent or {{an audit}} fee) vary on a {{percentage}} basis because the lump sum rent/audit amount {{as a percentage}} will {{vary depending on the}} amount of assets a fund has acquired.

It is, therefore, very hard for a fund to significantly reduce its <b>expense</b> <b>ratio</b> after it has some history. Thus, if an investor buys a fund with a high <b>expense</b> <b>ratio</b> that has some history, he/she should not expect any significant reduction.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe core {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compile an African Mutual Fund database with a focus on fees charged, expenses borne and fund sizes. Until now, no consolidated database of African Mutual Fund expenses exists. The ancillary goal of the paper is to arrange the dataset in order to perform basic statistical analysis; and to test for the existence or non-existence of a number of internationally established relationships between fund fees, expenses and other variables in an African context. The paper aims to establish both similarities and abnormalities relating to the efficiency of African Mutual Funds in comparison with their international counterparts. No prior work has been produced in the context of African Mutual Funds as the industry has been overlooked, until recently, due to the growing perception of Africa representing the final frontier for investors seeking abnormal returns. The fundamental data utilized in this research paper includes African Mutual Fund Total <b>Expense</b> <b>Ratios,</b> Net Asset Values (NAVs), and mean Total <b>Expense</b> <b>Ratios</b> (TERs) for international mutual funds with no particular geographical limitations. This paper achieves its {{objective of}} collating a comprehensive database of African Mutual Fund fees, expenses, size and other variables. Findings include weak evidence confirming the inverse relationship between the level of financial market development and mutual fund <b>expense</b> <b>ratios,</b> the inverse relationship between mean <b>expense</b> <b>ratios</b> per country and the strength of investor protection in the related country, and a positive relationship between fund family size and mean TERs - indicating the presence of scale economies in African Mutual Fund families. All such findings are in line with empirical evidence presented by international studies. Consistent with other exploratory research, the paper includes a number of unexpected findings and observations regarding the general disarray of corporate governance in the African Mutual Fund industry.
