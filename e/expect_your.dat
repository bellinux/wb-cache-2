2500|$|Eurogamer's Christian Donlan {{gave the}} game a 10/10, {{describing}} it as [...] "an endless freewheeling treat of a game" [...] with an [...] "ad-libbed drive to...explore {{how many different}} situations [...] can be squashed into". [...] He noted that this inventiveness carries over to the [...] "lavish and quick-changing" [...] soundtrack: [...] "This is pastiche at its most skillful, its most panoramic." [...] Cheat Code Central's Jenni Lada gave the game a 5/5, calling it [...] "the closest we will ever come to a perfect Mario game, one that is a culmination of every right decision ever made in the series." [...] Nintendo World Report stated that it's a Mario game that one would want to continue playing once the game is beaten and may be the killer app of the Wii U, saying [...] "Thankfully 3D World isn’t just a refinement of the Mario formula, it’s a powerful re-imagining. It’s an explosive cavalcade of color and excitement {{as well as a}} well thought out evolution of Mario." [...] The Escapist gave the game four out of five stars, but was slightly critical of it, saying [...] "Buy it if you love that little plumber, and enjoy the new toys, but don't <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> mind to be blown." ...|$|E
2500|$|An Essay {{begins with}} a series of letters in which Makin {{establishes}} her audience with her original appeal to “all Ingenious and Virtuous Ladies, more especially to her Highness the Lady Mary, eldest Daughter to his Royal Highness the Duke of York" [...] (Makin 1673). In the introductory epistle, Makin admits that to challenge customs, to imply that women are reasonable creatures who will benefit from learning, is a bold attempt and she expects to meet opposition {{while at the same time}} claiming that the patronage of the Royal Highness will be a form of protection. Here, in Makin's exordium, through the use of kairos, she appeals to her audience's interest and sympathy. While her audience is both male and female, her emotional appeal, the pathos of her treatise, is directed at women, for she writes: “I expect to meet with many scoffs and taunts from inconsiderate and illiterate men, that prize their own lusts and pleasure more than your profit and content” (Makin 1673). She goes on to state: “I shall be the less concerned at these, so long as I am in your favor; and this discourse may be a weapon in your hands to defend yourselves, whilst you endeavor to polish your souls, that you may glorify God" [...] (Makin 1673). She further emphasises [...] "ladies" [...] as her target audience: “I hope I shall not need to beg the patience of ladies to peruse this pamphlet: I have bespoken and do <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> patronage, because it is your cause I plead against an ill custom, prejudicial to you, which men will not willingly suffer to be broken” (Makin 1673).|$|E

6000|$|Penrose replied after a pause, {{speaking}} a little sadly. [...] "I <b>expected</b> <b>your</b> married life to encourage you in all your highest aspirations," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Ned," [...] Dr. Green replied, [...] "I {{have been}} <b>expecting</b> <b>your</b> question, and I {{am sorry to}} say that I have nothing {{agreeable}} to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BRADMERE. [With gruff sympathy] Um! Yes. They {{know how}} to die! [Wide another sharp look at him] D'you <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> wife soon? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{expect a}} fresh accident! Haven't you had enough? However, if your gloomy forebodings were justified, I <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> {{relations}} would meet my claim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the only}} {{rational}} thing I have heard," [...] said the Major. [...] "Though--did your uncle <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> young blood to keep the terms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Pavillon, [...] "and she <b>expects</b> <b>your</b> {{approach}} with much impatience, {{to determine which}} way you shall go since you are both determined on going. But I trust you will tarry breakfast?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then my luck is bad again," [...] said Kit. [...] "All the same, I've come {{to ask for}} {{something}} and meant to state that I <b>expected</b> <b>your</b> support. I meant to see you anyhow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{inclined}} to bargain?" [...] growled the other. [...] "It {{would be bad}} policy, I assure you. At present I have no orders about your person, but we <b>expected</b> <b>your</b> assistance in catching this Malay." ...|$|R
6000|$|For a moment, Osborn's anger blazed up again. [...] "I {{see where}} you are leading, you contemptible cur! You <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> sister to pay for you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, don't you see {{it would}} be impossible? The world couldn't go on. How do you <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> {{children}} to live if you give this money away?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you {{had ever}} been {{engaged to be married}} before,' he went on, 'I <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> opinion of my {{addresses}} would be different. But then, I should not----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All in good time, Sire," [...] said Howard. [...] "But not crudely, not crudely. This is one {{of those}} flimsy times when no man has a settled mind. <b>Your</b> awakening--no one <b>expected</b> <b>your</b> awakening. The Council is consulting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the clerk}} says you are <b>expecting</b> <b>your</b> HUSBAND on the steamer. What does this mean? Why {{did you tell}} him that?" [...] He had so far {{collected}} himself that there was a ring of inquisition in his voice.|$|R
6000|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{the door was}} re-opened, and a keen-looking gentleman, about six-and-thirty years of age, rather short in stature, but nevertheless very dignified-looking, came forward with out-stretched hands--'Greet you well, my Lord de Ribaumont. We <b>expected</b> <b>your</b> coming. Welcome, mine honoured friend's grandson.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{makes it}} worse,' cried Annora, 'if you are {{arranging}} a marriage {{in which you}} <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> child to be less happy than {{if she were a}} nun.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Bob, no slang. You {{know that}} mother doesn't like it. By the way, talkin' of mothers, is it on Wednesday or Thursday that you <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{understand}} that I cannot <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> services, Mr. Dockwrath,--your valuable time and services,--without remunerating you for them. That shall be fully explained to Messrs. Round and Crook." ...|$|E
5000|$|You want {{to choose}} a {{stopping}} rule to maximise <b>your</b> <b>expected</b> reward (or equivalently, minimise <b>your</b> <b>expected</b> loss) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you, Ormesby; and, of course, you {{and your}} companions will spend the night here," [...] he said cordially. [...] "My girls told me they had met you, and we were partly <b>expecting</b> <b>your</b> company. Apparently the malefactor got away, Sergeant Mackay?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nevitt {{looked at}} the paper with an {{attentive}} eye. [...] "How curious it is," [...] he said, regarding the signature narrowly, [...] "that you and Cyril, who are so much alike in everything else, should write so differently. I should have <b>expected</b> <b>your</b> hands to be almost identical." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, if good-nature {{show some}} slender proof, They never {{think they have}} reward enough; But, like our modern Quakers of the town, <b>Expect</b> <b>your</b> manners, and return you none.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{that is all}} I can <b>expect,</b> <b>your</b> Excellency, {{under the}} circumstances," [...] replied Mr. Merrick. [...] "I suppose I ought {{to thank you for}} your present act of justice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{on my last}} legs. I may {{not live}} an hour. But that's none of your business, I suppose. By the way, I <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> cousin on the {{afternoon}} train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, after I came inside; but, of course, I {{was more}} or less restless <b>expecting</b> <b>your</b> father to ride up, and then it's all rather {{exciting}} business to a novice. I could hear all sorts of birds and beasts stepping and fluttering about. I was scared in spite of my best resolution." ...|$|R
6000|$|Squire Gaylord came alone, {{and when}} Marcia greeted him with [...] "Why, father! Where's mother?" [...] he asked, [...] "Did you expect her? Well, I guess your mother's feeling rather {{too old for}} such long winter journeys. You know she don't go out a great deal I guess she <b>expects</b> <b>your</b> family {{down there in the}} summer." ...|$|R
6000|$|Colonel Woodburn cut in. [...] "You couldn't do that, Mr. Dryfoos, {{under your}} system. And if you {{attempted}} it, with your conspiracy laws, {{and that kind}} of thing, it might bring the climax sooner than you <b>expected.</b> <b>Your</b> commercialized society has built its house on the sands. It will have to go. But I should be sorry if it went before its time." ...|$|R
60|$|GRACE (half {{aside to}} him, significantly). You understand. (Julia, {{watching}} them jealously, leaves {{her father and}} gets close to Charteris. Grace adds aloud) I shall <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> support before the committee.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} see you," [...] said Jimmy in a quiet voice. [...] "I'd better state my object, because in {{a minute or two}} I <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> friends will come along--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it always}} {{takes the form}} of bank-notes I care not how great the reward may be. You will doubtless, as a good Christian, <b>expect</b> <b>your</b> own reward--for him and for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'These {{have been}} scraped {{together}} and laid by, lest sickness or death should separate {{my son and}} me. They have been purchased {{at the price of}} much hunger, hard labour, and want of rest. If you CAN take them--do--on condition that you leave this place upon the instant, and enter no more into that room, where he sits now, <b>expecting</b> <b>your</b> return.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--having conferred his {{affections}} on {{the young}} Countess Isabelle de Croye, the Duke <b>expects</b> <b>your</b> Majesty will, on your part, as he on his, yield your assent to the marriage, and unite with him in endowing the right noble couple with such an appanage, as, joined to the Countess's estates, may form a fit establishment for a Child of France." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} I shall love her, Vincent, for I think, my boy, {{that you would not}} make a rash choice. I think you are young, much too young, to be engaged; still, that is a {{secondary}} matter. Now tell us all about it. We <b>expected</b> <b>your</b> story to be exciting, but did not dream that love-making had any share in it." ...|$|R
