50|$|An <b>isoquant</b> {{shows that}} {{extent to which}} the firm in {{question}} has the ability to substitute between the two different inputs at will in order to produce the same level of output. An <b>isoquant</b> map can also indicate decreasing or increasing returns to scale based on increasing or decreasing distances between the <b>isoquant</b> pairs of fixed output increment, as output increases. If the distance between those isoquants increases as output increases, the firm's production function is exhibiting decreasing returns to scale; doubling both inputs will result in placement on an <b>isoquant</b> with less than double the output of the previous <b>isoquant.</b> Conversely, if the distance is decreasing as output increases, the firm is experiencing increasing returns to scale; doubling both inputs results in placement on an <b>isoquant</b> with more than twice the output of the original <b>isoquant.</b>|$|E

Also, every possible combination of inputs {{is on an}} <b>isoquant.</b> Finally, any combination of inputs above or {{to the right of}} an <b>isoquant</b> results in more output than any point on the <b>isoquant.</b> Although the marginal product of an input decreases as you increase the quantity of the input while holding all other inputs constant, the marginal product is never negative in the empirically observed range since a rational firm would never increase an input to decrease output.|$|E
50|$|Along an <b>isoquant,</b> the MRTS {{shows the}} rate at which one input (e.g. capital or labor) may be {{substituted}} for another, while maintaining the same level of output. Thus the MRTS is the absolute value of the slope of an <b>isoquant</b> at the point in question.|$|E
50|$|The isocost line is {{combined}} with the <b>isoquant</b> map to determine the optimal production point at any given level of output. Specifically, the point of tangency between any <b>isoquant</b> and an isocost line gives the lowest-cost combination of inputs that can produce the level of output associated with that <b>isoquant.</b> Equivalently, it gives the maximum level of output that can be produced for a given total cost of inputs. A line joining tangency points of isoquants and isocosts (with input prices held constant) is called the expansion path.|$|E

40|$|Data Envelopment Analysis is a {{procedure}} {{for evaluation of}} the relative efficiency of units in a production system. DEA involves construction of composite units as convex combinations of other units' inputs and outputs under various conditions related to returns to scale. The assumption of convexity is inconsistent with increasing returns to scale and not implied by constant or non-increasing returns to scale. An alternative DEA approach which does not invoke the assumption of a convex production possibility set is developed in this paper. It is implemented in two stages.

We can further test the implications of technical change on the productivity of the inputs: labor, land, fertilizer, and capital.

5000|$|An <b>isoquant</b> (derived from {{quantity}} and the Greek word iso, meaning equal) is a contour line drawn through {{the set of}} points at which the same quantity of output is produced while changing the quantities {{of two or more}} inputs. [...] While an indifference curve mapping helps to solve the utility-maximizing problem of consumers, the <b>isoquant</b> mapping deals with the cost-minimization problem of producers. Isoquants are typically drawn along with isocostcurves in capital-labor graphs, showing the technological tradeoff between capital and labor in the production function, and the decreasing marginal returns of both inputs. Adding one input while holding the other constant eventually leads to decreasing marginal output, and this is reflected {{in the shape of the}} <b>isoquant.</b> A family of isoquants can be represented by an <b>isoquant</b> map, a graph combining a number of isoquants, each representing a different quantity of output. Isoquants are also called equal product curves.|$|E
50|$|According to the argument, it is {{impossible}} to conceive of capital {{in such a way that}} its quantity is independent of the rates of interest and wages. The problem is that this independence is a precondition of constructing an <b>isoquant.</b> Further, the slope of the <b>isoquant</b> helps determine relative factor prices, but the curve cannot be constructed (and its slope measured) unless the prices are known beforehand.|$|E

50|$|With two inputs, say {{labor and}} capital, the {{optimization}} {{problem is to}} minimize the total cost (amount spent on factors of production, say labor and physical capital) subject to achieving a given level of output, as illustrated in the graph. Each of the convex isoquants shows various combinations of labor and capital usage all of which would allow a given amount of output to be produced. Each straight line segment is an isocost curve showing various amounts of labor and capital whose combined usage would cost a given amount unique to that isocost curve. Conditional on producing the amount of output consistent with, say, the middle <b>isoquant,</b> the lowest cost {{can be obtained by}} using amounts of labor and capital such that the point on the given <b>isoquant</b> is on the lowest possible isocost curve--that is, at the point of tangency between the given <b>isoquant</b> and one of the cost curves. At the tangency the marginal rate of technical substitution between the factors (the absolute value of the slope of the <b>isoquant</b> at the optimal point) equals the relative factor costs (the absolute value of the slope of the isocost curve).|$|E

50|$|Isoquants are {{typically}} combined with isocost lines {{in order to}} solve a cost-minimization problem for given level of output. In the typical case shown in the top figure, with smoothly curved isoquants, a firm with fixed unit costs of the inputs will have isocost curves that are linear and downward sloped; any point of tangency between an <b>isoquant</b> and an isocost curve represents the cost-minimizing input combination for producing the output level associated with that <b>isoquant.</b> A line joining tangency points of isoquants and isocosts (with input prices held constant) is called the expansion path.|$|E
