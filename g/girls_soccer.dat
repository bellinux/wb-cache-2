25|$|In {{the post}} {{apartheid}} South Africa, {{construction of new}} schools in poorer townships often failed to include the construction of both indoor and outdoor sporting facilities. There might be some space set aside for a netball court or a soccer field, though {{that may be the}} only substitute available. The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where men are the dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer physical education classes. To address this need, they have school teams. Most schools only offer netball for <b>girls,</b> <b>soccer</b> for boys and athletics for both genders.
