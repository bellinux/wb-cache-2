50|$|The {{day after}} the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley issued a {{proclamation}} declaring June 11 Chicago Blackhawks Day {{in the city of}} Chicago. That day, an estimated two million Chicagoans attended the Blackhawks Stanley Cup parade, more than the estimated 1.75 million who attended the parade for the Chicago White Sox 2005 World Series championship,and more than the rallies at Grant Park for any of the Chicago Bulls. The Blackhawks' celebration also overshadowed the series between the White Sox and Chicago Cubs taking place around the same time. However, White Sox manager Ozzie <b>Guillén</b> <b>said</b> that the parade the White Sox had was far bigger than the Blackhawks'. Daley presented the proclamation to the team at the celebratory parade and rally.|$|E

The field would eventually become {{the site of the}} monumental stadium the University of San Agustín would build. Early efforts to gather funds were largely organized by the university, which organized several fund-raisers by giving volunteering students lottery tickets to sell throughout the city. The prizes consisted of apartments near the new stadium. The rector of university Juan Manuel <b>Guillén</b> <b>said</b> that 70% of the stadium was financed through this lottery fund-raiser. Former president Alberto Fujimori promised to donate $2.5 million for the construction of the stadium; however the project only received S./ 2.5 million from the former president which he received severe criticism for.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, {{he spoke}} against Arizona's new law {{to deal with}} illegal immigration. Guillen {{described}} illegal immigrants as [...] "workaholics." [...] "And this country can't survive without them," [...] he said. [...] "There {{are a lot of}} people from this country who are lazy. We're not. Prove me wrong. A lot of people in this country want to be on the computer and send e-mails to people. We do the hard work. We're the ones who go out and work in the sun to make this country better." [...] In August, <b>Guillen</b> <b>said</b> that Asian players were treated better than Latino players, stating that while it is common practice for major league clubs to provide a Japanese or Korean translator for their Asian born players, no such translator is provided for their Spanish-speaking Latin American ballplayers.|$|E

Rafael <b>Guillén</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "... manages to convey a great encouragement and an unusually rich poetic imagery ...". Miguel Delibes stated, [...] "... is a work full of expressiveness ...". Salome maintained her line of poetic prose in her fourth book, a novel, [...] "Dejame Ser Tu Derrotada Estrella" [...] which achieves a great balance between narrative and lyric and is accompanied by a CD containing the texts of Salome, the guitarist José Gras, songs from Luis Eduardo Aute and Amancio Prada, in addition to readings by Luis Eduardo Aute, Amancio Prada, Andres Aberasturi, Trecet Ramón, Andrés Sorel, José Carlos Plaza, Lolo Rico the author herself Salome Ortega.|$|E
5000|$|When the new Comiskey Park (now called Guaranteed Rate Field) was built, many in {{the media}} and {{baseball}} (including both Cubs and White Sox fans) called the park [...] "sterile", and lacking the beauty and personality of the old park, even though many seats at the old park were cramped, behind posts, or in the outfield. Others contend that in contrast Wrigley Field is dirty, uncomfortable, and generally unpleasant to be in. Regardless, this again set up a point of rivalry as Cubs fans had their classic park, while White Sox fans had their modern park. Former Sox manager Ozzie <b>Guillén</b> <b>said</b> of Wrigley, [...] "But one thing about Wrigley Field, I puke every time I go there", further polarizing this point of contention. While several renovations to Guaranteed Rate Field have silenced many criticisms, such as the improved upper deck and bleachers, the difference between the fields remains a point of rivalry between fans of the teams.|$|E
5000|$|Aside from ratings game, {{the series}} is also {{considered}} as a [...] "critical success" [...] from its pilot telecast. Journal's resident entertainment columnist, Mario Bautista praised Rocco Nacino's acting performances, said that [...] "is fascinating to watch in Akin Pa rin ang Bukas because he obviously understands his role well. As the scheming and double dealing Jerry, he {{is a young man}} from squatters who try to make it appear in front of Lovi Poe as Lovelia that he is rich and cultured. When he's at home with the squatters, he really acts like a regular uncouth 'sanggan'. But when he's with Lovi and Cesar Montano, he speaks in English and delivers lines he quotes from the Hollywood movies he watches and imitates. In his reviews, Isah Red of Manila Standard Today, praised Poe as she [...] "continues to amaze the audience with her nearly naturalistic performance as a woman who is struggling between death and love." [...] Red also praised series' director Laurice <b>Guillen,</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "Guillen is meticulous in making sure that it does not develop into a nonsensical melodrama in which the plot meanders repetitiously. And I am glad its storyline goes into the direction in which we discover a lot about the characters." ...|$|E
5000|$|The network's drama {{department}} hired seasoned {{actress and}} director, Laurice Guillen to helm the series. In an interview, {{when asked what}} got her to accepting an assignment she, in the past, had dodged (she appeared on several television series as an actor, but she wouldn't dip her fingers into it as a director), Guillen admitted that [...] "the offer was good, plus more." [...] The network one, accommodated certain requests pertaining to shooting schedules given her aversion to taping long hours or till the [...] "wee" [...] hours of the morning. As to the actors she assembled for the series, <b>Guillen</b> <b>said</b> she was glad that most, if not all, of them are competent performers and [...] "they are the best cast possible in terms of talent and professionalism". She's also {{very happy with the}} story, with the writers and creative team, and the network support. Apart from that, Guillen also stated her more personal reasons for saying [...] "yes", said that [...] "I told myself, when will I do something like this? ... I'm not getting any younger, and when I am no longer physically capable of directing one, I don't want to regret that I didn't do it, at least once." ...|$|E

5000|$|Toronto {{kicked off}} their 2010 regular season in Arlington, Texas, against the Texas Rangers. (See below for opening day results). The Blue Jays lost 5-4. The Blue Jays rebounded, and won 7-4 the next day. Vernon Wells {{continued}} his good start by homering twice, while Toronto starter Brian Tallet pitched a quality game {{and earned a}} win. The next day, Toronto was dealt a scare, as All-Star second baseman Aaron Hill was a late scratch due to a hamstring injury. The injury {{was said to be}} minor. Mike McCoy started at second base in place of Aaron Hill for his first career MLB start. McCoy earned his first career hit in his first at-bat of the game. McCoy finished the game 2-for-5 with an RBI. Ricky Romero and C. J. Wilson held the game scoreless until the 7th when Ricky Romero threw a wild pitch to allow David Murphy to score and give the Rangers a 1-0 lead. Texas held on to that lead until the 9th inning when Frank Francisco came in to close the game. Vernon Wells hit a solo shot to jumpstart the Jays to a 3-run inning that would ultimately give the Jays a 3-1 win. Jason Frasor made his second straight save. The win marked the first time the Jays passed the [...]500 mark since July 7, 2009, when they were 43-42. The Jays then flew to Baltimore to play as visitor for the O's home opener. In front of 48,891 fans, the Jays quickly jumped out to a 3-0 lead, as Vernon Wells hit another RBI. Brandon Morrow had issues {{in the bottom of the}} first, as a lack of control helped the O's get back to tie the game at 3 on the strength of one hit. Toronto got back ahead before Miguel Tejada hit a 2-run shot in the 5th to tie the game again. Baltimore would then pull ahead in the 8th thanks to a César Izturis RBI with 2 outs. Mike Gonzalez entered the game to close it out, but like Thursday, Toronto rallied in the 9th for 2 runs to pull ahead for good. Kevin Gregg earned his first save with the Jays. Dana Eveland made his first start for the Jays in the 5th game, and earned a quality start. Eveland gave up 5 hits on 7.1 innings of work, and the offense scored 3 thanks to 2 RBIs from José Molina. Travis Snider was intentionally walked twice to bring up Molina. With the bases loaded, Molina was hit by a pitch to bring in a run. Molina also hit a RBI single after another Snider IBB. Jason Frasor earned his first save. The win gave the Jays sole possession of first place in the AL East for the first time since May 23, 2009. The Jays continued their hot start by winning their 5th straight. Baltimore took a 2-1 lead into the 8th. After Kevin Millwood retired the first two, John McDonald reached first thanks to a Miguel Tejada error. That error allowed José Bautista to hit a 2-run home run to give the Jays the lead. the Jays added insurance thanks to an Álex González solo shot (his second of the day), and Edwin Encarnación's first home run of 2010. Jason Frasor earned his fourth save. The Jays have started the season 5-1 for the past 2 seasons. The Jays then started their first homestand of 2010 on April 12 (see below for home opener results). Ricky Romero then pitched a gem in game 8, going 8 innings giving up 2 runs on 1 hit. The Jays took a 4-0 lead, and that was all they needed thanks to Romero. Romero struck out 12 and took a no-hitter into the 8th before A. J. Pierzynski was hit on a questionable call, and Alex Ríos ended the no-hit bid with a 2-run home run. Kevin Gregg earned to save to seal it. A day later the Jays were shut down, as they were only able to manage one run on two hits. The Sox put the Jays to sleep fast, thanks to 11 runs, 4 of which came from an Andruw Jones grand slam. Only 10,610 fans were there to witness that game, an all-time low for Jays games at Rogers Centre. Low opening-week attendance drew comments (unknown whether it was a joke or if they were serious) from Alex Ríos and Ozzie Guillén claimed that [...] "Baseball is dead in Toronto", and that hockey is the reason nobody cares about baseball in Toronto. Ozzie Guillén claimed that if hockey players were on the field, people would come. Ríos then blamed hockey for lack of interest in baseball, even though no professional hockey team from Toronto was playing during the opening series. Ríos went on to say only diehards support the Blue Jays. Ozzie Guillén did not understand why Ríos was booed by Jays fans. After watching a viral video uploaded two months before Ríos was released (when Ríos was leaving a charity event after a game in which he struck out 5 times in a 1-run loss, a kid asked for autographs, and Ríos declined it. Another fan told Ríos [...] "The way you played today, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph". Ríos constantly replied [...] "Who gives a fuck?" [...] as the fan called Ríos a bum.) Ozzie <b>Guillén</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I would beat the shit out of him and the guys." [...] The writer of that article (Joe Cowley), was also causing controversy for comments made about Canadian culture and the Jays organization. He claimed that [...] "Baseball is failing in Toronto", and that MLB should be concerned with moving a team out of Canada. In the middle of this he claimed that all that was on TV in his hotel room was hockey, Olympics, and MuchMusic videos. He suggested that Toronto should move to Caracas, Venezuela. In the end, the organization will not be moved out of Canada any time soon, as Paul Beeston said. But Toronto continued their homestand as they started a three-game set against the Angels. Toronto lost back-to-back games to LA to start the series. Their record dropped to 7-5.|$|E
