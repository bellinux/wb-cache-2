5|$|The {{decision}} to invite Bach {{was made by}} the council on 15 January 1723. The council seemed to have preferred Bach and Graupner because they were invited to show two cantatas each, while other candidates were requested to show only one. Two candidates <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> present their work in the same service. Graupner's performance took place on the last Sunday after Epiphany, 17 January 1723. Two days before the event, the town council already agreed to offer him the position.|$|E

In the mid-1960s Triumph International introduced broad scale electronic data processing. Due to the economic crisis, the company encountered significant difficulties {{for the first time}} at the beginning of the 1970s, meaning the company <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> introduce short-term work. The crisis also affected the company’s tights sales, which they had begun in 1969 and discontinued only three years later. At the same time, Triumph International began for the first time to produce products from lighter fabrics with fibers such as nylon or lycra.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of time, the type of {{aircraft}} stationed at Celle became larger and larger and crews were trained on almost all current military aircraft. The extent of the training activities necessitated the construction of external landing strips at Hustedt and Scheuen.

25|$|In December, the DPJ {{created a}} {{government}} {{task force to}} review government spending and pledged to make cuts equal to $32.8billion. However, the task force cut {{only a quarter of}} that amount. Hatoyama <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> renege on a campaign promise to cut road-related taxes – including a highly symbolic gasoline tax and highway tolls. Hatoyama faced criticism from fringes of his own party, some calling for a return to public works spending.|$|E
25|$|During a nine-month {{period in}} 1842–43, Lovelace {{translated}} the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended {{a set of}} notes. Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment was uninterested in it. Lovelace's notes <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine. Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday {{described himself as a}} supporter of her writing.|$|E
25|$|Attila Nyíri of Hungary {{proposed}} a solution after studying two {{pages of the}} codex. He simply turned the pages upside down, identified a Sumerian ligature, then he associated Latin letters {{to the rest of}} the symbols by resemblance. However, he sometimes transliterated the same symbol with different letters, and vice versa, the same letter was decoded from several symbols. Then he <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> rearrange the order of the letters to produce meaningful words. The text, if taken as meaningful, is of religious, perhaps liturgical character.|$|E

25|$|At 15, Cox {{became a}} regular at The Cavern Club, and remembered the long queues and violent {{competition}} {{for access to the}} Beatles. Although she got a kiss from Ringo, whom she called ‘Ritchie’ (for Richard), he did not immediately notice her among his numerous fans. All the Beatles were supposed to be officially unattached, for image purposes, and when Ringo started dating Cox, she was often threatened, and once scratched in the face by a vicious rival. She <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stop working as a hairdresser because of the threats. In September 1963, with her parents' permission, she travelled to Greece with Starr, McCartney, and Jane Asher.|$|E
25|$|In 1855, Prince Frederick {{made another}} trip to Great Britain and visited Victoria {{and her family}} in Scotland at Balmoral Castle. The purpose of his trip was to see the Princess Royal again, to ensure {{that she would be}} a {{suitable}} consort for him. In Berlin, the response to this journey to Britain was far from positive. In fact, many members of the Prussian court wanted to see the heir presumptive's son marry a Russian grand duchess. King Frederick William IV, who had allowed his nephew to marry a British princess, <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep his approval a secret because his own wife showed strong Anglophobia.|$|E
25|$|The TTC has {{recovered}} about 70% of its operating costs from the fare box in recent years. From its creation in 1921 until 1971, the TTC was self-supporting both for capital and operations (it <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay property taxes until 1967). Through the Great Depression and World War II, it accumulated reserves that {{allowed it to}} expand considerably after the war, both with subways and major steady growth of its bus services into the suburbs. It was not until 1971 that the Metro government and the province started to provide operational subsidies, required primarily due to rising costs of delivering transit to low-density suburbs in Metro Toronto and large wage increases. Deficits and subsidies soared throughout the 1970s and 1980s, followed by service cuts and a period of ridership decline in the 1990s, partly attributable to recession.|$|E

25|$|The WHR venture was not {{a success}} and was beset with {{problems}} from the start. Indeed, 1923 was its most successful year. Much hoped-for revenue from quarry traffic never materialised as the slate industry had fallen into decline. Its passenger services were also unsuccessful and could not compete with the local bus services, which often took half the time to complete the same journey. Its rolling stock was out of date, it lacked locomotives and carriages and its marketing was inadequate. In 1924, winter passenger services were discontinued due to poor traffic. A dispute with the Great Western Railway over {{the costs of the}} crossing over its line at Porthmadog also caused problems, despite the crossing having been used since 1867 without any charges or problems. The railway <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> resort to escorting passengers across the crossing on foot.|$|E
25|$|Considering {{the many}} signs and symptoms, the {{generally}} delayed diagnosis, {{and the possibility}} of residual complaints after treatment, it is little wonder that a significant number of people with Graves' disease have difficulty keeping their job. One study found that of 303 patients successfully treated for hyperthyroidism (77% had Graves' disease) 53% dealt with lack of energy. About one-third were unable to resume their customary work, mainly due to persistent mental problems. In their 1986 study of 26 patients (10 years after successful treatment of hyperthyroidism), Perrild et al. note that four patients had been granted disability pensions on the basis of intellectual dysfunction. Between 2006 and 2008, Ponto et al. surveyed 250 Graves' disease patients. Of these, 36% were written off sick and 5% <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take early retirement. In the same study, 34% of 400 questioned physicians reported treating patients with fully impaired earning capacity.|$|E
500|$|However, {{she soon}} {{came to realize}} that writing a book about Madonna would not be as easy as she had thought. There was already {{abundant}} material available about her life and career and Simone could not find anything else left to be said in her book. The author hoped of [...] "finding some tiny stone left unturned in the giant gravel pit of Madonna studies". She <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> return her book advance given by her publisher for failing to write the biography. Unable to produce a biography, Simone instead decided to pursue a different direction with the material. The author, who had already released the novel called Note to Self (2009) and is also a musician, wanted to focus on her own singing career, self-declared as a [...] "failure". She confessed having a personal affinity for [...] "underdog" [...] musicians, an understanding which was totally opposite to what Madonna stood for with her success.|$|E

500|$|By the 1570s, Sir Henry Sidney and {{his wife}} had become {{somewhat}} disillusioned and embittered about lacking financial rewards on the Queen's part for their long service. In 1572 Mary Dudley <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> decline a barony for her husband in a letter to William Cecil, himself Baron Burghley since the previous year: The expenses such a title implied were simply too great, Sir Henry's mind being [...] "dismayed [...] hard choice" [...] between choosing financial ruin and royal displeasure [...] "in refusing it". Two years later, in 1574, she quarrelled with the Lord Chamberlain (her brother-in-law, the Earl of Sussex) over accommodation at court. She refused to exchange her accustomed rooms with a cold chamber that had previously been [...] "but the place for my servants". All in all though, she explained, [...] "old Lord Harry and his old Moll" [...] would accept [...] "like good friends the small portion allotted our long service in court; which as little as it is, seems something too much." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Montagu did not {{profit from}} the new regime as he {{probably}} expected to. He did not regain the Earldom of Northumberland. Further, he lost some of the Courtney lands that had come with his Marquessate to the newly returned Earl of Devon. Montagu had no active role in government, and {{does not seem to}} have sat in Council, although he was appointed Chamberlain to the King's Household. Although he was confirmed in command of the new King's forces in the north and in possession of the manor of Wressle on 21 March 1471, he did not regain any other Percy estates. Indeed, it has been suggested that his loyalty might still have been suspect by the newly arrived Lancastrians: having been summoned to the November 1470 parliament, Polydor Virgil states that he had to apologise there for his prior support of Edward. [...] Montagu <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay cash for the king's pardon, which he only received after making a lengthy speech, declaring that he had only remained faithful to Edward out of fear.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Knox decision, local governments could legally impose {{assessments}} on real property {{for a wide range of}} purposes without voter approval.

2500|$|The {{large and}} far-flung Portuguese Empire was {{difficult}} and expensive to administer and was burdened with huge external debt and trade deficits.

John III responded with new appointments that proved troubled and short-lived: in some cases, the new governors <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight their predecessors {{to take up}} their appointments. [...] The resulting failures in administration brought on a gradual decline of the Portuguese trade monopoly. In consideration of the challenging military situation faced by Portuguese forces worldwide, John III declared every male subject between 20 and 65 years old recruitable for military service on 7 August 1549.|$|E
