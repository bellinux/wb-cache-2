50|$|Formation of a {{mixed layer}} <b>in</b> a <b>lake</b> {{is similar to that}} in the ocean, but mixing is more likely to occur <b>in</b> <b>lakes</b> solely due to the {{molecular}} properties of water. Water changes density as it changes temperature. <b>In</b> <b>lakes,</b> temperature structure is {{complicated by the fact that}} fresh water is heaviest at 3.98 °C (degrees Celsius). Thus <b>in</b> <b>lakes</b> where the surface gets very cold, the mixed layer briefly extends all the way to the bottom in the spring, as surface warms as well as in the fall, as the surface cools. This overturning is often important for maintaining the oxygenation of very deep lakes.|$|R
