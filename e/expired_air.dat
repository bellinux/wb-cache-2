There is a great need for a simple portable instrument that can be used away from the clinical laboratory for studies on the nasal cycle. Our aim was to investigate the usefulness of a small portable spirometer in studying the nasal cycle. The Mir Spirobank spirometer was fitted with a nasal adapter to measure the volume of <b>air</b> <b>expired</b> from each nasal passage during a slow vital capacity (VC). The spirometer was used to measure the fractions of the slow VC volume of <b>air</b> <b>expired</b> through the right and left nasal passage in turn.

The spirometry measurements of the volume of <b>air</b> <b>expired</b> from each nasal passage were compared with nasal conductance of each nasal passage (airflow at 75 Pa) obtained by posterior rhinomanometry. The spirometer was found easy to use by both the investigator and the patients. Simple regression analysis of the spirometer and rhinomanometer measures of airflow partitioning found a correlation coefficient of r = 0. 827 (p < 0. 0001; n = 36).

40|$|In {{order to}} improve voice quality in female laryngectomees and/or laryngectomees with a {{hypotonic}} pharyngo-oesophageal segment, a sound-producing voice prosthesis was designed. The new source of voice consists of either one or two bent silicone lips which perform an oscillatory movement driven by the <b>expired</b> pulmonary <b>air</b> that flows along the outward-striking lips through the tracheo-oesophageal shunt valve. Four different prototypes of this pneumatic sound source were evaluated in vitro and in two female laryngectomees, testing the feasibility and characteristics of this new mechanism for alternative alaryngeal voice production. In vivo evaluation included acoustic analyses of both sustained vowels and read-aloud prose, videofluoroscopy, speech rate, and registration of tracheal phonatory pressure and vocal intensity. The mechanism proved feasible and {{did not result in}} unacceptable airflow resistance. The average pitch of voice increased and clarity improved in female laryngectomees. Pitch regulation of this prosthetic voice is possible with sufficient modulation to avoid monotony. The quality of voice attained through the sound-producing voice prostheses depends on a patient's ability to let pulmonary air flow easily through the pharyngo-oesophageal segment without evoking the low-frequency mucosal vibrations that form the regular tracheo-oesophageal shunt voice. These initial experimental and clinical results provide directions for the future development of sound-producing voice prostheses.

Study Design: Experimental, randomized, crossover trial. Methods: The new sound source consists of a single silicone lip, which performs an oscillatory movement driven by <b>expired</b> pulmonary <b>air</b> flowing along the outward-striking lip through the TE shunt valve. A prototype of this pneumatic sound source is evaluated in vitro and in six laryngectomees, In vivo evaluation includes speech rate, maximal phonation time, perceptual voice evaluation of read-aloud prose by an expert listener, speech intelligibility measurements with 12 listeners, and self-assessment by the patients. Moreover, extensive acoustical and aerodynamic in vivo registrations are performed using a newly developed data acquisition system. Results: The current prototype seems beneficial in female laryngectomees with a hypotonic PE segment only, For them the sound-producing voice prosthesis improves voice quality and increases the average pitch of voice, without decreasing intelligibility or necessitating other pressure and airflow rates than regular TE shunt speech. Pitch regulation of this prosthetic voice is possible, yet limited. Conclusions: The mechanism is feasible and does not result in unacceptable airflow resistance. For this new mechanism of alaryngeal voice to become an established technique for postlaryngectomy voice restoration, a voice suitably pitched for male laryngectomees has to be generated and {{a large part of the}} melodic and dynamic range of the sound source has to be attainable within physiological airflow rates...|$|R

Each of the four determinants: ambient temperature, ambient humidity, tidal volume and respiratory frequency was examined at both sea level and altitude. The data collected from 14 men, at 7 ambient temperatures (- 35 ° to + 35 ° C), and 5 minute ventilation rates (which formed a continuum from 4 to 80 L STPD/min.), were corrected and statistically analyzed by computer. The results, presented in graphic, tabular and algebraic form, permit calculation of expired water or net water loss through the respiratory tract in man with corrections for minute volume, ambient temperature, gas density and ambient humidity. An attempt is made to explain the results presented using the notations of thermodynamics. It is assumed that the human respiratory tract is an efficient but limited counter-current heat and mass (water) exchange system. As such, the caloric requirements for equilibrating the respired air to 37 °C and approximately 100 % relative humidity are contingent upon the five determinants listed. The impact {{of a change in}} gas density is completely described in theory, listing changes in molar volume, heat capacity and gas flow characteristics, and how these changes might affect the heat and mass transfer between the respiratory mucosa and the respired air.

40|$|Methane {{production}} by ruminants {{is a significant}} contributor to agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (Webb et al., 2013). However, current values used to estimate methane output by sheep are default values and do {{not take into account}} animal and dietary factors that may affect methane output (Bernstein et al., 2007). Strategies to reduce ruminant methane output are the focus of a large body of research (Iqbal et al., 2008) and, in order to implement these strategies fully, a greater understanding of factors that influence ruminant methane emissions is necessary. The "gold standard" method for measuring methane output by sheep is the use of respiratory chambers (Blaxter and Clapperton, 1965). However, this method is expensive, time-consuming and labour intensive, making it unsuitable for use in an on-farm situation. The work presented in this thesis explores the potential of three proxies to estimate methane output by sheep, which could be used or adapted {{to be used as a}} practical means of estimating methane emissions from sheep on a large scale.
