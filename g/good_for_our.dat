5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, D’Esposito {{said he had}} {{considered}} making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including Loki, a young Nick Fury, Black Panther, Ms. Marvel, and Black Widow. Regarding Loki, D’Esposito said [...] "Being on Asgard {{is very difficult for}} us to do in a short. It’s just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it’s over. One shot of Loki on Asgard." [...] On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked [...] "It’s very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going … We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don’t want to do something that’s half baked because it’s not good for us and it’s not <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> fans." [...] In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on Sin and Crossbones, Jessica Jones, and Damage Control.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson's {{nomination}} {{sparked a}} controversy that erupted during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, {{based on his}} large stockholdings in General Motors. Reluctant to sell the stock, valued at the time at more than $2.5 million, Wilson agreed to do so under committee pressure. During the hearings, {{when asked if he}} could make a decision as Secretary of Defense that would be adverse to the interests of General Motors, Wilson answered affirmatively. But he added that he could not conceive of such a situation [...] "because for years I thought what was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> country was good for General Motors, and vice versa". This statement has frequently been misquoted as [...] "What's good for General Motors is good for the country". Although Wilson tried for years to correct the misquote, he was reported {{at the time of his}} retirement in 1957 to have accepted the popular impression.|$|E

2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire." [...] In response to these criticisms Gore stated that it is “certainly not true” {{that he is a}} “carbon billionaire” and that he is [...] "proud to put my money where my mouth is for the past 30 years. And though that is not the majority of my business activities, I absolutely believe in investing in accordance with my beliefs and my values." [...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think there is something wrong with being active in business in this country [...] I am proud of it. I am proud of it." ...|$|E

60|$|Why is it {{that neither}} angels, nor saints, nor evil spirits, appear to men now to speak to them as they did of old? Why, but because we have BOOKS, by which Christ's {{messengers}}, and the devil's messengers too, can tell what they will to thousands of human beings at the same moment, year after year, all the world over! I say, we ought to reverence books, {{to look at them}} as awful and mighty things. If they are good and true, whether they are about religion or politics, farming, trade, or medicine, they are the message of Christ, the Maker of all things, the Teacher of all truth, which He has put into the heart of some man to speak, that he may tell us what is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> spirits, for our bodies, and for our country.|$|E

60|$|It {{was a cold}} morning, but {{the rain}} of the {{preceding}} evening {{had given way to}} frost, and the air, though sharp, was dry. The ground under the feet was crisp, having felt the wind and frost, and was no longer clogged with mud. In his present state of mind the walk was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> poor pastor, and exhilarated him; but still, as he went, he thought always of his injuries. His own wife believed {{that he was about to}} commit suicide, and for so believing he was very angry with her; and yet, as he well knew, the idea of making away with himself had flitted through his own mind a dozen times. Not from his own wife could he get real sympathy. He would see what he could do with a certain brickmaker of his acquaintance.|$|E
6000|$|Nor is it {{only on the}} élite of {{the world}} that this {{tropical}} training has in its own way a widening influence. It is good, of course, for our Galtons to have seen South Africa; <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> Tylors to have studied Mexico; <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> Hookers to have numbered the rhododendrons and deodars of the Himalayas. I sometimes fancy, even, that in the works of our very greatest stay-at-home thinkers on anthropological or sociological subjects, I detect here and there a certain formalist and schematic note which betrays the want of first-hand acquaintance with the plastic and expansive nature of tropical society. The beliefs and relations of the actual savage have not quite that definiteness of form and expression which our University Professors would fain assign to them. But apart from the widening influence of the Tropics on these picked minds, there is a widening influence exerted insensibly on the very planters or merchants, the rank and file of European settlers, which can hardly fail to impress all those who have lived amongst them. The cramping effect of the winter cold and the artificial life is all removed. Men live in a freer, wider, warmer air; their doors and windows stand open day and night; the scent of flowers and the hum of insects blow in upon them with every breeze; their brother man and sister woman are more patent in every action to their eyes; the world shows itself more frankly; it has fewer secrets, and readier sympathies. I don't mean to say the result is all gain. Far from it. There are evils inherent in tropical life which, as a noble lord remarks of nature generally, [...] "no preacher can heal." [...] But viewed as education, like Saint-Simon's thieving, it is all valuable. I should think most men who have once passed through a tropical experience would no more wish that full chapter blotted out of their lives than they would consent to lose their university culture, their Continental travel, or their literary, scientific, or artistic education.|$|E
60|$|It must be {{admitted}} {{that there was}} some carelessness in permitting sporting ammunition ever to get to the front at all. When the Derbyshire Militia were taken by De Wet at Roodeval, a number of cases of sporting cartridges were captured by the Boers (the officers had used them for shooting springbok). My friend, Mr. Langman, who was present, saw the Boers, in some instances, filling their bandoliers from these cases on the plausible excuse that they were only using our own ammunition. Such cartridges should never have been permitted to go up. But in spite of instances of bungling, the evidence shows that every effort has been made to keep the war as humane as possible. I am inclined to hope that a fuller knowledge will show that the same holds <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> enemies, and that in spite of individual exceptions, they have never systematically used anything except what one of their number described as a 'gentlemanly' bullet.|$|E

Seldom does so much as a {{familiar}} name come up in my sittings, and no message of any intimate sort has ever come from the shadow world for me.

It was absolutely necessary to expose it. Strong pressure was brought upon me to look into the matter. It has cost me two years, Watson, but they have not been devoid of excitement. When I say that I started my pilgrimage at Chicago, graduated in an Irish secret society at Buffalo, gave serious trouble to the constabulary at Skibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended me as a likely man, you will realize that the matter was complex. Since then I have been honoured by his confidence, which has not prevented most of his plans going subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison. I watched them, Watson, and I picked them as they ripened. Well, sir, I hope that you are none the worse!" ...|$|E
