2500|$|Magnetos {{were used}} on the small engine's ancestor, the {{stationary}} [...] "hit and miss" [...] engine which {{was used in the}} early twentieth century, on older gasoline or distillate farm tractors before battery starting and lighting became common, and on aircraft piston <b>engines.</b> <b>Magnetos</b> were used in these engines because their simplicity and self-contained operation was more reliable, and because magnetos weighed less than having a battery and dynamo or alternator.|$|R
50|$|The 1899 Turcat-Méry had a 2.6-litre four-cylinder <b>engine</b> with <b>magneto</b> ignition. It {{also had}} a {{radiator}} {{at each end of}} the engine, chain drive and a five-speed gearbox with two speeds in reverse.|$|R
50|$|Two Legros & Knowles {{vehicles}} were {{shown at the}} 1904 Olympia Show, but they were cumbersome, outdated designs with chain drive, slow revving <b>engines</b> and <b>magneto</b> ignition. They were subsequently {{referred to as the}} 'Old Buggerinas'.|$|R
50|$|The engines were {{prone to}} failure, {{regardless}} of the type used. This was mainly due to the extended duration of the patrols, which could reach 20 hours in length. The engines were run at virtually full speed all this time, leading to many units simply wearing out, and RNAS station maintenance crews became skilled at rapidly overhauling the engines. Other problems stemmed from the <b>engine's</b> <b>magnetos.</b> Before the war, the majority of magnetos used worldwide {{had been made in}} Germany, usually by Bosch and AEG; but the British-made Lucas replacements were of poorer quality and it was common for crews to carry several spares on patrol and many became adept at changing them in mid-flight.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} Throttle, engine {{management}} controls were usually only a Choke lever and Ignition Advance/Retard for starting the hand cranked <b>engine.</b> On <b>magneto</b> ignition models {{there would be}} a simple switch to short the magneto and so stop the engine running.|$|R
50|$|Magnetos {{adapted to}} produce impulses of high voltage for spark plugs {{are used in}} the {{ignition}} systems of spark-ignition piston <b>engines.</b> <b>Magnetos</b> are used in piston aircraft engines for their reliability and simplicity, often in pairs. Motor sport vehicles such as motorcycles and snowmobiles may use magnetos because they are lighter in weight than an ignition system relying on a battery. Small internal combustion engines used for lawn mowers, chain saws, portable pumps and similar applications use magnetos for economy and weight reduction. Magnetos are not used in highway motor vehicles which have a cranking battery and which may require more control over ignition timing than is possible with a magneto system although sophisticated solid state controllers are becoming more prevalent.|$|R
50|$|The second <b>engine</b> had twin <b>magnetos</b> mounted {{behind the}} two {{overhead}} camshafts and developed 120 bhp {{and is now}} installed back in the Halford Special.|$|R
5000|$|No. 74: KOBAS Stationary Suction Gas Engine and Charcoal Gas Producer Unit. Wood gas <b>engine</b> with <b>magneto</b> {{ignition}} system had been started {{to develop in}} 1928 and produced in 1936. Less resource of petroleum during and after World War II in Japan, wood gas engine had been widely used by about 1955. - Hiroshima Prefecture ...|$|R
5000|$|After the accident, the NTSB removed, inspected, {{and tested}} the right <b>engine's</b> {{ignition}} <b>magneto</b> {{and found it}} to be operating normally, concluding, [...] "No mechanical or electrical discrepancies were found during the examination of the right magneto." [...] The inspection also determined that [...] "All of the fuel cross-feed and fuel dump valves were in the closed position." ...|$|R
5000|$|Early aviators using rotary {{engine-powered}} aircraft {{from the}} beginnings of their use in 1908, up {{through the end of}} World War I in 1918 had what could be called a reversed functionality version of the [...] "dead man's switch" [...] for cutting the ignition voltage to the spark plugs on such a power-plant, to give a degree of in-flight speed control for a rotary engine. This was often called a [...] "blip switch" [...] or [...] "coupe switch" [...] (from the French term coupez, or [...] "cut") and when not being pressed, allowed the high voltage from the <b>engine's</b> <b>magnetos</b> to operate the ignition with normal engine operation in flight — pressing the [...] "blip switch" [...] cut the flow of high voltage from the magnetos, stopping the combustion process in the cylinders. When such a [...] "blip switch" [...] was intermittently used on landing approach, this allowed a limited degree of engine speed control, as rotary engines generally did not have a conventional throttle in their carburettors to regulate engine speed, but only for governing the fuel-air ratio for start-up and full-speed operation.|$|R
25|$|Single-cylinder engines were reintroduced in 1925 as 1926 models. These singles were {{available}} either as flathead engines or as overhead valve engines until 1930, {{after which they}} were only available as flatheads. The flathead single-cylinder motorcycles were designated Model A for <b>engines</b> with <b>magneto</b> systems only and Model B for engines with battery and coil systems, while overhead valve versions were designated Model AA and Model BA respectively, and a magneto-only racing version was designated Model S. This line of single-cylinder motorcycles ended production in 1934.|$|R
5000|$|The {{redesigned}} [...] "Shaw Speedster" [...] {{looks very}} like the later King Midget series one, {{which was also}} advertised as a [...] "real car." [...] The redesigned Shaw car was produced until 1930. In 1915 Shaw also redesigned the engine kit featuring an improved H-20 <b>engine</b> with a <b>magneto</b> ignition, and chain drive.|$|R
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} {{engine was}} a six-cylinder motor with a displacement of 6494 cm³ (bore × stroke = 105 × 125 mm), which produced 40 PS (29 kW) at 1100 rpm. The <b>engine</b> had <b>magneto</b> ignition, automatic central lubrication and overhead valves. The power was {{transmitted to the}} rear wheels via a leather cone clutch, a three-speed gearbox with a right-hand shift mechanism and a chain. The wheelbase of the car was 3280 mm, the track was 1457 mm {{and the weight of}} the chassis was 1100 kg. The top speed was about 100 km / h.|$|R
50|$|Built by the Merryweather Fire Engine {{company in}} Greenwich, in 1888, the Butler Petrol Cycle (first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term) was a three-wheeled petrol vehicle. The rear wheel was directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four-stroke <b>engine</b> (with <b>magneto</b> ignition replaced by coil and battery), equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach), and Ackermann steering, {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. The driver was seated between the front wheels.|$|R
50|$|Mors {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{automobiles}} to use the V engine configuration. The Mors 60 horsepower Grand Prix car was powered by a 10 litre V4 side valve <b>engine,</b> with <b>magneto</b> ignition and dry sump lubrication, which could reach 950 rpm. The car had a steel chassis and a four-speed transmission that drove the rear wheels via chain drive, and rear-wheel brakes. In 1902, Mors added pneumatic shock absorbers to their cars, which represented a great leap forward given the quality of the roads and racetracks at the time. With this car, Henri Fournier was able to win the highly significant Paris-Berlin race, with the drive chain breaking immediately afterwards.|$|R
50|$|Larger {{railroad}} {{motor cars}} were the models 27A (10 men capacity), 27AW-F (10 men capacity), and 38B-F (14 men capacity). Adding side steps could {{double the number}} of men carried. The 27A had an air-cooled four-cylinder Wisconsin <b>engine</b> with <b>magneto</b> ignition and a Zenith carburetor that developed 22 horesepower. The 27AW-F and 38B-F had a water-cooled four-cylinder Ford engine that developed 40 hp. Other products in 1960 that ran on the rails included a power tamping jack, a ballast equalizer with plow and sweeper, a spike driver and a line of trailers and push carts. Track gauges and levels, plus portable setoff assembly and take off rails rounded out the catalog.|$|R
5000|$|The Cyclone was {{the same}} basic machine as the Royal Star except fitted for high performance. The A50CC Cyclone Competition built for the US market model year 1964 had dual 1 1/16" [...] carburettors, higher 10.5:1 <b>engine</b> {{compression}}, <b>magneto</b> ignition, larger front brake, 2 gallon fuel tank and upswept open exhaust. Built for scrambles, this model had no road lights. The A50C Cyclone Road built for the US market model years 1964 and 1965 had 1 1/16" [...] dual carburettors, higher 9:1 compression engine and larger front brake. This model had battery ignition, full road lighting and the same 2 gallon fuel tank. Both models were available for the UK market with 9:1 engine compression, battery ingition and 4 gallon fuel tanks.1 ...|$|R
5000|$|Because the magneto has {{low voltage}} output at low speed, {{starting}} an engine is more difficult. Therefore, some magnetos have an impulse coupling, a springlike mechanical linkage between the <b>engine</b> and <b>magneto</b> drive shaft which [...] "winds up" [...] and [...] "lets go" [...] {{at the proper}} moment for spinning the magneto shaft. The impulse coupling uses a spring, a hub cam with flyweights, and a shell. The hub of the magneto rotates while the drive shaft is held stationary, and the spring tension builds up. When the magneto is supposed to fire, the flyweights are released {{by the action of}} the body contacting the trigger ramp. This allows the spring to unwind giving the rotating magnet a rapid rotation and letting the magneto spin at such a speed to produce a spark.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{gasoline}} (petrol) {{internal combustion}} <b>engines</b> used a <b>magneto</b> ignition system, since no battery was fitted to the vehicle; magnetos are still used in piston-engine aircraft. The voltage {{produced by a}} magneto {{is dependent on the}} speed of the engine, making starting difficult. A battery-operated coil can provide a high-voltage spark even at low speeds, making starting easier. [...] When batteries became common in automobiles for cranking and lighting, the ignition coil system displaced magneto ignition.|$|R
5000|$|The spark {{ignition}} engine was a refinement of the early engines which used Hot Tube ignition. When Bosch developed the magneto it became the primary system for producing electricity to energize a spark plug. [...] Many small <b>engines</b> still use <b>magneto</b> ignition. Small <b>engines</b> are started by hand cranking using a recoil starter or hand crank [...] Prior to Charles F. Kettering of Delco's development of the automotive starter all gasoline engined automobiles used a hand crank.|$|R
5000|$|Dual {{ignition}} in aero-engines {{can allow}} the aircraft to continue flying and land safely after an ignition system failure. Operation of aero <b>engines</b> on one <b>magneto</b> (rather than both) typically {{results in an}} rpm drop of around 75 rpm. [...] Its existence on aviation powerplants {{dates back to the}} World War I years, when such engines as the Hispano-Suiza 8 and Mercedes D.III, and even rotary engines as the later Gnome Monosoupape model 9N [...] versions featured twin spark plugs per cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|Such {{systems are}} used for many {{internal}} combustion engines in other applications. In aeronautical applications, the systems are known as [...] "FADECs" [...] (Full Authority Digital Engine Controls). This kind of electronic control is less common in piston-engined light fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters than in automobiles. This {{is due to the}} common configuration of a carbureted <b>engine</b> with a <b>magneto</b> ignition system that does not require electrical power generated by an alternator to run, which is considered a safety advantage.|$|R
25|$|The Butler Petrol Cycle was a {{three-wheeled}} vehicle, {{with the}} rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four stroke <b>engine</b> (with <b>magneto</b> ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time.

No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.|$|R
2500|$|The 1910 Limited Touring was a {{high point}} for the company. Riding atop 42-inch wheels, and {{equipped}} with factory [...] "white" [...] tires, the Limited was the prestige model in Oldsmobile's two model lineup.

5000|$|Fully {{controlled}} valve movement was conceived during {{the earliest days}} of engine development, but devising a system that worked reliably and was not overly complex took a long time. Desmodromic valve systems are first mentioned in patents in 1896 by Gustav Mees. Austin's marine engine of 1910 produced 300 bhp and was installed in a speedboat called [...] "Irene I"; its all-aluminium, twin-overhead-valve <b>engine</b> had twin <b>magnetos,</b> twin carburetors and desmodromic valves.

Only 14 Cossack IIIs were built due to the cancellation of the post-war British airships.|$|R
5000|$|Claiming to be [...] "winner of the Glidden Tour", the 1914 Model 22 was a two-seat {{roadster}} or torpedo.

50|$|Later Otto engines {{employed}} a small magneto {{directly on the}} engine. Rather than tripping a switch, the spark plug firing arm applies a quick rotation to the magneto rotor, which then snaps back under spring tension. This quick rotation of the magneto coil produces a very brief current flow that fires the spark plug and ignites the fuel. This design {{has the advantage of}} requiring no external battery, and is how modern portable gas engines operate, incorporating the magnet portion of the magneto into the flywheel. Modern portable <b>engines</b> excite the <b>magneto</b> with every flywheel rotation, and so use a cam-operated electric switch to prevent plug firing except for the power stroke of the engine (see wasted spark).|$|R
5000|$|A magneto {{is one of}} the {{electromechanical}} devices invented for {{the purpose}} of ignition with gasoline internal combustion <b>engines.</b> A <b>magneto</b> at its most basic is a simple magnet that moves next to a wire, or sometimes a wire moves next to a magnet. As they move in relation to each other, the changes in direction of magnetic force induce an electric current in the wire. Usually the wire (called a primary wire) is very long, and looped around an iron magnetic core that more or less channels the magnetic field through the loop of wire. As the current flows, the wire loops develop their own magnetic field, which takes a certain amount of energy to form. The magnetic field is a type of potential energy. There is usually some sort of device that opens and closes the circuit called a contact breaker, points or an [...] As the points or ignitor open, the current ceases flowing, and the magnetic field collapses. The energy stored in the magnetic field is released in the form of increased electric voltage in the wire. This voltage jumps across the gap of either the ignitor or a spark plug located in the combustion chamber and ignites the air-fuel mixture to do work.|$|R
2500|$|On 26 April 1922, a {{group of}} anti-Treaty IRA men, led by Michael O'Neill, arrived {{at the house of}} Thomas Hornibrook, a former magistrate, at Ballygroman, East Muskerry, Desertmore, Bandon (near Ballincollig on the {{outskirts}} of Cork City), seeking to seize his car. Hornibrook was in the house at the time along with his son, Samuel, and his nephew, Herbert Woods (a former Captain in the British Army and MC). O'Neill demanded a part of the <b>engine</b> mechanism (the <b>magneto)</b> that had been removed by Thomas Hornibrook to prevent such theft. Hornibrook refused to give them the part, and after further efforts, some of the IRA party entered through a window. Herbert Woods then shot O'Neill, wounding him fatally. O'Neill's companion, Charlie O'Donoghue, took him to a local priest who pronounced him dead. The next morning O'Donoghue left for Bandon to report the incident to his superiors, returning with [...] "four military men", meeting with the Hornibrooks and Woods, who admitted to shooting O'Neill.|$|R
50|$|The {{new engine}} has a Lanchester {{vibration}} damper {{on the front}} end of its crankshaft. Its camshaft and valves are overhead, the valves being set at an angle of 45 degrees {{on either side of the}} spark plug. At the back of the engine there is a vertical shaft to drive the camshaft. The camshaft works the inlet valves through rockers and by horizontal pushrods works the exhaust valves on the opposite side. The whole mechanism is enclosed and the covers are easy to remove. The double springs on the valve stems have variable tension. Though removing the cylinder head is not as simple as on a conventional design its removal does not affect the timing of the <b>engine</b> or its <b>magneto.</b> The crankshaft has three bearings, the camshaft four. The air supply to the carburettor is routed through a tunnel in the crankcase and in this way the air is slightly warmed while cooling the crankshaft's central bearing. The pistons are manganese with tubular connecting rods and the gudgeon pins receive positive oiling.|$|R
5000|$|The Seagull {{outboard}} motor had a simple single cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine. Atop the <b>engine</b> was a <b>magneto,</b> {{and on its}} port side was a simple carburetter with no air filter. Even a rudimentary rubber [...] "storm cowl" [...] was an optional extra, and induction noise when running was pronounced. Above the cylinder head was bolted a small brass fuel tank whose 10:1 fuel/oil mix was gravity-fed to the carb via a clear plastic tube that served to capture dirt particles in its U-bend. A simple plastic filter filter on the banjo union to the carb gave rudimentary secondary filtering, {{but it was still}} not unusual for the carb jets to become blocked. Starting was effected with a hand-wound pull-rope, although a recoil starter became an option in due course. Connecting the motor to the gearbox and propeller werere two downtubes, the forward one containing the drive shaft and the aft tube serving as the exhaust, which vented underwater. This arrangement meant that the engine could not be rotated 360 degrees as can more modern engines. The Seagull handbook advises that the engine can be safely run at full throttle (partly to prevent the spark-plug from oiling up) but adds that is wasteful to try to exceed the maximum design speed of a displacement hull, suggesting a [...] "one-third open throttle" [...] usually suffices. The engines proved very rugged as they used high quality materials, and would last for years even in harsh marine environments and in developing countries. Seagull outboards were utilitarian in nature with a relatively slow-turning prop, and so were ideal for use in dinghies, tenders and small yachts. The Silver Century Plus model could propel a displacement hull of up to 26 feet in length; but all Seagull outboards were unsuitable for high speed craft.|$|R
