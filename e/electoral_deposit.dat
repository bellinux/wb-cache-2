50|$|Even {{more than}} before 1947, the {{appearance}} of National Liberal candidates aggrieved the Liberal Party. They saw this as a blatant misappropriation by the Conservative Party of not only much of their funds but also their historic party name, while the Liberals themselves were in a parlous political position. In 1951 it was only thanks to fraught local arrangements that {{five of the six}} remaining Liberal MPs were elected {{in the absence of a}} Conservative candidate. Two of these elections were achieved by formal local pacts, whereby only one Liberal or Conservative candidate would stand in each constituency in Bolton and Huddersfield). Increasingly, with <b>electoral</b> <b>deposits</b> expensive and <b>electoral</b> support low, the Liberal Party fielded few candidates, especially in 1951 and 1955 when the party barely mustered over 100 to stand for Parliament.|$|R

The 1935 election ultimately resulted in a massive victory for the Labour Party, bringing it to power for the first time, and a grave failure for the CPNZ in its electoral efforts, with all four of the party's candidates faring so poorly at the polls that they failed to recover their <b>electoral</b> <b>deposits.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of {{large number of}} candidates in Indian elections had often evoked extremely strong policy recommendations from different expert groups. The major policy tool to control candidate entry in India had, however, been <b>electoral</b> <b>deposit.</b> Using panel data on elections in different states and UTs, our study estimates the impact of <b>electoral</b> <b>deposit</b> on candidate entry. Results suggest that increase in deposit had a substantial short-term negative impact on candidate entry. The candidate structure in India, however, is fairly persistent due to feedbacks in political opportunity. For effective deterrence on continuous basis, regulators, therefore, need to change deposit frequently and keep it {{at a high level}} compared to the current international benchmark. We observe that the high deposit may not be an effective barrier against unethical practices like cloning, but could discriminate political participation of genuinely underprivileged groups. In contrast, the current level of signature requirement, a relatively unused policy tool for controlling candidate entry, is found to be low in India and could be easily increased further in order to be effective. We argue that given the high variation and lack of stability in candidate structure across regions and over time, a local approach on signature requirement [...] as in the US [...] could be an effective deterrent in India. Accordingly, we suggest that the Election Commission of India (ECI) should not only have the power to determine the deposit before each election, it should also have the power to change the minimum signature requirement across constituencies under certain pre-specified conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{candidates}} have become a regular feature of Indian elections. Given the regulatory concerns the problem has evoked, the paper reviews the process of candidate entry in select developed countries. The review reveals the presence of diverse approaches, ruling out the necessity for extreme options like debarring fringe candidates – a course suggested by several Indian expert groups. Among various policy options, India had largely relied on <b>electoral</b> <b>deposit.</b> Our results suggest that an increase in deposit had a significant negative impact on candidate entry in India. However, for an effective deterrence, India needs to continue to keep deposits {{at a very high}} level compared to the current international benchmark, discriminating political participation of genuinely underprivileged groups.
