25|$|This design {{gave the}} Amiga OS a great {{extensibility}} and flexibility within the limited memory capacity of {{computers in the}} 1980s. Sassenrath later noted that the design came as a necessity of trying to integrate into ROM dozens of internal libraries and devices including graphics, sound, graphical user interface, <b>floppy</b> <b>disc,</b> file systems, and others. This dynamic modular method also allowed hundreds of additional modules to be added by external developers over the years.|$|E
25|$|Bell worked {{extensively}} in medical research and invented techniques for teaching {{speech to the}} deaf. During his Volta Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record {{as a means of}} reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder, the hard disc and <b>floppy</b> <b>disc</b> drive, and other magnetic media.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} quite {{common in the}} 1980s to use {{physical}} floppy disks and the postal service for spreading software, in an activity known as mail trading. Prior to the sale of software that came on CD-ROM discs and after hard drives had become available, the software did not require the <b>floppy</b> <b>disc</b> {{to be in the}} drive when starting and using the program. So, a user could install it onto his/her computer and mail the disk to the next person, who could do the same. Particularly widespread in continental Europe, mail trading was even used by many of the leading cracker groups as their primary channel of interaction. Software copyright violation via mail trading was also the most common means for many computer hobbyists in the Eastern bloc countries to receive new Western software for their computers.|$|E

500|$|On August 5, Yankovic {{recorded}} [...] "Here's Johnny", {{a parody}} of [...] "Who's Johnny" [...] by El DeBarge. The song, a loving ode to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson announcer Ed McMahon, features John Roarke of the television series Fridays fame doing an impression of McMahon's voice. According to Yankovic, Peter Wolf, {{the man who wrote}} [...] "Who's Johnny", enjoyed the parody idea so much that he personally brought the <b>floppy</b> <b>disc</b> program that had all the synthesizer parts for the original song into the studio when Yankovic was recording his parody. The final parody recorded for the album was [...] "Toothless People", a play on Mick Jagger's [...] "Ruthless People", which was recorded on August 29, 1986. The song, about elderly people who are missing their teeth, was written after Yankovic heard it would be the theme to the 1986 film Ruthless People. Assuming the song would be a hit, Yankovic requested and received permission from Jagger to record a parody version. [...] When Jagger's song failed to crack the Top 40, Yankovic considered not recording his version, but because Jagger had [...] "authorized" [...] the parody, he decided failing to produce it would be an insult to the artist. Therefore, he recorded the spoof anyway.|$|E

It also contains a [...] library and utility, tested with MuseScore, allowing easy debugging of especially mass-parallel MML files, score sheet printing (ideally after some minimal postprocessing, but the defaults are usually legible), etc. – Floppi-Music and MMLlib is Free Software written in pure Python.|$|E

2500|$|Not all ROMs offered star {{commands}} (ROMs containing data files, for instance), but any ROM could [...] "hook" [...] into certain vectors {{to enhance}} the system's functionality. Often the ROM was a device driver for mass storage combined with a filing system, starting with Acorn's 1982 Disc Filing System whose API became the de facto standard for <b>floppy</b> <b>disc</b> access. The Acorn Graphics Extension ROM (GXR) expanded the VDU routines to draw geometric shapes, flood fills and sprites. During 1985 Micro Power designed and marketed a Basic Extension ROM, introducing statements such as WHILE, ENDWHILE, CASE, WHEN, OTHERWISE, and ENDCASE, as well as direct mode commands including VERIFY.|$|E
