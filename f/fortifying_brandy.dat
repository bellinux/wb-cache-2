50|$|A vin de liqueur is a sweet {{fortified}} {{style of}} French wine that is <b>fortified</b> with <b>brandy</b> to unfermented grape must. The term vin de liqueur {{is also used}} by the European Union to refer to all fortified wines.|$|R
50|$|The {{unfermented}} {{grape must}} is <b>fortified</b> with <b>brandy</b> until the solution reaches an alcohol level of 16%-22%. The resulting wine {{is left with}} a high level of residual sugar because most strains of yeast cannot reproduce at such a high alcohol level.|$|R

50|$|After {{fermentation}} is complete, sherry is <b>fortified</b> with <b>brandy.</b> Because the fortification {{takes place}} after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine (for example) is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so {{that not all}} of the sugar is turned into alcohol.|$|R
500|$|Vins Doux Naturels are [...] "naturally sweet" [...] wines {{that have}} been <b>fortified</b> with <b>brandy</b> to stop fermentation, leaving {{residual}} sugar to add sweetness to the wine. The majority of Languedoc sweet white wines are made {{with a variety of}} Muscat grapes. The red fortified wines of the Banyuls are made from Grenache grapes, normally have an alcohol level between 16 and 17% and carry residual sugars in the 8 to 12% range.|$|R
50|$|Some {{varieties}} {{consist of}} the unfermented grape juice <b>fortified</b> with <b>brandy</b> or clear spirit immediately after pressing. Others are made like port, {{where the only}} partially fermented wine, still retaining {{a large amount of}} sugar, is infused with brandy. The relatively high alcohol of the brandy arrests the fermentation, leaving a fortified wine high in alcohol and high in residual sugar (usually about 10 to 15%). It is typically made from 50% Mission wine and 50% Mission brandy.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{beverages}} called [...] "wine", such as {{barley wine}} and rice wine (e.g. sake), {{are made from}} starch-based materials and resemble beer more than traditional wine, while ginger wine is <b>fortified</b> with <b>brandy.</b> In these latter cases, the term [...] "wine" [...] refers to the similarity in alcohol content {{rather than to the}} production process. The commercial use of the English word [...] "wine" [...] (and its equivalent in other languages) is protected by law in many jurisdictions.|$|R
60|$|Just at that moment, Lord Southminster swaggered back, {{accompanied}} {{by a couple of}} unwilling policemen. 'Oh, I say,' he cried, bursting in and staring around him, jubilant. 'Look heah, Georgey, are you going quietly, or must I ask these coppahs to evict you?' He was wreathed in smiles now, and had evidently been <b>fortifying</b> himself with <b>brandies</b> and soda.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th century sailors took along water, cordial {{and milk}} in casks. According to the Regulations and Instructions {{relating}} to His Majesty's Service at Sea, {{which had been}} published {{for the first time}} in 1733 by the Admiralty, sailors were entitled to a gallon of weak beer daily (5/6 of the usual British gallon, equivalent to the modern American gallon or slightly more than three and a half litres). As the beer had been boiled in the brewing process it was reasonably free from bacteria and lasted for months unlike water kept in a cask for the same time. In the Mediterranean, wine was also issued, often <b>fortified</b> with <b>brandy.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bass' No. 1 Ale was {{the first}} beer to be marketed as barley wine, around 1870. The ale was called [...] "No. 1" [...] because it came off the first running, i.e., {{was the first}} beer {{produced}} from the mash, and Bass marketed the high-alcohol, low-bitter, malty sweet ale as a [...] "barley wine" [...] {{as a substitute for}} <b>fortified</b> wines like <b>brandy</b> and sherry.|$|R
50|$|An apéritif is any {{alcoholic}} beverage usually served before a meal {{to stimulate the}} appetite, while a digestif is any {{alcoholic beverage}} served after a meal for the stated purpose of improving digestion. Fortified wine, liqueurs, and dry champagne are common apéritifs. Because apéritifs are served before dining, they are usually dry rather than sweet. One example is Cinzano, a brand of vermouth. Digestifs include <b>brandy,</b> <b>fortified</b> wines and herb-infused spirits (Drambuie).|$|R
2500|$|Alcohol was {{strictly}} forbidden during rehearsals and recording, so the cast fortified themselves with milk. The milk {{in turn was}} <b>fortified</b> with <b>brandy.</b> In later episodes the catchphrase [...] "round the back for the old brandy!" [...] or [...] "the old Marlon Brando" [...] was used to announce the exit {{of one or more}} characters, or a break for music. In [...] "The Pam's Paper Insurance Policy" [...] (Series 9, Episode 4) Ray Ellington, before his musical item begins, muses, [...] "I wonder where he keeps that stuff!". In [...] "The Scarlet Capsule" [...] (Series 9, Episode 14) Ellington's reply to Secombe's cry of [...] "Time for Ray Ellington and the old BRANDYYY there" [...] was [...] "The introductions he gives me...". [...] In [...] "The Moon Show" [...] (Series 7, Episode 18), Ellington sympathises with the listeners, stating [...] "Man, the excuses he makes to get to that brandy!", causing Milligan, Sellers and Secombe to wail [...] "MATE!" [...] in protest. However, Milligan got his own back by making Ellington laugh halfway through the song by doing Minnie Bannister voices while Ellington was singing.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 20th century, Angove {{wine grapes}} were sourced from its {{vineyards}} at Tea Tree Gully while the Renmark operation focused on <b>fortified</b> wine and <b>brandy</b> production. It {{was evident that}} the Tea Tree Gully vineyards were {{under pressure from the}} local suburban sprawl and so 500 hectares of land near Renmark was purchased with the view to establishing a vineyard to supply winemaking varieties that were not available locally. In 1969 the first plantings occurred here at the winery’s Nanya Vineyard and fifteen years later 480 hectares were bearing fruit in what was the first broad acre vineyard, and the largest at the time, in Australia and the southern hemisphere. Premium grape varieties dominated the planting mix and the company showed the rest of the industry what could be achieved in the Riverland.|$|R
5000|$|Michigan's wine {{industry}} dates from after {{the repeal of}} Prohibition. With large plantings of Concord in the southwest, mostly for the Welch Grape Juice Company, the state was well positioned to enter wine production. Four large wineries (out of eleven wineries established by 1946) came to produce almost all Michigan wine: La Salle Wine and Champagne Company which was established in Windsor, Ontario, and moved to Farmington, Michigan; the Bronte Champagne and Wines Company of Hartford; Michigan Wineries (now Tabor Hill Winery) of Buchanan; and St. Julian Winery, which was also established in Windsor, Ontario, on the Canadian shore across from Detroit during Prohibition and moved to Paw Paw, Michigan, after repeal. [...] To promote the local industry, Michigan law in the mid-20th century placed a tax of four cents per U.S. gallon on Michigan wine while other wine was taxed at 50 cents per U.S. gallon. Michigan wine of that era was, primarily, fermented to dryness, giving about 9% alcohol, and then <b>fortified</b> with California <b>brandy</b> to 16% alcohol. State laws considered this natural wine and allowed it to be sold in grocery and drug stores while fortified wines from out of state, produced to 18-20% alcohol, could only be sold from state liquor stores.|$|R
