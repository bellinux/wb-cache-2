5000|$|Case E-16/11 Icesave {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the landmark case of the EFTA Court case, mainly due to its relation to the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis and Directive 94/19/EC on deposit-guarantee schemes, which had also been transposed into EEA law. This directive obliged EU and <b>EEA</b> <b>EFTA</b> states to create deposit-guarantee schemes. Deposit-guarantee schemes reimburse a limited amount of deposits to depositors where their bank has failed, as a way to protect a part of depositors’ wealth from bank failures. In Icesave, the EFTA Court dealt with an action by the EFTA Surveillance Authority against Iceland. The Authority claimed that Iceland had violated the transposed Directive and thus EEA law in the aftermath of its major economic crisis and the collapse of the Icelandic banking sector in 2008, by failing to ensure that British and Dutch depositors using the ‘Icesave’ accounts offered by Icelandic banks received the minimum amount of compensation set out in Article 7(1) of the Directive. The Court noted that the nature of the result to be achieved fell to be determined by the substantive provisions of the particular directive. Moreover, it noted {{that as a result of}} the economic crisis, the regulatory framework of the financial system had been subject to revision and amendment in order to enhance financial stability. But the Court held that the Directive did not envisage the alleged obligation of result to ensure payment to depositors in the Dutch and British branches of Icelandic banks in a systemic crisis of the magnitude experienced in Iceland or how to proceed in a case where the guarantee scheme was unable to cope with its payment obligations remained largely unanswered by the Directive, with its Article 7(6) being the only operative provision that deals with non-payment. Still, the relevant question in Icesave was whether the EEA States are legally responsible under the Directive in an event of such magnitude. The Court held that the principle of non-discrimination requires that there to be no difference in treatment of depositors by the guarantee scheme itself and the way in which it uses its funds. Discrimination under the Directive is prohibited but the transfer of domestic deposits from some entities to new ones was made before the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority, Fjármálaeftirlitið, rendered its declaration that triggered the application of the Directive. Thus, depositor protection under the Directive never applied to depositors in Icelandic branches of the affected banks. Accordingly, the transfer of domestic deposits did not fall within the scope of the non-discrimination principle as stipulated by the Directive and could not lead to an infringement of the aforementioned provisions of the Directive read in light of Article 4 EEA.|$|R

For the EFTA States, the consequence is a more ‘supranational’ EEA Agreement than originally conceived. Further, it is shown that the EFTA Court appears, in hard cases, to lean even further towards teleological (ie integrationist) interpretation than the ECJ. It is suggested that this may be due to to structural imbalances between the two <b>EEA</b> courts, the <b>EFTA</b> Court’s desire to prove its independence from the EFTA States and its quest for recognition from the ECJ...|$|R

40|$|National parliaments are {{frequently}} labelled as the ‘victims’ of European integration and the EU {{is accused of}} causing the erosion of parliamentary democracy. This thesis reviews these claims by examining {{the influence of the}} European Union on national parliaments in their lawmaking capacity. The Europeanisation of legislatures is analysed {{at the level of the}} transformation of their competence as domestic lawmakers and ‘European players’ (Europeanisation of competence) and at the level of institutional and procedural adaptation (institutional Europeanisation). In this way, the thesis addresses some of the major cleavages causing disagreement between the proponents and opponents of the disempowerment of national parliaments. It is argued that the EU brings not only restrictions, but also benefits to the legislative activities of national representative institutions; and, in fact, the strengthening or weakening pattern of Europeanisation largely depends on parliamentary capacity and willingness to adapt. The study not only assesses the pattern of EU influence on the national parliaments of its Member States, but also examines whether similar processes can be identified in non-Member States. The analysis regarding non-Member States looks beyond the examples that are typically assessed by Europeanisation studies (e. g. the <b>EEA,</b> the <b>EFTA</b> and the candidate countries) and instead focuses on the case of Ukraine. The latter represents the Eastern neighbours of the EU that lack creditable membership prospects and would therefore be expected to demonstrate a weaker (if any) impact of the EU on its parliament. By building the links between the processes of Europeanisation within the EU and ‘far beyond’ its borders, this thesis aims to prove that the ‘de-parliamentarisation vs. re-parliamentarisation’ discussion is of much wider geographical relevance than it might appear at first sight.

We have not seen a strengthening of parliamentary institutions in the EEA structures, and the national parliaments of the EFTA Member States have not made adjustments enabling them to get a stronger role in governing European affairs. There is thus an increasing gap between the EU and the EEA regarding parliamentary involvement. The article examines the process of gradually strengthening the parliaments in the EU. It documents the limited formal and actual role played by parliaments and parliamentarians in the EEA construction.

5000|$|In Case E-2/97 Mag Instruments a {{parallel}} importer purchased Maglite flashlights in California, {{where they were}} manufactured, and imported them into Norway without the manufacturer’s and trade mark owner’s consent. According to established Norwegian law, international exhaustion applied to trade marks. The EFTA Court held that under the First Trade Mark Directive 89/104/EEC, the EFTA States were entitled to opt for the international exhaustion of trade mark rights. The Court emphasized that they retained their sovereignty in foreign trade matters. Unlike the EC Treaty, the EEA Agreement did not establish a customs union, but an enhanced free trade area. The purpose and {{the scope of the}} EC Treaty and the EEA Agreement are therefore different. According to Article 8 EEA, the principle of free movement of goods as laid down in Articles 11 to 13 EEA applies only to goods originating in the EEA, while in the Community a product is in free circulation once it has been lawfully placed on the market in a Member State. In general, the latter applies {{in the context of the}} EEA only with respect to products originating in the EEA. In the case at hand, the product was manufactured in the United States and imported into Norway. Accordingly, it was not subject to the principle of the free movement of goods within the EEA. Based on this, the EFTA Court rejected the argument put forward by the governments of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom as well as by the European Commission that giving the EEA/EFTA States the right to opt for international exhaustion would lead to disparities in the EEA market. Article 7(1) of the Trade Mark Directive was interpreted so that it was for the EEA/EFTA States’ legislatures and courts to decide whether they wanted to introduce or to maintain the principle of international exhaustion of trade mark rights with regard to goods originating from outside the <b>EEA.</b> The <b>EFTA</b> Court found that international exhaustion was in the interest of free trade and competition and thus in the interest of consumers. Furthermore, the principle of international exhaustion was in line with the main function of a trade mark, to allow the consumer to identify with certainty the origin of the products. This interpretation of Article 7(1) of the Trade Mark Directive was also consistent with the TRIPs Agreement, which left the issue open for the Member States to regulate.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{expression}} “neighbourhood policy” of the European Union (EU) is understood {{in a broad}} way which includes {{the members of the}} European Free Trade Association (EFTA) contracting parties to the European Economic Area (<b>EEA),</b> the <b>EFTA</b> State Switzerland, candidate states, the countries of the European Neighbour-hood Policy (ENP), and Russia. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the centre of gravity in the judicial dimension of this policy. The innermost circle of integration after the EU itself comprises the EFTA States who are party to the European Economic Area. With the EFTA Court, they have their own common court. The existence of two courts – the ECJ and the EFTA Court – raises the question of homogeneity of the case law. The EEA homogeneity rules resemble the ones of the Lugano Convention. The EFTA Court is basically obliged to follow or take into account relevant ECJ case law. But even if the ECJ has gone first, there may be constellations where the EFTA Court comes to the conclusion that it must go its own way. Such constellations may be given if there is new scientific evidence, if the ECJ has left certain questions open, where there is relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights or where, in light of the specific circumstances of the case, there is room for “creative homogeneity”. However, in the majority of its cases the EFTA Court is faced with novel legal questions. In such cases, the ECJ, its Advocates General and the Court of First Instance make reference to the EFTA Court’s case law. The question may be posed whether the EEA could {{serve as a model for}} other regional associations. For the ENP states, candidate States and Russia this is hard to imagine. Their courts will to varying degrees look to the ECJ when giving interpretation to the relevant agreements. The Swiss Government is – at least for the time being – unwilling to make a second attempt to join the EEA. The European Commission has therefore proposed to the Swiss to dock their sectoral agreements with the EU to the institutions of the EFTA pillar, the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) and the EFTA Court. Switzerland would then negotiate the right to nominate a member of the ESA College and of the EFTA Court. The Swiss Government has, however, opted for another model. Swiss courts would continue to look to the ECJ, as they did in the past, and conflicts should also in the future be resolved by diplomatic means. But the ECJ would play a decisive role in dispute settlement. It would, upon unilateral request of one side, give an “authoritative” interpretation of EU law as incorporated into the relevant bilateral agreement. In a “Non-Paper” which was drafted by the chief negotiators, the interpretations of the ECJ are even characterised as binding. The decision-making power would, however, remain with the Joint Committees where Switzerland could say no. The Swiss Government assumes that after a negative decision by the ECJ it would be able to negotiate a compromise solution with the Commission without the ECJ being able to express itself on the outcome. The Government has therefore not tried to emphasise that the ECJ would not be a foreign court. Whether the ECJ would accept its intended role, is an open question. And if it would, the Swiss Government would have to explain to its voters that Switzerland retains the freedom to disregard such a binding decision and that for this reason the ECJ is not only no foreign court, but no adjudicating court at all...|$|R
40|$|It is a {{generally}} accepted {{idea that the}} basis {{for the future of the}} economies, of not just the Nordic countries but of EU as a whole, is a transition to a (more) knowledge based economy. An important tool to achieve this goal is research policy. The background to this thesis is the feasibility and chances for success of a common Nordic research policy, since the Nordic countries by themselves all have relatively small populations. Taken together, though, the population of the Nordic countries is enough to achieve what is often termed “critical mass” in research programs, and thus makes the Nordic region a significant player in or contributor to international research schemes. Especially in relation to EU, the Nordic countries are in a good position to make a common effort, since all are either members (Denmark, Finland, Sweden) or part of the <b>EEA</b> agreement through <b>EFTA</b> (Iceland, Norway). At the same time the regional cooperation between the Nordic countries has a long history and long established organizations through both the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. 	 In this thesis we analyze Nordic and EU research policy in the period 1970 - 2008 and what characterizes each of these. In addition to this historical analysis, we make a case study of the Nordic research institution NordForsk. We then use the results from this historical analysis in conjunction with the case study to see if, how and under which conditions NordForsk can be used to develop the Nordic region as a European research region. Thus the thesis covers both History and Public Administration. We have found that EU research policy has generally been characterized more by industrial or innovation policy than by the kind of broad research policy, including basic research, which is typically found in the member states, and their commitment has been half hearted at best. Nordic research policy has been characterized by an overshadowing emphasis on consensus and grass roots ad hoc solutions, and lacked member states’ commitment and an overarching goal. We see a clear possibility in NordForsk as the only true Nordic research policy institution, but it is necessary to expand its mandate and especially the commitment of the Nordic states to a common agenda to achieve the kind of synergies, that make such a Nordic institution relevant. In the absence of such initiatives an institution such as NordForsk is of relatively small significance, although it may yield good results by supporting a few small projects...|$|R
