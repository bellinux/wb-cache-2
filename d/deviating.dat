40|$|This {{research}} examines whether {{evaluations of}} positive <b>deviates</b> (i. e. high achieving group members) {{are influenced by}} the attributions they make for their performance. We argue that ingroup positive <b>deviates</b> who make group attributions help enhance the ingroup 2 ̆ 7 s image and thus attract favorable evaluations. In Experiment 1, ingroup positive <b>deviates</b> who made group attributions were generally evaluated more favorably than ingroup positive <b>deviates</b> who made individual attributions. There was also evidence that the positive <b>deviates</b> 2 ̆ 7 attribution style influenced group and self-evaluations. Evaluations of outgroup positive <b>deviates</b> were not influenced by their attribution style. In Experiment 2, an ingroup positive <b>deviate</b> who was successful and attributed that success to the group was upgraded relative to an ingroup positive <b>deviate</b> who made individual attributions. Group evaluations were also higher when the positive <b>deviate</b> made group attributions. This pattern did not emerge when the positive <b>deviate</b> failed. The results are discussed from a social identity perspective...|$|R

40|$|The Reticulitermes flavipes <b>deviate</b> gene was {{investigated}} {{to determine its}} role in termites 2 ̆ 7 response to environmental changes, {{as well as its}} effect on important termite behaviors such as trail following and foraging. ^ The <b>deviate</b> gene was expressed in all four termite body regions that were sampled (antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen), and the gene was also present in the three phenotypes sampled (worker, solder, and nymph). ^ To examine the effect of photoperiod on <b>deviate</b> expression, termites were held in either light, dark, or light/dark cycle conditions. These differences in light conditions resulted in altered <b>deviate</b> expression between light and dark treatments, suggesting a possible connection between the <b>deviate</b> gene and termite circadian rhythm. ^ Temperature did not appear to alter <b>deviate</b> expression across the range tested (17 °C– 27 °C), however when juvenile hormone was added to identical temperature treatments, a difference in gene expression was observed between 17 °C and 22 °C. This information may suggest that the <b>deviate</b> gene is suppressed by juvenile hormone, and that <b>deviate</b> {{may play a role in}} the processes associated with caste maintenance and differentiation in termites. Additionally, when RNA-interference (RNAi) was used to silence <b>deviate</b> gene expression, <b>deviate</b> silenced worker termites held in dishes containing a food source treated with juvenile hormone III did not show significant differences from controls in the number presoldiers that developed or the timing of presoldier development. These findings may further support the hypothesis that <b>deviate</b> expression in termites decreases as juvenile hormone increases. ^ Finally, RNAi gene silencing was used to examine the behavioral role of the <b>deviate</b> gene.

40|$|Objectives: Septoplasty for {{correction}} of <b>deviated</b> nose often requires {{removal of the}} <b>deviated</b> part of the quadrangular cartilage and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone or vomer. In most cases, the removed bone is discarded. We de-scribe our experience using septal bone for <b>deviated</b> nose correction, and analyze the postoperative results. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 23 patients who underwent {{correction of}} <b>deviated</b> nose using nasal septal bone to straighten <b>deviated</b> septal cartilage from January 2004 to August 2008. The subjective satisfaction of pa-tients was evaluated 6 to 12 months after rhinoplasty with a questionnaire. Aesthetic outcomes were evaluated by 2 inde-pendent rhinoplastic surgeons who compared preoperative and postoperative photographs. To evaluate outcomes objec-tively, we made anthropometric measurements of the <b>deviated</b> nose before and after surgery using facial photographs. Results: All patients indicated cosmetic satisfaction and improvement in nasal obstruction. The outcome analysis by 2 independent rhinoplastic surgeons indicated that 13 patients had excellent, 5 patients had good, and 5 had fair outcomes. Anthropometric measurements of the <b>deviated</b> nose showed that both the curved <b>deviated</b> angles and the linear <b>deviated</b> angle had improved (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Use of nasal septal bone to straighten <b>deviated</b> septal cartilage appears to be feasible in corrective rhino-plasty, and may be particularly beneficial in cartilage-depleted patients...|$|R

When the Populist convention gathered the next month in Chicago, they divided between endorsing the silverite Democrat and preserving their new party's independence. Weaver backed the former course, holding the issues the party stood for to be of more importance than the party itself. A majority of delegates agreed, but without the enthusiasm that had marked their convention of four years earlier. At the same time, Weaver joined with anti-fusionists to keep the Populist platform from <b>deviating</b> from the party's ideological principles. Against the fusion candidate stood Republican William McKinley of Ohio, a hard-money conservative. Bryan succeeded in uniting the South and West, Weaver's longtime dream, but with the more populous North solidly behind McKinley, Bryan lost the election.|$|E

5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in <b>deviating</b> about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E
