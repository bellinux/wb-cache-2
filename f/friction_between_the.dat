5|$|Peggy resumes {{her plan}} {{to run for}} council in 2010, but is furious to {{discover}} that Pat is also running. The storyline introduces the character of Harvey Freeman, played by Martin Jarvis, a freelance journalist who is reporting on the election. Harvey is a potential love interest for both Peggy and Pat, and causes <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Ronaldinho in 2003, and Barcelona's {{subsequent}} success in La Liga and Champions League, {{has been seen}} as crucial to an increase in the national, and worldwide, fan-base of the club. This development of a larger national fan-base has created <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Catalan nationalist supporters, who wish to secede from Spain, and the club's other Spanish supporters.|$|E
5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, {{which became a}} cause of ongoing <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> British and French, especially on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. Jean, and Cape Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E
50|$|Internationally, the Pentapartito {{relied on}} a strong pro-Europeanism and atlanticism from a pro-Arab policy, (Craxi and Andreotti). This fact caused many <b>frictions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Liberals and the Socialists, {{and was one of}} the causes of {{disintegration}} of the coalition.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{relative}} motions for the toroidal drive are analysed. <b>The</b> sliding factors <b>between</b> <b>the</b> planet and the stator or the worm are given. <b>The</b> <b>friction</b> coefficients <b>between</b> <b>the</b> planet and the stator or the worm under asperity contact or hydrodynamic lubrica-tion are presented. <b>The</b> <b>friction</b> coefficients <b>between</b> <b>the</b> planet and the stator or the worm under partial hydrodynamic lubrication are also given. Changes of <b>the</b> sliding factors <b>between</b> <b>the</b> planet and the stator or the worm along with drive parameters are presented. <b>The</b> <b>friction</b> coef-ficients <b>between</b> <b>the</b> planet and the stator or the worm under hydrodynamic lubrication are compared, {{and the changes}} of them along with drive parameters are discussed. Under asperity contact, the changes of <b>the</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient <b>between</b> <b>the</b> planet and the stator along with the drive parameters are given as well. Under partial hydrodynamic lubrication, the changes of <b>the</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient <b>between</b> <b>the</b> planet and the stator along with {{the ratio of the}} film thickness to mean standard deviations of the height distributions for two teeth are also discussed. These results can be used for friction design of the toroidal drive...|$|R
50|$|Augsburg {{was granted}} {{the status of}} a Free Imperial City on March 9, 1276 and from then until 1803, it was {{independent}} of its former overlord, the Prince-Bishop of Augsburg. <b>Frictions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> city-state and the prince-bishops were to remain frequent however, particularly after Augsburg became Protestant and curtailed the rights and freedoms of Catholics.|$|R
5|$|Experiments and ice {{modeling}} {{published in}} 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one {{order of magnitude}} more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed. Their results indicates {{that most of the}} heat generated by the ice actually comes from the ice's crystalline structure (lattice) as a result of deformation, and not <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> ice grains. The greater the deformation of the ice sheet, the more heat is generated.|$|E
5|$|In public, Alexandra was dignified and charming; in private, affectionate and jolly. She enjoyed {{many social}} activities, {{including}} dancing and ice-skating, {{and was an}} expert horsewoman and tandem driver. She also enjoyed hunting, {{to the dismay of}} Queen Victoria, who asked her to stop, but without success. Even after the birth of her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Prussians and the queen's partiality towards them.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders and Chiefs rivalry {{has only}} existed recently. In 2012 and 2013 the Chiefs {{defeated}} the Crusaders in the semi-final, 20-17 and 20-19 respectively. All matches {{between the two}} sides are characterised by high intensity matches and altercations throughout. The Chiefs have identified and recruited large amounts of talent from traditional Crusaders territory, causing more <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> fan bases. In the 2017 semi-final, the Crusaders repaid the Chiefs in kind, defeating the Chiefs 27-13.|$|E
50|$|The {{coalition}} still {{judged the}} Italian Communist Party and the Italian Social Movement as too extreme {{for participation in}} government. Internationally, the coalition relied on a strong pro-Europeanism and atlanticism from a pro-Arab policy, (Craxi and Andreotti). This fact caused many <b>frictions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Liberals and the Socialists, {{and was one of}} the causes of disintegration of the coalition.|$|R

5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|Victoria became second-in-line to the British throne in 1827; {{to prevent}} Victoria from being {{surrounded}} by commoners, King George IV named Lehzen a Baroness of the Kingdom of Hanover later that year. Lehzen encouraged the princess to become strong, informed, and independent from the Duchess and Conroy's influence, causing <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two and Lehzen. Attempts to remove the governess, who {{had the support of}} Victoria's uncles George IV, William IV, and Leopold I of Belgium, were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Wet snow {{avalanches}} are a low-velocity {{suspension of}} snow and water, with the flow confined {{to the surface of}} the pathway. The low speed of travel is due to the <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.|$|E
500|$|Human factors {{also led}} to delays in production. Ismail and the other crew members {{attempted}} to achieve realism by ensuring everything in the film was {{as it was in}} life, a decision which he later recanted after realising that [...] "film was truly the art of make-believe, making people believe something, creating a new reality from what is." [...] Cast-wise, three actors (including the lead, Del Juzar), competed for the affections of Faridah, leading to <b>frictions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> actors. The cast also argued about interpretations of their roles, with Ismail insisting on them following his direction.|$|R

5|$|A loyal clubman, Trumble {{served on}} the {{committee}} of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) from 1900–01 to 1910–11 and was made a life member in 1904. In 1911 he resigned from the bank to become MCC club secretary; a position he held for 27years until his death. In this role, he played a leading part in reconciling the club and the Victorian Cricket Association {{after a period of}} some <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two bodies. He was instrumental in attracting quality cricketers to the club including Bert Ironmonger, whom Trumble saw play on a visit to Queensland. During his term as secretary, the Melbourne Cricket Ground was expanded to a capacity of over 70,000spectators.|$|E
5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from a foreigner who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas {{of discipline and}} tactics differed enormously from those {{to which they were}} accustomed. This resulted in <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay, and Pulaski's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
30|$|Contact may be {{developed}} with friction {{based on the}} Coulomb criterion. The method allows no movement until the friction force is reached. After that, the movement is initiated and the friction forces remain constant. <b>The</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient <b>between</b> <b>the</b> timber member and stiff steel plate was set equal to 0.2 [28]. Considering surface condition of dowel, <b>the</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient <b>between</b> <b>the</b> dowel and timber was set equal to 0.3, which {{can be considered as}} <b>the</b> limit value <b>between</b> <b>the</b> smooth and rough surface dowel [29].|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} May 1940, Berger {{had filled}} the {{authorised}} quota of new recruits, but his recruiters kept signing up young men to create a reserve that could replace the many older Allgemeine SS reservists in the three field divisions. To supplement this pool, Berger also continued recruiting for the SS-TV and police regiments, which were not under Wehrmacht control, and were still below the strengths approved by Hitler. This continued to create <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Wehrmacht and SS, as potential Wehrmacht recruits were siphoned off to forces under Himmler's control. By a range of methods, Berger diverted manpower from the younger age groups, and also targeted areas outside the Reich that were not subject to Wehrmacht recruiting controls.|$|E
5|$|Calling himself Anders, and feigning {{an injured}} leg, Kator is {{taken in by}} Jessica and Jo. His arrival {{immediately}} causes <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two. Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned {{to the spot where}} he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in a spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo.|$|E
5|$|Coke became {{involved}} in the now classic Shelley's Case in 1581, which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today; the case also established Coke's reputation as an attorney and case reporter. His next famous case was Chudleigh's Case, a dispute over the interpretation of the Statute of Uses, followed by Slade's Case, a dispute between the Common Pleas and King's Bench over assumpsit now regarded as a classic example of the <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two courts and the forward movement of contract law; Coke's argument in Slade's Case formed the first definition of consideration.|$|E

In [...] 1967, René Lévesque, who until then had been a leading figure in the Liberal Party of Quebec, quit the Liberals to found the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association (MSA).|$|R
5|$|There was <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{new owners}} and the Commissioners of Sewers. The railway company {{proposed}} {{the creation of a}} railway between Highbridge and Glastonbury in 1850, and the Somerset Central Railway was authorised by Parliament on 17 June 1852. The canal was transferred to the new company, and was used to speed the construction of the railway, earning £312 in the year ending September 1853. The line followed the route of the canal closely, with much of it built on the towpath. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854.|$|E
5|$|This {{period of}} Armenian hegemony in the region, however, was coming {{close to an}} end {{with a series of}} Roman {{victories}} in the Roman–Mithridatic Wars. <b>Friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two had existed for several decades, although it was during the Third Mithridatic War that the Roman armies under Lucullus made significant progress against Mithridates, forcing him to take refuge with Tigranes. Lucullus sent an ambassador named Appius Claudius to Antioch to demand that Tigranes surrender his father-in-law; should he refuse, Armenia would face war with Rome. Tigranes refused Appius Claudius' demands, stating that he would prepare for war against the Republic.|$|E
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was <b>friction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E
