25|$|The {{night was}} spent in terrible anxiety and {{extraordinary}} human effort.

25|$|Nyastadaṇḍam (Sanskrit: न्यस्तदण्डम्). While Paraśurāma {{is on his}} pilgrimage, Sahasrārjuna's sons – the Haihaya princes, {{attack the}} Āśrama of Jamadagni to avenge their father's killing. The princes run <b>down</b> <b>everything</b> and {{everybody}} that comes their way. Jamadagni is in deep meditation when he is beheaded by the princes, who take his severed head with them to Māhiṣmatī. When Paraśurāma returns, he sees the Āśrama strewn with corpses. He then sees an inconsolable Reṇukā crying near the torso of Jamadagni. When Reṇukā sees Paraśurāma, she beats her chest 21 times saying how could the Haihaya kings kill her husband with Paraśurāma still alive. Paraśurāma places Jamadagni's torso in a boat filled with oil and asks Reṇukā to protect his father's body till he is back. The enraged Paraśurāma goes to Māhiṣmatī all alone and calls out to the Haihayas. He kills their entire army and annihilates the Haihaya race. He then brings back Jamadagni's severed head and attaches it to the torso. Jamadagni is resurrected. Paraśurāma annihilates the race of Kṣatriyas 21 times from the earth, leaving out the dynasties of Raghu and Yadu. After killing 12,000 kings, Paraśurāma creates five huge lakes of blood in Kurukṣetra. Finally, on {{the request of the}} sage Kaśyapa, Paraśurāma gives up anger and gives all the lands on the earth to Kaśyapa. He then goes to the Mahendra mountain to perform penance.|$|E

500|$|According to Crowley's later statements, on 8 April {{he heard}} a disembodied voice that claimed {{to be that of}} Aiwass, the {{messenger}} of Horus, or Hoor-Paar-Kraat. Crowley said that he wrote <b>down</b> <b>everything</b> the voice told him {{over the course of the}} next three days, and titled it Liber L vel Legis or The Book of the Law. The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new Aeon, and that Crowley would serve as its prophet. It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, [...] "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," [...] and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowley's religion, Thelema. Crowley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with The Book of the Law. Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.|$|E
