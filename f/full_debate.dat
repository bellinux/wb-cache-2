25|$|On 24 January 2013, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill was {{introduced}} to the Commons by Maria Miller, and a <b>full</b> <b>debate</b> occurred at the Second Reading on 5 February. The bill retains some distinctions from marriage {{between a man and a}} woman; e.g. in divorce proceedings, adultery (as with opposite-sex marriage) can only involve sexual conduct between two persons of the opposite sex, while non-consummation will not be grounds for annulment of a same-sex marriage.|$|E
2500|$|In his dissent Justice Alito sharply {{criticized the}} {{majority}} for usurping {{the role of}} the legislature. Alito argued that Kennedy's rationale for defining national consensus was flawed, because the previous Coker decision had [...] "stunted legislative consideration of the question whether the death penalty for the targeted offense of raping a young child is consistent with prevailing standards of decency." [...] In this Alito followed former Chief Justice Warren Burger, who had dissented from Coker because it, in his view, prevented a <b>full</b> <b>debate</b> over the uses of the recently reinstated death penalty. In this vein, Alito also argued that [...] "The Eighth Amendment protects the right of an accused. It does not authorize this Court to strike down federal or state criminal laws on the ground that they are not {{in the best interests of}} crime victims or the broader society." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Long Parliament, though Hampden was by {{no means}} a {{frequent}} speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator. [...] "He was not a man of many words," [...] says Clarendon, [...] "and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a <b>full</b> <b>debate</b> and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future" [...] (Hist. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.|$|E
50|$|Fuller, a Particular Baptist, was a controversialist in defence of the {{governmental}} {{theory of the}} atonement against hyper-Calvinism {{on the one hand}} and Socinianism and Sandemanianism on the other.

2500|$|On November 4, John Wharton {{was named}} chair of a {{committee}} to determine {{the purpose of the}} war. [...] After three full days of deliberation failed to produce a resolution, delegates began a <b>full</b> <b>debate</b> on the floor. [...] The turning point of the discussion came when Houston, who many believed to be a staunch member of the War Party, asked the fellow delegates to refrain from declaring independence. Such a declaration would likely cause {{many of the people who}} supported the Constitution of 1824 in other parts of Mexico to refrain from supporting the Texians. [...] The Consultation compromised. On November 7, they released a resolution declaring that [...] "The people of Texas, availing themselves of their natural rights, solemnly declare that they have taken up arms in defense of their rights and liberties which were threatened by the encroachments of military despots and in defense of the Republican principles of the federal constitution of Mexico of 1824." [...] The resolution further specified that Texas reserved the right to create an independent government as long as Mexico was not governed by that document. The members hoped that this wording would allow them to gain support from both federalists within Mexico and from the United States. The resolution passed 3314.|$|E

60|$|There {{had been}} some {{question}} as to whether we should not attempt a night attack upon their camp, of which I was rather in favour. After <b>full</b> <b>debate,</b> however, the idea had been abandoned, owing to the fewness of our numbers, the dislike which the White Kendah shared with the Black of attempting to operate in the dark, and the well chosen position of our enemy, whom {{it would be impossible to}} rush before we were discovered by their outposts. What I hoped in my heart was that they might try to rush us, notwithstanding the story of the two captured spies, and in the gloom, after the moon had sunk low and before the dawn came, become entangled in our pitfalls and outlying entrenchments, where we should be able to destroy a great number of them. Only on the previous afternoon that cunning old fellow, Hans, had pointed out to me how advantageous such an event would be to our cause and, while agreeing with him, I suggested that probably the Black Kendah knew this as well as we did, as the prisoners had told us.|$|E

60|$|In this audacious tumult, {{when our}} very name and {{character}} as gentlemen {{was to be}} cancelled forever, along with the faith and honor of the nation, I, who had exerted myself very little on the quiet passing of the bill, thought it necessary then to come forward. I was not alone; but though some distinguished members on all sides, and particularly on ours, added much to their high reputation by the part they took on that day, (a part which {{will be remembered as}} long as honor, spirit, and eloquence have estimation in the world,) I may and will value myself so far, that, yielding in abilities to many, I yielded in zeal to none. With warmth and with vigor, and animated with a just and natural indignation, I called forth every faculty that I possessed, and I directed it in every way in which I could possibly employ it. I labored night and day. I labored in Parliament; I labored out of Parliament. If, therefore, the resolution of the House of Commons, refusing to commit this act of unmatched turpitude, be a crime, I am guilty among the foremost. But, indeed, whatever the faults of that House may have been, no one member was found hardy enough to propose so infamous a thing; and on <b>full</b> <b>debate</b> we passed the resolution against the petitions with as much unanimity as we had formerly passed the law of which these petitions demanded the repeal.|$|E
6000|$|On {{demobilisation}} we {{have the}} chance of our lives to put men on the land. Because {{this is still a}} Party question, to be sagaciously debated up hill and down dale three or four years hence, we shall very likely grasp the mere shadow and miss the substance of that opportunity. If the Government had a mandate [...] "Full steam ahead" [...] we could add {{at the end of the}} war perhaps a million men (potentially four million people) to our food-growing country population; as it is, we may add thereto a few thousands, lose half a million to the Colonies, and discourage the rest--patting our own backs the while. To put men on the land we must have the land ready in terms of earth, not of paper; and have it in the right places, within easy reach of town or village. Things can be done just now. We know, for instance, that in a few months half a million allotment-gardens have been created in urban areas and more progress made with small holdings than in previous years. I repeat, we have a chance which will not recur to scotch the food danger, and to restore a healthier balance between town and country stocks. Shall we be penny-wise and lose this chance for the luxury of [...] "free and full discussion of a controversial matter at a time when men's minds are not full of the country's danger"? This is the country's danger--there is no other. And this is the moment for full and free discussion of it, for full and free action too. Who doubts that a Government which brought this question of the land in its widest aspects to the touch-stone of <b>full</b> <b>debate</b> at once, would get its mandate, would get the power it wanted--not to gerrymander, but to build? ...|$|E
60|$|You may easily believe I am {{not at all}} {{surprised}} at what you tell me, since it is but a confirmation of my own conjecture that I sent you last week, and made you my reproaches upon it at a venture. It looks exceeding strange, yet, I {{believe it to be}} a great truth, that, in order to carry a point in your house, the two following circumstances are of great advantage; first, to have an ill cause; and, secondly, to be a minority. For both these circumstances are extremely apt to unite men, to make them assiduous in their attendance, watchful of opportunities, zealous for gaining over proselytes, and often successful; which is not to be wondered at, when favour and interest are on the side of their opinion. Whereas, on the contrary, a majority with a good cause are negligent and supine. They think it sufficient to declare themselves upon occasion in favour of their party, but, sailing against the tide of favour and preferment, they are easily scattered and driven back. In short, they want a common principle to cement, and motive to spirit them; For the bare acting upon a principle from the dictates of a good conscience, or prospect of serving the public, will not go very far under the present dispositions of mankind. This was amply verified last sessions of Parliament, upon occasion of the money bill, the merits of which I shall not pretend to examine. 'Tis enough that, upon the first news of its transmission hither, in the form it afterwards appeared, the members, upon discourse with their friends, seemed unanimous against it, I mean those of both parties, except a few, who were looked upon as persons ready to go any lengths prescribed them by the court. Yet with only a week's canvassing among a very few hands, the bill passed after a <b>full</b> <b>debate,</b> by a very great majority; yet, I believe, you will hardly attempt persuading me, or anybody else, that one man in ten, of those who changed their language, were moved by reasons any way affecting the merits of the cause, but merely through hope, fear, indolence, or good manners. Nay, I have been assured from good hands, that there was still a number sufficient to make a majority against the bill, if they had not apprehended the other side to be secure, and therefore thought it imprudence, by declaring themselves, to disoblige the government to no purpose.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{informed}} consent {{is well established}} {{in the field of}} bioethics, but its application is unclear in the area of public health. The increasing prevalence of public health interventions creates a need to analyze the scope of government power as it relates to individual choice. This Article explores three different types of public health measures in which individual choice has been limited: (1) environmental interventions; (2) classic public health interventions to prevent contagious disease; and (3) public health information reporting or use. The reasons for limiting informed consent vary depending on the context, and the implications for the scope of an exception likewise vary. Careful consideration of the theoretical bases for exceptions indicates the importance of information disclosure in almost all situations, and may lead to novel solutions, such as a ‘fair use‘ model for health information. A singular “public health exception” concept is overly broad and superficial. Instead, there should be a <b>fuller</b> <b>debate</b> about the requirements of informed consent in the wide variety of public health settings...|$|R
