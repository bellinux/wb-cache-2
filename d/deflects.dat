The Amulet of the Fates has limited usage before needing to be recharged (which occurs automatically and is represented by the Amulet of the Fates Meter).

X-band travelling wave <b>deflecting</b> structure has features of higher <b>deflecting</b> voltage and compact structure, which is good performance at ultra-short bunch length measurement. In this paper, a new X-band <b>deflecting</b> structure has been designed operated at HEM 11 - 2 pi/ 3 mode.

5|$|Friendly and enemy non-player {{characters}} {{inhabit the}} two worlds. Friendly characters can provide Link with assistance or side-quests to complete. Link wields a sword and shield, {{which can be}} used to defeat enemies and <b>deflects</b> their attacks. Other combat items from past Zelda games return, such as the bow, the fire rod, bombs, and more. However, unlike previous games, the methods for obtaining and using these items is different. Rather than finding them in dungeons, they are rented or purchased from a merchant, named Ravio. Should Link fall in battle, his rented items will be returned to Ravio. They also do not require ammunition, instead their use is limited by the replenishing energy gauge. Link's total life energy can be increased by collecting heart pieces. His weapons can be upgraded by completing a side quest that involves searching for small hidden creatures and returning them to their parent. Link can also participate in several minigames to earn rupees, Hyrule's currency.|$|E

Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she <b>deflects</b> with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star.

When Cassie discovers she has HIV, Aden becomes irate at the prospect {{that she may have}} infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, he cries in disappointment. His doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but <b>deflects</b> her attempts to take things further. She goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), which prompts a jealous Aden to admit that he could not sleep with her because of the abuse he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo.

The distributions of <b>deflecting</b> fields are considered with respect to non linear additions, which provide emittance deteriorations during a transformation.

40|$|Existing {{multihop}} wireless {{routing protocols}} {{are incapable of}} reacting quickly to transient degradation of link quality rendering them unsuitable for supporting real-time applications. This limitation is imposed on the metricbased routing protocols {{in order to achieve}} route stability and low protocol overhead. We design <b>Deflect,</b> a lightweight and opportunistic mechanism that works underneath the routing layer. <b>Deflect</b> enables fast local adaptation of end-to-end routes in response to sudden drops in link delivery ratio or node failures. <b>Deflect</b> nodes snoop on transmissions to monitor link quality, and <b>deflect</b> traffic on other nodes to circumvent a poor-quality link. The design of <b>Deflect</b> achieves the following goals: a) zero message overhead mechanism for monitoring link quality at a very short time scale; b) fast switching of traffic through a node in neighborhood of the poor link; c) transparency to end-to-end routing protocol. We show that <b>Deflect</b> can react to link quality degradation within a few hundred milliseconds, compared to tens of seconds for an end-to-end routing protocol. Experiments in presence of controlled interference with <b>Deflect</b> show that the average measurement error is less than 5 %. Overall, <b>Deflect</b> is shown to provide significant improvement in packet loss and delay compared with traditional metric-based routing. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Deflecting</b> {{cavities}} {{are used}} in particle accelerators for the manipulation of charged particles by <b>deflecting</b> or crabbing (rotating) them. For short deflectors, {{the effect of the}} power coupler on the <b>deflecting</b> field can become significant. The particular power coupler type can introduce multipole rf field components and coupler-specific wakefields. Coupler types that would normally be considered like standard on-cell coupler, waveguide coupler, or mode-launcher coupler could have one or two rf feeds. The major advantage of a dual-feed coupler is the absence of monopole and quadrupole rf field components in the <b>deflecting</b> structure. However, a dual-feed coupler is mechanically more complex than a typical single-feed coupler and needs a splitter. For most applications, <b>deflecting</b> structures are placed in regions where there is small space hence reducing the size of the structure is very desirable. This paper investigates the multipole field components of the <b>deflecting</b> mode in single-feed couplers and ways to overcome the effect of the monopole component on the beam. Significant advances in performance have been demonstrated. Additionally, a novel coupler design is introduced which has no monopole field component to the <b>deflecting</b> mode and is more compact than the conventional dual-feed coupler...|$|R
