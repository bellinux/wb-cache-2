6000|$|I say to them, What <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> made for? It shuts them up. They haven't {{a word to}} answer. What <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> made for? That clinches it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of that," [...] said Mr. Kennedy. [...] "A man who {{can kill}} more salmon than anybody else, can rarely do {{anything}} <b>else.</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> going on with your match?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Appleby almost fancied that Palliser winced as {{they turned}} away. “Yes,” he said. “Violet and I are, however, not married yet, and we’ll talk of {{something}} <b>else.</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> liking the business any better?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I heard {{something}} {{about it at the}} time," [...] said Mrs. Armitage. [...] "You were very much in love with somebody <b>else,</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No? What a coincidence! I declare here's {{some one}} <b>else.</b> <b>You</b> <b>were</b> not {{thinking}} of this some one <b>else</b> too; <b>were</b> <b>you,</b> Amy?' ...|$|R
60|$|CANYNGE. Then you can't suggest any one {{who could}} have known? Nothing <b>else</b> <b>was</b> taken, <b>you</b> see.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, that I am for {{the time}} being; but now move on if you would {{continue}} that which you have begun, <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> like {{to fall into the}} hands of other soldiers in this encampment who will have less care for your safety." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you bear another surprise? Mr. Morris {{has seen}} Miss Jethro, and has {{discovered}} that Mr. Mirabel has been wrongly suspected of a dreadful crime. Our amiable little clergyman is guilty of being a coward--and guilty of nothing <b>else.</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> really quiet enough to read about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! I {{should not}} have asked you <b>else.</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> very much shocked?" [...] she added, with a mocking gleam in her eyes. [...] "It is not proper, is it! I confess I {{did not think of}} that. But do come," [...] she added, with a sudden bewitching smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, bless my soul!" [...] I exclaimed, [...] "who <b>else</b> <b>was</b> there? <b>You</b> wouldn't have {{expected}} {{to take up a}} collection among the summer-boarders?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If we must talk," [...] Sybil suggested, {{quickening}} {{her pace}} a little, [...] "let us talk of something <b>else.</b> How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> enjoying your millions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a {{thousand}} times more beautiful," [...] he said, [...] "than anything <b>else</b> could <b>be....</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> all the beauty in the world. Beauty doesn't mean, never has meant, anything--anything at all but you. It heralded you, promised you...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{have you}} {{arranged}} about meeting Miss Silvester?" [...] he went on. [...] "You can't {{go to the}} hotel {{in the character of}} her husband. I have prevented that. Where <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to meet her? She is all alone; she must be weary of waiting, poor thing. Can you manage matters so as to see her to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘You {{need not}} die,’ said Jason. ‘Flee home with us across the sea. Show us first {{how to win}} the fleece; for you can do it. Why <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> the priestess of the grove? Show us but how to win the fleece, and come with us, and you shall be my queen, and rule over the rich princes of the Minuai, in Iolcos by the sea.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Meantime Wilmet and Alda found {{themselves}} before a large, florid, much-dressed lady, with a most good-natured face, who greeted them with 'Good morning, my dears! Just as Marilda told me, so much alike {{as to be}} quite romantic. Well, no doubt it is a pity to separate between you, but my Marilda will be a true sister. She has spoken of nothing <b>else.</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> willing, either of you, my dears?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You needn't thank me," [...] he said gruffly. [...] "I {{wanted to}} let you drown. But I went out for Mary Stella's sake. Tell me one thing--I couldn't bring myself to ask it of anyone <b>else.</b> When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to be--married?" ...|$|R

6000|$|BELLO: What <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> good for, an {{impotent}} {{thing like}} you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds of Bloom's haunches) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp {{as a boy}} of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly) Can you do a man's job? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, just as spies {{frequent}} hostile camps. How <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{to learn}} about the enemy? Besides, I enjoy myself at their meetings. They are good fighters, and, right or wrong, they have read the books. Any one of them knows far more about sociology and all the other ologies than the average captain of industry. Yes, I have been to half a dozen of their meetings, but that doesn't make me a socialist any more than hearing Charley Hapgood orate made me a Republican." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know it, Nigel, {{but you do}} {{not know}} each {{separate}} name, <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> a wiser man than I had thought you. In truth--none can say that they know all, though I have myself picked off eighty, and six for a wager at court, and it is said that the chief huntsman of the Duke of Burgundy has counted over a hundred--but it is in my mind that he may have found them as he went, for there was none to say him nay. Answer me now, lad, how would you say if you saw ten badgers together in the forest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>else</b> <b>is</b> it. <b>You</b> haven't <b>been</b> here a day, but {{you must}} {{telegraph}} for some female {{to be ready to}} hold your hand the moment you go away. And before she lets go, you'll be wiring for another. <b>YOU</b> WANT TO <b>BE</b> LOVED, <b>you</b> want to <b>be</b> loved--a man of your years. It's disgusting--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never {{counted on}} finding {{you at home}} on this day of all others; but just dropped in on the chance <b>you</b> might <b>be</b> here, since I have looked {{everywhere}} <b>else.</b> Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> keeping so snug when {{there is so much}} going on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. It's because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{like no one}} <b>else.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> so good, and so sweet-tempered. You {{have such}} a gentle nature, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> always right.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It seemed {{deeper than}} the mere death of a cousin, and the Countess had no {{hesitation}} in connecting her exasperating brother with the expression of her sister-in-law's eyes. Her heart beat with an almost joyous expectation, for if she had wished to see Osmond overtopped the conditions looked favourable now. Of course if Isabel should go to England she herself would immediately leave Palazzo Roccanera; nothing would induce her to remain there with Osmond. Nevertheless she felt an immense desire to hear that Isabel would go to England. [...] "Nothing's impossible for you, my dear," [...] she said caressingly. [...] "Why <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> rich and clever and good?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{does not}} its {{structure}} announce an author? [...] "No; {{you do not}} see who nor what he is. Who told you that the order you admire here belies itself nowhere <b>else?</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> allowed to conclude from a point in space to infinite space? You pile a vast piece of ground with earth-heaps thrown here or there by chance, but among which the worm and the ant find convenient dwelling-places enough. What would you think of these insects, if, reasoning after your fashion, they fell into raptures over the intelligence of the gardener who had arranged all these materials so delightfully for their convenience?"[49] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You seem fairly {{at home in}} exile," [...] I answered, [...] "and Florence {{seems to}} me a very pretty Siberia. But do you know my own thought? Nothing is so idle as to talk about our want of a nutritive soil, of opportunity, of inspiration, {{and all the rest of}} it. The worthy part is to do {{something}} fine! There is no law in our glorious Constitution against that. Invent, create, achieve! No matter if you have to study fifty times as much as one of these! What <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> an artist for? Be you our Moses," [...] I added, laughing, and laying my hand on his shoulder, [...] "and lead us out of the house of bondage!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is easily answered. Were you your own dear self it would matter nought to me were your name Kerr, or MacDougall, or Comyn, or aught <b>else.</b> It <b>is</b> <b>you</b> I love, and your ancestors or your relations {{matter to me}} not one single jot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{she used}} to pretend she did not believe you would. But I knew better. I knew that when she said, over and over again, 'Is my father never coming for me?' she was {{thinking}} of somebody <b>else.</b> And <b>are</b> <b>you</b> come to take her away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} allowed Mr. Miller to run after me, as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> pleased to term it," [...] {{retorted}} Betty with indignation. [...] "I {{do not like}} him. I never see him any more unless you or Bessie or some one <b>else</b> <b>is</b> present. <b>You</b> know that. I cannot prevent him from walking to church with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bender {{took another}} view. [...] "Why, I got right up myself--a little more and I'd almost {{have begun to}} paw it! He got me quite interested"--the {{proprietor}} of the picture would perhaps care to know--"in that Moretto." [...] And it was on these lines that Mr. Bender continued to advance. [...] "I take it that your biggest value, however, Lord Theign, is your splendid Sir Joshua. Our friend there {{has a great deal}} to say about that too--but it didn't lead to our moving any more furniture." [...] On which he paused as to enjoy, with a show of his fine teeth, his host's reassurance. [...] "It has yet, my impression of that picture, sir, led to something <b>else.</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> prepared, Lord Theign, to entertain a proposition?" ...|$|E
60|$|What is said {{in these}} few pages may be objected to as vague; {{it is no}} more vague than the {{position}} seemed to me to demand. Each man must judge for himself what it behoves him to do at this juncture, and the whole Church for herself. All that is intended in this appeal is to begin, in a tone of dignity and disinterestedness, the consideration of the question; for when such matters are much pulled about in public prints, and have been often discussed from many different, and not always from very high, points of view, there is ever a tendency that the decision of the parties may contract some taint of meanness from the spirit of their critics. All that is desired is to press upon you, as ministers of the Church of Scotland, some sense of the high expectation with which your country looks to you at this time; and how many reasons there are that you should show an example of signal disinterestedness and zeal in the encouragement that you give to returning brethren. For, first, it lies with you to clear the Church from the discredit of our miserable contentions; and surely you can never have a fairer opportunity to improve her claim to the style of a peacemaker. Again, it lies with you, as I have said, to take the first step, and prove your own true ardour for an honourable union; and how <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to prove it? It lies with you, moreover, to justify {{in the eyes of the}} world the time you have been enjoying your benefices, while these others have voluntarily shut themselves out from all participation in their convenience; and how <b>else</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to convince the world that there was not something of selfishness in your motives? It lies with you, lastly, to keep your example unspotted before your congregations; and I do not know how better you are to do that.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is a {{piece of}} good fortune that I hardly hoped for," [...] said Hardyman, his cool, quiet, dreary way of {{speaking}} quickened as usual, in Isabel's presence. [...] "I only got back from France this morning, and I called on Lady Lydiard in the hope of seeing you. She was not at home--and you were in the country--and the servants didn't know the address. I could get nothing out of them, except that you were on a visit to a relation." [...] He looked at Moody while he was speaking. [...] "Haven't I seen you before?" [...] he said, carelessly. [...] "Yes; at Lady Lydiard's. You're her steward, are you not? How d'ye do?" [...] Moody, with h is eyes on the ground, answered silently by a bow. Hardyman, perfectly indifferent whether Lady Lydiard's steward spoke or not, turned on his saddle and looked admiringly at Isabel. [...] "I begin to think I am a lucky man at last," [...] he went on with a smile. [...] "I was jogging along to my farm, and despairing of ever seeing Miss Isabel again--and Miss Isabel herself meets me at the roadside! I wonder whether you are as glad to see me as I am to see you? You won't tell me--eh? May I ask you something <b>else?</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> staying in our neighborhood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But there <b>is</b> {{something}} <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> wishing for, {{is there}} not? I fancy every officer and {{man in the}} regiment is wishing for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{certainly}} shall take {{no notice}} of such folly,' said Mr. Kendal, 'and I wish {{that no one}} <b>else</b> should. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> about, Sophia?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} very sorry to attempt it," [...] said the Madonna with unusual frigidity. [...] "If you knew some one <b>else</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} of <b>you,</b> would you think of him?" ...|$|R
