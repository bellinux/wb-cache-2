50|$|Canalization secures a {{definite}} available depth for navigation; and {{the discharge of}} the river generally is amply sufficient for maintaining the <b>impounded</b> <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> {{as well as providing}} the necessary water for locking. Navigation, however, is liable to be stopped during the descent of high floods, which in many cases rise above the locks; and it is necessarily arrested in cold climates on all rivers by long, severe frosts, and especially by ice. Many small rivers, like the Thames above its tidal limit, have been rendered navigable by canalization, and several fairly large rivers have thereby provided a good depth for vessels for considerable distances inland. Thus the canalized Seine has secured a navigable depth of 10 feet (3.2 metres) from its tidal limit up to Paris, a distance of 135 miles, and a depth of 6 feet (2.06 metres) up to Montereau, 62 miles higher up.|$|E
50|$|Flushing Creek once rose in {{the present-day}} {{neighborhood}} of Kew Gardens Hills, where Vleigh Place traces the Vleigh (old Dutch for Valley) of the headwaters. In the larger valley that comprises the present-day Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, the creek meandered through salt marshes, collecting water from Fly and Ireland Creeks and Horse Brook before emptying into Flushing Bay on the East River. The Flushing River, from the Water Gate buildings in Flushing Meadow Park, is measured about 200 feet wide with a depth of about 15 feet and marsh river mud bottom. This tide, or water gate, acts as a dam to maintain the water surface moving upstream at a constant level, while the downstream side does not permit inflow even when the surface is raised above the <b>impounded</b> <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> The area {{near the mouth of}} the creek became the site of the early Flushing settlement.|$|E

The estimates ranged from 0. 13 to 447 YOY bass per hectare (average 121). Significant positive correlations were obtained for the relation between year-class strength and <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> change in <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> and turbidity; significant negative correlations were obtained between year-class strength and water hardness, alkalinity, and pH.

40|$|Significant hazards {{may occur}} due to large landslide-dams formed by {{earthquake}} induced landslides. Those landslide-dams present serious threats to both life and property from possible upstream flooding when the <b>impounded</b> lake <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises, and possible dam failure and downstream flooding with rapid release of <b>impounded</b> <b>water.</b> In {{order to prevent}} those secondary disasters, we made an assumption that the landslide-dams are only formed when {{a large amount of}} landslide deposits directly rush into a river with moderate or high-velocities. Then a practical prediction method is presented to extract the dangerous slopes which are thought as the sources of earthquake induced landslide-dams. The prediction procedure consists of the following steps: (1) identification of all the slopes using spatial statistics; (2) the extraction of potential slopes according to our assumption using three spatial relation filters; (3) stability analysis to determine landslide prone slopes and volume estimation of potential landslide deposits using Limit Equilibrium Analysis. (4) susceptibility mapping by ranking the exact slopes. This method has been used to extract slopes those are potential to collapse and form landslide-dams in the catchment of Tongkou river after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, China.

40|$|AbstractThe {{reservoir}} sediment {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} which hindered the effective implementation of the comprehensive benefits of the Three Gorges Project. The preliminary impounding was carried out in the June of 2003. The environmental effect caused by the impounding is a social focus. The primary objective of this paper is to analysis the sediment of the Three Gorges Reservoir based on the observation. After preliminary <b>impounding</b> the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> of the reservoir has been raised and the flow velocity has been reduced. The character of the hydrology and sediment of the river within the reservoir has also been changed. Then the changes have great influence on the sediment deposition and erosion, riverbed geometry, flow velocity and flow condition. In order to solve problems mentioned above, the sediment prototype observation in the reservoir was performed and the results were analyzed intensively. There are a total of 45 observation stations were employed to work in this research in the upstream and downstream of the reservoir. Firstly, the hydrological character before and after impounding was observed respectively. Secondly, the sedimentation pattern of the reservoir and variable backwater area was analyses. Thirdly, the water surface slope roughness and silt was calculated and validated. Based on the observation and analyses, it is found that the effect of the sediment and change of the riverbed in the reservoir is little and can be controlled. The analysis method and research results can be helpful for the environmental assessment of other great project...|$|R

40|$|During summer drought, Mediterranean fluvial {{networks}} are transformed into highly heterogeneous landscapes characterized by different environments (i. e., running and <b>impounded</b> <b>waters,</b> isolated river pools and dry beds). This hydrological setting defines novel biogeochemically active areas {{that could potentially}} increase the rates of carbon emissions from the fluvial network to the atmosphere. Using chamber methods, we aimed to identify hot spots for carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) emissions from two typical Mediterranean fluvial networks during summer drought. The CO 2 efflux from dry beds (mean ± SE = 209 ± 10 mmolCO 2 m- 2 d- 1) was comparable to that from running waters (120 ± 33 mmol m- 2 d- 1) and significantly higher than from <b>impounded</b> <b>waters</b> (36. 6 ± 8. 5 mmol m- 2 d- 1) and isolated pools (17. 2 ± 0. 9 mmol m- 2 d- 1). In contrast, the CH 4 efflux did not significantly differ among environments, although the CH 4 efflux was notable in some <b>impounded</b> <b>waters</b> (13. 9 ± 10. 1 mmol CH 4 m- 2 d- 1) and almost negligible in the remaining environments (mean. 3 mmol m- 2 d- 1). Diffusion was the only mechanism driving CO 2 efflux in all environments and was most likely responsible for CH 4 efflux in running waters, isolated pools and dry beds. In contrast, the CH 4 efflux in <b>impounded</b> <b>waters</b> was primarily ebullition-based. Using a simple heuristic approach to simulate potential changes in carbon emissions from Mediterranean fluvial networks under future hydrological scenarios, we show that an extreme drying out (i. e., a four-fold increase of the surface area of dry beds) would double the CO 2 efflux from the fluvial network. Correspondingly, an extreme transformation of running <b>waters</b> into <b>impounded</b> <b>waters</b> (i. e., a twofold increase of the surface area of <b>impounded</b> <b>waters)</b> would triple the CH 4 efflux. Thus, carbon emissions from dry beds and <b>impounded</b> <b>waters</b> should be explicitly considered in carbon assessments of fluvial networks, particularly under predicted global change scenarios, which are expected to increase the spatial and temporal extent of these environmentsThis research {{was funded by the}} Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the projects CGL 2011 - 30474 -C 02 - 01 and CGL 2014 - 58760 -C 3 - 1 -...|$|R
