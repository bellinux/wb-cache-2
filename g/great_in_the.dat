5|$|Castell y Bere is a Welsh castle near Llanfihangel-y-pennant in Gwynedd, Wales. Constructed by Llywelyn the <b>Great</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1220s, {{the stone}} castle was {{intended}} to maintain his authority over the local people and to defend the south-west part of the princedom of Gwynedd. In 1282 war with Edward I of England resulted {{in the death of}} Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and Castell y Bere fell to English forces. Edward I expanded the castle further and established a small town beside it. In 1294 the Welsh leader Madoc ap Llywelyn mounted a major revolt and the castle was besieged and apparently burnt. Edward did not repair it and it became ruined. Today it {{is in the hands of}} Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Class {{differences}} were not as <b>great</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vendée as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural Vendée, the local nobility {{seems to have been}} more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France. Alexis de Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée. Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.|$|E
5|$|Farewell Great Macedon (also {{known as}} Alexander the <b>Great</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> script's early stages) was a six-part story pitched for Season 1 and {{was written by}} Moris Farhi.

The script was published by Nothing at the End of the Lane in October 2009. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010.|$|E

Several examples of capitals displaying Ionic influences can be seen as far as Patna, especially with the Pataliputra capital, dated to the 3rd century BC.

Similarly, the average number of questions asked (per group) via Chat Box during the online concept mapping activity also was almost 2.5 times <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> High Performance groups compared with the Low Performance groups. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same way, the average number of written sentences addressed to the whole group was 1.5 times <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> High Performance groups while the average number of written sentences addressed to a specific person was 17 times <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Low Performance groups. The average number of both encouragements and acknowledgements written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sentences was more than two times <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> High Performance groups compared with the Low Performance groups.

5|$|The 1966–67 season proved {{frustrating}} for United, despite {{the introduction of}} another club <b>great</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of Eddie Gray. Leeds finished fourth, five points behind champions Manchester United, and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals after defeat to Chelsea. They made progress in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, beating DWS (Netherlands), Valencia, Bologna (Italy) and Kilmarnock (Scotland) to reach the final, where they were beaten 2–0 on aggregate by Yugoslavian outfit Dinamo Zagreb. At {{the end of the}} season he was named as the Footballer of the Year, succeeding his brother who had won it the previous year. During the award ceremony he told a number of amusing stories and won a standing ovation from the crowd, this started him on a successful sideline as an after-dinner speaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{consumption}} of aviation gasoline during combat and resupply operations was so <b>great</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early {{phase of the}} war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it {{became one of the}} more serious logistical problems facing UN planners. Ocean tankers could rarely keep pace with the rate of consumption. Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its air operations, on several occasion the situation became quite dire, and was only rectified by the rapid procurement of supplies from Japan. On a number of occasions throughout the war, the demand of military consumption had the effect of leaving Japanese gas stations with no fuel to sell to the public.|$|E
5|$|The ROK {{disorganization}} was so <b>great</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face {{of continued}} North Korean pressure that Task Force Jackson could not launch its planned attack. The US 21st Infantry {{was in an}} assembly area north of An'gang-ni and ready for an attack {{the morning of the}} 28th, but during the night the ROK 17th Regiment lost its position on the high ridge northward at the bend of the Kigye valley, and the attack was canceled. The South Koreans regained their position in the afternoon but that night lost it again. At the same time, elements of the NK 5th Division penetrated the ROK 3rd Division southwest of P'ohang-dong. Coulter directed the 21st Infantry to repel this penetration. During the day on August 29, B Company, 21st Infantry, supported by a platoon of tanks of B Company, 73rd Medium Tank Battalion, successfully counterattacked northwest from the southern edge of P'ohang-dong for a distance of , with South Korean troops following. The American units then withdrew to P'ohang-dong. That night the ROK's withdrew, and the next day an American infantry-tank force repeated the action of the day before. The 21st Infantry then took over from the ROK 3rd Division a sector extending north and northwest of P'ohang-dong.|$|E

5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as <b>great</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|The co-rule between Eystein, Sigurd and Olaf entailed {{a shared}} kingship, and the kingdom itself was not divided into fixed borders. During {{the early years}} of their reign, Eystein is {{nonetheless}} said to have stayed mostly in Western Norway and Trøndelag, while Sigurd was in Viken. In practice, only Eystein and Sigurd ever ruled as kings, as Olaf was considerably younger and died when he was only seventeen years old, and virtually nothing is known about him beyond his name. One of the earliest acts by the kings was passing a retterbot, a special law ordained by the king, which among other things abolished various royal taxes that originated from the Danish rule of Sweyn Knutsson and Ælfgifu (under Cnut the <b>Great)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1030s. The kings became very popular because of this. According to some sources, the main motivation for abolishing the taxes was to gain the support of the population for Sigurd's planned crusade.|$|E
