25|$|Borazon, a {{boron nitride}} allotrope, {{is the fourth}} hardest substance, after {{aggregated}} diamond nanorods, ultrahard <b>fullerite,</b> and diamond, and the third hardest artificial material. Borazon is a crystal created by heating equal quantities of boron and nitrogen at temperatures greater than 1800 °Celsius, 3300 °Fahrenheit at 7 gigapascal 1 millionpound-force per square inch. Borazon was first invented in 1957 by Robert H. Wentorf, Jr., a physical chemist working for the General Electric Company. In 1969, General Electric adopted the name Borazon as its trademark for the crystal.|$|E

In another method, <b>fullerite</b> is compressed to lower pressures (2-20 GPa) and then heated to a temperature {{in the range of}} 300 to 2500 K. Extreme hardness of what now appears likely to have been nanodiamonds was reported by researchers in the 1990s.

We have used the intermolecular potential of Girifalco with parameters recently calculated for these fullerenes.

50|$|Helium {{can form}} {{intercalation}} compounds with the fullerites, including buckminsterfullerene C60 and C70. In solid C60 there are {{spaces between the}} C60 balls, either tetrahedral or octahedral in shape. Helium can diffuse into the solid <b>fullerite</b> even at one atmosphere pressure. Helium enters the lattice in two stages. The first rapid stage takes a couple of days, and expands the lattice by 0.16% (that is 0.022 Å) filling the larger octahedral sites. The second stage takes thousands of hours to absorb more helium and expands the lattice twice as much again (0.32%) filling the tetrahedaral sites. However the solid C60•3He is not stable and loses helium on a timescale of 340 hours when not under a helium atmosphere. When the helium intercalated <b>fullerite</b> is cooled, it has an orientational phase transition that is 10K higher than for pure solid C60. The actual discontinuous change in volume at that point is smaller, {{but there are more}} rapid changes near the transition temperature, perhaps due to varying occupancy of the voids by helium.|$|E
50|$|Other very {{important}} considerations are price and availability. Diamond, {{for a long}} time considered the hardest substance in existence, is actually softer than <b>fullerite</b> and even harder aggregated diamond nanorods, both of which have been synthesised in laboratories but no commercial process has yet been developed. Diamond itself is expensive due to scarcity in nature and the cost of synthesising it. Bauxite is a very common ore which, along with corundum's reasonably high hardness, contributes to corundum's status as a common, inexpensive abrasive.|$|E

He also co-developed a new in-situ mechanical testing device for measuring the tensile response of bundles of SWCNTs and individual MWCNTs inside of a scanning electron microscope. This work has yielded important insights into the mechanics and tribology of these systems, and suggested the possibility of very low friction linear bearings.

40|$|Electron-phonon {{coupling}} directly {{determines the}} stability of cooperative order in solids, including superconductivity, charge and spin density waves. Therefore, the ability to enhance or reduce electron-phonon coupling by optical driving may open up new possibilities to steer materials' functionalities, potentially at high speeds. Here we explore the response of bilayer graphene to dynamical modulation of the lattice, achieved by driving optically-active in-plane bond stretching vibrations with femtosecond mid-infrared pulses. The driven state is studied by two different ultrafast spectroscopic techniques. Firstly, TeraHertz time-domain spectroscopy reveals that the Drude scattering rate decreases upon driving. Secondly, the relaxation rate of hot quasi-particles, as measured by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, increases. These two independent observations are quantitatively consistent {{with one another and}} can be explained by a transient three-fold enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling constant.

40|$|A simple, yet {{accurate}} {{solution of}} the electron–phonon coupling problem in C 60 is presented.

This parametrization allows for an economic determination of the deformation potential associated with the fullerene’s normal modes. The resulting electron–phonon coupling constants are used to calculate Jahn–Teller effects in C − 60, and multiple satellite peaks in the corresponding photoemission reaction.
