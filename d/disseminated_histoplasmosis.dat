50|$|Within the phagosome {{the fungus}} has an {{absolute}} requirement for thiamine.Cell-mediated immunity for histoplasmosis develops within 2 weeks. If {{the patient has}} strong cellular immunity, macrophages, epithelial cells and lymphocytes surround the organisms and contain them, and eventually calcify. In immunocompromised individuals, the organisms disseminate to different organs such as bone, spleen, liver, adrenal glands and mucocutaneous membranes, resulting in progressive <b>disseminated</b> <b>histoplasmosis.</b> Chronic lung disease can manifest.|$|E
50|$|If {{symptoms}} of histoplasmosis infection occur, they will start within 3 to 17 days after exposure; {{the average is}} 12-14 days. Most affected individuals have clinically silent manifestations and show no apparent ill effects. The acute phase of histoplasmosis is characterized by non-specific respiratory symptoms, often cough or flu-like. Chest X-ray findings are normal in 40-70% of cases.

40|$|The {{published}} reports {{of patients with}} the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with <b>disseminated</b> <b>histoplasmosis</b> come mostly from institutions located in endemic areas for histoplasmosis, where disease is thought to occur by either primary infection or reactivation. The characteristics of reactivation disease are not well delineated. We describe the clinical features of reactivation <b>disseminated</b> <b>histoplasmosis</b> in 46 residents of San Francisco, California, with AIDS who did not report recent travel to an area endemic for histoplasmosis. Patients presented with illness lasting days to months, manifested most frequently by fever, chills, sweats, cough or dyspnea, gastrointestinal complaints, malaise, and weight loss. Physical examination and imaging studies were notable for hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or abnormal pulmonary findings {{in more than half}} of patients. Laboratory studies revealed a high rate of cytopenia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, abnormal liver function test values, respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia, and a median CD 4 lymphocyte count of 36 x 10 (9) per liter. The clinical presentation of reactivation <b>disseminated</b> <b>histoplasmosis</b> in patients with AIDS living in San Francisco {{is similar to that of}} <b>disseminated</b> <b>histoplasmosis</b> reported in patients with AIDS living in endemic areas.

The fungus, originally {{thought to be a}} Sepedonium sp. due to the large sized, hyaline or brownish colored tuberculated macroconidia and to lack of dimorphism (yeast form at 37 °C) produce H and M antigens, visualized by the immunodiffusion with rabbit anti-Histoplasma capsulatum hyperimmune serum. Patient?s serum sample was non reactive with H. capsulatum antigen by immunodiffusion, counterimmunoelectrophoresis and complement fixation tests, and immunoenzymatic assay failed to detect the specific circulating antigen.

40|$|Histoplasmosis, a {{systemic}} mycosis {{caused by the}} dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum and Histoplasma capsulatum var duboisii is endemic to {{many parts of the}} world. The clinical manifestations range from acute or chronic pulmonary infection to a progressive disseminated disease. After initial exposure to the fungus, the infection is self-limited and restricted to the lungs in 99 % of healthy individuals. The remaining 1 %, however, progress to either disseminated or chronic disease involving the lungs, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow or rarely, the skin and mucous membranes. Mucocutaneous histoplasmosis is frequently reported in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but it is rare in immunocompetent hosts. A 60 -year-old male presented with asymptomatic swelling of the hard palate and crusted papules and nodules over the extremities, face and trunk. Clinically, the diagnoses of cutaneous cryptococcosis versus histoplasmosis was considered in this patient. A chest X-ray revealed hilar lymphadenopathy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was nonreactive. Skin biopsy revealed multiple tiny intracellular round yeast forms with a halo in the mid-dermis. Culture of the skin biopsy in Sabouraud′s dextrose agar showed colonies of Histoplasma capsulatum. Despite an investigation including no evidence of underlying immunosuppression was found, he was started on IV amphotericin-B (0. 5 mg/kg/day).

40|$|Histoplasmosis is a {{fungal disease}} {{caused by the}} dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, {{recognized}} as an AIDS-defining illness since the Center for Disease Control’s revision criteria in 1985.

Serum antibodies and/or antigen research can make diagnosis, but the demonstration of the agent by culture or histopathological examination remains the gold standard methods. Co-infections in patients with AIDS are well known; however, reports on <b>disseminated</b> tuberculosis and <b>histoplasmosis</b> are scarce.

Incidental finding of yeast forms within the leukocytes during a routine blood cell count highlighted the diagnosis of histoplasmosis.

40|$|Introduction The {{distribution}} of infection by Histoplasma capsulatum in Brazil is heterogeneous, {{and the number}} of cases affecting immunocompetent individuals is relatively small. This study reports the epidemiological and clinical data regarding histoplasmosis in non-immunosuppressed individuals. Methods The study included only the immunocompetent patients with histoplasmosis who were diagnosed between 1970 and 2012 at a university hospital located in Ribeir&# 227;o Preto, State of S&# 227;o Paulo, Brazil. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected retrospectively from the patient records. Results Of the 123 patients analyzed, 95 had an active disease that manifested in the different clinical forms of histoplasmosis. Men were the predominant gender, and most patients resided in the Northeast of the State of S&# 227;o Paulo and in the nearby municipalities of the State of Minas Gerais. The risk factors for acquiring histoplasmosis and prolonged contact in a rural environment were recorded in 43. 9 % and 82. 9 % of cases, respectively. Smoking, alcoholism, and comorbidity rates were high among the patients with the chronic pulmonary and subacute/chronic <b>disseminated</b> forms of <b>histoplasmosis.</b> Many patients achieved clinical cure spontaneously, but 58. 9 % required antifungals; the disease lethality rate was 5. 3 %.
