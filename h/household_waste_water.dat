40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to examine the}} flows of nitrogen and phosphorus in the Forshällaån watershed, which covers an area of 27, 4 km 2 and is situated between Uddevalla and Ljungskile in the province of Göteborgs- and Bohuslän, in southwest Sweden, latitude 58 ° 18 ' N and longitude 11 ° 56 ' E. 28 % of the watershed is agricultural land, the remaining is forest and some unproductive areas with bare bedrock. The dominant soil types on the agricultural land are sandy loam, silty loam and clay loams, but sand and clay also occur. The forested areas are located on shallow morainic tills in higher areas. Average annual precipitation and runoff are 900 mm and 425 mm respectively. Nitrogen deposition is estimated at 20 kg ha - 1 year - 1. For the calculations, results from literature studies, interviews with farmers and estimations of plant nutrient balances on the farms in the watershed and an inventory of the <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> systems made by the Uddevalla community have been used. Total leaching from the forest area (1960 ha) was estimated to 5. 9 Mg N and 0, 08 Mg P year - 1, viz 3 kg N and 0, 04 kg P ha -l year -l, but these figures are fairly approximate. With an increase in N-leaching of 1 kg ha -l year -l the total leaching from forest land would reach 7, 9 Mg year -l. The agricultural land (458 ha) contributes with approximately 4. 8 Mg N each year, which is 44 %, of the total nitrogen loss. Thus, the agricultural land is the most important source of nitrogen losses. Extensively used agricultural areas (320 ha) contributes with approximately l. 3 Mg N year - 1. These estimations have been done with good precision. It is difficult to give a precise figure on the contribution of erosion to N and P losses. Estimates of the nutrient losses caused by erosion have been made only for agricultural land with annual crops (200 ha). The estimated losses of P and N are about 0. 20 and 0, 8 Mg per year, respectively. Phosphorus is lost mainly through <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water,</b> which contributes with 0. 52 Mg per year or 65 % of the total losses. Nitrogen lost from <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> is calculated to about 1. 9 Mg per year. In the forest areas large clear cuts and ruts should be avoided in order to reduce leaching of plant nutrients. In cultivated areas, fertilizing should be adapted to the uptake by tile crops and the manure should be spread over the whole area. Fallow should be avoided. Ploughing should be done as late as possible, preferably in the spring, and in direction perpendicular to the slope. Concerning tile <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> the best for the water quality would be to use moulder toilets whenever possible...|$|E

The system is set up like a wagon-wheel and at the centre, or hub, is a 200 litre (44 gallon) drum. An outlet {{from the base of}} the drum leads into a plastic pipe which goes completely round the drum. Leading off the central pipe (like wheel spokes) are four- metre long pipes laid out to water the beds. Holes are drilled in these lateral pipes every 30 cm so that water will drip out and water the crops growing alongside. To prevent the holes getting blocked a piece of string is threaded through the holes and knotted at each end. Pulling the string back and forth unblocks the holes. The irrigator can be modified to have parallel lines of pipes, or increased with a further circle outside the first ring. The system is particularly effective if the water is brackish, as drip-irrigation systems are the best way to utilize poor quality water. Wagon-wheel irrigator for small gardens The irrigator will water 18 square metres of garden. Where it is necessary to water the vegetables three times a week, water consumption will be about 600 litres, and that will be sufficient to produce about 500 kg of vegetables a year. The irrigator is being used by communities in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa in an arid area which has less than 250 mm rainfall per annum and where all-year-round vegetable production has not previously been possible.

The scenario is described for waste management, production processes and design of product, energy system, use of compost in agriculture. The period of projection is 60 years, as it is considered important to allow for ample time for behavior change. The target state described is equivalent to a 80 - 100 percent reduction of emissions of the selected substances. On the basis of action theory, the potentials for innovation and change of the main actors (private households, economy, state) are examined, and the impending innovation processes {{in the direction of}} the target state are described.

Anxiously wells water quality reduction {{will happen in}} consequences frombad sanitation, like <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> seepage, chemistries cesspool, laundry, etc. This research applied comparatively descriptive characteristic approach quantitative method. Well water wassample taken from 9 units on February and 9 units on April 2008. Sample unit was taken by purposive sampling methodfor excavated wells and random sampling method for water sample. Analysis result for well water was compared withquality standard of Bali Governor regulation No. 8 ‘ 2007 and with quality standard of Health Minister RepublicIndonesian Rule No. 907 ‘ 2002 and also pollution index according to Minister of Alive Environment Decision No. 115 ‘ 2003. Water quality was calculated based on pollution index correlated with physical environment condition withSpearmen test (Rho) and measuring society behaviour by Sturges. Research result shows that in February for parameter BOD, Fe and total coliform slightly exceeded water qualitystandard and in April 2008 for parameter DO, BOD, Fe and total coliform slightly exceeded water quality standard class Iand drinking water quality standard. Pollution Index (IP) with result for all well water researched is under 5 (five) that is(1 < IP ? 5) classified is low pollution. By using Spearmen analysis, so that alternative hypothesis unaccepted, wellphysical environment condition (IS) not in correlated to excavated wells water standard quality with Rho (?) 0, 147 andsignificance 0, 705 more than ? 5 %.

40|$|Shortages in {{supply of}} {{nutrients}} and freshwater {{for a growing}} human population are critical global issues. Traditional centralized sewage treatment can prevent eutrophication and provide sanitation, but is neither efficient nor sustainable in terms of water and resources. Source separation of household wastes, combined with decentralized resource recovery, presents a novel approach to solve these issues. Urine contains within 1 % of <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> up to 80 % of the nitrogen (N) and 50 % of the phosphorus (P). Since microalgae are efficient at nutrient uptake, growing these organisms in urine might be a promising technology to concomitantly clean urine and produce valuable biomass containing the major plant nutrients. While state-of-the-art suspension systems for algal cultivation have mayor shortcomings in their application, immobilized cultivation on Porous Substrate Photobioreactors (PSBRs) might be a feasible alternative. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a robust process for nutrient recovery from minimally diluted human urine using microalgae on PSBRs. The green alga Desmodesmus abundans strain CCAC 3496 was chosen for its good growth, after screening 96 algal strains derived from urine-specific isolations and culture collections. Treatment of urine, 1 : 1 diluted with tap water and without addition of nutrients, was performed at a light intensity of 600 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1 with 2. 5 % CO 2 and at pH 6. 5. A growth rate of 7. 2 g dry weight m-² day- 1 and removal efficiencies for N and P of 13. 1 % and 94. 1 %, respectively, were determined. Pre-treatment of urine with activated carbon was found to eliminate possible detrimental effects of pharmaceuticals. These results provide a basis for further development of the technology at pilot-scale. If found to be safe in terms human and environmental health, the biomass produced from three persons could provide the P for annual production of 31 kg wheat grain and 16 kg soybean, covering the caloric demand in food for almost one month of the year for such a household. In combination with other technologies, PSBRs could thus be applied in a decentralized resource recovery system, contributing to locally close the link between sanitation and food production...|$|E
