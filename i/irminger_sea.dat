40|$|In {{the process}} of open-ocean {{convection}} in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean, surface water sinks to depth as a distinct water mass, the characteristics of which affect the meridional overturning circulation and oceanic heat flux. In addition, carbon is sequestered from {{the atmosphere in the}} process. In recent years, this convection has been shallow or non-existent, which could be construed as a consequence of a warmer climate. Here we document the return of deep convection to the subpolar gyre in both the Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>seas</b> in the winter of 2007 – 2008. We use profiling float data from the Argo programme to document deep mixing. Analysis of a variety of in situ, satellite and reanalysis data shows that contrary to expectations the transition to a convective state took place abruptly, without going through a phase of preconditioning. Changes in hemispheric air temperature, storm tracks, the flux of fresh water to the Labrador Sea and the distribution of pack ice all contributed to an enhanced flux of heat from the sea to the air, making the surface water sufficiently cold and dense to initiate deep convection. Given this complexity, we conclude that {{it will be difficult to}} predict when deep mixing may occur again. The subpolar North Atlantic Ocean is a critical component of the global climate system. Deep convection in the Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>seas</b> produces the water mass known as Labrador Sea Water (LSW (ref. 1)).

40|$|The Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) {{along the}} western margin of the subpolar North Atlantic is an {{important}} component of the deep limb of the Meridional Overturning near its northern origins. A network of moored arrays from Denmark Strait to the tail of the Grand Banks has been installed for almost two decades to observe the boundary currents and transports of North Atlantic Deep Water as part of an internationally coordinated observatory for the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The dominant variability in all of the moored velocity time series is in the week-to-month period range. While the temporal characteristics of this variability change only gradually between Denmark Strait and Flemish Cap, a broad band of longer term variability is present farther along the path of the DWBC at the Grand Banks and in the interior basins (Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>Seas).</b> The vigorous intra-seasonal variability may well mask possible interannual to decadal variability that is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the high frequency fluctuations. Here, the intra-seasonal variability is quantified at key positions along the DWBC path using both, observations and high resolution model data. The results are used to evaluate the model circulation, and in turn the model is used to relate the discrete measurements to the overall pattern of the subpolar circulation. Topographic waves are found to be trapped by the steep topography all around the western basins, the Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>Seas.</b> In the Labrador Sea, the high intra-seasonal variability of the boundary current regime is separated by a region of extremely low variability in narrow recirculation cells from the basin interior.

40|$|A May 2008 {{oceanographic survey}} of the Labrador Sea and recent Argo float {{profiles}} have revealed that convective overturning extended {{to a depth of}} about 1600 m during the winter of 2008, resulting in the production of a large “year class” of Labrador Sea Water.

We used a simple index for identifying MCAOs: the vertical potential temperature gradient between the sea surface and 700 hPa. It was found that atmospheric temperature variability is considerably more important than the sea surface temperature variability in governing both the seasonal and the inter-annual variability of MCAOs. Furthermore, a composite analysis revealed that a few well-defined and robust synoptic patterns are evident during MCAOs in winter.

40|$|Deep {{convection}} in the Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>Seas</b> inflates {{the cold}} and low-saline subpolar gyre, which is a rich nutrient and zooplankton source for the surrounding warmer waters of subtropical origin. The zooplankton abundances on the south Iceland shelf show characteristic sub-decadal variability, which closely reflect the oceanic abundances of the ecologically most important zooplankton species – Calanus finmarchicus. Much higher abundances of this species are observed during years when the winter mixed layer depths (MLD) in the Labrador-Irminger Sea, and over the Reykjanes Ridge are deep. Furthermore, a tight relationship is identified between on-shelf zooplankton abundances and lateral shifts of the biologically productive subarctic front southwest of Iceland. Thus, we suggest that northeastward expansion of the subpolar gyre results in biologically productive periods in the waters southwest of Iceland – both oceanic and on the shelf. In addition to local atmospheric forcing, {{we find that the}} MLD and frontal position are also impacted by remote heat losses and convection in the Labrador Sea, through northward advection of unstable mode waters. The sub-decadal oceanic and on-shelf biological production peaks are possibly predictable by half a year (local winter convection to subsequent summer production), and the advective time-lag from the Labrador Sea might induce an even longer predictability horizon (up to 1. 5 years). © 201...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} mechanisms for the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) variability at 26. 5 ° N (other than the Ekman component) {{that can be}} related to external forcings, in particular wind variability. Resolution dependence is studied using identical experiments with 1 ° and 1 / 4 ° NEMO model runs over 1960 – 2010. The analysis shows that much of the variability in the AMOC at 26 ° N {{can be related to}} the wind strength over the North Atlantic, through mechanisms lagged on different timescales. At ~ 1 -year lag the January–June difference of mean sea level pressure between high and mid-latitudes in the North Atlantic explains 35 – 50 % of the interannual AMOC variability (with negative correlation between wind strength and AMOC). At longer lead timescales ~ 4 years, strong (weak) winds over the northern North Atlantic (specifically linked to the NAO index) are followed by higher (lower) AMOC transport, but this mechanism only works in the 1 / 4 ° model. Analysis of the density correlations suggests an increase (decrease) in deep water formation in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre to be the cause. Therefore another 30 % of the AMOC variability at 26 ° N can be related to density changes in the top 1000 m in the Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>seas</b> occurring ~ 4 years earlier...|$|R

40|$|The {{variability}} of the Atlantic meridional overturing circulation (AMOC) strength is investigated in control experiments and in transient simulations {{of up to}} the last millennium using the low-resolution Community Climate System Model version 3. In the transient simulations the AMOC exhibits enhanced low-frequency variability that is mainly caused by infrequent transitions between two semi-stable circulation states which amount to a 10 percent change of the maximum overturning. One transition is also found in a control experiment, but the time-varying external forcing significantly increases the probability of the occurrence of such events though not having a direct, linear impact on the AMOC. The transition from a high to a low AMOC state starts with a reduction of the convection in the Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>Seas</b> and goes along with a changed barotropic circulation of both gyres in the North Atlantic and a gradual strengthening of the convection in the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) Seas. In contrast, the transition from a weak to a strong overturning is induced by decreased mixing in the GIN Seas. As a consequence of the transition, regional sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are found in the midlatitude North Atlantic and in the convection regions with an amplitude of up to 3 K. The atmospheric response to the SST forcing associated with the transition indicates {{a significant impact on the}} Scandinavian surface air temperature (SAT) in the order of 1 K. Thus, the changes of the ocean circulation make a major contribution to the Scandinavian SAT variability in the last millennium...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} global mean {{temperature}} (GMT) change is calculated by regressing local surface air temperature (SAT) to GMT for an ensemble of CMIP 5 models and for observations over the last 132 years. Calculations {{are based on the}} historical period and climate change scenarios. As in the observations the warming pattern contains a warming hole over the subpolar North Atlantic. Using a bivariate regression of SAT to GMT and an index of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), the warming pattern is decomposed in a radiatively forced part and an AMOC fingerprint. The North Atlantic warming hole is associated with a decline of the AMOC. The AMOC fingerprint resembles Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), but details of the pattern change when the AMOC decline increases, underscoring the nonlinearity in the response. The warming hole is situated south of deep convection sites, indicating that it involves an adjustment of the gyre circulation, although {{it should be noted that}} some models feature deep convection in the middle of the subpolar gyre. The warming hole is already prominent in historical runs, where the response of the AMOC to GMT is weak, which suggests that it is involved in an ocean adjustment that precedes the AMOC decline. In the more strongly forced scenario runs, the warming hole over the subpolar gyre becomes weaker, while cooling over the Nordic seas increases, consistent with previous findings that deep convection in the Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>Seas</b> is more vulnerable to changes in external forcing than convection in the Nordic seas, which only reacts after a threshold is passed...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of nearly 20 years of altimetric sea surface height (SSH) is investigated {{to understand its}} association with decadal to multidecadal variability of the North Atlantic heat content. Altimetric SSH is dominated by an increase of about 14 cm in the Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>seas</b> from 1993 to 2011, while the opposite has occurred over the Gulf Stream region over the same time period. During the altimeter period the observed 0 - 700 m ocean heat content (OHC) in the subpolar gyre mirrors the increased SSH by its dominantly positive trend. Over a longer period, 1955 - 2011, fluctuations in the subpolar OHC reflect Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) and {{can be attributed to}} advection driven by the wind stress ''gyre mode'' bringing more subtropical waters into the subpolar gyre. The extended subpolar warming evident in SSH and OHC during the altimeter period represents transition of the AMV from cold to warm phase. In addition to the dominant trend, the first empirical orthogonal function SSH time series shows an abrupt change 2009 - 2010 reaching a new minimum in 2010. The change coincides with the change in the meridional overturning circulation at 26. 5 N as observed by the RAPID (Rapid Climate Change) project, and with extreme behavior of the wind stress gyre mode and of atmospheric blocking. While the general relationship between northern warming and Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) volume transport remains undetermined, the meridional heat and salt transport carried by AMOC's arteries are rich with decade-to-century timescale variability...|$|R

However, significantly higher concentrations in 1 -sea-winter (1 SW) escapees (0. 43 ± 0. 25 Bq kg- 1) may alternatively suggest feeding within local estuaries. High concentrations in some Canadian 1 SW salmon indicated trans-Atlantic migration. Low concentrations of Canadian multi-sea-winter (MSW) salmon suggested a feeding distribution in the Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>Seas</b> before homeward migration, because those regions have the lowest surface water 137 Cs levels. Estimates of wild Canadian and Irish salmon feeding east of the Faroes (~ 8 oW) were 14. 2 % and 10. 0 % (1 SW, 24. 7 % and 11. 5 %; MSW, 2. 9 % and 0. 0 %), respectively.

40|$|The North Atlantic Ocean vigorously ventilates {{the ocean}} interior.

These ventilation rates and pathways are uncertain, and a powerful way to estimate them is to monitor the penetration of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) tracers. Here, a CFC dataset of over 44 000 observations, taken between 1982 and 1998, is combined with a non-eddy-resolving (resolution) general circulation model of the North Atlantic Ocean. The CFC data are assimilated with the model by optimizing the uncertain air{ndash}sea CFC flux. The assimilated CFC fields are then systematically compared with the observations to identify the best fit and hence the most realistic ventilation. Three GCM experiments are performed this way to find the dependence on model thickness diffusivity. Each GCM solution is close to being statistically consistent with the CFC observations and likely sources of error. Lower diffusivity gives the best match to data although some systematic bias in sequestering tropospheric CFC remains. Lower diffusivity, around 150 m 2 s{ndash} 1, permits a stronger circulation with a more realistic North Atlantic Current.

Most notable is {{the treatment of}} horizontal discretisation which has undergone transition from a staggered E-grid to an orthogonal curvilinear C-grid. The treatment of subgridscale mixing has been improved by {{the inclusion of a}} new formulation of bottom boundary layer (BBL) slope convection, an isopycnal diffusion scheme, and a Gent and McWilliams style eddy-induced mixing parameterisation. The model setup described here has a north pole over Greenland and a south pole on the coast of the Weddell Sea. This gives relatively high resolution in the sinking regions associated with the thermohaline circulation. Results are presented from a 450 year climatologically forced integration. The forcing {{is a product of the}} German Ocean Model Intercomparison Project and is derived from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting reanalysis. The main emphasis is on the model's representation of key quantities that are easily associated with the ocean's role in the global climate system. The global and Atlantic northward poleward heat transports have peaks of 1. 43 and 0. 84 PW, at 18 degrees and 21 degrees N respectively. The Atlantic meridional overturning streamfunction has a peak of 15. 7 Sv in the North Atlantic and an outflow of 11. 9 Sv at 30 degrees S. Comparison with a simulation excluding BBL shows that the scheme is responsible for up to a 25 % increase in North Atlantic heat transport, with significant improvement of the depths of convection in the Greenland, Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>Seas.</b> Despite the improvements, comparison with observations shows the heat transport still to be too weak. Other outstanding problems include an incorrect Gulf Stream pathway, a too strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and a too weak renewal of Antarctic Intermediate Water.

40|$|Studies {{addressing}} climate variability {{during the}} last millennium generally focus on variables with a direct influence on climate variability, like the fast thermal response to varying radiative forcing, or the large-scale changes in atmospheric dynamics (e. g. North Atlantic Oscillation). The ocean responds to these variations by slowly integrating in depth the upper heat flux changes, thus producing a delayed influence on ocean heat content (OHC) that can later impact low frequency SST (sea surface temperature) variability through reemergence processes. In this study, both the externally and internally driven variations of the OHC {{during the last}} millennium are investigated using a set of fully coupled simulations with the ECHO-G (coupled climate model ECHAMA 4 and ocean model HOPE-G) atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (AOGCM). When compared to observations for the last 55 yr, the model tends to overestimate the global trends and underestimate the decadal OHC variability. Extending the analysis back to the last one thousand years, the main impact of the radiative forcing is an OHC increase at high latitudes, explained to some extent by a reduction in cloud cover and the subsequent increase of short-wave radiation at the surface. This OHC response {{is dominated by the}} effect of volcanism in the preindustrial era, and by the fast increase of GHGs during the last 150 yr. Likewise, salient impacts from internal climate variability are observed at regional scales. For instance, upper temperature in the equatorial Pacific is controlled by ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) variability from interannual to multidecadal timescales. Also, both the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) modulate intermittently the interdecadal OHC variability in the North Pacific and Mid Atlantic, respectively. The NAO, through its influence on North Atlantic surface heat fluxes and convection, also plays an important role on the OHC at multiple timescales, leading first to a cooling in the Labrador and <b>Irminger</b> <b>seas,</b> and later on to a North Atlantic warming, associated with a delayed impact on the AMO.

Here we repeat recent experiments conducted for the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, providing an idealized additional source of freshwater along Greenland’s coast. For conservative and high melting estimates, the AMOC reduction is 35 % and 42 %, respectively, compared to a weakening of 30 % for the original A 1 B scenario. Even for the high meltwater estimate the AMOC recovers in the 22 nd century. The impact of the additional fresh water is limited to further enhancing the static stability in the <b>Irminger</b> and Labrador <b>Seas,</b> whereas {{the backbone of the}} overturning is maintained by the overflows across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge. Our results suggest that abrupt climate change initiated by GIS melting is not a realistic scenario for the 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|The {{duration}} and {{sequence of events}} recorded in Heinrich layers at sites near the Hudson Strait source area for ice-rafted material are still poorly constrained, notably because of the limit and uncertainties of the 14 C chronology. Here we use high-resolution 230 Th-excess measurements, in a 6 m sequence raised from Orphan Knoll (southern Labrador Sea), to constrain {{the duration of the}} deposition of the five most recent Heinrich (H) layers. On the basis of maximum/minimum estimates for the mean glacial 230 Th-excess flux at the studied site a minimum/maximum duration of 1. 0 / 0. 6, 1. 4 / 0. 8, 1. 3 / 0. 8, 1. 5 / 0. 9, and 2. 1 / 1. 3 kyr is obtained for H 0 (∼Younger Dryas), Hl, H 2, H 3, and H 4, respectively. Thorium- 230 -excess inventories and other sedimentological features indicate a reduced but still significant lateral sedimentary supply by the Western Boundary Undercurrent during the glacial interval. U and Th series systematics also provide insights into source rocks of H layer sediments (i. e., into distal <b>Irminger</b> Basin/local Labrador <b>Sea</b> supplies) ...|$|R
