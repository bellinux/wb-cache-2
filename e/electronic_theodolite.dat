Most {{of the conventional}} scanning systems are less flexibility and difficult to realize engineering applications for employing sequential registration tactic. To develop portable scanning system and engineering registration method overcoming problems of error accumulation and propagation is the research direction. In this paper, one 3 -D free-form shape measuring system using unconstrained range sensor is designed. A quasi-active stereo binocular visual sensor embedded within a scanning mechanism is used as the range sensor. Error compensation is performed by residual amendment according to camera calibration lattice. Artificial control points are designed and adhered on object and one camera is introduced to shot these control points from different positions and orientations. Then ray bundle adjustment (BA) method {{is used to calculate}} the space coordinates of all the control points, so as to set up a global control net work. Registration can be completed by mapping at least 3 control points observed by range sensor in single view acquisition into the global control network.

Therefore, the working range of the system can be easily extended. The measuring precision mainly depends on the quality of global control network.

40|$|Digital {{zenith camera}} systems (DZCS) are {{dedicated}} astronomical-geodetic measurement {{systems for the}} observation of {{the direction of the}} plumb line. A DZCS key component is a pair of tilt meters for the determination of the instrumental tilt with respect to the plumb line. Highest accuracy (i. e., 0. 1 [*]arc-seconds or better) is achieved in practice through observation with precision tilt meters in opposite faces (180 ° instrumental rotation), and application of rigorous tilt reduction models. A novel concept proposes the development of a hexapod (Stewart platform) -based DZCS. However, hexapod-based total rotations are limited to about 30 °– 60 ° in azimuth (equivalent to ± 15 ° to ± 30 ° yaw rotation), which raises the question {{of the impact of the}} rotation angle between the two faces on the accuracy of the tilt measurement. The goal of the present study is the investigation of the expected accuracy of tilt measurements to be carried out on future hexapod-based DZCS, with special focus placed on the role of the limited rotation angle. A Monte-Carlo simulation study is carried out in order to derive accuracy estimates for the tilt determination as a function of several input parameters, and the results are validated against analytical error propagation. As the main result of the study, limitation of the instrumental rotation to 60 ° (30 °) deteriorates the tilt accuracy by a factor of about 2 (4) compared to a 180 ° rotation between the faces. Nonetheless, a tilt accuracy at the 0. 1 [*]arc-second level is expected when the rotation is at least 45 °, and 0. 05 arc-second (about 0. 25 microradian) accurate tilt meters are deployed. As such, a hexapod-based DZCS can be expected to allow sufficiently accurate determination of the instrumental tilt. This provides supporting evidence for the feasibility of such a novel instrumentation. The outcomes of our study are not only relevant to the field of DZCS, but also to all other types of instruments where the instrumental tilt must be corrected.

In doing so, DInSAR algorithm is involved two parts: 3 D map simulation and interferogram simulation with DEM and satellite orbit parameters. Further, 3 D coastal geomorphology reconstruction is realized by fuzzy B-spline algorithm with the midpoint displacement method and the terrain roughness and average slope are determined by two describing parameters of the model.

A Peak Performance 24 point calibration frame was used as a control object on an emulated running lane. Additionally, a second Peak Performance frame was split in eight poles, which were placed along the mid-lane at 0. 5 m intervals before and after the calibration frame. The positions of all 48 spherical targets were determined using a Leica 1610 <b>electronic</b> <b>theodolite</b> from three survey stations located around the measured volume. All the points were videotaped from 5 different distances with 2 cameras and digitised using the Target digitising system. The rms-deviations between the Surveyed locations and the reconstructed points varied considerably in different co-ordinate directions, in different poles, and in different camera distances. The findings imply that the control points should not actually be evenly distributed around the analysed volume, but the markers should be evenly distributed in relation to cameras taking account the pan angle. In any case, extrapolation may not be as large a problem in certain situations as previously believed.

This system consists of an optical system, an electronic system (with detailed schematics and printed circuit artwork, included) the software system which is approximately 100 pages of C source code, system identification and controller simulation, modelling and design, and finally instrument calibration and testing effort over a 2 year period. The project is a collaboration between the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the School of Surveying at the University of Tasmania. It is supported by an ARC university research fund granted to the School of Surveying over a two year period. The initial investigation into the feasibility {{of the project was}} carried out by Dr. A. Sprent, then at the North East London Polytechnic (Sprent, 1. 12). During this time the optical system of the instrument was developed. Following this investigation, it was decided to further undertake the continuation of the project as a Master's Degree in order to develop the electronics, measurement, tracking and control software. The Anglescan system is similar to a standard surveying theodolite mounted on a tripod and capable of determining the position of a retro-reflective mirror based within the instrument's field of view with respect with its optical centre of field (in both azimuth and elevation planes). This involves a new and different technique for target location than the currently existing <b>electronic</b> <b>theodolites</b> (see sections 1. 5, 1. 6). One of the main advantages of this method is the improved target locating accuracy, it has been field tested with an accuracy of + 1 - 1 second of arc, and simplicity in optical design. The disadvantages however include increased complexity of both the hardware (electronics), software, and calibration involved. The instrument deviates from a standard theodolite in that it has been fitted with precision DC servomotor drives on the azimuth and elevation axes for target tracking. The servomotors also include optical rotary encoders for measurement [...] While tracking, the system operates by continuously locating the target mirror with respect to its centre of field of view, then applying a feedback control signal to the azimuth and elevation motors in order to re-centre the instrument directly onto the target, this is updated at a rate of 30 samples/second. Part of the objectives of this work is to design the necessary hardware and software to achieve this task, this includes the design of a return (laser) analog signal processor card, the design of a target position measurement card, and azimuth/elevation servo motors interface cards (azimuth card and elevation card). Furthermore, the project also requires the design of an appropriate target acquisition and control loop strategy to allow smooth and accurate tracking of a moving target. A number of control system designs have been investigated, including proportional control, pole placement design and linear quadratic control. We have also used system identification techniques to obtain an accurate model of the plant which is necessary for controller design and simulation. To achieve the high precision required in measurement, it is necessary to calibrate the instrument. The calibration method is a complex procedure which uses least squares techniques to produce the required calibration accuracy (this is discussed in detail in section 5). The instrument finds applications in areas such as monitoring earth movements, motion of large structures such as building and bridges, locating earth working machinery such as tractors, bulldozers, graders, concrete and asphalt paving machines where an accurate level surface is required. Another application of particular interest is in surface contour mapping where we require to map a 3 dimensional surface (obtain the surface contour or topography), this application is a slightly more complex problem requiring the use of two instruments, this then becomes a multivariable control problem. As a result of this research work, one paper was presented at the IREECON - 91 conference in Sydney and is published in the proceedings [Dirita 1. 13].

40|$|Sharply angular {{boulders}} {{as large}} as 320 kg sit on the Racetrack Playa, Death Valley, California; trails leading to them indicate that the rocks have moved large distances. The process has never been witnessed. Although high winds and a wetted surface seem necessary, controversy persists {{about the need for}} other conditions, especially ice sheets. On the basis of experiments with a wetted Racetrack surface (soft mud ∼ 3 cm deep), we find the effective coefficient of friction to be surprisingly high, ∼ 0. 8. Movement by wind alone of moderate-sized (20 kg) rocks with cubic shape requires sustained winds close to the ground of ∼ 80 m/s (∼ 180 mph). Larger flat-lying rocks require much higher winds. To assess the ice-sheet hypothesis, we mapped a large number of tracks into a precise coordinate system with an <b>electronic</b> <b>theodolite.</b> Certain tracks, separated by 3 ̆c 1 to ∼ 830 m, have nearly identical curving patterns near their starts. The distance between a distinctive bend on one such track and its mate on another matches the distance for another mated pair of bends on these same tracks within several centimetres, even for tracks 830 m apart. As proposed by Stanley (1955), it seems that the rocks, resting on mud, were locked into a single floating ice sheet, in this case at least 850 X 500 m. Final resting places of these rocks are much more widely scattered than their starting points, suggesting that the sheet broke into smaller plates. Large ice sheets can move rocks even with light winds and may explain the gentle curvature of tracks hundreds of metres long, a pattern very unlikely with gusty high winds and no ice...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine how the size and orientation of large wood placed in streams in combination with peak flows, substrate and channel gradient affect pool volume, surface area and maximum depth in two coastal Oregon streams. Eighteen Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) logs were placed in each of two streams, J-Line Creek and Preacher Creek, in the summer of 1989. Surveys were conducted annually from 1989 - 1996 at summer low flow using a total station <b>electronic</b> <b>theodolite.</b> The orientation of the introduced wood and the parameters of residual pools associated with the wood were determined from high resolution topographic maps made from the surveys. Residual pool volume associated with the introduced wood increased 2, 500 percent over the seven years for J-Line Creek and 30 percent for Preacher Creek. Large spanners, logs placed perpendicular to the stream flow and flush with the stream bottom, had the greatest pool volume associated with them, however horizontal orientations shifted downstream over time. Large ramps, logs placed at a downstream orientation and angled up onto the bank, were the most stable treatment. Differences between the two watersheds and an interaction variable between the diameter of the introduced wood and the horizontal orientation of the introduced wood were the significant variables which entered the multiple linear regression model for residual pool volume. These variables, as well as the vertical orientation of the introduced wood, were significantly correlated to both residual pool surface area and maximum depth. The recurrence interval of the annual maximum instantaneous peak flow was not significantly associated with residual pool volume, surface area nor maximum depth. Multiple regression models explained, at most, twenty-eight percent of the variability in residual pool volume, maximum depth and surface area. Estimates of pool volume obtained with aquatic habitat inventories (Bisson et al., 1982) were compared with residual pool calculations determined from the topographic maps. Pool volume in a reach determined by aquatic habitat inventories explained 96 percent of the variability of residual pool volume in a reach, however estimates of individual pool volume explained only 40 percent of the variability in residual pool volume...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: The aim of {{this project}} is {{to bridge the gap}} of {{understanding}} between the heights produced by Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and their relationship to the Australian Height Datum (AHD). This will be achieved by developing a local geoid model and testing it by utilising global positioning equipment, software, registered state control marks and geodetic surveying principles. The objective of the project is to improve future GPS derived AHD heights and to confirm AHD values of a sample of state control marks within the limitations of a sample area. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), notably GPS, have the ability to provide real time corrections and centimetre accuracy for surveying, civil engineering, property development, scientific and various other applications where position, both vertical and horizontal, is required. GPS offers an attractive alternative position determination tool, but only provided that it is sufficiently accurate for the application at hand. This project presents the results of utilising GPS, and software, to improve future GPS derived results of the AHD within the project area and confirm the stated values of AHD on state control marks within the limitations of the project area. GPS has established itself as a competitor to traditional surveying instruments such as the <b>theodolite,</b> <b>electronic</b> total stations, laser levels and spirit levels. GPS is a faster and more efficient tool for surveying applications, especially over large areas, when compared to the latter mentioned traditional instruments. Accurate position is the fundamental component of any built form project. Data is now commonly requested on the national mapping datum, the GDA 94 and the AHD. Deriving and transfening AHD heights using GPS is problematic. GPS users in Australia have had access to AUSGeoid 98, as a reference geoid, since November 1998. The primary application of a gravimetric geoid model is to convert GPS derived ellipsoid heights to elevations on a local height datum such as AHD. AUSGeoid 98 is a gravimetric geoid model developed, at two-arc minute spacing, to align AHD. AHD has deficiencies by virtue of its original establishment as an orthometric derived height system. This represents a considerable gap in the knowledge in the integrity of the AUSGeoid 98 's realisation of the AHD. The outcomes and results from this project can be used to complement the existing AUSGeoid 98 's geoid model and therefore increase the accuracy and realisation of AHD by GPS observations within the project area...|$|R
