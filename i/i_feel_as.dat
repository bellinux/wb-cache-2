500|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Badler had joined the cast of Neighbours as [...] "super-bitch" [...] Diana Marshall. Badler said that when she met with the writers, they told her that they are big fans of V and so they wrote the part of Diana with her in mind. They named the character Diana in a homage to the role she played in V. The writers did not know that Badler was living in the county until a chance meeting brought them together. Badler revealed that the guitarist in her band managed to connect her to Neighbours executive producer, Susan Bower and when she tried to get her music featured on the show, she was asked to play Diana instead. Badler said that she still had to audition for the role, which she said was [...] "depressing" [...] as she hates auditioning. However, she said it was fun as the part was for a bad girl, which is the kind of role she enjoys playing. She added [...] "Now I'm happy that I had to earn the role; <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though it was made for me." ...|$|E
500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... I decided not to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E

They built a house in the Morgan Creek area off the present Morgan Creek Road, which was sparsely populated.

Thinking of the red soil, the seasons, the way things smelled down there, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though my experience of coming of age there was more a matter of landscape and climate than people." [...] James attended public primary school in Chapel Hill. Isaac's career prospered, but he was frequently away from home, on military service at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, or as part of Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica in 1955 and 1956. Isaac Taylor later rose to become dean of the UNC School of Medicine from 1964 to 1971. Beginning in 1953, the Taylors spent summers on Martha's Vineyard.|$|E
2500|$|Skaat has said, [...] "My wish {{was always}} to be a singer, and I'm still working on it." [...] Skaat {{is one of many}} {{well-known}} singers, both past and present, of Yemenite Jewish heritage—a long line that includes Bracha Zefira, Shoshana Damari, Haim Moshe, Zohar Argov, Ofra Haza, Gali Atari, Dana International, Achinoam Nini (Noa), and many others. [...] However, unlike the music of some Yemenite Jewish singers, there have been generally few hints of the distinctive singing style often associated with that culture in Skaat's music. Although Skaat has said that he has been influenced by Rivka Zohar and he has named Rami Kleinstein and Sarit Hadad as two of his favorite singers, he stated in a February 2010 interview that, [...] "I don't think I [...] ever been influenced by someone in specific. I have always listened to so many different kinds of music. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if I have learned from each singer I listened to and still do. From the vigour of the great female singers, through the song interpretation of French performers to the intricate structures of classical music pieces. I find inspiration in them all!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Derek Martin {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by the new baby swap storyline when it was published in the media. Speaking on This Morning, Martin commented: [...] "I'm one of those actors – I don't know how many others do it – but when I get the scripts, I only read my bits. So I looked , 'Charlie leaves his grandson upstairs, goes downstairs, gets on the drink, gets drunk – the baby's dead'. So that's terrible guilt obviously – because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though it's my fault that he's died. I {{was surprised}} when I saw the story come out – because I don't read the others' [...] – that it was a baby swap." [...] Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: [...] "Don't forget, there's millions of people – there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up… everybody will have opinions about that. So therefore you have to accept that's the public – some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is." [...] He continues: Over the years, don't forget, EastEnders have always had subjects. When [...] brother had raped Kat and we didn't find out until later on, that was a very strong storyline. And when Little Mo was bashed by her husband Trevor. These stories are all part of real life." ...|$|E
