50|$|The {{classical}} {{approach to}} brittle fracture {{in the late}} 1940s had been developed in the early 1920s, following the work of A. A. Griffith. Griffith had shown that an instability criterion could be derived for cracks in brittle materials based on the variation of potential energy of the structure as the crack grew. The Griffith approach was global and could not easily be extended to accommodate structures with finite geometries subjected to various types of loadings. The theory was considered to apply only to a limited class of extremely brittle materials, such as glasses or ceramics. Irwin observed that the fracture process in metals involved nonelastic work at the crack tip. This observation permitted him to modify the <b>Griffith</b> <b>theory</b> by incorporating a plastic work of fracture {{in addition to the}} classical surface energy of crack formation.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} James R. Rice (then at Brown University) and G. P. Cherepanov {{independently}} {{developed a new}} toughness measure to describe the case where there is sufficient crack-tip deformation that the part no longer obeys the linear-elastic approximation. Rice's analysis, which assumes non-linear elastic (or monotonic deformation theory plastic) deformation ahead of the crack tip, is designated the J-integral. This analysis is limited to situations where plastic deformation at the crack tip does not extend to the furthest edge of the loaded part. It also demands that the assumed non-linear elastic behavior of the material is a reasonable approximation in shape and magnitude to the real material's load response. The elastic-plastic failure parameter is designated JIc and is conventionally converted to KIc using Equation (3.1) of the Appendix to this article. Also note that the J integral approach reduces to the <b>Griffith</b> <b>theory</b> for linear-elastic behavior.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we generalize Barenblatt's {{cohesive}} fracture {{theory for}} fractal cracks. We discuss {{the difficulties of}} generalizing the concept of traction on a fractal surface. Borodich's modification of <b>Griffith's</b> <b>theory</b> for fractal cracks is reviewed. Irwin's driving force is generalized for fractal cracks and a fractal driving force (G_f) is defined. It is shown that to generalize Barenblatt's theory for fractal cracks {{it is necessary to}} introduce a new quantity, D-fractal cohesive pseudo-stress. This new quantity is cohesive force per unit of a fractal measure. Fractal modulus of cohesion is seen to be a function of both the material and the fractal dimension of the crack. Equivalence of fractal Barenblatt's and <b>Griffith's</b> <b>theories</b> is discussed.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the physical {{meaning of the}} intrinsic crack resistance in the <b>Griffith</b> <b>theory</b> of brittle fracture by means of atomic-scale simulations. By taking cubic SiC as a typical brittle material, we show that the widely accepted identification of intrinsic crack resistance with the free surface energy underestimates the energy-release rate. The strain dependence of the Young modulus and surface energy, as well as allowance for lattice trapping, improve the estimate of the crack resistance. In the smallest scale limit, crack resistance can be fitted by an empirical elastoplastic model...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} a large class of {{viscoelastic}} fluids, i. e., transient networks, are brittle according to the <b>Griffith's</b> <b>theory</b> of solid fracture. However, contrary to solids, cracks are intrinsic to the material arising from the equilibrium nature of the fluid microstructure. The brittleness of these fluids comes from thermal fluctuations of bonds distribution. In this approach, the rupture stress is predicted {{to be on the}} order of the Young modulus, in very good agreement with experimental values...|$|R
30|$|We then {{investigate}} the quasi-static {{limits of the}} dynamic gradient damage model. In the absence of brutal or unstable crack propagation where the classical static <b>Griffith’s</b> <b>theory</b> fails, the dynamic model converges to the first-order quasi-static gradient damage model, when the loading speed decreases. However, when the crack may propagate at a speed comparable to the material speed of sound, the dynamic model should be preferred to correctly account for inertial effects. The crack evolution in the dynamic gradient damage model is in quantitative accordance with the LEFM predictions on the 1 -d peeling problem.|$|R

The model displays a rich behavior, accounting for different fracture phenomena, and in particular for crack formation and growth. A comparison with standard Finite Element simulations and with the basic <b>Griffith</b> <b>theory</b> of fracture is provided. Moreover, an ‘almost steady’ state, i. e. a long apparent equilibrium followed by an abrupt crack growth, is obtained by suitably parameterizing the system.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the removal of material or the creation or extension of cracks always reduces the total potential energy of any non-linear or linear stable elastic body under fixed load and displacement boundary conditions. A weaker statement that crack extension releases potential energy in excess of plastic dissipation is established for stable elastic-plastic bodies, with certain strong but reasonable restrictions {{on the path of}} traction removal from the new surface. Crack healing, however, always absorbs energy. Implications for the <b>Griffith</b> <b>theory</b> of fracture, including its extension to inelastic materials, and the mechanical aspects of stress corrosion cracking are discussed...|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to systematically check for possible stress concentrations caused by cracks—there is a critical crack length of 2a for which, when this value is exceeded, the crack proceeds to definite catastrophic failure. This ultimate failure is definite since the crack will propagate on its own once the length is greater than 2a. (There is no additional energy required to increase the crack length so the crack will continue to enlarge until the material fails.) The origins of the value 2a can be understood through <b>Griffith's</b> <b>theory</b> of brittle fracture.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{onset of}} crack {{propagation}} in rubber is studied computationally {{by using the}} softening hyperelasticity approach. The basic idea underlying the approach is to limit the capability of a material model to accumulate energy without failure. The latter is done by introducing a limiter for the strain energy density, which results from atomic/molecular considerations and {{can be interpreted as}} the average bond energy or the failure energy. Including the energy limiter in a constitutive description of material it is possible to enforce softening and, consequently, allow tracking the onset of structural instability corresponding to the onset of material failure. Specifically, initiation of crack propagation is studied {{in the case of a}} thin sheet of a rubber-like solid under the hydrostatic tension. The large deformation neo-Hookean material model enhanced with the energy limiter is used for finding the critical tension corresponding to the onset of static instability of the sheet, i. e. the onset of fracture propagation. The influence of the crack sharpness and length on the critical load is analyzed. It is found that material is sensitive to the crack sharpness when the shear modulus is significantly greater than the average bond energy. The sensitivity declines when the value of the shear modulus approaches the value of the failure energy. Roughly speaking, softer materials are less sensitive to cracks than more brittle materials where the brittleness is defined as a ratio of the shear modulus to the failure energy. It is also found that the critical tension is proportional to the inverse square root of the crack length for more brittle materials. The latter means that the <b>Griffith</b> <b>theory</b> based on the linearized elasticity is also applicable to softer materials undergoing large deformations. Unfortunately, the applicability of the <b>Griffith</b> <b>theory</b> is restricted to cracks with equivalent sharpness only...|$|E

A model based on <b>Griffith's</b> <b>theory</b> of fracture combining plate bending elastic energy and fracture energy accounts for our observations. These findings indicate how the post-mortem shape of broken samples are related to material properties and impact parameters, a procedure relevant to forensic science, archaeology or astrophysics...|$|R

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this short paper to show that the well known <b>Griffiths</b> <b>theory</b> of brittle {{fracture}} can be re-interpreted as a simple case of a modified Hamiltonian, and corresponds to a stationary action solution using the Euler-Lagrange equations.

It is then shown that if physics of fracture is modelled using a simplified crack tip stress wave unloading model, then the Griffith-Irwin relationship can be derived in a single process, which is a major simplification of the procedure. Also the simplified crack tip stress wave unloading model employed gives a much clearer view of the basic physics of fracture. Keywords: Fracture, Griffiths, Hamiltonians, stress waves.
