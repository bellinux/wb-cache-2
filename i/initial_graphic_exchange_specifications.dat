40|$|Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) is {{considered}} to be the bridge that links Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM). One of the imperative characteristics of CAPP is Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR). CAD files contain detailed geometric information of a part, which are not suitable for using in the downstream applications such as process planning. Different CAD or geometric modeling packages store the information related to the design in their own databases. Structures of these databases are different from each other. As a result no common or standard structure has been developed so far, that can be used by all CAD packages. For that reason this paper will propose an intelligent feature recognition methodology (IFRM) to develop a feature recognition system which has the ability to communicate with the different CAD/CAM systems. The proposed methodology is developed for 3 D prismatic parts that are created by using solid modeling package by using CSG technique as a drawing tool. The system takes a neutral file in <b>Initial</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Specification</b> (IGES) format as input and translates the information in the file to manufacturing information. The boundary (B-rep) geometrical information of the part design is analyzed by a feature recognition program that is created specifically to extract the features from the geometrical information based on the geometric reasoning approach. A feature recognition algorithm is used to recognize different features of the part such as step, holes, etc. The system is written in C++ language on a PC-based system.

40|$|In {{design and}} manufacturing, many systems {{are used to}} manage {{technical}} product data. Each system has its own data formats so the same information has to be entered multiple times into multiple systems, leading to redundancy and errors. Although not unique to manufac-turing, it is more acute there because design data are complex and three-dimensional (3 D). The National Institute of Standards and Technology has estimated that data incompatibility is a $ 90 billion problem for the U. S. manufacturing industry. 1 Over the years many solutions have been proposed. The most successful have been standards for data exchange. The first ones were national and focused on geometric data exchange. They include the Standard d’Exchange et de Transfer (SET) in France, the Verband des Automobilindustrie FlächenSchnittstelle (VDAFS) in Germany, and the <b>Initial</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Specification</b> (IGES) in the United States. Later a grand unifying effort was started by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to produce one international standard for all aspects of technical product data, named STEP for the Standard for Product Model Data. 2 The types of systems that use STEP are shown in Fig. 1. Nearly every major CAD/CAM system now contains a module {{to read and write}} data defined by one of the STEP application protocols (APs). In the United States the most commonly implemented protocol is AP- 203. This protocol is used to exchange data describ-ing designs represented as solid models and assemblies of solid models.

40|$|In {{the field}} of Grid Generation and the CAD/CAM, there are {{numerous}} geometry output formats which require the designer to {{spend a great deal}} of time manipulating geometrical entities in order to achieve a useful sculptured geometrical description for grid generation. Also in this process, there is a danger of losing fidelity of the geometry under consideration. This stresses the importance of a standard geometry definition for the communication link between varying CAD/CAM and grid system. The IGES (<b>Initial</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Specification)</b> file is a widely used communication between CAD/CAM and the analysis tools. The scientists at NASA Research Centers - including NASA Ames, NASA Langley, NASA Lewis, NASA Marshall - have recognized this importance and, therefore, in 1992 they formed the committee of the 'NASA-IGES' which is the subset of the standard IGES. This committee stresses the importance and encourages the CFD community to use the standard IGES file for the interface between the CAD/CAM and CFD analysis. Also, two of the IGES entities [...] the NURBS Curve (Entity 126) and NURBS Surface (Entity 128) [...] which have many useful geometric properties [...] like the convex hull property, local control property and affine invariance, also widely utilized analytical geometries can be accurately represented using NURBS. This is important in today grid generation tools because of the emphasis of the interactive design. To satisfy the geometry transformation between the CAD/CAM system and Grid Generation field, the CAGI (Computer Aided Geometry Design) developed, which include the Geometry Transformation, Geometry Manipulation and Geometry Generation as well as the user interface. This paper will present the successful development IGES file transformer and application of NURBS definition in the grid generation...|$|R
40|$|CAD) tools, {{which were}} {{introduced}} in the 1960 s, represented tremendous productivity gains over paper drawings, such as ease to revise and archive. CAD tools also opened new opportunities, such as enabling manufacturing instructions to be derived automatically and executed directly from the drawing. Nevertheless, as computer design and manufacturing tools proliferated to meet increasingly complex and diverse engineering needs, so did the formats that each tool used to capture and store product data. While paper drawings can be marked up by anyone with a pencil, a product model that cannot be interpreted by the necessary CAD tool is useless. For organizations to share designs across various CAD and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) tools, their data files must be formatted {{in a manner that}} the tool can recognize. This requirement has become increasingly important in an age where large manufacturers often form joint ventures to address a business opportunity, and where partners in a supply chain are being called upon to deliver an increasingly complex array of services. Most companies find it difficult to enforce the use of a common set of CAD/CAM tools within their organiza-tion, much less across (multiple) supply chains and among joint venture partners. Because of the lack of any common set of tools, a common format for neutral file exchange is needed. Using a neutral standard for transferring information across systems drastically reduces the requirements for translators. The cost benefits are suggested by the reduction in necessary translators shown in Fig. 1. It illustrates that by using a neutral file exchange, the number of translators (for N systems) can be reduced from scaling as n (n– 1) to 2 n. In 1979, a series of events catalyzed the CAD vendor and user community to create the first national standard for CAD data exchange, which is documented in the report <b>Initial</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Specification,</b> Version 1. 0 [1]. CAD systems were less than ten years old, and only a handful of products had any significant market penetration. Even at this early stage, users were over-whelmed by the inability to share data among these tools and with their own internally developed databases. Fig. 1. Illustration of the benefits of using a neutral file exchange...|$|R
40|$|The {{computational}} steps traditionally {{taken for}} most engineering analysis suites (computational fluid dynamics (CFD), structural analysis, heat transfer and etc.) are: (1) Surface Generation [...] usually by employing a Computer Assisted Design (CAD) system; (2) Grid Generation [...] preparing the volume for the simulation; (3) Flow Solver [...] producing the results at the specified operational point; (4) Post-processing Visualization [...] interactively attempting {{to understand the}} results. For structural analysis, integrated systems {{can be obtained from}} a number of commercial vendors. These vendors couple directly to a number of CAD systems and are executed from within the CAD Graphical User Interface (GUI). It {{should be noted that the}} structural analysis problem is more tractable than CFD; there are fewer mesh topologies used and the grids are not as fine (this problem space does not have the length scaling issues of fluids). For CFD, these steps have worked well in the past for simple steady-state simulations at the expense of much user interaction. The data was transmitted between phases via files. In most cases, the output from a CAD system could go to <b>Initial</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Specification</b> (IGES) or Standard Exchange Program (STEP) files. The output from Grid Generators and Solvers do not really have standards though there are a couple of file formats that can be used for a subset of the gridding (i. e. PLOT 3 D data formats). The user would have to patch up the data or translate from one format to another to move to the next step. Sometimes this could take days. Specifically the problems with this procedure are:(1) File based [...] Information flows from one step to the next via data files with formats specified for that procedure. File standards, when they exist, are wholly inadequate. For example, geometry from CAD systems (transmitted via IGES files) is defined as disjoint surfaces and curves (as well as masses of other information of no interest for the Grid Generator). This is particularly onerous for modern CAD systems based on solid modeling. The part was a proper solid and in the translation to IGES has lost this important characteristic. STEP is another standard for CAD data that exists and supports the concept of a solid. The problem with STEP is that a solid modeling geometry kernel is required to query and manipulate the data within this type of file. (2) 'Good' Geometry. A bottleneck in getting results from a solver is the construction of proper geometry to be fed to the grid generator. With 'good' geometry a grid can be constructed in tens of minutes (even with a complex configuration) using unstructured techniques. Adroit multi-block methods are not far behind. This means that a million node steady-state solution can be computed on the order of hours (using current high performance computers) starting from this 'good' geometry. Unfortunately, the geometry usually transmitted from the CAD system is not 'good' in the grid generator sense. The grid generator needs smooth closed solid geometry. It can take a week (or more) of interaction with the CAD output (sometimes by hand) before the process can begin. One way Communication. (3) One-way Communication [...] All information travels on from one phase to the next. This makes procedures like node adaptation difficult when attempting to add or move nodes that sit on bounding surfaces (when the actual surface data has been lost after the grid generation phase). Until this process can be automated, more complex problems such as multi-disciplinary analysis or using the above procedure for design becomes prohibitive. There is also no way to easily deal with this system in a modular manner. One can only replace the grid generator, for example, if the software reads and writes the same files. Instead of the serial approach to analysis as described above, CAPRI takes a geometry centric approach. This makes the actual geometry (not a discretized version) accessible to all phases of the analysis. The connection to the geometry is made through an Application Programming Interface (API) and NOT a file system. This API isolates the top-level applications (grid generators, solvers and visualization components) from the geometry engine. Also this allows the replacement of one geometry kernel with another, without effecting these top-level applications. For example, if UniGraphics is used as the CAD package then Parasolid (UG's own geometry engine) can be used for all geometric queries so that no solid geometry information is lost in a translation. This is much better than STEP because when the data is queried, the same software is executed as used in the CAD system. Therefore, one analyzes the exact part that is in the CAD system. CAPRI uses the same idea as the commercial structural analysis codes but does not specify control. Software components of the CAD system are used, but the analysis suite, not the CAD operator, specifies the control of the software session. This also means that the license issues (may be) minimized and individuals need not have to know how to operate a CAD system in order to run the suite...|$|R
