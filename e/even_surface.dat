5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse â€“ {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and <b>even</b> <b>surface</b> of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
25|$|The dwarf or {{cloud forest}} {{developed}} in the higher peaks of the Central Cordillera is quite different in general appearance from the cloud forest of Sierra Luquillo Mountains due to the less rigorous environment in Toro Negro. The physical effect of the wind is much reduced; the shrubs are neither bent nor shorn to an <b>even</b> <b>surface,</b> but are essentially erect and their crowns are rounded and uneven in outline. The mosses are reduced to a thin mantle on the more sheltered trunks and are absent in many places, while the great mats of Selaginella are completely lacking.|$|E
25|$|The {{portrait}} of Aline was painted in tempera on linen, as {{were those of}} the two girls. It has a height of 40cm and a width 32.5cm. Below the painted cloth, scraps of linen pressed onto the mummy's face were used to provide an <b>even</b> <b>surface,</b> so that the portrait is nearly flat. Some of the portraits were painted before {{the death of their}} subject, but in Aline's case, where it is actually painted {{on the end of the}} mummy wrapping, it appears to have been produced after death, perhaps based on a previously prepared portrait. As is common for mummy portraits, the painting produces the impression of three-dimensional depth, a relatively recent feature in Egyptian art and due to Graeco-Roman influences. Frontal depictions of human faces had also been unusual throughout most of the history of Egyptian art. The wavy hairstyle with a central parting is painted simply, but carefully. The small ringlets above the forehead are striking. The face appears full, but not fat. It conveys the impression that this woman, who belonged to the middle or upper levels of Egyptian society, had led a good life. Her simple jewellery is carefully painted. The depiction of the necklace made of gilded plaster, added to the portrait. Aline wears a white tunica or chiton, thin lilac bands (clavus) run across her shoulder. The colours are warm. The sad, wistful gaze is typical of mummy portraits. Altogether, it is a masterful {{portrait of}} a middle-aged woman.|$|E
50|$|A {{very common}} example of {{combined}} usage is the phase-detection auto-focus system used in single-lens reflex cameras since the 1985s. The passive phase-detection auto-focus needs some contrast to work with, {{making it difficult}} to use in low-light scenarios or on <b>even</b> <b>surfaces.</b> An AF illuminator will illuminate the scene and project contrast patterns onto <b>even</b> <b>surfaces,</b> so that phase-detection auto-focus can work under these conditions as well.|$|R

40|$|We {{settle the}} first step for the {{classification}} of surfaces of general type with K^ 2 = 8, p_g = 4 and q = 0, classifying the <b>even</b> <b>surfaces</b> (K is 2 -divisible). The first <b>even</b> <b>surfaces</b> of general type with $K^ 2 = 8 $, $p_g= 4 $ and $q= 0 $ were found by Oliverio as complete intersections of bidegree (6, 6) in a weighted projective space P(1, 1, 2, 3, 3). In this article we prove that the moduli space of <b>even</b> <b>surfaces</b> of general type with K^ 2 = 8, p_g = 4 and q = 0 consists of two 35 -dimensional irreducible components intersecting in a codimension one subset (the first of these components is {{the closure of the}} open set considered by Oliverio). For the surfaces in the second component the canonical models are always singular, hence we get a new example of generically nonreduced moduli spaces. Our result gives a posteriori a complete description of the half-canonical rings of the above <b>even</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The method of proof is, we believe, the most interesting part of the paper. After describing the graded ring of a cone we are able, combining the explicit description of some subsets of the moduli space, some deformation theoretic arguments, and finally some local algebra arguments, to describe the whole moduli space. This {{is the first time that}} the classification of a class of surfaces can only be done using moduli theory: up to now first the surfaces were classified, on the basis of some numerical inequalities, or other arguments, and later on the moduli spaces were investigated.

50|$|The style {{began to}} slowly reemerge in {{popularity}} {{in the early to}} late 2000s, as a new generation of black musicians, athletes, and actors began to embrace this hairstyle. A prominent example is Cleveland Cavaliers guard/forward Iman Shumpert. The hairstyle <b>even</b> <b>surfaced</b> again in 2012 with the late 1980s-early 1990s style returning.

60|$|Once more, {{this double}} {{change in the}} extent and in the {{elevation}} of the lands, involved yet another species of heterogeneity, that of coast-line. A tolerably <b>even</b> <b>surface</b> raised out of the ocean, must have a simple, regular sea-margin; but a surface varied by table-lands and intersected by mountain-chains must, when raised out of the ocean, have an outline extremely irregular both in its leading features and in its details. Thus endless is the accumulation of geological and geographical results slowly brought about by this one cause--the contraction of the Earth.|$|E
60|$|Edwards was by {{her side}} in an instant, and with aching eyes he {{examined}} every fissure in the crags in quest of some opening that might offer facilities for flight. But the smooth, <b>even</b> <b>surface</b> of the rocks afforded hardly a resting-place for a foot, much less those continued projections {{which would have been}} necessary for a descent of nearly a hundred feet. Edwards was not slow in feeling the conviction that this hope was also futile, and, with a kind of feverish despair that still urged him to action, he turned to some new expedient.|$|E

He could distinguish a faint track, {{where the}} grasses had been disturbed, running straight across the sloo past the spot he occupied; {{but he thought}} that the person who had made the track had endeavored to leave as little mark as possible. Then he glanced out between the poplar trunks across the sunlit prairie. There was not a house on it; scarcely a clump of timber broke its <b>even</b> <b>surface.</b> The bluff was very lonely; and George remembered that a trail which ran near by led to an Indian reservation some distance to the north.

60|$|For all that, {{it was a}} {{nuisance}} {{to get up and}} look for dead branches in the dark, and he waited, reluctant to throw off his blanket, for some minutes, and then roused himself with a jerk. He imagined he heard voices out on the lake. He glanced at Father Lucien, but the latter was fast asleep. Thirlwell wondered whether he himself had gone to sleep again and dreamed, but half-consciously fixed his eyes on the opening that commanded a view of the lake. He could see it indistinctly; a smooth white plain running back into the dark. The snow caught a faint reflection although the moon was hidden, but nothing broke the <b>even</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
60|$|All {{the floors}} in Venice are of stone, and whether of marble flags, or of that species of {{composition}} formed of dark cement, with fragments of colored marble imbedded and smoothed and polished {{to the most}} glassy and <b>even</b> <b>surface,</b> and the general effect and complexion of petrified plum- pudding, all the floors are death-cold in winter. People sit with their feet upon cushions, and their bodies muffled in furs and wadded gowns. When one goes out into the sun, one often finds an overcoat too heavy, but it never gives warmth enough in the house, where the Venetian sometimes wears it. Indeed, the sun is recognized by Venetians as the only legitimate source of heat, and they sell his favor at fabulous prices to such foreigners as take the lodgings into which he shines.|$|E

60|$|It did {{not take}} him long to reach the first or big dam. It was {{difficult}} for this boy {{of the city to}} believe that this could be the work of animals and not men, and had he not seen some of the beaver cuttings in the Bronx Park at home he would have been inclined to think that Upton had been stuffing him when he told him about the dam. There was little opportunity to examine the construction, because it was covered with snow and was in effect a long solid wall of glistening white. Beyond stretched the smooth <b>even</b> <b>surface</b> of the big pond, with nothing to break the dead level of it but three white mounds over toward the north shore. These he knew must be the houses of which Upton had told him, and he at once decided to go over and investigate them.|$|E

The sledges, instead of gliding smoothly along as on an <b>even</b> <b>surface,</b> sometimes ran with violence after the dogs, and sometimes seemed with difficulty to ascend a rising hill. Noises, too, like the report of cannon, were now distinctly heard in many directions, from the bursting of the ice at a distance. Alarmed at these frightful phenomena, our travellers drove with all haste towards the shore; and, as they approached it, the prospect before them was tremendous. The ice having burst loose from the rocks, was tossed to and fro, and broken in a thousand pieces against the precipices with a dreadful noise; which, added to the raging of the sea, the roaring of the wind, and the driving of the snow, so overpowered them as almost completely to deprive them {{of the use of}} their eyes and ears.|$|E
60|$|As Abijah Wolf had said, the croppers of the West Riding were a rough set. Their {{occupation}} consisted in shearing or cropping {{the wool}} {{on the face}} of cloths. They used a large pair of shears, which were so set that one blade went under the cloth while the other worked on its upper face, mowing the fibers and ends of the wool to a smooth, <b>even</b> <b>surface.</b> The work was hard and required considerable skill, and the men earned about twenty-four shillings a week, a sum which, with bread and all other necessities of life at famine prices, barely sufficed for the support of their families. The introduction of power looms threatened to abolish their calling. It was true that although these machines wove the cloth more evenly and smoothly than the hand looms, croppers were still required to give the necessary smoothness of face; still the tendency had been to lower wages.|$|E

The show's popularity, in a time where few TV programs featured in-depth heavy metal coverage, may also be considered highly influential if not directly responsible for MTV2's need to revive the long-ceased Headbangers Ball over eight years after its initial cancellation.

5000|$|A show {{hunter is}} {{supposed}} to make its movements look effortless; and maintain a long, low, ground-covering stride with a swinging shoulder, and a low head and neck set [...] They are expected to never stop at a fence, cause a knockdown or a rub, and take every fence in good form and hitting every planned stride in between [...] While these characteristics are important for a field hunter, as a knockdown or a rub {{could result in a}} fall for the rider, the way of going is not as important for the field hunter as for the show hunter. The show hunter typically takes the fences at a far slower pace than the field hunter, and in far more controlled conditions. Hunters showing at indoor shows compete on flat, <b>even</b> <b>surfaces</b> over specified [...] "natural type" [...] fences such as coops, post and rails, hanging gates, brush, roll-backs, faux stone and brick walls, and natural-colored rails.

60|$|Mary {{suddenly}} became radiant, and Colonel Parsons {{gave her a}} happy little smile and a friendly nod.... At last James had his opportunity. He lingered while Mary gathered together her music, and waited again to light his pipe, {{so that when they}} came out of the Vicarage gates the rest of the company were no longer in sight. The day had become overcast and sombre; on the <b>even</b> <b>surface</b> of the sky floated little ragged black clouds, like the fragments cast to the wind of some widowed, ample garment. It had grown cold, and James, accustomed to a warmer air, shivered a little. The country suddenly appeared cramped and circumscribed; in the fading light a dulness of colour came over tree and hedgerow which was singularly depressing. They walked in silence, while James looked for words. All day he had been trying to find some manner to express himself, but his mind, perplexed and weary, refused to help him. The walk to Mary's house could not take more than five minutes, and he saw the distance slipping away rapidly. If he meant to say anything it must be said at once; and his mouth was dry, he felt almost a physical inability to speak. He {{did not know how to}} prepare the way, how to approach the subject; and he was doubly tormented by the absolute necessity of breaking the silence.|$|E

Ricciardetto shut his eyes at first, on perceiving himself so high in the air; but he speedily became used to it, though he looked down on the sun at last. In this manner they passed the desert, and the sea-coast, and the ocean, and swept the tops of the Pyrenees, Ashtaroth talking to them of wonders by the way; for {{he was one of the}} wisest of the devils, and knew a great many things which were then unknown to man. He laughed, for instance, as they went over sea, at the notion, among other vain fancies, that nothing was to be found beyond the pillars of Hercules; [...] "for," [...] said he, [...] "the earth is round, and the sea has an <b>even</b> <b>surface</b> all over it; and there are nations on the other side of the globe, who walk with their feet opposed to yours, and worship other gods than the Christians." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} of Rancocus Island created {{quite as much}} astonishment among the native mariners, as had that of the horses, cows, &c. Until they saw it, {{not one of them}} had any notion of its existence, or of a mountain at all. They dwelt themselves on low coral islands, and quite beyond the volcanic formation, and a hill was a thing scarcely known to them. At this island Heaton and Betts deemed it prudent to dismiss their attendants, not wishing them to know anything of the Reef, as they were not sure what sort of neighbours they, might prove, on a longer acquaintance. The mountain, however, possessed so many advantages over the Reef, as the latter was when Bob left it, that the honest fellow frankly admitted its general superiority, and suggested the possibility of its becoming their permanent residence. In some respects it was not equal to the Reef, as a residence, however, the fishing in particular turning out to be infinitely inferior. But it had trees and fruits, being very much of the same character as Vulcan's Peak, in this respect. Nevertheless, there was no comparison between the two islands as places of residence, the last having infinitely the most advantages. It was larger, had more and better fruits, better water, and richer grasses. It had also a more <b>even</b> <b>surface,</b> and a more accessible plain. Rancocus Island was higher and more broken, and, while it might be a pleasanter place of residence than the Reef during the warm months, it never could be a place as pleasant as the plain of the Peak.|$|E
