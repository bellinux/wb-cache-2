5|$|In 77 BC, {{the senate}} sent one of Sulla's former lieutenants, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great"), {{to put down}} an {{uprising}} in Hispania. By 71 BC, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, Marcus Licinius Crassus, had <b>just</b> <b>put</b> down the Spartacus-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the populares party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution. They attempted to forge {{an agreement with the}} populares party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70 BC, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The two were soon elected, and quickly dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.|$|E

As soon as they were elected, they dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.|$|E
25|$|OPP’s {{research}} revealed {{two significant}} factors; first, there was unlimited demand for {{products and services}} of these family units. Second, the family units were extremely competitive (on account of very low over heads and very cheap and docile labour).

In fact many units are supplying goods to famous firms, who <b>just</b> <b>put</b> their labels and make big profits. What is required is to support their initiatives.|$|E

500|$|Given {{the legal}} system's {{affirmation}} of its position, the SP began to forcibly {{remove some of}} the settlers. Their agents would attempt to serve eviction notices, but often would not find anyone at home, as homeowners knew they were coming. In these cases, the agents then tried removing the furniture from the homes, but the Settler's League would <b>just</b> <b>put</b> the furniture back after the agents' departure. Finally, it escalated to {{the point at which the}} agents would then disassemble the houses, but again, volunteers would <b>just</b> <b>put</b> them back together. The settlers were not above their own brand of justice, either. People who had purchased land from those forced to sell would be harassed by locals, and in one case one farmer who had aligned with the SP had his house burned down. Those supporting the railroads tended to be wealthier than the others, deriding the Settler's League as [...] "a set of demagogues" [...] who were [...] "very anxious to get something for nothing." ...|$|E

[...] This was, however, partially refuted in 2016 by road manager Peter Grumley, {{who claimed to have}} purchased and stored {{at least one of the}} sets in his West Auckland warehouse.|$|E
500|$|Pitbull and Jim Jones also {{recorded}} freestyle raps over the song.

500|$|Several {{commentators}} have rated Kelly the best accompanist in jazz, including critic Ray Comiskey and music educator Mark Levine. Drummer Philly Joe Jones said that, as an accompanist, Kelly [...] "puts down flowers behind a soloist. He {{never wanted to}} steal in. He <b>just</b> <b>put</b> together the right things." [...] Pianist Bruce Barth pointed out that part of Kelly's success as an accompanist came from [...] "occasional and compelling use of 'blues licks' and melodic phrases in place of chords." ...|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on Australia's {{involvement}} in the Vietnam War, Wilton considered that it was justified, and that the West's intervention helped delay the takeover of South Vietnam, {{and the spread of}} communism to Laos and Cambodia, by almost a decade. [...] "Whether that was worthwhile", he added, [...] "is a matter for the historian to judge". The key lesson, he felt, was not to intervene in a conflict [...] "unless you are prepared to win", because it was [...] "not something that you can <b>just</b> <b>put</b> one foot in and feel the temperature".|$|E

Disagreeing with the other Sepultura members, Max said, [...] "If this is how it's going down, I'm out. I quit. I can't <b>just</b> <b>put</b> a mask on and backstab a bunch of people that trust me."

500|$|On the 41st {{episode of}} Transmission Gagavision, Gaga {{announced}} that the song {{was going to be}} released soon. She added the abstract message along with the announcement: [...] "Let the cultural baptism begin. If they were not who you were taught they would be, would you still believe?" [...] "Judas" [...] was scheduled to be sent to mainstream airplay on April 19, 2011, and digital retailers on the same day, but after the track was leaked to the internet, its release was brought forward to April 15, 2011. This was done to counteract the pre-release leaks. Before the release, Gaga tweeted about the single, saying: [...] "#PawsUpForJudas! I've learned love is like a brick, you can build a house or sink a dead body." [...] On April 15, 2011, hours before the song was played on radio she again tweeted: [...] "Even After Three Times He Betrays Me," [...] she wrote, harking back to the song's lyrics about love and betrayal. In the United Kingdom, the song premiered on The Capital FM Network on April 15, 2011, during their program Home Run. Gaga addressed the leak in the 43rd episode of Transmission Gagavision, likening it to a disembodiment, saying, [...] "A slow death! <b>Just</b> <b>put</b> me out of my f---ing misery, <b>just</b> <b>put</b> that sh-- out. They were tearing [...] limb for limb. First it was the arm of the song, then the liver...." ...|$|E
500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series and every time I looked at the award I kept on thinking that people would be expecting so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it. In the end, I <b>just</b> <b>put</b> the thing away." [...] The series then went on to win BAFTAs for its entire run.|$|E
500|$|Lateef of Latyrx {{notes that}} Wallace had, [...] "intense and complex flows", Fredro Starr of Onyx says, [...] "Biggie {{was a master}} of the flow", and Bishop Lamont states that Wallace {{mastered}} [...] "all the hemispheres of the music". [...] "Notorious B.I.G. also often used the single-line rhyme scheme to add variety and interest to his flow". Big Daddy Kane suggests that Wallace didn't need a large vocabulary to impress listeners – [...] "he <b>just</b> <b>put</b> his words together a slick way and it worked real good for him". Wallace was known to compose lyrics in his head, rather than write them down on paper, in a similar way to Jay-Z.|$|E

500|$|Though it {{was noted}} that even [...] "She" [...] has [...] "passing moments of lyrical {{humanity}} to go with the pliant music ("When I'm with my friends I <b>just</b> <b>put</b> on a front / But {{in the back of my}} top I'm writing songs about 'we'"). It's almost like there's boyish innocence lurking underneath all that bile." [...] The Village Voices Eric Harvey mused that the [...] "sinuous Frank Ocean feature [...] "She" [...] ramps up the voyeurism" [...] and noted that he [...] "keeps things within a Rear Window framework. He admits he's going through the dating motions strictly to get laid, but he also says that his violent front is just a show for his boys." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Way Too Cold" [...] was {{produced}} by Hit-Boy, a producer signed to West's label GOOD Music, known for his production on [...] "Niggas in Paris". [...] According to Hit-boy, he had [...] "made the beat a couple months ago, just in a session messing around" [...] and that Kanye [...] "just did the record maybe {{a week and a}} half ago. We actually don’t know if it's going to be on Khaled's album or ‘Ye's album. We <b>just</b> <b>put</b> it out because we felt like it was so urgent, people just needed to hear it."

500|$|Eyder Peralta of The Houston Chronicle was {{critical}} of Izzie's ethics in cutting Denny's LVAD wire, writing that she [...] "should not be practising medicine" [...] and stating: [...] "That's the reason I don't watch Grey's Anatomy, anymore, because the super hot blond chick can make an earth-shattering, fatal decision and she doesn't get canned." [...] Regarding the second season, Kevin Carr from 7M Pictures said [...] "Rhimes really <b>just</b> <b>put</b> Scrubs, E.R., Sex and the City and even a dash of The Love Boat in a blender and poured out Grey's Anatomy." [...] Also {{in regard to the}} second season, Christopher Monfette of IGN TV said [...] " [...] The second season of this medical drama expertly wove its signature elements of complex relationships, whimsical banter and challenging life-lessons - all to a montage-fetish, indie-rock soundtrack".|$|E
