The {{development}} of the complex smart system of technical condition monitoring is offered and is supported for monitoring of metal and nonmetallic elements of construction at the operation, which concerns {{a new class of}} diagnostic systems on the basis of concept Structural Health Monitoring. Structurally functional synthesis of system is carried out. The generalized block diagram is developed, and the principle of functioning of system is proved. The <b>functional</b> <b>chart</b> of multichannel system of monitoring of construction elements of welded tanks is developed for an estimation of static and dynamic loadings and an estimation of a current technical condition of the testing object. The following measuring channels of system are generated: the channel of measurement of vibration, the channel inclinometer, the channel of measurement of deformation. Block diagrammes are developed, simulation and the analysis of characteristics of measuring channels is carried out. The diagnostic server is developed for management of processes of measurement, registration, transformation, transfer and the analysis of data, decision-making on a current technical condition and operational loadings. Algorithms and the software, the graphic interface of program and conservation of diagnostic data are developed on the basis of external module ADT which co-operates with system LabVIEW. The qualifier of a technical condition {{on the basis of a}} probability neural network is developed, which provides nonlinear classification diagnostics data. Efficiency of the developed qualifier is confirmed at recognition of faultless and defective conditions (the relative size of a crack 0, 05) of elements by using two-dimensional features. As a part of a diagnostic server the module of management is developed. It is realized as virtual device in system LabVIEW. The working capacity of the virtual device and stability of work of the network interface and communication channels is confirmed.

40|$|Abstract The {{establishment}} of gut microbiota immediately after birth is modulated by different mechanisms {{that can be}} considered specific determinants of temporal and spatial variability. Over the last few years, molecular methods have been offering a complementary support to the classical microbiology, often underpowered by its inability to provide unbiased representation of gut microbiota. The advent of high-throughput-omics-based methods has opened new avenues in {{the knowledge of the}} gut ecosystem by shedding light on its shape and modulation. Such methods may unveil taxa distribution, role and density of microbial habitants, hence highlighting individual phenotyping (physiological traits) and their relationship with gut dysbiosis, inflammation processes, metabolic disorders (pathological conditions). Synergic meta-omics or "systems biology"-based approaches may concur in providing advanced information on microbiota establishment and pathogen control.

30|$|A <b>functional</b> SPC <b>chart</b> {{requires}} the calculations {{of the limits}} displayed in Fig.  1 and plotting {{the values of the}} quality characteristic over time. For this purpose, different assumptions need to be made on the type of the quality characteristics under study, and some other considerations, such as sample size and the number of sub-groups. While the observations are within the control limits (UCL and LCL), the process is assumed to be in the statistical control. However, when observations show an unusual behavior or are placed outside the control limits, a signal is issued which means that significant sources of variability are present. In this situation, some investigations should be made, and corrective/preventive actions need to be taken. Systematic use of such control charts is an effective way for keeping the values of the quality characteristics around the target with minimum variability. For more detail on the use of modern statistical control charts, please refer to Montgomery (2013) and Okland (2007) which provide a comprehensive view of statistical control charts, from basic principles to state-of-the-art concepts and applications.|$|R

Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is {{a member}} of the lipocalin superfamily; {{dysregulated}} expression of NGAL has been observed in several benign and malignant diseases. In the present study, differentially expressed genes, in comparison with those of control cells, in the mRNA expression profile of EC 109 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells following NGAL overexpression were analyzed by multiple bioinformatic tools for a comprehensive understanding. A total of 29 gene ontology (GO) terms associated with immune func-tion, chromatin structure and gene transcription were identified among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NGAL overexpressing cells. In addition to the detected GO categories, the results from the <b>functional</b> annotation <b>chart</b> revealed that the differentially expressed genes were also associated with 101 functional annotation category terms. A total of 59 subpath-ways associated locally with the differentially expressed genes were identified by subpathway analysis, a markedly greater total that detected by traditional pathway enrichment analysis only.

40|$|Present work {{is devoted}} to {{locating}} and clamping of prismatic parts in fixtures during the machining on drilling-milling-boring machines. The special feature of locating schemes of parts of the present type {{is that one of}} the flat surfaces is used as a datum (3 contact points) ensuring stability, convenience of locating and vibration elimination during the machining process. Within the scope of the presented work, the comprehensive mathematical model of the system “fixture – workpiece” has been developed taking into account technological features of locating and clamping processes of workpiece in fixture. The methodology of determination of the rigidity of the cutting tool and functional elements has been proposed. As a result, the static and dynamic analysis of the workpiece in the fixture under the effect of spatial system of cutting and clamping forces is being determined. In addition, the free frequencies of the system “fixture-workpiece” and forms of the free and forced vibrations, frequency-response characteristics are being determined.

40|$|Exploration of the Role of ROC’s Armed Forces in Disaster Prevention and Relief and Defense Mobilization can {{be divided}} into two aspects: {{theoretical}} legal system and practical operations. In the aspect of theoretical legal system, after the Earthquake on September 21 st, 1999 in Taiwan, a “Disaster Prevention and Protection Act” was enacted to specifically administer disaster prevention and relief efforts. Pursuant to the Act, the Framework for Disaster Prevention and Relief was erected and relevant laws for Defense Mobilization were enacted. Japan’s compound disaster on March 11 th in 2011 prompted Taiwan to reform its <b>functional</b> organizational <b>chart</b> for compound disaster. In accordance with the “Act of All-Out Defense Mobilization Preparation,” Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense acts as a Secretary for the "Executive Yuan Mobilization Meeting" and integrates related agencies and all level governments in the joint implementation of mobilization preparations in eight major fields. Although the Ministry of National Defense may initiate disaster relief efforts, the armed forces primarily play an assistant role. In practical operations, when assisting local government to carry out relief efforts during drills, the armed forces find some major problems, including: professionalism and verisimilitude need improving in simulation drills; local governments lack realist understanding of the relief capabilities of the armed forces; critical details lack conclusive planning efforts; evacuation and reception mechanisms need improving. In the future, the Ministry of National Defense will follow the policy guidance, such as “prepare for disaster in advance, deploy troops with an eye to disaster preparedness, and ensure readiness for rescue operations,” make efforts to enhance its coordination with local governments, and consolidate its relief education and training programs, so as to protect the lives and assets of the people whenever the need arises...|$|R
