40|$|AbstractMicro {{turbine engine}} (MTE) is an {{important}} kind of propulsion system for miniature unmanned aircraft or missiles, because of its better high-speed performance (than propeller propulsion) and higher propulsion efficiency (obviously than rockets). Windmill start is a common air-starting mode used in micro turbine <b>engine.</b> The <b>windmill</b> starting characteristics {{are important to the}} practical use of micro turbine engine. In this paper, the windmill starting characteristics research for a 12 cm diameter (MTE-D) micro turbine engine is carried out by experiment and numerical simulation. The characteristic of rotor mechanical losses at low-speed condition is studied, and the engine common working line of windmill starting process is obtained. Based on the <b>engine</b> <b>windmill</b> characteristics, the propane ignition characteristics under different inflow conditions are researched, and the envelope of propane ignition and propane flameout is determined. The experimental research of fuel supply and ignition characteristics is completed, and the envelope of fuel supply and ignition is obtained. The windmill stage, propane ignition stage, fuel ignition stage and acceleration process from idling-speed to 80 % full speed of MTE-D micro turbine engine is optimized, and the optimization windmill starting parameters are collected. The successful windmill starting experiment under this condition with engine speed up to 80 % full speed indicates that these starting parameters are reasonable. All the starting parameters of MTE-D micro turbine engine obtained in this work are dimensionless parameters, and the conclusions obtained in this study have some reference to other micro turbine engines with the similar structural form and starting process...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of a decoupler and a controlled-feathering device incorporated with the YT- 56 A turboprop engine {{has been made to}} determine the effectiveness of these devices in reducing the high negative thrust (drag) which accompanies power failure of this type of engine. Power failures were simulated by fuel cut-off, both without either device free to operate, and with each device free to operate singly. The investigation was made through an airspeed range from 50 to 230 mph. It was found that with neither device free to operate, the drag levels realized after power failures at airspeeds above 170 mph would impose vertical tail loads higher than those allowable for the YC- 130, the airplane for which the test power package was designed. These levels were reached in approximately one second. The maximum drag realized after power failure was not appreciably altered by the use of the decoupler although the decoupler did put a limit on the duration of the peak drag. The controlled-feathering device maintained a level of essentially zero drag after power failure. The use of the decoupler in the YT- 56 A <b>engine</b> complicates <b>windmilling</b> air-starting procedures and makes it necessary to place operating restrictions on the engine to assure safe flight at low-power conditions,...|$|R

5000|$|In 1871 the Wijnserpolder {{was founded}} and the mill built {{replacing}} several privately owned mills. The millwright was probably Gerben van Wieren from Janum as the mill {{is very similar}} to windmill De Victor, Warnswerd built by the same millwright. In 1924 a millers house was built next to the mill which still exists today. The mill was in need of renovation by 1926 and the option of installing an electric pump was considered but this proofed too expensive. In stead the mill was modernised in 1932, replacing the patent sails with airfoil shaped dekkerised sails, a steel Archimedes' screw with Dekker roller bearings and a bronze windshaft bearing. These changes improved efficiency but made the mill susceptible to over speeding in blustery winds. When the inner stock had to be replaced in 1957 the Dekker system was removed and a Fok system was fitted. The other stock was fitted with the Fok system sometime later after the steel plates of the airfoil had worn out. This system was also a lot cheaper.Sierksma was miller until 1967 when he had to stop for health reasons. Difficulties with the housing requirements for a new miller meant that no new miller was hired but two board members of the Wijnserpolder waterboard themselves operated the mill. Until 1975 the polder was drained solely by wind power. In this year the drive wheels and upright shaft were removed and put to one side and a diesel <b>engine</b> from <b>windmill</b> De Hoop, Roodkerk was installed. As a diesel powered pumping station the mill continued to operate until 1984 when its function was taken over by the newly built electric pumping station [...] "De Murk". The windmill slowly fell into disrepair and demolition was considered before it was taken over by Stichting De Fryske Mole and restored in 1995. Since then it is operated by volunteer millers and is designated as a backup pumping station in case of emergencies. During the last restoration of 2010/2011 amongst other work a stock and the screw were replaced.|$|R
5000|$|The 1841 act of {{parliament}} authorized the building of an engine to drain Bourne North Fen, replacing <b>engines</b> (probably <b>windmills),</b> erected after an act of 1776, which were described as [...] "dilapidated, decayed and entirely removed". The act of 1843 transferred all responsibility for this engine and the drainage from the Black sluice commissioners to the Bourne North Fen Commissioners, [...] a separation of responsibilities that continued until after the Second World War. [...] The machinery for lifting the water off the fen is situated {{on the side of}} the Forty-Foot drain at Gutheram Cote, and was erected by the Butterly Iron Company. It consists of a condensing beam engine of 30 N.H.P, the boiler pressure being originally 6lbs., but now increased to 9lbs. The cylinder is 45 inches in diameter and the stroke 6 ft. The engine works an iron scoopwheel, 15ft. in diameter, and 4ft. 3in. wide, having 30 scoops, their length being 3ft. 10in. The dip is regulated by a vertical shuttle placed near the wheel, and the dip allowed being about 2ft. The maximum lift is 4ft., the head and dip being 6ft. The engines are stopped when this lift is attained, as the water is then level with the gauge fixed under the clause in the Act. The wheel makes 4.5 revolutions a minute and the engine 19. With a full head, 2.5 tons of coal are consumed in 24 hours. This gives a coal consumption of 200.37 lbs. per horse power, per hour, of water actually lifted, which is very extravagant, modern engines and centrifugal pumps running with a consumption of 4.5lbs. per hour whilst the maximum allowed by the Dutch authorities is 6.60lbs.The area of land drained is about 4,000 acres, but only 3,500 acres are liable to taxation.The level of the Fen varies from 4ft. to 6ft. above the Ordnance datum, or from 12ft. to 13ft. above the sill of the Black Sluice which is 20 miles distant.

Before the present analysis code was developed, all the major aircraft engine and airframe manufacturers in the United States and overseas were performing similar types of analyses to ensure the structural integrity of engine-airframe systems. Although there were many similarities among the analysis procedures, each manufacturer was developing and maintaining its own structural analysis capabilities independently. This situation led to high software development and maintenance costs, complications with manufacturers exchanging models and results, and limitations in predicting the structural response to the desired degree of accuracy. An industry-NASA team was formed to overcome these problems by developing a common analysis tool that would satisfy all the structural analysis needs of the industry and that would be available and supported by a commercial software vendor so that the team members would be relieved of maintenance and development responsibilities. Input from all the team members was used to ensure that everyone's requirements were satisfied and that the best technology was incorporated into the code.

40|$|The article {{describes}} high-level mathematical models developed to solve special problems arising at later stages of design {{with regard to}} calculation of the aircraft gas turbine engine (GTE) under real operating conditions. The use of blade row mathematics models, as well as mathematical models of a higher level, including 2 D and 3 D description of the working process in the engine units and components, {{makes it possible to}} determine parameters and characteristics of the aircraft engine under conditions significantly different from the calculated ones. The paper considers application of mathematical modelling methods (MMM) for solving a wide range of practical problems, such as forcing the engine by injection of water into the flowing part, estimate of the thermal instability effect on the GTE characteristics, simulation of <b>engine</b> start-up and <b>windmill</b> starting condition, etc. It shows that the MMM use, when optimizing the laws of the compressor stator control, as well as supplying cooling air to the hot turbine components in the motor system, can significantly improve the integral traction and economic characteristics of the engine in terms of its gas-dynamic stability, reliability and resource. It ought to bear in mind that blade row mathematical models of the engine are designed to solve purely "motor" problems and do not replace the existing models of various complexity levels used in calculation and design of compressors and turbines, because in “quality” a description of the working processes in these units is inevitably inferior to such specialized models. It is shown that the choice of the mathematical modelling level of an aircraft engine for solving a particular problem arising in its designing and computational study is to a large extent a compromise problem. Despite the significantly higher "resolution" and information ability the motor mathematical models containing 2 D and 3 D approaches to the calculation of flow in blade machine components have found quite a limited application in practice of computational studies of the aircraft engines and are mainly used in designing the fans, compressors and turbines, as well as in verifying autonomous calculations of these units. </p...|$|R
