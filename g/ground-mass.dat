50|$|Apatite, magnetite, and zircon, all {{in small}} but {{frequently}} perfect crystals, are almost universal minerals of the quartz-porphyries. The <b>ground-mass</b> is finely crystalline {{and to the}} unaided eye has usually a dull aspect resembling common earthenware; it is grey, green, reddish or white. Often it is streaked or banded by flow during cooling, but as a rule these rocks are not vesicular.|$|E
50|$|The quartz {{crystals}} {{exist in}} a fine-grained matrix, usually of micro-crystalline or felsitic structure. In specimens, the quartz appears as small rounded, clear, greyish, vitreous blebs, which are crystals, double hexagonal pyramids, with their edges and corners rounded by resorption or corrosion. Under the microscope they are often seen to contain rounded enclosures of the <b>ground-mass</b> or fluid cavities, which are frequently negative crystals with regular outlines resembling those of perfect quartz crystals. Many of the latter contain liquid carbonic acid and a bubble of gas that may exhibit vibratile motion under high magnifying powers.|$|E
50|$|The lavas, having cooled {{rapidly in}} contact with the air or water, are mostly finely {{crystalline}} or have at least fine-grained <b>ground-mass</b> representing that part of the viscous semi-crystalline lava flow that was still liquid at the moment of eruption. At this time they were exposed only to atmospheric pressure, and the steam and other gases, which they contained in great quantity were free to escape; many important modifications arise from this, the most striking being the frequent presence of numerous steam cavities (vesicular structure) often drawn out to elongated shapes subsequently filled up with minerals by infiltration (amygdaloidal structure).|$|E
50|$|Two main types may be {{recognized}} {{by means of the}} microscope; the felsitic and the microcrystalline. In the former the ingredients are so fine-grained that in the thinnest slices they cannot be determined by means of the microscope. Some of these rocks show perlitic or spherulitic structure, and such rocks were probably originally glassy (obsidians or pitchstones), but by lapse of time and processes of alteration have slowly passed into very finely crystal-line state. This change is called devitrification; it is common in glasses, as these are essentially unstable. A large number of the finer quartz-porphyries are also in some degree silicified of impregnated by quartz, chalcedony and opal, derived from the silica set free by decomposition (kaolinization) of the original feldspar. This re-deposited silica forms veins and patches of indefinite shape or may bodily replace a considerable area of the rock by metasomatic substitution. The opal is amorphous, the chalcedony finely crystalline and often arranged in spherulitic growths that yield an excellent black cross in polarized light. The microcrystalline <b>ground-masses</b> are those that can be resolved into their component minerals in thin slices by use of the microscope. They prove to consist essentially of quartz and feldspars, which are often in grains of quite irregular shape (microgranitic).|$|R
50|$|As {{crystallization}} {{was going}} on while the mass was still creeping forward {{under the surface of}} the Earth, the latest formed minerals (in the <b>ground-mass)</b> are commonly arranged in subparallel winding lines that follow the direction of movement (fluxion or fluidal structure)â€”and larger early minerals that previously crystallized may show the same arrangement. Most lavas fall considerably below their original temperatures before emitted. In their behavior, they present a close analogy to hot solutions of salts in water, which, when they approach the saturation temperature, first deposit a crop of large, well-formed crystals (labile stage) and subsequently precipitate clouds of smaller less perfect crystalline particles (metastable stage).|$|E
50|$|If {{the rock}} was {{originally}} banded or foliated (as, for example, a laminated sandstone or a foliated calc-schist) this character {{may not be}} obliterated, and a banded hornfels is the product; fossils even may have their shapes preserved, though entirely recrystallized, and in many contact-altered lavas the vesicles are still visible, though their contents have usually entered into new combinations to form minerals that were not originally present. The minute structures, however, disappear, often completely, if the thermal alteration is very profound. Thus small grains of quartz in a shale are lost or blend with the surrounding particles of clay, and the fine <b>ground-mass</b> of lavas is entirely reconstructed.|$|E
50|$|In {{igneous rocks}} the first {{generation}} of crystals generally forms before the lava has emerged to the surface, that is to say, during the ascent from the subterranean depths to the crater of the volcano. It has frequently been verified by observation that freshly emitted lavas contain large crystals borne along in a molten, liquid mass. The large, well-formed, early crystals (phenocrysts) are said to be porphyritic; the smaller crystals of the surrounding matrix or <b>ground-mass</b> belong to the post-effusion stage. More rarely lavas are completely fused at the moment of ejection; they may then cool to form a non-porphyritic, finely crystalline rock, or if more rapidly chilled may in large part be non-crystalline or glassy (vitreous rocks such as obsidian, tachylyte, pitchstone).|$|E
5000|$|The phenocrysts or {{porphyritic}} minerals are {{not only}} larger {{than those of the}} ground-mass; as the matrix was still liquid when they formed they were free to take perfect crystalline shapes, without interference by the pressure of adjacent crystals. They seem to have grown rapidly, as they are often filled with enclosures of glassy or finely crystalline material like that of the <b>ground-mass</b> [...] Microscopic examination of the phenocrysts often reveals that they have had a complex history. Very frequently they show layers of different composition, indicated by variations in color or other optical properties; thus augite may be green in the center surrounded by various shades of brown; or they may be pale green centrally and darker green with strong pleochroism (aegirine) at the periphery.|$|E
50|$|There is {{typically}} {{no distinction between}} a first generation of large well-shaped crystals and a fine-grained <b>ground-mass.</b> The minerals of each have formed in a definite order, and each has had a period of crystallization that may be very distinct or may have coincided with or overlapped the period of formation {{of some of the}} other ingredients. Earlier crystals originated {{at a time when most}} of the rock was still liquid and are more or less perfect. Later crystals are less regular in shape because they were compelled to occupy the spaces left between the already-formed crystals. The former case is said to be idiomorphic (or automorphic); the latter is xenomorphic. There are also many other characteristics that serve to distinguish the members of these two groups. For example, orthoclase {{is typically}} feldspar from granite, while its modifications occur in lavas of similar composition. The same distinction holds for nepheline varieties. Leucite is common in lavas but very rare in plutonic rocks. Muscovite is confined to intrusions. These differences show the influence of the physical conditions under which consolidation takes place.|$|E
50|$|The other {{determining}} factor, {{namely the}} physical conditions attending consolidation, {{plays on the}} whole a smaller part, yet {{is by no means}} negligible. Certain minerals are practically confined to deep-seated intrusive rocks, e.g., microcline, muscovite, diallage. Leucite is very rare in plutonic masses; many minerals have special peculiarities in microscopic character according to whether they crystallized in depth or near the surface, e.g., hypersthene, orthoclase, quartz. There are some curious instances of rocks having the same chemical composition, but consisting of entirely different minerals, e.g., the hornblendite of Gran, in Norway, which contains only hornblende, has the same composition as some of the camptonites of the same locality that contain feldspar and hornblende of a different variety. In this connection we may repeat what has been said above about the corrosion of porphyritic minerals in igneous rocks. In rhyolites and trachytes, early crystals of hornblende and biotite may be found in great numbers partially converted into augite and magnetite. Hornblende and biotite were stable under the pressures and other conditions below the surface, but unstable at higher levels. In the <b>ground-mass</b> of these rocks, augite is almost universally present. But the plutonic representatives of the same magma, granite and syenite contain biotite and hornblende far more commonly than augite.|$|E
50|$|A second mode of {{occurrence}} of tachylite {{is in the}} form of lava flows. Basaltic rocks often contain a small amount of glassy <b>ground-mass,</b> and in the limburgites this becomes more important and conspicuous, but vitreous types are far less common in these than in the acid lavas. In the Hawaiian Islands, however, the volcanoes have poured out vast floods of black basalt, containing feldspar, augite, olivine, and iron ores in a black glassy base. They are highly liquid when discharged, and the rapid cooling that ensues on their emergence to the air prevents crystallization taking place completely. Many of them are spongy or vesicular, and their upper surfaces are often exceedingly rough and jagged, while at other times they assume rounded wave-like forms on solidification. Great caves are found where the crust has solidified and the liquid interior has subsequently flowed away, and stalactites and stalagmites of black tachylite adorn the roofs and floors. On section these growths show usually a central cavity enclosed by walls of dark brown glass in which skeletons and microliths of augite, olivine and feldspar lie imbedded. From the crater of Mt. Kilauea, thin clouds of steam rise constantly, and as the bubbles of vapor are liberated from the molten rock they carry into the air with them thin fibers of basalt that solidify at once and assume the form of tachylite threads. Under the microscope they prove to be nearly completely glassy with small circular air vesicles sometimes drawn out to long tubes. Only in the Hawaiian Islands are glassy basaltic lavas of this kind at all common. A small outcrop at Spring Hill in Victoria, Australia has tachylite which has been exploited as a material for making Aboriginal flaked stone implements.|$|E
50|$|In {{other cases}} these two {{minerals}} are in graphic intergrowth, often forming radiate growths of spherulites consisting of fibers of extreme tenuity; this type {{is known as}} granophyric. There is another group in which the matrix contains small rounded or shapeless patches of quartz in which many rectangular feldspars are embedded; this structure is called micropoikilitic, and though often primary is sometimes developed by secondary changes that involve the deposit of new quartz in the <b>ground-mass.</b> As a whole those quartz-porphyries that have microcrystalline ground-masses are rocks of intrusive origin. Elvan is a name given locally to the quartz-porphyries that occur as dikes in Cornwall. In many of them the matrix contains scales of colorless muscovite or minute needles of blue tourmaline. Fluorite and kaolin appear also in these rocks, and the whole of these minerals are due to pneumatolytic action by vapors permeating the porphyry after it had consolidated but probably before it had entirely cooled. Many ancient rhyolitic quartz-porphyries show on their weathered surfaces numerous globular projections. They may be several inches in diameter, and vary from this size down to a minute fraction of an inch. When struck with a hammer they may detach readily from the matrix as if their margins were defined by a fissure. If they are broken across their inner portions are often seen {{to be filled with}} secondary quartz, chalcedony or agate: some of them have a central cavity, often with deposits of quartz crystals; they also frequently exhibit a succession of rounded cracks or dark lines occupied by secondary products. Rocks having these structures are common in north Wales and Cumberland; they occur also in Jersey, the Vosges and Hungary. It has been proposed to call them pyromerides.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{suite of}} {{volcanic}} {{rocks in the}} northwest corner of the Narragansett basin includes at least four basalt flows, two rhyolite flows, and associated pyroclastic rocks. The volcanics are interbedded with non-marine, sedimentary rocks within {{the lower part of the}} Wamsutta Formation and, until recently, were considered Pennsylva-nian in age. An age of about 373 Ma has been reported for the rhyolite, based on U/Pb geochronology (Thompson and others, 1999). The basalt flows are typically 1 to 2 m thick and marked by pillows, sediment dikes, and magma/sediment commingling features. The two younger flows contain intergranular to subophitic clinopyroxene and sparse phenocrysts of plagioclase and pseudomorphed olivine in a pilotaxitic <b>ground-mass.</b> The two older flows are similar but contain no pyroxene. The rhyolite flows, from 3 to 20 m thick, are characterized by subhorizontal quartz seams that represent cooling cracks or zones of preferential vesiculation filled with late-stage quartz. Both rhyolite flows contain phenocrysts of anorthoclase in a granophyric, devitrified <b>ground-mass</b> with relict perlitic features. Identification of pyroclastic deposits beneath one rhyolite flow indicates that extrusion was preceded by explosive activity. Major an...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. In {{addition}} to the normal type of chromite alteration, an antipathetic form of alteration has been observed in the ultramafic zone of the Panton Sill, Western Australia.

40|$|The Kuruman Kimberlite Province {{contains}} the oldest known kim-berlites in the Kaapvaal Craton (1 Â· 6 ^ 1 Â· 8 Ga), but only limited geochronological and isotopic data exist for this province.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of a combined chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical study of fine-grained opaque matrix material from a type- 3 ordinary chondrite Allan Hills A 77299.

40|$|A {{note on the}} {{controls}} of the retrograde transformation of andalusite to kyanite PURTSCHELLER (1969) reported some intriguing examples of disequilibrium among aluminium silicate polymorphs in metamorphic rocks from the 0 tztal, Austria. In particular, in certain rock compositions, a primary metamorphism produced andalu-site both as small crystals in pelitic rocks and as large crystals (several cm) in quartz pods in the rocks. During retrograde metamorphism, some large crystals in quartz pods were converted to kyanite pseudomorphs, others were not changed and the <b>ground-mass</b> fine andalusite of the host rock was little changed.

40|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of the Kerforne dyke tholeiitic basalts (Brittany, France), {{the northernmost}} outcrop of the 200 Ma Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP), is constrained by its zoned augite and plagioclase crystals. Augite cores with high Mg/Fe and Cr suggest crystallization from near-primary magmas, with slightly enriched Rare Earth element (REE) patterns. Plagioclase crystals with high-An (An 85) rounded cores are MgO- and K-rich, REE- poor, and display 87 Sr/ 86 Sr 200 Ma (0. 7058) {{significantly higher than}} those of the surrounding <b>ground-mass</b> (0. 7052 - 0. 7053) suggesting open-system evolution processes. We propose a differentiation process involving mixing of different mafic magmas which occurred in less than a few hundred years judging from the lack of diffusive re-equilibration of major and trace elements in augite and of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr 200 Ma in plagioclase cores. The relatively large range of incompatible element contents and ratios of observed and calculated magmas are possibly due fractional crystallization and to moderate amounts of crustal contamination which affected the more primitive magmas in particular. The calculated magmas reach near-primitive compositions and suggest that they originated from melting of a spinel peridotite slightly enriched in LREE vs. HREE...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Hydrothermal most pure {{potassium}} feldspar (adularia) forms incrustations on fissured wall {{rocks in}} an active geothermal environment. Measured max. temperature, 265 ~ and con-centration of K + and Na + cations in the geothermal fluid require K-feldspar and Na-feldspar to be deposited under equilibrium conditions. On fissure walls only K-feldspar is precipitated, whereas andesine phenocrysts of host rocks {{are replaced by}} both K-feldspar and Na-feldspar, and <b>ground-mass</b> of host rock is replaced by K-feldspar. Optical data indicate that K-feldspar forming incrustations i partly monoclinic, partly triclinic.

A primary origin for the triclinic adularia is postulated.

40|$|SUMMARY. The angular {{relationships}} among sets of olivine plates in barred chondrules were investi-gated on the universal stage {{to test a}} suggestion that such chondrules represent exsolution and inversion from a pre-existing jadeitic pyroxene. In one of sixty-seven cases tudied, adjacent plates represent olivine twinning on (IOO); the others vary randomly and correspond toneither olivine nor pyroxene twinning. On this basis and from other evidence, we conclude that the mineralogy and texture of barred chondrules are primary and due to rapid crystallization f ultrabasic magma in a low-pressure environment. OF the many and varied types of chondrules found in chondritic meteorites, the most bizarre are those that consist of optically parallel plates of olivine separated by a glassy, microcrystalline, or (in the more severely metamorphosed stones) crystalline <b>ground-mass.</b> In some cases (fig. I) a single set of plates is present; in others (fig. 2), two or more sets are present. Intergrowths of five or more sets {{are by no means}} rare.

40|$|Summary. Zonal myrmekitic and granophyric ntergrowths in {{plagioclase}} and K-feldspar phenocrysts are described. There are {{two such}} zones in the feldspars of the Late Granite, G 2, {{but only one}} in the Early Granite, G 1. The zonal granophyric intergrowths are the end-product ofthe replacement of myrmekitic plagioclases by K-feldspar. Transitional stages of this replacement, which took place in the solid state, are represented in numerous examples. The zones of myrmekite, which also represent growth in the solid state, occur between zones of magmatie plagioclase, which is oscillatory-zoned. It is concluded that the granites evolved at depth under the influence of at least hree phases of volcanic activity. Each of these phases re-sulted in the partial melting of the country rocks with subsequent magmatic crys-tallization, followed further, under the slow cooling conditions, by extensive r action in the solid state. During each of the final two phases, some of the granite was in-truded as a crystal mush to form G 1 and G 2, in which the phenocrysts retain evi-dence of their evolution at depth whilst the <b>ground-mass</b> gives evidence of the final magmatic crystallization. UNDY is the southernmost si e of igneous activity in the Atlantic Tertiary province. The island is composed primarily of granite although a group of Palaeozoic slates, into which the granite was emplaced, outcrop {{at the southern end of}} the island. A swarm of Tertiary basalt and trachyte dykes cuts both granite and slate. Dollar (1941) has made the most recent field study of the granite and concluded that there are two distinct granites.

40|$|New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating {{coupled with}} {{detailed}} fi eld mapping, stratigraphy, and chemical analyses have established an eruptive chro-nology that reveals and constrains the compo-sitional and volumetric evolution of Seguam Island in the Aleutian Island arc, Alaska. Sixty new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages from lavas, domes, and pyroclastic deposits were obtained using furnace incremental-heating techniques on replicate samples of whole-rock and <b>ground-mass</b> separates, and they constrain the dura-tion of Pleistocene to Holocene subaerial volcanism to 318 k. y. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar plateau ages indicate that over 85 % of the complex, ~ 68 km 3 of material, was erupted almost continuously between 318 ka and 9 ka. At ca. 9 ka, a stratocone {{on the eastern}} half of the island partially collapsed producing a 4 -km-wide crater. Rhyolitic dome-forming eruptions followed from vents in the newly created crater, and were likely contempora-neous with 8. 0 km 3 of basaltic and basaltic andesitic effusions from Pyre Peak, and a 1. 4 km 3 basaltic eruption from a monogenetic cone on the far eastern end of the island. Geo-chemical changes over the last 318 k. y. are subtle. Most notably, the earliest eruptions from 318 to 142 ka produced no andesite, and basalt from this period has larger ranges in Zr/Rb and La/Yb than younger basalts. Small volumes of dacitic to rhyolitic magma were produced from basalt by a monotonic crystal-liquid fractionation process that varied only slightly in successive eruptive phases over 318 k. y. We identifi ed minor geochemical changes in magma composition during each of the three main stages of vol-canism, but overall the monotonic variations in major- and trace-element compositions of basaltic andesitic to rhyolitic lavas are consistent with an origin via closed- system fractional crystallization of basalt.
