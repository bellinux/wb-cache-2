40|$|A {{strain gage}} {{particularly}} suited {{for use in}} detecting and measuring mechanically induced strain in thermally strained specimens including an elongated link, adapted to be <b>fixedly</b> <b>secured</b> {{to the surface of}} a specimen, having thermal expansion characteristics matched with those of the specimen, and characterized by a differential capacitor employed for detecting strain induced motion as such motion is effected between the link and the surface of the specimen...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{an instrument for}} high-precision or surgical applications of a minimally invasive nature, comprising a distally positioned directable head, a shaft upon which the head is positioned, and a proximally positioned handgrip for operating the head, wherein a ring of cables comprising longitudinally extending cables connects to the head, wherein each cable of the ring of cables is disposed such that at least a part of both sides is {{in direct contact with}} another cable of the ring of cables, and wherein the cables are <b>fixedly</b> <b>secured</b> in the radial direction. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{manufacturing}} a hot side regenerator cross arm seal assembly having a thermally stablilized wear coating with a substantially flat wear surface thereon to seal between low pressure and high pressure passages {{to and from}} the hot inboard side of a rotary regenerator matrix includes the steps of forming a flat cross arm substrate member of high nickel alloy steel; <b>fixedly</b> <b>securing</b> the side edges of the substrate member to a holding fixture with a concave surface thereacross to maintain the substrate member to a slightly bent configuration on the fixture surface between the opposite ends of the substrate member to produce prestress therein; applying coating layers on the substrate member including a wear coating of plasma sprayed nickel oxide/calcium flouride material to define a wear surface of slightly concave form across the restrained substrate member between the free ends thereon; and thereafter subjecting the substrate member and the coating thereon to a heat treatment of 1600. degree. F. for sixteen hours to produce heat stabilizing growth in the coating layers on the substrate member and to produce a thermally induced growth stress in the wear surface that substantially equalizes the prestress in the substrate whereby when the cross arm is removed from the fixture surface following the heat treatment step a wear face is formed on the cross arm assembly that will be substantially flat between the ends...|$|R
