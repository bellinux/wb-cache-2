The <b>killing</b> <b>operation</b> was completed in a single day at Majdanek and Trawniki. At Poniatowa the shootings took two days, because in one of the barracks Jews staged a revolt.

50|$|In December 1939 or January 1940, Wirth {{was present}} when twenty to thirty German mental {{patients}} {{were subjected to}} the first known gassing experiment using carbon monoxide. At Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre, the idea to disguise the gas chambers as shower rooms was introduced. Wirth continued to participate as a troubleshooter in the T-4 killing centers. For instance, when at Brandenburg a group of suspecting mental patients refused to enter the (disguised) gas chamber, Wirth coaxed them into the room by telling them {{that they had to}} enter it in order to receive clothing. But Wirth's most intimate connection with T-4 was at Hartheim, where he was chief of the office staff and director of personnel.

40|$|BIRDS incompletely bled during kill-ing {{operations}} are often unacceptable to consumers. Blood {{trapped in the}} small blood vessels under the skin, and particu-larly in the larger veins and arteries in the wings, make the birds unattractive. Good bleeding has come to mean a step toward good quality. In commercial oper-ations thorough bleeding within a very limited period of time is often difficult. I t would thus seem that attention should be directed toward methods of draining more blood from the birds in this time interval. Latimer and Pederson (1923) cited Zaitschek's studies to show that when the jugular vein of chickens whose aver-age live weight was 1096. 8 + 12. 3 gm. was severed, they lost 3. 8 percent of the aver-age live weight as blood. Turner (1948) found that decapitated White Leghorn hens varying in weight from 1803 gms. to 2043 gms. lost from 3. 2 to 2. 3 percent of their live weight as blood. The heavier hens lost proportionately less blood than the lighter hens. Newell and Schaffner (1950 a) indicated that a loss of 35 per-cent to 50 {{percent of the total}} blood of the body occurs during the bleeding phases of the <b>killing</b> <b>operation</b> with considerable variation in blood loss.

40|$|Key words: ethics; euthanasia; {{history of}} euthanasia; {{national}} socialism If euthanasia {{were to be}} made legal in other countries apart from the Netherlands and Belgium, nurses would be faced with ethical dilemmas that could impact on their professional accountability and their personal moral beliefs. As {{a part of history}} has demonstrated, the introduction of the practice of euthanasia could also significantly change the relationship between nurses and patients. In Germany between 1940 and 1945, in response to a government directive, nurses participated in the practice of euthanasia and as a result many innocent German people were killed by what were considered to be ‘mercy deaths’. It is important to try and understand the moral thinking and examine the complex issues at this historical junction that led German nurses to participate in the killing of thousands of innocent people. Such reflection may help to stimulate an awareness of the moral issues that nurses in the twenty-first century could confront if euthanasia were to be made legal in their own country. This has implications for future nursing practice. Clarification of terminology The term ‘euthanasia ’ as used by the National Socialists Friedlander states: Also called ‘mercy death’, the term was used as a euphemism to disguise their murder of the handicapped. They killed them for racial and eugenic reasons, not to ease the suffering of the individual. Their <b>killing</b> <b>operation</b> was a secret government program and not an act of individual mercy. It was not applied against persons suffering from common physical diseases like cancer but only against those considered ‘life unworthy of life’. The Nazis ’ victims did not suffer from diseases that were terminal or from disabilities that were necessarily incurable and their deaths were certainly not painless. ...|$|E
