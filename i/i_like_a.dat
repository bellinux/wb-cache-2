500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Marshall Chess formed Cadet Concept Records as a {{subsidiary}} of Chess Records. The label's first release was the self-titled debut album of the psychedelic band Rotary Connection, whose members Chess described as [...] "the hottest, most avant garde rock guys in Chicago". As {{a result of the}} album's success, Chess felt that he could revive the career of bluesmen Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf by recording two albums of experimental, psychedelic blues, producing the albums Electric Mud and The Howlin' Wolf Album. [...] Chess hoped the new albums would sell well among fans of psychedelic rock bands influenced by Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. According to Muddy Waters, [...] "Quite naturally, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good-selling record. I was looking at it because I played for so many of these so-called hippies that I thought probably I could reach them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{layout of}} the track {{received}} a mostly positive response from the drivers. Adrian Sutil of Force India said {{he felt it was}} a [...] "real pleasure" [...] to be racing on the track and praised it for having [...] "a lot of character". Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher said the asphalt improved during the Friday free practice sessions and that the track was [...] "very demanding and tricky which provides a challenge that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lot". Kubica said although the first sector was [...] "boring" [...] he felt the entire track layout was [...] "ten times better than Abu Dhabi". The drivers raised concerns about the entry of the pit lane at turn seventeen—a corner taken at [...] Kubica said, [...] "It might be quite tight if someone's pitting" [...] and Lotus driver Jarno Trulli said he was [...] "worried about someone going into the back of him" [...] when he was forced to pit because his car's gears were stuck in position. He also said the drivers would raise the point with Whiting.|$|E

5000|$|... "Love <b>Is</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Butterfly" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{recorded}} by American country music artist Dolly Parton. It was released in August 1974 as the first single and title track from the album Love <b>Is</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Butterfly. [...] "Love <b>Is</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Butterfly" [...] was her overall fourth {{number one on the}} country chart as a solo artist (and her third consecutive number one). The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of twelve weeks on the country chart.|$|R

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} immediately after Johnston finished the Britain's Got Talent live tour over a six-week period in London. The track listing, which contained both religious and popular songs, {{was chosen by}} Cowell; Johnston said [...] "I hadn't sung many of the tracks before. But I knew them all and, anyway, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> challenge." [...] Johnston described recording the album as [...] "great", and said [...] "All I’ve ever wanted {{to do is go}} into a studio and record an album and it was everything I’ve ever dreamed of." [...] Johnson recorded [...] "Walking in the Air" [...] as a duet with fellow Britain's Got Talent contestant Faryl Smith, and the song was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. The recording was finished by September 2008, after which Johnston began to make appearances to publicise the release, including appearances on GMTV, Channel 5 News, BBC Breakfast, This Morning and Radio 2's Friday Night Is Music Night. In preparation for the album's promotion, Johnston received confidence tutoring. He said that [...] "I've got no confidence and sometimes people get on at me for being moody so I've had some help with that." [...] Johnston also received vocal training from Yvie Burnett, who was, at the time, coaching Leona Lewis and Leon Jackson, and with whom Smith trained during Britain's Got Talent. The album was produced by Nigel Wright.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert Adair, {{writing in}} a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that [...] "Kubrick's {{approach}} to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I {{think you have to}} view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|E
500|$|Swivel {{dedicated}} {{much time}} in getting the vocal sound right, which according to him is crucial while working with Beyoncé's music. He further explained, [...] "I only put a quick EQ on the vocal {{at the end of}} a recording session if I have been cutting her, but mixing is far more particular, so I spent a lot of time dialling in the perfect frequency." [...] For the delay throws in the verses on [...] "I Care", he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent — half reverb, half clean — then through an Amp Farm plug‑in for the grittiness, and that then went through a quarter‑note delay. In the bridge, é matches the guitar solo vocally — that was doubled — and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that grittiness. To do justice to the multitude of vocal tracks within the song, Swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a Waves S1 Imager plug‑in. He said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record, [...] "I hate hard‑panned L/R. To get the right width, I pan them all differently in pairs: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, maybe one is 100/100, but this process is ultimately what creates the stereo field." [...] Swivel used Waves' SSL E‑Channel plug‑in to shape Beyoncé's lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without isolating he width. He added that something is hard‑panned, it feels too isolated and also confuses the listener's ears. Swivel explained further, [...] "I like smooth sound, and with B that works fine as she’s so good at matching everything. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wall of background vocals. It's the best way of putting your vocal in every area of the stereo field: a wide sound, but you’ve still got something there in the middle." ...|$|E

2500|$|While hosting Tubridy Tonight, {{he spoke}} of the public's {{perception}} of him, saying: [...] "I think I am a victim of my own image. I think it's been cultivated by others for me. I live in a very ordinary semi-detached house. People only ever see me on a Saturday night on TV and I'm in a smart suit with a book-lined backdrop so that's what they think – you're Johnny smart suit with a book-lined backdrop." [...] Referring to the type of woman he would like, Tubridy said: [...] "I like intelligence, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good conversation. I like elegance, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> girl who is feminine without being vain, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little retro in terms of fashion and look and sprinkle it with a little sense of humour.

It wasn't a script I liked, but I {{remember}} my agent at the time saying, [...] "Look, {{you only have to}} work two weeks, and they're going to pay you a lot of money. We'll just say it was your first movie and they just didn't release it." [...] I think people were all fucked up on drugs. I don't know.

2500|$|There {{is a story}} which relates {{that when}} the son of Johanan ben Zakai was very sick, the father {{solicited}} the prayers of Hanina. Hanina readily complied, and the child recovered. The overjoyed father could not refrain from expressing his admiration for his wonderful pupil, stating that he himself might have prayed the whole day without doing any good. His wife, astonished at such self-abasement {{on the part of}} her famous husband, inquired, [...] "Is Hanina greater than thou?" [...] To this he replied, [...] "There is this difference between us: he is like the body-servant of a king, having at all times free access to the august presence, without even having to await permission to reach his ears; while <b>I,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lord before a king, must await an opportune moment" [...] (Berakhot, 34b). Another tale states that, at the solicitation of Gamaliel II, Hanina entreated mercy for that patriarch's son, and at the conclusion of his prayers assured Gamaliel's messengers that the patient's fever had left him. This assurance created doubt {{in the minds of the}} messengers, who promptly asked, [...] "Art thou a prophet?" [...] To this he replied, [...] "I am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet; but experience has taught me that whenever my prayer flows freely it is granted; otherwise, it is rejected." [...] The messengers thereupon noted down Hanina's declaration, and the exact time when it was made; on reaching the patriarch's residence they found that Hanina had spoken truly (ibidem; compare Berakhot, v. 5 and Yerushalmi Berakhot, v. 9d).|$|E
