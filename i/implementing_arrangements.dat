The arrangement package of Cgal can construct and maintain arrangements of various families of curves, when {{provided with the}} representation of the curves and some basic geometric functionality on them. It employs the exact computation paradigm in order to handle all degenerate cases in a robust manner. We present the representations and algorithms that are needed for <b>implementing</b> <b>arrangements</b> of Bézier curves using exact arithmetic. Our framework is efficient and complete, handling all degenerate cases. In order to avoid the prohibitive running times incurred by an indiscriminate usage of exact arithmetic, we make extensive use of the geometric properties of Bézier curves for filtering.

40|$|Hyderabad {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing cities in India. To meet its rapidly {{expanding}} water needs, it constructed and began withdrawals from the Singur reservoir, located on a tributary of the Godavari River, in 1991. Administrative rules define allocation of water from the reservoir but prioritize Hyderabad urban needs over much longer established agricultural uses. Furthermore, the agricultural sector receives less water than even these rules allow, and urban withdrawals have changed the quantity and the timing of the water, which is available to agriculture. An increase in groundwater use by farmers may have been one response to these changes, with possible implications for surface and groundwater users further downstream. While proposals have been put forth to compensate the agricultural sector in general and the farmers directly affected by reallocation, for example by improving access to wastewater for irrigation downstream from Hyderabad or by conveying wastewater for irrigation purposes downstream Singur reservoir, compensation has not been implemented to date. The Hyderabad case study clearly highlights the advantages for devising and <b>implementing</b> <b>arrangements</b> to regulate the transfer of water from agriculture to cities, allowing a move from sectoral competition for water to efficient management of a scarce resource...|$|E

However, the assessment criteria used during this process focused on effectiveness, suitability, and interoperability areas—such as whether BMD elements can work together to track ballistic missile threats—and did not explicitly require DOD to comprehensively identify and plan to resolve implementation issues prior to deploying these capabilities. DOD plans to continue to use its existing process to accept BMD capabilities planned for Europe in the future. Without identifying and planning to resolve implementation issues before deployment, DOD risks continuing to encounter implementation issues after it deploys additional BMD capabilities in Europe, which may lead to significant delays and inefficiencies. ...|$|E

While seemingly harmless, the administrative power bears important legal consequences regarding the position of individuals, of third countries, and of the Union as a whole. In a system based on the rule of law (and committed to its respect in external relations), it is crucial to question whether <b>implementing</b> <b>arrangements</b> are in place or ought to be put in place with the aim of subjecting the external administrative power to administrative rules and principles. The analytical framework suggested by the thesis uses as a starting point the features and the impact of the administrative power externally. Based on this analysis, it identifies which administrative law principles (as developed {{within the framework of the}} internal market) have the potential of giving effect to the administrative rule of law externally once applied and operationalized in the external domain. Despite the increasing role granted to administrative power externally, administrative law in external relations is underdeveloped. Therefore, the analytical framework suggested by this thesis is relevant as it helps to ensure that the action of the Union in the international scene is carried out in compliance with its constitutional spiration, i. e. upholding the rule of law in its relations with the outer world, and as it structures the relation between the Union and individuals, and between the Union and third countries. The 'long-overdue encounter' between EU external relations and EU administrative law ought to be encouraged. The thesis aims to offer a methodology for structuring such an encounter and for planning venues for future meetings.

40|$|The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 - 2030 finds that, despite {{progress}} in disaster risk reduction {{over the last}} decade “evidence indicates that exposure of persons and assets in all countries has increased faster than vulnerability has decreased, thus generating new risk and a steady rise in disaster losses” (p. 4, UNISDR 2015). Fostering cooperation among relevant stakeholders and policy makers to “facilitate a science-policy interface for effective decisionmaking in disaster risk management” is required to achieve two priority areas for action, understanding disaster risk and enhancing disaster preparedness (p. 13, p. 23, UNISDR 2015). In other topic areas, the term science-policy interface is used interchangeably with the term boundary organisation. Both terms are usually used refer to systematic collaborative arrangements used to manage the intersection, or boundary, between science and policy domains, with the aim of facilitating the joint construction of knowledge to inform decision-making. Informed by complexity theory, and a constructivist focus on the functions and processes that minimize inevitable tensions between domains, this conceptual framework has become well established in fields where large complex issues have significant economic and political consequences, including environmental management, biodiversity, sustainable development, climate change and public health. To date, however, there has been little application of this framework in the disaster risk reduction field. In this doctoral project the boundary management framework informs an analysis of the research response to the 2010 - 2011 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence, focusing on the coordination role of New Zealand’s national Natural Hazards Research Platform. The project has two aims. It uses this framework to tell the nuanced story of the way this research coordination role evolved in response to both the complexity of the unfolding post-disaster environment, and to national policy and research developments. Lessons are drawn from this analysis for those planning and <b>implementing</b> <b>arrangements</b> across the science-policy boundary to manage research support for disaster risk reduction decision-making, particularly after disasters. The second aim is to use this case study to test the utility of the boundary management framework in the disaster risk reduction context. This requires that terminology and concepts are explained and translated in terms that make this analysis as accessible as possible across the disciplines, domains and sectors involved in disaster risk reduction. Key findings are that the focus on balance, both within organisations, and between organisations and domains, and the emphasis on systemic effects, patterns and trends, offer an effective and productive alternative to the more traditional focus on individual or organisational performance. Lessons are drawn concerning the application of this framework when planning and implementing boundary organisations in the hazard and disaster risk management context...|$|E
