It presents a technical solution where the disconnecting function is integrated in the breaking chamber, {{eliminating the need for}} separate <b>disconnectors.</b> This increases the availability, since open-air disconnecting switch main contacts need maintenance every 2–6 years, while modern circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years.

The mathematical relationship between the moving contact stroke and rotation angle of motor is obtained by analyzing the dynamical coordination characteristics of motor actuator used in 550 kV gas-insulated switchgear <b>disconnector.</b> The electromagnetic field equation of motor, motive equation of rotor, and circuit equation of winding are solved simultaneously for acquiring dynamical characteristics of motor.

5000|$|The sear on many {{firearms}} {{is often}} {{connected to a}} <b>disconnector,</b> which, after a cycle of semi-automatic fire has proceeded, keeps the hammer in place until the trigger is released and the sear takes over. Many firearms, such as the M1911 pistol, use a notch in the slide of the handgun that the top end of the <b>disconnector</b> returns to after the trigger is released. When the trigger is still under pressure by the firearm operator, the <b>disconnector</b> will not retract to its resting position. On other handguns, such as the Series 80 version of the M1911, a firing pin block acts as an internal safety, which is disengaged by the <b>disconnector</b> after the trigger is pulled.

50|$|<b>Disconnectors</b> have {{provisions}} for a lockout-tagout so that inadvertent operation is not possible. In high-voltage or complex systems, these locks {{may be part}} of a trapped-key interlock system to ensure proper sequence of operation. In some designs, the isolator switch has the additional ability to earth the isolated circuit thereby providing additional safety. Such an arrangement would apply to circuits which inter-connect power distribution systems where both ends of the circuit need to be isolated.|$|E
50|$|Unlike load {{switches}} and circuit breakers, <b>disconnectors</b> lack {{a mechanism for}} suppression of electric arcs, which occurs when conductors carrying high currents are electrically interrupted. Thus, they are off-load devices, intended to be opened only after current has been interrupted by some other control device. Safety regulations of the utility must prevent any attempt to open the disconnector while it supplies a circuit. Standards in some countries for safety may require either local motor isolators or lockable overloads (which can be padlocked).|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{elongated}} {{shape of}} the city and the terrain conditions, the trolleybus network was planned along main streets. The network is powered with overhead lines because most of the network is located on wide, bi-directional streets. The overhead lines are supported with lateral suspension lines or extension arms. From 1998, the overhead lines began to be overhauled with modern suspension lines produced by the Czech company Elektroline. Almost 80% of overhead line intersections and junctions were replaced with new parts. These new parts allow trolleybuses to use greater speeds. Additionally, 32 sectional isolators and two sectional <b>disconnectors</b> were installed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As {{a central}} {{component}} of any existing AC substation, <b>disconnector</b> switches {{are responsible for}} providing isolation between grid-connected and safely approachable sections of bus. Additionally, they can provide the capability of transferring load currents between different busses. Due to the excellent performance history in AC, possible challenges for <b>disconnector</b> switches in future HVDC substations were identified by comparing computed effects of DC stress to the standardized capabilities of existing AC <b>disconnector</b> switches. It was found that pure, time-constant DC voltages and currents will not lead to excessive stress onto <b>disconnector</b> switches. However, voltage and current ripples present in real HVDC systems can give rise to considerably different results. Ripples exhibiting a 1 /f decay in magnitude up to the 30 th harmonic were utilized in calculations. Similarly to AC, switching of sections of bus can lead to multiple restrikes or prestrikes, potentially resulting in very fast transients. The maximum voltage collapse exhibits a strong dependence on {{the magnitude of the}} voltage ripple. Transferring load currents between different busses {{has been shown to be}} possible under DC conditions. However, the recovery voltage as well as the extinction process itself depend heavily on the current ripple. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a disconnector, {{disconnect switch}} or isolator switch {{is used to}} ensure that an electrical circuit is completely de-energized for service or maintenance. Such switches are often found in electrical distribution and industrial applications, where machinery must have its source of driving power removed for adjustment or repair. High-voltage isolation switches are used in electrical substations to allow isolation of apparatus such as circuit breakers, transformers, and transmission lines, for maintenance. The disconnector is usually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. <b>Disconnectors</b> can be operated either manually or automatically.|$|E
50|$|Modern pump shotgun designs, {{such as the}} Remington 870 and Mossberg 500, have {{a safety}} feature called a trigger disconnector, which {{disconnects}} the trigger from the sear as the bolt moves back, so that the trigger must be released and pulled again to fire the shotgun after it closes. Many early pump shotguns, such as the Winchester 1897, did not have trigger <b>disconnectors,</b> and would, if the trigger were held back, fire immediately upon closing. Due to the higher rate of fire that this allows, some shooters prefer models without this feature, such as the Ithaca 37, Stevens Model 520/620, and Winchester Model 12.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone of}} the company was laid in Vienna in 1907 in the Wattgasse 53 in the 16th district Ottakring. The company initially produced knife switches, the forerunners of today's <b>disconnectors,</b> which are counted from construction to the simplest and the first electrical switches {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. The other main products in the first four decades of the company's existence were lever and roller switches. At the end of the 1920s the new plastic material bakelite was used in switch construction. Kraus & Naimer is the patent owner of numerous innovations in switchgear technology. For the first time, the company introduced a cam switch in the modular design (model C15) to the market in 1948, whereby customer-specific switches can be manufactured. The method of mass production of individual products is generally known in the industry also under the term mass customization.|$|E

40|$|Gas Insulated Substations (GIS) {{have found}} {{a broad range of}} {{applications}} in power systems because of their high reliability, easy maintenance, small ground space requirements etc. In a Gas insulated substations, the operation of <b>disconnector</b> switches and circuit breakers can cause Very Fast Transient Overvoltages (VFTOs), which will bring an instantaneous change in voltage with a very short rise time and it is normally followed by oscillation having high frequencies. For designing the insulation level of a substation, it is essential to know the maximum value of VFTO. Fast operating <b>disconnector</b> switches are usually used to reduce time of the breakdown; however, it cannot eliminate fully the effect of the VFTO.

50|$|The vz.58 uses {{a trigger}} {{mechanism}} with a lever-type fire mode selector, {{which is also}} a manual safety against accidental discharge. When the selector lever is placed in its rear position ("1"—single fire) the sear is disabled and the left hammer catch is rotated by the <b>disconnector,</b> which is depressed by the bolt carrier after every shot and is therefore disconnected from the hammer catch. The forward setting of the selector lever ("30"—automatic fire) disables the <b>disconnector,</b> and the left hammer catch meshes with the sear mechanism. The center ("safe") setting with the selector lever pointing vertically downwards, mechanically lowers the trigger bar and the <b>disconnector</b> so there is no connection between the trigger and the semi-automatic sear which holds the hammer. The rifle also has an internal safety, which prevents the weapon from discharging when out of battery. The right linear hammer catch disables it, and it can only be released by pulling the charging handle back and cocking the weapon.|$|R
