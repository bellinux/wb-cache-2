40|$|A generic {{prediction}} {{of general relativity}} is that the cosmological linear density growth factor D is scale independent.

A scale <b>dependent</b> <b>D</b> can cause time variation in gravitational potential at high redshifts and provides a new cosmological test of gravity, through early time integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect-large scale structure (LSS) cross correlation.

We outline its relation to α-attractor models for inflation, with the cosmological sector originating from certain string theory corrections leading to α= 2 and α= 1 / 2. Above a certain field range, the steepening effect of higher-order corrections leads first to the breakdown of single-field slow-roll and after that to the onset of 2 -field dynamics: the overall volume of the extra dimensions starts {{to participate in the}} effective dynamics. Finally, we propose effective supergravity models of fibre inflation based on an D 3 uplift term with a nilpotent superfield.

A total of 357, nonclinical students were selected through multistage sampling method and completed a set of questionnaires including IPSM. Internal consistency, convergent validity, divergent validity, and test-retest reliability of the Persian version of the IPSM were analyzed. To assess the construct validity, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed. Results: Total IPSM, as well as all subscales showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0. 86 and 0. 51 – 0. 71, respectively). Test-retest reliability at a 2 -week interval was significant, with intraclass correlation coefficient ranging between 0. 73 and 0. 92.

40|$|SUMMARY. ROC curves are {{a popular}} method for {{displaying}} {{sensitivity and specificity}} of a continuous diagnostic marker, X, for a binary disease variable, D. However, many disease outcomes are time <b>dependent,</b> <b>D</b> (t), and ROC curves that vary {{as a function of}} time may be more appropriate. A common example of a time-dependent variable is vital status, where D(t) = 1 if a patient has died prior t o time t and zero otherwise. We propose summarizing the discrimination potential of a marker X, measured at baseline (t = O), by calculating ROC curves for cumulative disease or death incidence by time t, which we denote as ROC(t). A typical complexity with survival data is that observations may be censored. Two ROC curve estimators are proposed that can accommodate censored data. A simple estimator is based on using the Kaplan-Meier estimator for each possible subset X> c. However, this estimator does not guarantee the necessary condition that sensitivity and specificity are monotone in X. An alternative estimator that does guarantee monotonicity is based on a nearest neighbor estimator for the bivariate distribution function of (X, T), where T represents survival time (Akritas, M. J., 1994, Annuls of Statistics 22, 1299 - 1327). We present an example where ROC(t) is used to compare a standard and a modified flow cytometry measurement for predicting survival after detection of breast cancer and an example where the ROC(t) curve displays the impact of modifying eligibility criteria for sample size and power in HIV prevention trials...|$|E
40|$|Introduction:Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) is {{the standard}} procedure {{for the detection of}} anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) rearrangement in non–small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) but is expensive and time consuming. We tested three antibodies to ALK, using various detection systems, and hypothesized that ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) may represent a cost-effective and efficient means of screening for ALK rearrangement in NSCLC. Methods:We screened 377 stage I or II NSCLC cases in a tissue microarray by FISH and IHC (5 A 4 [Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne, UYnited Kingdom] by Nichirei’s N-Histofine ALK detection kit [Nichirei Biosciences inc., Tokyo, Japan], 5 A 4 by Novocastra with ADVANCE [Dako Canada inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada], D 5 F 3 by Cell Signaling Technology with ADVANCE [Cell Signalling Technologies inc., Danvers, MA], and DAKO clone ALK 1 with FLEX [Dako Canada inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada] and ADVANCE). IHC was scored as 0, 1 +, 2 +, or 3 +. Possibly positive or positive cases were further analyzed by IHC and FISH on whole section. Results:Tissue microarray results were available on 377 cases by IHC and 273 cases by FISH. Eleven cases were positive or possibly positive by either IHC or FISH, and three cases were positive or possibly positive by both methods. Three cases were ALK-positive by FISH on whole section validation. There was no correlation between semiquantitative IHC score (1 +, 2 +, 3 +) and ALK rearrangement by FISH. D 5 F 3 (Cell Signaling by ADVANCE) and 5 A 4 (Novocastra by ADVANCE) showed the greatest combination of sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (87. 5 % for 5 A 4 by Novocastra and 75 % for D 5 F 3 by Cell Signaling), and produced no false-negative results. Conclusions:IHC is a reliable screening tool for identification of ALK rearrangement in NSCLC and is antibody <b>dependent.</b> <b>D</b> 5 F 3 (Cell Signaling) and 5 A 4 (Novocastra) can be used with FISH for identification of IHC-positive cases to reduce screening costs...|$|E
40|$|During space missions, astronauts {{are exposed}} to not only greater amounts of natural {{radiation}} than they receive on earth but also to a differing radiation quality, which can result in immediate and long-term risks. To estimate the cancer risk, the molecular and the cellular mechanisms of the response to cosmic radiation have to be uncovered. As the transcription factor Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) is involved in cell regulation of apoptosis (programmed cell death), it could influence the cellular outcome (survival, mutation, apoptosis) after radiation exposure and therefore the cancer risk. Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK/ 293) cells stably transfected with a receptor-reporter-construct carrying the destabilized variant of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (d 2 EGFP) {{under the control of}} the NF-κB response element were used in this work to analyse the NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to accelerated light and heavy ions. Irradiation was performed either with X-rays (150 kV), with 75 MeV/nucleon carbon or 29 MeV/nucleon lead ions at GANIL (LET 30 or 8800 keV/μm, respectively), Caen, or with 2. 1 MeV α particles (LET 160 keV/μm) at PTB, Braunschweig. After irradiation the following biological endpoints were determined (i) cell survival via the colony forming ability test, (ii) time-dependent activation of NF-κB <b>dependent</b> <b>d</b> 2 EGFP gene expression using flow cytometry, (iii) quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) of selected NF-κB target genes. High X-ray doses induce the expression of IκBα and GADD 45 β. After exposure with 1 nuclear hit of 2. 1 MeV α particles, d 2 EGFP fluorescence can already be seen. After exposure of HEK cells with 5 nuclear hits, maximal NF-κB activation is achieved. The NF-κB target genes IκBα and GADD 45 β are upregulated shortly after α-particle exposure. Exposure to carbon ions results in a slight activation of the NF-κB pathway. Lead ions induced the expression of the IκBα gene. The NF-κB pathway is activated by particle radiation, and the extent of activation seems to correlate with the LET of the applied radiation. As activation of the NF-κB pathway is supposed to play a role in the negative regulation of apoptosis, survival of cells with DNA damage might be favoured especially after low doses of densely ionising radiation...|$|E

Methods: The frequency and function of Tregs were evaluated in wild type and NKT cell deficient (CD 1 dko) mice. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis assays were performed with NKT cells co-cultured with Tregs. The ability of Tregs to inhibit NKT cells in vivo was examined by adoptive transfer of Tregs in a model of NKT cell mediated hepatitis.

Electron micrographs show morphological features typical of principal cells in vivo. Using the patch clamp technique distinct differences are detected in whole-cell membrane current and voltage (Vm) between single M- 1 cells 24 h after seeding vs cells grown to confluence. (a) Under control conditions (pipette: KCl- Ringer; bath: NaCl-Ringer) Vm averages - 42. 7 +/- 3. 4 mV in single cells vs - 16. 8 +/- 4. 1 mV in confluent cells. Whole-cell conductance (Gcell) in confluent cells is 2. 6 times higher than in single cells. Cell capacitance values are not significantly different in single vs confluent M- 1 cells, arguing against electrical coupling of confluent M- 1 cells. (b) In confluent cells, 10 (- 4) - 10 (- 5) M amiloride hyperpolarizes Vm to - 39. 7 +/- 3. 0 mV and the amiloride-sensitive fractional conductance of 0. 31 shows a sodium to potassium selectivity ratio of approximately 15. In contrast, single cells express no significant amiloride-sensitive conductance. (c) In single M- 1 cells, Gcell is dominated by an inwardly rectifying K-conductance, as exposure to high bath K causes a large depolarization and doubling of Gcell. The barium-sensitive fraction of Gcell in symmetrical KCl-Ringer is 0. 49 and voltage <b>dependent.</b> (<b>d)</b> In contrast, neither high K nor barium in the apical bath affect confluent M- 1 cells, showing that confluent cells lack a significant apical K conductance. (e) Application of 500 microM glibenclamide reduces whole-cell currents in both single and confluent M- 1 cells with a glibenclamide-sensitive fractional conductance of 0. 71 and 0. 83 in single and confluent cells, respectively. Glibenclamide inhibition occurs slower in confluent M- 1 cells than in single cells, suggesting a basolateral action of this lipophilic drug on ATP-sensitive basolateral K channels in M- 1 cells. (f) A component of the whole-cell conductance in M- 1 cells appears as a deactivating outward current during large depolarizing voltage pulses and is abolished by extracellular chloride removal. The deactivating chloride current averages 103. 6 +/- 16. 1 pA/cell, comprises 24 % of the outward current, and decays with a time constant of 179 +/- 13 ms. The outward to inward conductance ratio obtained from deactivating currents and tail currents is 2. 4, indicating an outwardly rectifying chloride conductance...|$|E

This thesis investigated different aspects of these three elements and revealed novel interactions of brain neurotrophins, environmental influences and emotional behaviour in mice. In the first two studies, we used C 57 BL 6 mice housed in standard or enriched conditions to investigate anxiety- and fear-related behaviour and neurotrophin levels in different brain regions. We discovered: (a) The normal (steady state) levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) protein are differently distributed in dorsal and ventral parts of hippocampus in both male and female mice, with the dorsal hippocampal levels being consistently higher than those in ventral hippocampus. (b) Exposure to a series of behavioural tests induced complex changes on neurotrophin levels in selected brain regions. (c) Differential housing exerted significant influences on anxiety-related behaviour and brain neurotrophins; these changes were gender and brain region <b>dependent.</b> (<b>d)</b> Significant correlations between behavioural measures and postmortem brain regional neurotrophic factors contents were related: whereby the magnitude of anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze was positively related to dorsal hippocampal BDNF levels, but negatively related to NGF levels in dorsal hippocampus and in the amygdala, while the expression of conditioned fear is positively related to amygdala BDNF and NGF levels, and to dorsal hippocampus NGF levels. The third and fourth studies further explored the interrelationship of environmental conditions, behaviour and brain neurotrophins, using BALB/c mice and BDNF knockout mice. The studies involved exposure to intermittent individual housing with or without access to physical exercise in anxious BALB/c mice and environmental enrichment (EE) in BDNF mutant mice. The results showed that: (a) Intermittent exposure to individual housing induced anxietylike behaviours with significantly enhanced motor activity, (b) Alternate social isolation caused down regulation of NGF and BDNF levels in frontal cortex, while up regulation of BDNF protein content in the amygdala and BDNF protein and mRNA levels in the hippocampus. (c) Access to running wheels for intermittently isolated mice normalized motor activity. Besides increased cerebellar BDNF and hippocampal NGF and BDNF protein levels, physical exercise did not attenuate down regulation of cortical NGF and BDNF protein levels induced by intermittent social isolation. These results demonstrated {{for the first time that}} alternate housing had significant impact on behaviour and neurotrophin levels in selected brain regions in mice, which can be partially altered by voluntary physical exercise. It also suggested that substantial changes induced by intermittent social isolation are different from previous findings caused by sustained social isolation on behaviour and brain neurotrophin. (d) EE increased numbers of dendritic spines in the hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons in wild-type (WT) mice, whereas less impact was found in this brain region in the BDNF mutant mice.

Ukraine and Georgia have been experiencing so-called “colour revolutions” while Russia and Armenia {{seems to be in}} a “autoritarian backlash”. What determined their different path, if they all departed in 1991 from the same political unit? Because democratisation came instantly and simultaneously to all of the 15 former Soviet republics, the former soviet union republics (from now on called FSU) represent one is one of the worlds most unique and largest labs to compare the political development of new-born democracies, and analyze the process of liberalization. By this study I hope to shed light on precondition for political liberalization in the former Soviet Union, with possible general implications also for other regions in transit to liberal democracy. The quest is interesting for scholars trying to understand what creates and what deteriorates democracies and political freedom, but also interesting for all foreign policy makers and non-governmental groups inside or outside the FSU whose aim to spread a liberal democracy. My two research questions are: Can the IPR, socioeconomic development and fragmentation of elites be preconditions explain the variation of political freedom in the post-soviet space? If yes, how can the IPR, socioeconomic development and fragmentation of elites be preconditions explain the variation of political freedom in the post-soviet space? My suggested model has three basic variables with these operationalisation (<b>Dependent</b> <b>D)</b> Variation of political freedom in FSU	Freedom Scale 7 - 1 (Independent A) Power resource distribution	IPR - Index of Power Resources (Independent B) Socioeconomic development level	HDI - Human Development Report (Independent C) Elite fragmentation	Nr. of effective president candidates previous. election The theory of independent variable A assumes that higher distribution of economical and intellectual resources, like income, property and education in society will influence the strength of a political freedom: the less concentrated economic and intellectual resources are on few hands, the more freedom persists. Independent variable B is a theory of socioeconomic development. The basic assumption of the theory is that the more well-to-do (educated, healthy and wealthy) a population is, the more political freedom. Independent variable C is the theory of fragmented elites. The basic assumption of this theory is that a when political power is distributed, when there is real competition for governmental power, - a fragmented elite, - prospects improve for the existence for the civil and political rights. The paper draws on theories from development theory, democracy theory and elite theory, and use structuralist theories to identify preconditions for political freedom. I also argue why measuring political freedom equals measuring democray, in the region of post-soviet space and discuss the theoretical problems of a structural approach, a universal approach, and the interpretation of the analysis. I conclude that that the distance from Tallinn to Tashkent is indeed long, but taht there does seem to exist structural preconditions {{in the former soviet union}} republics that explain the variation of political freedom and these are precondtion that can be affected by policy, internally and externally. The most important explanatory precondition seems to be IPR, partially in combination with elite theory...|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} the effective {{theory of the}} universal Kaehler modulus in warped compactifications using the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity. The spacetime <b>dependent</b> 10 <b>d</b> solution is constructed at the linear level for both the volume modulus and its axionic partner, and nontrivial cancellations of warping effects {{are found in the}} dimensional reduction. Our main result is that the Kaehler potential is not corrected by warping, up to an overall shift in the background value of the volume modulus. We extend the analysis beyond the linearized approximation by computing the fully backreacted 10 d metric corresponding to a finite volume modulus fluctuation. Also, we discuss the behavior of the modulus in strongly warped regions and show that there are no mixings with light Kaluza-Klein modes. These results are important for the phenomenology and cosmology of flux compactifications. Comment: 28 pages, 1 figure; v 2. corrected typos, added refs & minor clarification...|$|R
40|$|A micro-explosion {{occurring}} after pulsed laser-induced {{breakdown in}} {{water can be}} effectively described as an optodynamic phenomenon. It {{is a source of}} shockwaves that propagate into the surrounding medium. We present a measurement of the source size based on far field detection of the propagatingwaves using a beam deflection probe technique. By taking into consideration the moving breakdown model the relation between the size of the breakdown region and the apparent size of the optodynamic source is shown. An energy <b>dependent</b> enlargement parameter <b>d</b> is introduced which describes the relation...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} of moderate fluctuations for macroscopic observables of the random field Curie Weiss model (i. e., standard Curie-Weiss model embedded in a site <b>dependent,</b> i. i. <b>d.</b> random environment). We obtain path space large deviation principles via a general analytic approach based on convergence of non-linear generators and uniqueness of viscosity solutions for associated Hamilton Jacobi equations. The moderate asymptotics depend crucially on the phase we consider and moreover, the space-time scale range for which fluctuations can be proven is restricted {{by the addition of}} the disorder...|$|R
