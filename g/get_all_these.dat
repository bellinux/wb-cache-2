500|$|Over {{the course}} of the season, Blaine's musical {{performances}} leading the Warblers became so prevalent that he was called out for it on-screen. Criss offered the insight: [...] "Blaine definitely had his moment in the sun. I think it's time to focus back on the characters that fans of the show really know and love. Completely objectively from watching the show, I was like, 'Why does Blaine <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> songs? This is ridiculous. I want to hear other people doing stuff.' I think we're focusing a little more back on New Directions and taking {{a little bit of a}} break from the Warblers." ...|$|E

I wrote the verses first, as well as the melody and the inclusion of several instrumentals. Sometimes I'll have an idea for a lyrics. If I'm collaborating with someone, I'll direct them in the direction that I'm going chord wise, because I <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> melody ideas and then I lose them if I don't have someone really good with the keyboard with me. That's why I tend to collaborate because I lose the ideas by the time I figure out the chord. All these melody ideas just go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because of its {{themes of}} fornication, drug addiction, prostitution, violence, and murder, Porgy and Bess {{proved to be}} {{difficult}} to cast. Many black actors felt the story did nothing but perpetuate negative stereotypes. Harry Belafonte thought the role of Porgy was demeaning and declined it. So many performers refused to participate in the project that Goldwyn actually considered Jackie Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson and singer Clyde McPhatter for major roles. [...] Only Las Vegas entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr. expressed interest in appearing in the film, and arranged to audition for a role during a party at Judy Garland's home. Ira Gershwin's wife Lee was present and, horrified by Davis' vulgarity, implored Goldwyn, [...] "Swear on your life you'll never use him." [...] The producer, who sneeringly called Davis [...] "that monkey," [...] assured her he would not cast him and offered the role of Sportin' Life to Cab Calloway instead. When Calloway declined, Davis had Frank Sinatra and some of his associates pressure Goldwyn, who finally announced to Davis, [...] "The part is yours. Now will you <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> guys off my back?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Interviewed in Polari Magazine Clayton said, [...] "I've always written diaries. I've {{kept them}} for years, but just sporadically, during {{important}} moments. So {{when we had}} the shop I thought, 'This {{is going to be an}} important moment'. I had a feeling we weren't going to be there very long, and I wanted to document the period. We were <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> crazy people coming into the shop, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> mad characters, but I thought rather than just write it as a diary I would post it on MySpace.

5000|$|The single, {{released}} by Monument Records, {{had been out}} nine months before it finally charted, and had been written off by Monument as a failure. Said White: [...] "They had done given up on it, but we kept <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> people in Texas coming to the clubs and buying the record. So we would send up to Nashville saying, 'Send us a thousand more this week.' They would send us these 'Do Not Sell' examples, so {{we would have to}} sit down and mark out the 'Do Not Sell' and then send them to the record stores. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> stores in South Texas kept calling our house saying, 'We need more.'

500|$|While Windows RT {{functions}} {{similarly to}} Windows 8, {{there are still}} some notable differences, primarily involving software and hardware compatibility. Julie Larson-Green, then {{executive vice president of the}} Devices and Studios group at Microsoft, explained that Windows RT was ultimately designed to provide a [...] "closed, turnkey" [...] user experience, [...] "where it doesn't have all the flexibility of Windows, but it has the power of Office and then all the new style applications. So you could give it to your kid and he's not going to load it up with a bunch of toolbars accidentally out of Internet Explorer and then come to you later and say, 'why am I <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> pop-ups?' It just isn't capable of doing that by design." ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{explores the}} {{challenges}} of assessment in open distance learning (ODL). The authors argue that ultimately assessment should be about {{improving the quality of}} teaching and effective learning. It should be based on making expectations explicit and public, setting appropriate criteria and high standards for learning quality, systematically gathering, analyzing and interpreting evidence to determine how well performance matches expectations and standards, and using the resultant information to document, explain, and improve performance. However, <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> variables to work in ODL presents mammoth challenges. How can ODL lecturers validate and authenticate students’ written work? How can they tell whether the students’ submitted work sufficiently reflects their knowledge and understanding? South Africa has inherited an unequal, racially skewed and inequitable educational provision from its apartheid past. This poses serious challenge for assessing quality. The article therefore seeks to understand these context-specific challenges of ODL assessment at UNISA. </p...|$|R
