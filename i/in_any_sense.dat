25|$|During the Three Kingdoms Period, the Xuanxue (Mysterious Wisdom) school, {{including}} Wang Bi, {{focused on}} the texts of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Many of the school's members, including Wang Bi himself, were not religious <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense.</b> Wang Bi mostly focused on reconciling Confucian thought with Taoist thought.

In addition, his commentary was compatible with Confucian ideas and Buddhist ideas that later entered China. This compatibility ensured Taoism would remain an important aspect of Chinese culture, and made the merging of the three religions easier in later periods, such as the Tang dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The ties {{of loyalty}} to a lord, were to the person of a lord, not to his station; {{there was no real}} concept of patriotism or loyalty to a cause. This {{explains}} why dynasties waxed and waned so quickly, a kingdom was only as strong as its leader-king. There was no underlying administration or bureaucracy to maintain any gains beyond the lifetime of a leader. An example of this was the leadership of Rædwald of East Anglia and how the East Anglian primacy did not survive his death. Kings could not, except in exceptional circumstances, make new laws. Their role instead was to uphold and clarify previous custom and to assure his subjects that he would uphold their ancient privileges, laws, and customs. Although the person of the king as a leader could be exalted, the office of kingship was not <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> as powerful or as invested with authority as it was to become. One of the tools kings used was to tie themselves closely to the new Christian church; through the practice of having a church leader anoint and crown the king; God and king were joined in peoples' minds.|$|E

The book's popularity was largely due to Robinson's promise that wild gardening could be easy and beautiful; that the use of hardy perennials would be less expensive and offer more variety than the frequent mass planting of greenhouse annuals; and that it followed nature, which he considered the source of all true design.|$|E
500|$|Zobel used {{a design}} {{technique}} {{based on his}} theoretical discovery that the impedance looking into {{the end of a}} filter chain was practically the same (within the limits of component tolerances) as the theoretical impedance of an infinite chain after {{only a small number of}} sections had been added to the chain. These [...] "image" [...] impedances have a mathematical characterization impossible to construct simply out of discrete components, and can only ever be approximated. Zobel found that using these impedances constructed out of small filter chains as components in a greater network allowed him to build realistic line simulators. These were not <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> intended as practical filters in the field, but rather the intention was to construct good controllable line simulators without having the inconvenience of miles of cable to contend with.|$|E

The manner in which the strain of the war was borne shows how great are the forces of production which, in normal times, go to waste; proves that what we suffer from now is not overproduction, but underproduction.|$|R
500|$|Shortly thereafter, Information Minister Ahmad Shabery Cheek {{insisted that}} ketuanan Melayu did not imply a {{master-slave}} relationship <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> between the Malays and non-Malays.

However, some prominent members of the royalty such as the Raja of Perlis and former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Syed Jamalullail have themselves been critical of ketuanan Melayu; in early 2009, the Raja stated that [...] "In Malaysia, every race is tuan ...

[...] Though he was impressed with the majority of the episode, Pascua had mixed feelings on the character of Stevens, attributing it to his dislike of Heigl.|$|E

[...] Giving evidence in December 2011, Morgan, who bragged in a newspaper column for the Daily Mail in 2006 about hearing the message, refused to say who had played him the recorded message of the call, saying he was protecting a source.

500|$|By {{the late}} nineteenth century, {{businesses}} began to form combinations, known as trusts, which claimed a larger and {{larger share of the}} market—large enough to dictate prices, their detractors claimed. Members of both major parties were concerned with the growth of the power of trusts and monopolies, and {{at the opening of the}} 51st Congress Sherman proposed what would become the Sherman Antitrust Act. The bill Sherman proposed was largely derivative of a failed bill from the previous Congress written by Senator George F. Edmunds, which Sherman had amended during its consideration. Until 1888, Sherman had shown little interest in the trust question but it was rising in the national consciousness, and Sherman now entered the fray. The revised bill Sherman proposed was simple, stating that [...] "very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal". The bill further prescribed criminal penalties for any person who monopolizes trade. In debate, Sherman praised the effects of corporations on developing industry and railroads and asserted the right for people to form corporations, so long as they were [...] "not <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> a monopoly".|$|E
500|$|At the 23rd Party Congress in 1966, Brezhnev {{told the}} delegates that the Soviet {{military}} {{had reached a}} level fully sufficient to defend the country. The Soviet Union reached ICBM parity with the United States that year. In early 1977, Brezhnev told {{the world that the}} Soviet Union did not seek to become superior to the United States in nuclear weapons, nor to be militarily superior <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of the word. In the later years of Brezhnev's reign, it became official defense policy to only invest enough to maintain military deterrence, and by the 1980s, Soviet defense officials were told again that investment would not exceed the level to retain national security. In his last meeting with Soviet military leaders in October 1982, Brezhnev stressed the importance of not over-investing in the Soviet military sector. This policy was retained during the rules of Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko and Mikhail Gorbachev. He also said that the time was opportune to increase the readiness of the armed forces even further. At the anniversary of the 1917 Revolution a few weeks later (Brezhnev's final public appearance), Western observers noted that the annual military parade featured only two new weapons and most of the equipment displayed was obsolete. Two days before his death, Brezhnev stated that any aggression against the Soviet Union [...] "would result in a crushing retaliatory blow".|$|E
500|$|Contrectatio meant [...] "handling" [...] and was {{established}} as the prohibited action associated with furtum {{before the end}} of the republic. Furtum had in the early and mid-Republic required the carrying away of a thing. This was widened and there are several examples from the classical Rome and later where it is even hard to find physical contact <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense.</b> Contrectatio extended to dealing with the thing as if the owner, and [...] "physical interference" [...] can be considered a more accurate term than just touching. The idea of furtum, and conrectatio in particular, broadened during the republic to complement the narrowly defined Lex Aquilia. This did, for example, include using a borrowed thing in a way which went beyond that agreed with the lender (furtum usus), such as borrowing a horse and riding it for longer than agreed. During the Republic, no distinction was made in language between furtum usus and furtum in general. Contrectio included what might be thought of as fraud: knowingly accepting a wrongful payment, or embezzlement, for example. The case of wrongful payment is problematic, because a mistaken payment still transferred ownership; it seems contradictory that the receiver was granted ownership and still liable for theft. To accept a thing as a pledge knowing that it did not belong to the pledgor was also furtum [...] not merely acting as an accomplice. Plautus, a playwright, suggests that failing to report a theft after the fact was furtum, but this should not be assumed. The development of contrectio as the preferred prohibited act accompanied that of the criminal law, the actio doli (for fraud) and the Aquilian actions.|$|E
