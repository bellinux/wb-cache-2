When oral drugs are administered, {{the efficiency of}} the drug is to produce a therapeutic effect and the lack of this effect {{may be due to the}} medication travelling too quickly through the digestive system, limiting the time that it can be absorbed.

40|$|Introduction: The optimal dose, duration, and {{efficacy}} of itraconazole in Indian patients of pulmonary aspergilloma (PA) are not clearly defined. Therefore, a study was carried out, to resolve these issues in diagnosed cases of PA complicating old treated patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Materials and Methods: The study patients randomly received itraconazole either in a fixed <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> of 200 mg (group I), 200 mg twice daily (group II) or a variable <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> (group III), for 12 months. All the patients were followed up for the entire duration of the study for clinical, radiological, and immunological response. The side effects were recorded as and when reported by the patients and managed symptomatically. Results: A total of 60 patients were enrolled, 20, in each group. There were no intergroup differences with regard to age, sex, body weight, smoking status, alcohol intake, symptoms, Potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount, fungal culture, pattern of radiological lesions or anti-aspergillus antibodies (anti-Asp-Ab) titers. The radiological response was poor in group I patients, {{as compared to the}} other groups, at two months (P < 0. 05). The dose of itraconazole was increased in five of the patients in group I due to poor response. A higher number of group II patients suffered side effects and the dose of itraconazole had to be decreased in three of these patients, but none of the patients on a variable <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> required a change in <b>dose</b> <b>schedule.</b> Conclusion: Thus, a weight-based variable <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> of itraconazole was found to be a more effective and safer modality in the management of PA than a fixed <b>dose</b> <b>schedule...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A two <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> (0 and 6 months) for a {{combined}} hepatitis A and B vaccine {{is currently being}} developed. METHODS: The present study compared the combined hepatitis A and B vaccines in 12 - 15 -year-old: Twinrix paediatric (360 EL. U HAV antigen/ 10 microg HBs antigen) on a three <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> (0, 1 and 6 months) to the adult formulation (720 EL. U HAV antigen/ 20 microg HBs antigen) on a two <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> (0 and 6 months) and also reports on the follow-up until 24 months. RESULTS: Seroconversion (SC) rates to HAV in both regimens reached 100 % by month 7 and remained 100 % up to month 24. Anti-HAV, GMTs were slightly higher for the two dose than the three dose regimens at this time point. Seroprotection against hepatitis B was > 99 % in both groups by month 7 and 24, this was still 94 and 96 %, respectively. Statistical non-inferiority of group 1 (two dose) versus group 2 (three dose) was demonstrated. All vaccines were well tolerated and the most frequently reported local and general symptoms were pain and fatigue. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported during the study. CONCLUSION: The two dose regimen elicited similar immunogenicity to HAV and HBsAg and reactogenicity profiles as the three dose regimen in this group of healthy adolescents.

40|$|Background:Streptococcus pneumoniae {{causes a}} {{considerable}} amount of morbidity and mortality in children < 5. However, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) can prevent much of this burden. Until recently, PCVs were mostly available only in developed countries using a variety of <b>dosing</b> <b>schedules.</b> As more lower income countries make decisions to introduce PCV into their national immunization programs, an optimal schedule with which to administer PCV has become a key policy question. Methods:We performed a systematic review of English literature published from 1994 to 2010 on the effects of PCV <b>dosing</b> <b>schedules</b> on immunogenicity, nasopharyngeal carriage, invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{toxicity}} and efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) for localized carcinoma of the prostate, using a hypofractionated (55 Gy/ 20 fractions/ 4 weeks) vs. a conventionally fractionated (64 Gy/ 32 fractions/ 6. 5 weeks) <b>dose</b> <b>schedule.</b> METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 217 patients were randomized to either the hypofractionated (108 patients) or the conventional (109 patients) <b>dose</b> <b>schedule,</b> with planning with two-dimensional (2 D) CT scan planning methodology in the majority of cases. All patients were followed for a median of 48 (6 - 108) months. Gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity was evaluated before RT and after its completion using modified late effects of normal tissue-subjective, objective, management, analytic (LENT-SOMA) scales and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer sexual function questionnaire. Efficacy of RT based on clinical, radiologic, and prostate-specific antigen data were also evaluated at baseline and after RT. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal and GU toxicity persisted 5 years after RT and did not differ between the two <b>dose</b> <b>schedules</b> other than in regard to urgency of defecation. However, 1 -month GI toxicity was not only worse in patients with the hypofractionated RT schedule but also adversely affected daily activities. Nadir prostate-specific antigen values occurred at a median of 18. 0 (3. 0 - 54. 0) months after RT. A total of 76 biochemical relapses, with or without clinical relapses, have occurred since; of these, 37 were in the hypofractionated and 39 in the conventional schedule. The 5 -year biochemical +/- clinical relapse-free and overall survival was 55. 9 % and 85. 3 % respectively for all patients, and did not differ between the two schedules. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation therapy for prostate carcinoma causes persistent GI toxicity that is largely independent of the two <b>dose</b> <b>schedules.</b> The hypofractionated schedule is equivalent in efficacy to the conventional schedule...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{characterize}} the prevalence and pathophysiology of anorectal dysfunction up to 2 yr following radiation therapy (RT) for localized {{carcinoma of the}} prostate.

RESULTS: There was a persistent increase in anorectal symptoms after RT. At 2 yr, bowel frequency, urgency, and fecal incontinence were increased in 50 %, 47 %, and 26 % of patients, respectively. After RT, there were progressive reductions of (1) basal anal pressures, (2) anal pressures in response to squeeze and increased intra-abdominal pressure, (3) rectal compliance, and (4) rectal volumes associated with sensory perception and the desire to defecate. The thickness of the external anal sphincter increased with time after RT. No difference was observed between the patients in the two radiation <b>dose</b> <b>schedules.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Anorectal dysfunction following RT for prostate carcinoma is an underestimated cause of morbidity, which progresses with time.
