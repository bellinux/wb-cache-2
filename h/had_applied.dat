5|$|By {{the time}} President Reagan {{had given his}} first speech on the epidemic, some six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been {{diagnosed}} with AIDS and 20,849 had died of it. By the end of 1989, the year Reagan left office, 115,786 people {{had been diagnosed with}} AIDS in the United States, and more than 70,000 of them had died of it. It has been suggested that far fewer would have died, both then and in the decades that followed, if the Reagan administration <b>had</b> <b>applied</b> the same determination in combatting AIDS as the Ford administration <b>had</b> <b>applied</b> to fighting Legionnaires' disease.|$|E

These states have begun, or will begin shortly, the accession process by adopting EU law {{to bring the}} states {{in line with the}} rest of the Union. While most of these countries <b>have</b> <b>applied</b> only recently, Turkey is a long-standing candidate, <b>having</b> <b>applied</b> in 1987 and gaining candidate status in 1999. This is due to the political issues surrounding the accession of the country.|$|R

5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court. The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent was outside the bounds of {{the authority of the}} Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court was right to reverse. Instead, the note supported the state court who <b>had</b> <b>applied</b> the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E

However, the transfer was delayed, {{and he did not}} leave for home until June 1902, when he sailed on board the SS Bavarian with troops returning for the Coronation of Edward VII. He had been twice mentioned in despatches during the war, received the Queen's South Africa Medal, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E

5|$|Josip Broz Tito's biographer Vladimir Dedijer {{described}} Misita's {{death as}} a great loss for the uprising. On 31 August 2008, the deputy speaker of the Serbian National Assembly, Božidar Delić of the Serbian Radical Party, dedicated a plaque to Misita in the Vuk Karadžić Square in Loznica. One of the people present was the man that <b>had</b> <b>applied</b> for the plaque to be installed, Božidar Panić, who had idolised Misita in his youth, and had lit a candle for him every year.|$|E
5|$|Masaccio's use {{of light}} was also revolutionary. While earlier artists like Giotto <b>had</b> <b>applied</b> a flat, neutral light from an unidentifiable source, Masaccio's light emanated from a {{specific}} location outside the picture, casting {{the figures in}} light and shadow. This created a chiaroscuro effect, sculpting the bodies into three-dimensional shapes.|$|E

5|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} Stone Rollin at Blakeslee Recording Company, his {{recording studio}} complex in Los Angeles, California. He spent approximately one year {{working on the}} album, including writing its music and lyrics. He worked on the album's production with recording engineer and long-time collaborator Charles Brungardt. The two shared an interest in collecting vintage musical gear and studying historic recording techniques, which they <b>had</b> <b>applied</b> in recording The Way I See It. However, for Stone Rollin, they sought to eschew its predecessor's Motown aesthetic for a more eclectic style, in keeping with Saadiq's other musical projects.|$|E
5|$|U.S. rhetoric abroad {{also had}} an effect on the Guatemalan {{military}}. The military had always been anti-communist, and Ambassador Peurifoy <b>had</b> <b>applied</b> {{a lot of pressure on}} senior officers ever since his arrival in Guatemala in October 1953. Árbenz had intended the secret shipment of weapons from the Alfhem to be used to bolster peasant militias, in the event of army disloyalty. But the U.S. informed army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and his top generals.|$|E

5|$|Alex {{was born}} on July 18, 1992. She grew up in Oakland, California, with her parents Michael and Sita. Her father was an {{alcoholic}} and physically abusive towards his wife. When Alex was in her pre-teenage years, Michael was killed during a violent episode against Sita. The police declined to press charges, unaware that Alex was responsible for Michael's death. Alex was then sent to live with Sita's family in Mumbai, India. Alex returned to the United States, where she enrolled at the FBI Academy in 2015. Unknown to the Bureau, Alex had discovered that {{her father was a}} former FBI agent and <b>had</b> <b>applied</b> to learn more about his past. Alex kept her activities a secret from Sita, telling her mother that she was starting graduate school. A stuffed bear wearing a UC Berkeley sweater can be seen on her desk in the fifteenth episode of the first season, suggesting that she may have attended the University of California, Berkeley, prior to enrolling at Quantico.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Denmark was {{a member}} of the European Union (EU), while Sweden and Norway <b>had</b> <b>applied</b> and were {{awaiting}} referenda to determine membership. EU was working to deregulate the airline market from 1995, which could cause problems for the Scandinavian agreements. In preparation for this, Braathens SAFE started negotiations with Linjeflyg of Sweden and Maersk Air of Denmark to crate an alliance to compete with SAS. In particular, the three airlines wanted to capture the two million passengers that travelled between the three Scandinavian capitals: Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. Instead, SAS was given permission to purchase Linjeflyg in exchange for the Swedish airline market being deregulated from 1 July 1992. From 23 October 1992, the Norwegian Armed Forces stopped chartering aircraft and started using scheduled flights to fly 240,000 personnel annually. Since most of the transport was between Northern and Southern Norway, this gave reduced revenue for Braathens SAFE.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich {{was tried}} in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a {{trafficking}} offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges. During the lengthy trial the accused had no legal representation. Although he <b>had</b> <b>applied</b> to the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria for assistance, {{they said that they}} would only help him if he pleaded guilty, an option which Dietrich did not want to take. He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance, but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge—regarding the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to that which was involved in the first three charges—he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court. Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, but that court refused to hear his appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.|$|E
