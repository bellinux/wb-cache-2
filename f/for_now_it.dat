25|$|The 'Heritage House' {{was built}} in 1869 and is a State Historic Landmark. The oldest house in Compton, it was {{restored}} {{as a tribute to}} early settlers. It is an important landmark of Compton's rich history. At the corner of Myrrh and Willowbrook near the Civic Center Plaza, the Heritage House is a rustic-looking home that will eventually have a museum detailing early life in Compton. <b>For</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> shows the stark difference between the simple life of the 19th century and the fast-paced urban environment of the 21st.|$|E
25|$|The railroads {{opened up}} the Great Plains for settlement, <b>for</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> was {{possible}} to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the East, and Europe. Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they clearly understood {{the need for a}} hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling paperwork and financial details. During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After approximately one generation, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping, and home economics courses in the schools.|$|E

2500|$|Asbury Park's nightlife {{includes}} The Stone Pony. On Main Street is The Saint, (formerly the Clover Club), a {{club that}} showcases local and emerging acts, {{as well as}} established performers. Across town, on Fourth Avenue, is Asbury Lanes, a no longer functioning vintage bowling alley and bar with live performances ranging from musical acts, neo-Burlesque, hot rod, and art shows. Though it has been closed <b>for</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> is currently being restored to its former glory. Bought by the newly opened Asbury Hotel sitting adjacent on Fifth Avenue, it will be connected with the hotel. An above ground passageway has already been built to connect the two buildings. An educated guess to its reopening would be Spring 2017. The Baronet, a vintage movie theater which dates back to Buster Keaton's era, was near Asbury Lanes, but its roof recently caved in and the building was demolished. The Asbury Hotel pays homage to this once great theater with its 5th floor rooftop movie theater called [...] "The Baronet". The Asbury Hotel also has an 8th floor rooftop bar, paying homage to the former building inhabitants and calling it [...] "Salvation". In a town that was once nearly abandoned, there are now over 60 restaurants, bars, coffee houses, two breweries, a coffee roastery, and live music venues situated in Asbury Park's boardwalk and downtown districts.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But <b>for</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> just left me a little cold.
