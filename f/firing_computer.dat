25|$|The British {{discovered}} that the depth charge damage to the U-boat was not critical—there were leaks {{in some of the}} ballast tanks and a small leak in a fuel tank. Around one third of the battery cells were cracked and the bow had been buckled. Water had leaked in through a valve that had been unseated by the explosions and through glass gauges that had broken; other damage was minor and no evidence of chlorine gas found. In his report, Colvin stated his opinion that {{there was no evidence of}} any damage control being carried out and that an experienced submarine crew would have been easily able to improvise repairs, stay submerged and likely evade the air-attack. After their surrender, the German crew had attempted to destroy instruments and fittings, but, with the exception of the wrecked radio and the damaged torpedo <b>firing</b> <b>computer,</b> the attempt appeared half-hearted and the damage was not significant. Also, useful papers had missed destruction. Copies of encrypted signals and their corresponding, plain-language, German texts were found—material of use to the British Enigma code breaking effort. A significant discovery was the U-boat commander's handbook, which provided context and background information for decrypted messages. The British, unfamiliar with German naval procedures, abbreviations and jargon, had ofttimes found German naval traffic hard to understand even when decrypted.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficient}} {{operation of}} process equipment requires attentive operation by well-trained personnel. Use {{of a computer}} simulation model together with a conversational computer program, which provides dynamic game playing opportunities for the trainee, has proven a very effective training tool. The programs {{have been used in}} plants and refineries, and they demonstrate the ability to develop rapidly within the Operator Trainee a real understanding of the variables affecting process performance. Experience with a furnace <b>firing</b> <b>computer</b> training program is described. Using a time-share computer terminal, the Operator participates in a conversational training experience in which he is taught startup, routine operation, and to cope with operating problems on a gas and/or oil fired process furnace. Specific operator-oriented problems are encountered and solved by making control adjustments in the simulator program which has been developed. In using the program, the trainee is challenged to achieve or exceed firing efficiency goals set for the furnace. A variety of operating conditions are presented. As an extension of the success experienced with the furnace program, a new program has been developed simulating a crude oil distillation unit. The Distillation Column Operator training program is designed to facilitate an understanding of distillation principles and the effect on energy efficiency for the various product quality and yields achieved. The results of Operator acceptance of these programs is that a wider application of the principle's computer simulator training to other industry processes is warranted...|$|E
40|$|The role of large-conductance Ca 2 +-dependent K+ {{channels}} (BK-channels; {{also known}} as maxi-K- or slo-channels) in spike broadening during repetitive firing was studied in CA 1 pyramidal cells, using sharp electrode intracellular recordings in rat hippocampal slices, and computer modelling. Trains of action potentials elicited by depolarizing current pulses showed a progressive, frequency-dependent spike broadening, reflecting a reduced rate of repolarization. During a 50 ms long 5 spike train, the spike duration increased by 63 · 6 ± 3 · 4 % from the 1 st to the 3 rd spike. The amplitude of the fast after-hyperpolarization (fAHP) also rapidly declined during each train. Suppression of BK-channel activity with (a) the selective BK-channel blocker iberiotoxin (IbTX, 60 nM), (b) the non-peptidergic BK-channel blocker paxilline (2 – 10 μM), or (c) calcium-free medium, broadened the 1 st spike to a similar degree (≈ 60 %). BK-channel suppression also caused a similar change in spike waveform as observed during repetitive firing, and eliminated (occluded) most of the spike broadening during repetitive <b>firing.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations using a reduced compartmental model with transient BK-channel current and 10 other active ionic currents, produced an activity-dependent spike broadening that was strongly reduced when the BK-channel inactivation mechanism was removed. These results, which are supported by recent voltage-clamp data, strongly suggest that in CA 1 pyramidal cells, fast inactivation of a transient BK-channel current (ICT), substantially contributes to frequency-dependent spike broadening during repetitive firing...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{extensive}} development of the <b>fire</b> <b>computer</b> models, and its use {{in the study of the}} fire safety, fire investigation, etc. has been increased. The most important types of <b>fire</b> <b>computer</b> models are the field model and the zone model. The first model reaches a better approximation to fire dynamics, but the second one requires less computational time. Additionally, in the last years, it should be noted the great advances in information processing using artificial neural networks, and it has become a useful tool with application in very diverse fields. This paper analyzes the possibilities of develop a new <b>fire</b> <b>computer</b> model using artificial neural networks. In the first approach to this objective, a simple compartment was analyzed with a field model. After that, simulations employing General Regression Neural Network were performed. This method achieves similar results that the field model employing computational times closer to the zone models. The neural network has been trained with FDS field model and validating the resulting model with data from a full scale test. In later stages other phenomena and different types of networks will be evaluated...|$|R
