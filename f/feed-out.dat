40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} air stress during storage, {{exposure}} to air at <b>feed-out,</b> and treatment with silage additives to enhance aerobic stability on methane production from maize silage were investigated at laboratory scale. Up to 17 % of the methane potential of maize without additive was lost during seven days exposure to air on <b>feed-out.</b> Air stress during storage reduced aerobic stability and further increased methane losses. A chemical additive containing salts of benzoate and propionate, and inoculants containing heterofermentative {{lactic acid bacteria}} were effective to increase aerobic stability and resulted in up to 29 % higher methane yields after exposure to air. Exclusion of air to the best possible extent and high aerobic stabilities should be primary objectives when ensiling biogas feedstocks...|$|E

40|$|Ensiling is a {{preservation}} {{technology for}} moist whole-plant forage crops {{which is based}} on lactic acid fermentation under anaerobic conditions, whereby lactic acid bacteria (LAB) convert water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) into organic acids, mainly lactic acid. As a result, pH decrease and thus forage is preserved for a long time 1. The application of silage additives has become the conventional implement to control the ensiling process. Although the main objective in using silage additives is to ensure the fermentation process to produce well preserved silages, attention is also paid to methods of reducing ensiling losses and improving aerobic stability of silages during the <b>feed-out</b> period 2.

Ensilage is a preservation method for moist forages that is based on natural lactic acid fermentation under anaerobic conditions. There are six phases which occur during ensilage, storage and <b>feed-out</b> of the fermented forages. The technology of silage making is not popular in Indonesia, although ensilage may successfully occurs in tropical area including Indonesia. The reason may be due to limited information available regarding ensilage for the farmers. This review covered silage fermentation process and probiotics effect of feeding silage to the ruminants.

40|$|Maize and sorghum silages {{are good}} {{sources of energy}} for {{lactating}} dairy cows that produce milk destined for fresh and matured cheeses. Silages are usually stored in horizontal silos with or without side walls on commercial farms throughout the world. The main microbiological and nutritional quality problems are related to harvesting time, ensiling technology, and management practices during filling and <b>feed-out.</b> Aerobic deterioration is a key point that must avoided on farms {{in order to improve}} the hygienic, chemical and sensorial quality of milk and cheeses. Aerobic deterioration causes large losses of dry matter (DM) and quality, and it can cause health problems for animals and humans through the transfer of pathogens and mycotoxins from feed and livestock to food products.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the production practices and use of corn silage in dairy farms in Southern Brazil, and to evaluate their impact on the nutritional quality and occurrence of mycotoxins. The data were collected by application of questionnaires among the producers, and by analysis of silage samples. The variables were subjected to factorial analysis of data reduction through the principal components method, thus obtaining 84. 12 % of the variance associated with the location, corn hybrid, crop production management, and inoculant used, characterizing the farms into four distinct groups. In farms from Paraná, the silage production technologies were more associated with implantation and crop management processes, and investment in equipment related to ensilage/silo <b>feed-out</b> was less frequent. Farms of Rio Grande do Sul showed high adoption of outsourced services, self-propelled machines, bunker silos, double-sided plastic film, and inoculant to control aerobic deterioration, and the silages showed higher levels of propionic acid (7. 95 g/kg DM), and lower concentrations of aflatoxins (7. 7 ppb) and total mycotoxins (26. 58 ppb).

40|$|Understanding {{the roles}} that various {{microbes}} play in silage fermentation and the factors that affect their growth can help us understand why silages ferment in various ways. In many, but not all cases, the fermentation that a crop undergoes {{can be explained by}} how microbes interact with factors such as moisture content, buffering capacity, and sugar content. However, management factors such as silo packing speed, silage pack density, type of additive used, chop length, silo management during storage, and silo management during <b>feed-out</b> can also affect the silage fermentation. In some cases fermentation analyses can qualitatively explain poor silage nutritive value or low intakes, but they cannot be used to balance diets for cattle. Thus, they should always be used in conjunction with other standard chemical analyses (i. e. ADF, NDF, CP, RDP/RUP, NE L, NDF digestibility, etc.). A large portion of this review was patterned after a paper by Kung and Shaver (2001) and an invited presentation by Muck and Kung (2002).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{survey on}} 68 dairy farms {{was carried out}} to {{evaluate}} the ensiling procedures adopted to store corn silage. Samples from core, lateral and apical zones of the <b>feed-out</b> face of silos were analysed. A principal factor analysis (PFA) was carried out on the entire database (196 silage samples and 36 variables) and 11 principal factor components (PCs) were retained and interpreted. RESULTS: Ensiling procedures influenced the area exposed to risk of air penetration. Cores had higher dry matter, starch and lactic acid content or lower pH, fibre, propionate and butyrate concentrations than peripheral samples (P < 0. 05). The highest (P < 0. 05) mycophenolic acid and roquefortina C concentrations were detected in lateral samples. Chemical and digestibility variables loaded on two PCs; four PCs were characterized by end-products associated with clostridia, heterolactic, homolactic and aerobic fermentations; two PCs were associated withmycotoxins, whereas three PCs explained ensiling procedures. CONCLUSION: The main quality traits of corn silages differed throughout the entire silo face. Minimization of the area exposed to risk of air penetration represents the best strategy to preserve the nutritional value and safety of corn silages.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{investigate}} {{corn silage}} fermentative quality, a principal factor analysis {{was carried out}} on a database consisting of 196 corn silages sampled from the core, lateral and apical parts of silo <b>feed-out</b> face and characterised by 36 variables. Eleven principal factor components (PCs) were retained and interpreted. Two PCs were related to chemical and digestibility variables; four PCs were characterised by end-products associated with clostridia, heterolactic, homolactic or aerobic fermentations; two PCs were associated with mycotoxins produced by Penicillium roqueforti or by Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium spp., while three PCs explained ensiling procedures adopted to store corn silages. RESULTS: Lower (P < 0. 05) yeast or mould counts and greater (P < 0. 05) aerobic stability were measured in core than in peripheral samples. Excluding PCs related to ensiling procedures, other PCs were able to predict microbiological counts, aerobic stability or biogenic amine content as verified by multiple linear regression analysis. Based on these results, several corn silage quality index calculations were computed by using a summative equation approach in which different PCs as well as diverse relative weights multiplying each PCs were combined. To compute definitive index calculation, only PCs explaining clostridia, heterolactic and homolactic fermentations were used with relative weights of 30 %, 50 % and 20 %. CONCLUSIONS: The new proposed fermentative quality index was highly correlated to parameters related to corn silage fermentative quality, such as microbiological counts, aerobic stability or biogenic amines and it properly discriminated well- and poorly preserved forages...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Studies were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of different ensiling densities on fermentation, aerobic stability, and nutritive value of maize and sorghum silages. Maize and sorghum were harvested at dough (363 g/kg) and milk stages (275 g/kg), respectively. Herbages were chopped approximately 1. 5 cm after harvest and then ensiled in mini silos at high and low-bulk densities for 8. 5 weeks. Different bulk densities were achieved by ensiling different weights of herbage in the fixed-volume mini silos (1. 5 -L anaerobic jars, Weck, Germany). The obtained dry matter (DM) densities were 168 and 216 kg of DM/m 3 for maize forage and 132 and 178 kg of DM/m 3 for sorghum forage. Fermentation kinetics, the rate of aerobic deterioration upon aerobic exposure, and nutrient digestibility were followed during the periods of ensiling (on days 2, 4, 8, 15, and 60). In all cases, increased packing density resulted in silages with lower acetate content, ammonium N levels, and fermentation losses, but lactate content did not differ. Butyrate was detected in appreciable amounts only in sorghum silage. Propionate was not detected in any silage. Tightly packed silages remained stable upon exposure to air. Tight packing increases the digestibly of nutrients and improves the energy content of silages. These data show that high density limits air infiltration and reduces the oxidation loss during storage and <b>feed-out.</b> As a consequence, more dry matter is recovered and more energy is preserved...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. High densities in bunker silos {{minimize}} {{losses and}} reduce storage costs; however, the guidelines to attain high densities {{are based on}} relatively little research. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine those practices or factors most correlated with bunker silo density. Density was measured in 175 bunker silos across Wisconsin using core samples collected at chest height (1. 13 m, 3. 70 ft, on average) across the <b>feed-out</b> face. Silo filling practices were surveyed and correlated with density. Most silages sampled were alfalfa or corn. Dry matter densities ranged from 106 to 434 kg/m 3 (6. 6 to 27. 1 lb/ft 3). The core densities were correlated with the height of silage above the core, indicating the effect of selfcompaction. To adjust for this, all densities were corrected for the median depth below the surface (2. 16 m or 7. 09 ft) using the equations of Pitt (1983) for density with height for the center of tower silos. The adjusted dry matter densities were most strongly correlated with how thinly a load was spread (L), tractor weight (W), packing time per tonne as-fed (T), and dry matter content (D). These four factors were combined into a packing factor [W (TD) 1 / 2 L – 1] that explained 18. 2 % of the variation in dry matter density. Additional factors such as the use of dual wheels, etc. did not significantly improve the prediction of dry matter density. An equation was developed to predict average density in a bunker silo based on the packing factor plus crop height in the silo. Keywords. Silage, Silos, Density, Packing, Tractor, Tires, Bunker.

40|$|Eight beams {{carrying}} a shaped pulse from the NOVA laser were focused into a hohlraum {{with a total}} energy of about 25 kJ. A planar foil {{was placed on the}} side of the hohlraum with perturbations facing away from the hohlraum. All perturbations were 4 {micro}m in amplitude and 50 {micro}m in wavelength. Three foils of pure aluminum were shot with thicknesses and pulse lengths respectively of 86 {micro}m and 2. 2 ns, 50 {micro}m and 4. 5 ns, and 35 {micro}m with both 2. 2 ns and 4. 5 ns pulses. Two composite foils constructed respectively of 32 and 84 {micro}m aluminum on the ablative side and 10 {micro}m beryllium on the cold surface were also shot using the 2. 2 ns pulse. X-ray framing cameras recorded perturbation growth using both face- and side-on radiography. The LASNEX code was used to model the experiments. A shock wave interacted with the perturbation on the cold surface generating growth from a Richtmyer-Meshkov instability and a strong acoustic mode. The cold surface perturbation fed-out to the Rayleigh-Taylor unstable ablation surface, both by differential acceleration and interface coupling, where it grew. A density jump did not appear to have a large effect on <b>feed-out</b> from interface coupling. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability`s vortex pairs overtook and reversed the direction of flow of the Richtmyer-Meshkov vortices, resulting in the foil moving from a sinuous to a bubble and spike configuration.

40|$|Whole-plant corn silages {{were treated}} with Ecosyl® or Foraform® in one trial and Biomate® or Biomate + Cold-flo® in the second trial. In both trials, the silages were well preserved, but all were highly {{unstable}} in air during the first 3 to 4 weeks of the <b>feed-out</b> period. Foraform-treated silage was 2 to 6 degrees F cooler than its control, but Cold-flo-treated silage was 2 to 8 degrees F warmer during the first 10 days post-filling. Laboratory silo results showed that both control silages fermented extremely fast; however, inoculated silages had slightly lower pH and higher lactic acid values through the first 4 to 7 days postfilling. Foraform lowered the initial pH of the ensiled material, restricted subsequent fermentation, and produced a silage with about one-half the acid content compared to its control. Cold-flo raised the initial pH and delayed the start of fermentation, but resulted in a silage with greater acid content and an increased dry matter loss. Though not significant, calves fed Ecosyl, Foraform, and Biomate silages had about 6 percent better feed conversion than those fed control silages and gain per ton of crop ensiled was also higher for the three treated silages. Cold-flo-treated silage produced 3. 5 lb less gain per ton of crop ensiled than its control. Whole-plant forage sorghums {{were treated with}} TriLac® in one trial and Silagest® in the second trial. Inoculated silages had slightly lower ensiling temperatures than controls. All silages fermented rapidly, but both inoculants increased ensiling efficiency as indicated by higher lactic to acetic acid ratios (in laboratory silos) and decreased dry matter losses (in farm-scale silos). Calves fed Silagest silage outperformed those fed control silages, and both inoculants increased gain per ton of crop ensiled over control silages...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to reduce the predictor dimensionality {{and to develop a}} model able to forecast Clostridium tyrobutyricum contamination in corn silages. A survey on 33 dairy farms was performed, and samples from core, lateral, and apical parts of the <b>feed-out</b> face of corn silage bunkers were analyzed for chemical, biological (digestible and indigestible NDF), fermentative (pH, ammonia nitrogen, lactic acid, VFA, and ethanol), and microbiological (yeasts and molds) traits. Corn silage samples were analyzed for C. tyrobutyricum cell and spore counts by adoption of a molecular DNA–based method. A partial least squares (PLS) regression with a leaveone- out cross-validation method was used to reduce the dimensionality of the original predictors (n = 30) by projecting the independent variables into latent constructs. In a first step of the model development, the importance of independent variables in predicting C. tyrobutyricum contamination was assessed by plotting factor loadings of both dependent and independent variables on the first 2 components and by verifying for each predictor the variable influence on projection values adopting the Wold’s criterion as well as the entity of standardized regression coefficients. Three ensiling characteristics (bunker type, presence of lateral wrap plastic film, and penetration resistance as a measurement of the ensiled mass density), a chemical trait (DM), 9 characterizations of the fermentative profile (pH, ammonia nitrogen, acetic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, ethanol, and lactic acid), and 2 microbiological traits (yeasts and molds) were retained as important terms in the PLS model. Three reduced-variable PLS (rPLS) regressions—the first based on ensiling, chemical, fermentative, and microbiological retained important variables (rPLSecfm); the second based on chemical, fermentative, and microbiological retained important traits (rPLScfm); and the last based on only chemical and fermentative retained important variables (rPLScf) —were performed. The model that best fit the C. tyrobutyricum measurements was rPLSecfm. The rPLScfm and rPLScf models had similar regression performances but higher mean square errors of prediction than rPLSecfm. However, all tested models seemed adequate to rank corn silages for low, medium, and high risks of C. tyrobutyricum contamination. To avoid the visit on farm by trained people required to measure penetration resistance, the use of the rPLScf model is suggested as a useful tool to assess the risk of C. tyrobutyricum in corn silage...|$|E
