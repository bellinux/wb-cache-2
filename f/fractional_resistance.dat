The {{modulation}} of {{ion transport}} pathways in filter-grown monolayers of the CI-secreting subclone (19 A) {{of the human}} colon carcinoma cell line HT- 29 by muscarinic stimulation was studied by combined Ussing chamber and microimpalement experiments. Basolateral ddition of 10 4 M carbachol induced acomplex poly-phasic change of the cell potential consisting of (i) a fast and short (30 -sec) depolarization of 15 + 1 mV from a resting value of- 52 -+ l mV and an increase of the <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> ofthe apical membrane (first phase), (ii) a repolarization of 22 + I mV leading to a hyperpolarization f the cell (second phase), (iii) a depolarization of l l-+ 1 mV and a decrease of the <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> of the apical membrane (the third phase), (iv) and sometimes, a hyperpolarization f 6 +- 1 mV and an increase of the <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> of the apical membrane (fourth phase) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a tactile sensor using piezoresistive beams for {{detection}} of the {{coefficient of static friction}} merely by pressing the sensor against an object. The sensor chip is composed of three pairs of piezoresistive beams arranged in parallel and embedded in an elastomer; this sensor is able to measure the vertical and lateral strains of the elastomer. The coefficient of static friction is estimated from the ratio of the <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> changes corresponding to the sensing elements of vertical and lateral strains when the sensor is in contact with an object surface. We applied a normal force on the sensor surface through objects with coefficients of static friction ranging from 0. 2 to 1. 1. The <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> changes corresponding to vertical and lateral strains were proportional to the applied force. Furthermore, the relationship between these responses changed according to the coefficients of static friction. The experimental result indicated the proposed sensor could determine the coefficient of static friction before a global slip occurs...|$|E

A {{knowledge}} of the ionic and electrical gradients across the Malpighian tubules of Onymacris plana is fundamental {{to the understanding of}} the transport mechanisms of fluid across the basolateral and apical membranes. Until now no one has investigated the isolated perfused Malpighian tubule of Onymacris plana and simultaneously measured basolateral potentials. Malpighian tubule segments (about lmm length) were dissected out and perfused in vitro according to the method of Burg et. al.

40|$|The {{modulation}} of {{ion transport}} pathways in filtergrown monolayers of the Cl [...] secreting subclone (19 A) {{of the human}} colon carcinoma cell line HT- 29 by muscarinic stimulation was studied by combined Ussing chamber and microimpalement experiments. Basolateral addition of 10 - 4 m carbachol induced a complex poly-phasic change of the cell potential consisting of (i) a fast and short (30 -sec) depolarization of 15 ± 1 mV from a resting value of - 52 ± 1 mV and an increase of the <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> of the apical membrane (first phase), (ii) a repolarization of 22 ± 1 mV leading to a hyperpolarization of the cell (second phase), (iii) a depolarization of 11 ± 1 mV and a decrease of the <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> of the apical membrane (the third phase), (iv) and sometimes, a hyperpolarization of 6 ± 1 mV and an increase of the <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> of the apical membrane (fourth phase). The transepithelial potential increased with a peak value of 2. 4 ± 0. 3 mV (basolateral side positive). The transepithelial PD started to increase (serosa positive), coinciding with {{the start of the}} second phase of the intracellular potential change, and continued to increase during the third phase. Ion replacements and electrical circuit analyses indicate that the first phase is caused by increase of the Cl- conductance in the apical and basolateral membrane, the second phase by increased K+ conductance of the basolateral membrane, and the third phase and the fourth phase by increase and decrease, respectively, of an apical Cl- conductance. The first and second phase of the carbachol effect could be elicited also by ionomycin. They were strongly reduced by EGTA. Phorbol dibutyrate (PDB) induced a sustained depolarization of the cell and a decrease of the apical <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance.</b> The results suggest that two different types of Cl- channels are involved in the carbachol response: one Ca 2 + dependent and a second which may be PKC sensitive. In the presence of a supramaximal concentration of forskolin, carbachol evoked a further increase of the apical Cl- conductance. It is concluded that the short-lasting carbachol/Ca 2 +-dependent Cl- conductance is different from the forskolin-activated conductance. The increase of the Cl- conductance in the presence of forskolin by carbachol may be due to activation of different Cl- channels or to modulation of the PKA-activated Cl- channels by activated PKC...|$|E

We report {{on the characteristics of}} a new class of asymmetric meshes, tiled using a recently-discovered family of pentagons. Micron-scale meshes were fabricated on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates via optical lithography, metal evaporation (Ti 10 nm, Pt 50 nm) and lift-off. Three different designs were assessed, each with the same tessellation pattern and linewidth (5 micron), but with different sizes of the fundamental pentagonal unit. The designs corresponded to areal coverage of the metal patterns of 27 % (Design# 1), 14 % (Design# 2) and 9 % (Design# 3), respectively. Good mechanical stability was observed for both tensile strain and compressive strain. After 1, 000 bending cycles, devices subjected to tensile strain showed <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> increases in the range 8 % to 17 % with the lowest changes observed for Design# 2. Devices subjected to compressive strain showed <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> increases in the range 0 % to 7 % with best results observed for Design# 1. The performance of the pentagonal metal mesh devices as visible transparent heaters via Joule heating was also assessed. A saturation temperature of 88 +/- 1 degrees C was achieved at low voltage (5 V) with a fast response time (~ 20 s) and a high thermal resistance (168 +/- 6 degrees C cm 2 /W).

40|$|The {{present study}} scrutinizes the popular view that tremors of central origin but {{not those of}} {{peripheral}} origin are largely resistant to mechanical perturbations. We explore the effects of perturbations in a well-established model of peripheral tremor and document that (a) tremor frequency can remain unchanged when spring or weight loads are added, (b) entrainment by external drives can be limited to drives of similar frequency, and (c) resetting of tremor phase by torque pulses can remain <b>fractional.</b> This <b>resistance</b> to mechanical perturbations arises in the model because peripheral neuromuscular dynamics act as a limit-cycle oscillator which, by its very nature, will absorb moderate changes to signals and parameters. We conclude from our study that resistance to mechanical perturbations is not an exclusive property of central tremors, but rather may {{also be found in}} peripheral tremors. Other criteria are therefore needed to distinguish between different origins of tremor. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{behavior}} of highly ordered, segregated single-wall carbon nanotube (CNT) networks under applied strain. Polymer latex templates induce self-assembly of CNTs into hexagonal (2 D) and honeycomb (3 D) networks within the matrix. Using mechanical and spectroscopic analysis, we have studied the strain transfer mechanisms between the CNT network and the polymer matrix. Axial deformation of the nanotube network under applied strain is indicated by downshifts in the 2 D mode in the Raman spectra, as well as variation in the radial breathing modes. The slippage within nanotube bundles at high strain is indicated by a reduction in the 2 D mode rate of change.

Changes in electrophysiological parameters provoked by serosal addition of 10 - 5 m forskolin included: (i) a sustained increase in the transepithelial potential difference (3. 9 ± 0. 4 mV). (ii) a transient decrease in transepithelial resistance with 26 ± 3 Ω · cm 2 from a mean value of 138 ± 13 Ω · cm 2 before forskolin addition, (iii) a depolarization of the cell membrane potential by 24 ± 1 mV from a resting value of - 50 ± 1 mV and (iv) {{a decrease in the}} <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> of the apical membrane from 0. 80 ± 0. 02 to 0. 22 ± 0. 01. Both, the changes in cell potential and the <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance,</b> persisted for at least 10 min and were dependent on the presence of Cl- in the medium. Subsequent addition of bumetanide (10 - 4 m), an inhibitor of Na/K/ 2 Cl cotransport, reduced the transepithelial potential, induced a repolarization of the cell potential and provoked a small increase of the transepithelial resistance and fractional apical resistance. Serosal Ba 2 + (1 mm), a known inhibitor of basolateral K+ conductance, strongly reduced the electrical effects of forskolin. No evidence was found for a forskolin (cAMP) -induced modulation of basolateral K+ conductance. The results suggest that forskolin-induced Cl- secretion in the HT- 29 cl. 19 A colonic cell line results mainly from a cAMP-provoked increase in the Cl- conductance of the apical membrane but does not affect K+ or Cl- conductance pathways at the basolateral pole of the cell. The sustained potential changes indicate that the capacity of the basolateral transport mechanism for Cl- and the basal Ba 2 +-sensitive K+ conductance are sufficiently large to maintain the Cl- efflux across the apical membrane. Furthermore, evidence is presented for an anomalous inhibitory action of the putative Cl- channel blockers NPPB and DPC on basolateral conductance rather than apical Cl- conductance...|$|E

Omission of amiloride increased the Isc from 5. 7 to 27. 6 microA/cm 2 due to the rise in apical membrane conductance from 21 to 595 microS/cm 2.

Specific membrane conductances were calculated from equivalent circuit equations. Transport properties of the apical and basolateral membranes were investigated during control conditions and short-term increases in basolateral potassium concentration [K+] from 2. 5 to 20 mmol/l, with or without 0. 5 mmol/l Ba 2 + at the basolateral side. As in most other epithelia, the apical membrane represents the major resistive barrier. Transcellular, apical and basolateral membrane conductances (gc, go and gi respectively), obtained from 22 acceptable microelectrode studies, averaged 61, 80 and 292 microS/cm 2, respectively. There was a highly significant correlation between short-circuit current (Isc) and go, whereas gi was unrelated to Isc. The Isc, which averaged 4. 1 microA/cm 2, was almost completely blocked by amiloride. This was associated with fast hyperpolarization; the intracellular potential (Vsc) increased from - 69 to - 83 mV and the <b>fractional</b> apical <b>resistance</b> rose to nearly 100 %. Using the values of Vsc during amiloride at normal and high [K+], an apparent transference number for K+ at the basolateral membrane of 0. 72 can be calculated. This value corresponds with the decrease in gi to about 25 % of the control values after blocking the K+ channels with Ba 2 +. The nature of the remaining conductance is presently unclear. The cellular current decreased during high [K+] and Ba 2 +, in part resulting from reduction of the electrochemical gradient for apical Na+ uptake due to the depolarization.

Characteristics of the particle motion allow improved volume distribution determinations by properly accounting for the shape factor.

Kb+ depolarization caused an initial decrease of the short-circuit current (Isc) with a subsequent {{return of the}} Isc toward control values in 60 - 90 min. Whereas basolateral membrane resistance (Rb) and voltage were decreased markedly by high [Kb+], apical membrane electrical resistance (Ra) was decreased also. After 60 min, intracellular voltage averaged - 27. 3 mV, transcellular <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> (fRa) was 86. 8 %, and Ra and Rb were decreased to 36. 1 and 13. 0 %, of their control values, respectively. Amiloride-induced noise analysis of the apical membrane Na+ channels revealed that Na+ channel density was increased approximately 72 % while single-channel Na+ current was decreased to 39. 9 % of control, roughly proportional to the decrease of apical membrane voltage (34. 0 % of control). In control and Kb+-depolarized epithelia, the Na+ channel density exhibited a phenomenon of autoregulation. Inhibition of Na+ entry (by amiloride) caused large increases of Na+ channel density toward saturating values of approximately 520 X 10 (6) channels/cm 2 in Kb+-depolarized tissues. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of cultured human nasal epithelia to hypertonic bathing solutions {{was tested using}} ion-selective microelectrode and quantitative microscopy. Raised luminal, but not serosal, osmolality (+/- 150 mM mannitol) decreased Na+ absorption but did not induce Cl- secretion. Raised luminal osmolality increased cell Cl- activity, Na+ activity, and transepithelial resistance and decreased both apical and basolateral membrane potentials and the <b>fractional</b> <b>resistance</b> of the apical membrane; equivalent circuit analysis revealed increases in apical, basolateral, and shunt resistances. Prolonged exposure (10 min) to 430 mosM luminal solution elicited no regulation of any parameter. Optical measurements revealed {{a reduction in the}} thickness of preparations only in response to luminal hypertonic solutions. We conclude that (a) airway epithelial cells exhibit asymmetric water transport properties, with the apical membrane water permeability exceeding that of the basolateral membrane; (b) the cellular response to volume loss is a deactivation of the basolateral membrane K+ conductance and the apical membrane Cl- conductance; (c) luminal hypertonicity slows the rate of Na+ absorption but does not induce Cl- secretion; and (d) cell volume loss increases the resistance of the paracellular path. We speculate that these properties configure human nasal epithelium to behave as an osmotic sensor, transducing information about luminal solutions to the airway wall...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} {{addition}} of ATP to the mucosal bathing solution on transepithelial, apical, and basolateral membrane voltages and resistances in Necturus gallbladder epithelium were determined. Mucosal ATP (100 IxM) caused a rapid hyperpolarization of both apical (Vmc) and basolateral (Vcs) cell membrane voltages (AV m [...] 18 -+ 1 mV), a fall in transepithelial resistance (Rt) from 142 -+ 8 to 122 - 7 12. cm 2, and {{a decrease in}} <b>fractional</b> apical membrane <b>resistance</b> (fR~) from 0. 93 - 0. 02 to 0. 83 _+ 0. 03. The rapid initial hyperpolarization of Vmc and V, was followed by a slower depolarization of cell membrane voltages and a lumen-negative change in transepithelial voltage (Vm~). This phase also included an additional decrease in fR~. Removal of the ATP caused a further depolarization of membrane voltages followed by a hyperpolarization and then a return to control values, fR ~ fell to a minimum after removal of ATP and then returned to control values as the cell membrane voltages repolarized. Similar responses could be elicited by ADP but not by adenosine. The results of two-point cable experiments revealed that ATP induced an initial increase in cell membrane conductance followed by a decrease. Transient elevations of mucosal solution [K÷] induced a larger depolarization of Vmc and Vcs during exposure to ATP than under control conditions. Reduction of mucosal solution [CI-] induced a slow hyperpolarization of Vm, and V, before exposure to ATP and a rapid depolarization during exposure to ATP. We conclude that ATP 4 - is the active agent and that it causes a concentration-dependent increase in apical and basolateral membrane K + permeability. In addition, an apical membrane electrodiffusive C 1 - permeability is activated by ATP 4 -...|$|R
40|$|Electrophysiological {{techniques}} {{were used to}} determine the electrical properties of the collecting duct (CD) cell in the isolated cortical collecting duct from obstructed (UUOOK) and contralateral (UUOCK) kidneys in rabbits 24 h after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO); results were compared with those from sham-operated kidneys. The lumen-negative transepithelial voltage and the basolateral membrane voltage (VB) were decreased in the UUOOK, and increased in the UUOCK. The transepithelial conductance (GT) was decreased in parallel with an increase in the <b>fractional</b> apical membrane <b>resistance</b> (fRA) and a decrease in apical membrane conductance in the UUOOK. By contrast, the GT was increased in parallel with increases in apical and basolateral membrane conductances in the UUOCK. The amiloride-sensitive changes in apical membrane voltage (VA), GT and fRA were lower in the UUOOK, but greater in the UUOCK. The changes in VA and GT upon raising the perfusate K+ concentration and upon addition of luminal Ba 2 + were decreased in the UUOOK, and increased in the UUOCK. Addition of ouabain to the bath resulted in a smaller depolarization of VB in the UUOOK, but in a greater depolarization in the UUOCK. Upon lowering bath Cl-, the change in basolateral membrane electromotive force (delta EMF) was increased in the UUOOK, and decreased in the UUOCK. Reversely, upon raising bath K+, the delta EMF was decreased in the UUOOK, and increased in the UUOCK. We conclude: (a) the conductances of Na+ and K+ in the apical membrane, and active Na(+) -K+ pump activity and relative K+ conductance in the basolateral membrane are decreased in the UUOOK, and increased in the UUOCK; (b) the relative basolateral membrane Cl- conductance was increased in the UUOOK, and decreased in the UUOCK...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} make the {{prediction}} of land surface heat fluxes more robust, two improvements were made to an operational two-layer model proposed previously by Zhang. These improvements are: 1) a surface energy balance method is used to determine the theoretical boundary lines (namely Ã¢Â€Â˜true wet/cool edgeÃ¢Â€Â™ and Ã¢Â€Â˜true dry/warm edgeÃ¢Â€Â™ in the trapezoid) in the scatter plot for the surface temperature versus the fractional vegetation cover in mixed pixels; 2) a new assumption that the slope of the Tm Ã¢Â€Â“ f curves is mainly controlled by soil water content is introduced. The variables required by the improved method include near surface vapor pressure, air temperature, surface <b>resistance,</b> aerodynamic <b>resistance,</b> <b>fractional</b> vegetation cover, surface temperature and net radiation. The model predictions from the improved model were assessed in this study by in situ measurements, which show that the total latent heat flux from the soil and vegetation are in close agreement with the in situ measurement with an RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) ranging from 30 w/m 2 ~ 50 w/m 2,which is consistent with the site scale measurement of latent heat flux. Because soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration are not measured separately from the field site, in situ measured CO 2 flux is used to examine the modeled ÃŽÂ»Eveg. Similar trends of seasonal variations of vegetation were found for the canopy transpiration retrievals and in situ CO 2 flux measurements. The above differences are mainly caused by 1) the scale disparity between the field measurement and the MODIS observation; 2) the non-closure problem of the surface energy balance from the surface fluxes observations themselves. The improved method was successfully used to predict the component surface heat fluxes from the soil and vegetation and it provides a promising approach to study the canopy transpiration and the soil evaporation quantitatively during the rapid growing season of winter wheat in northern China...|$|R
