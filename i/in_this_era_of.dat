25|$|Gothic Revival {{became the}} {{dominant}} style of Canadian civic architecture {{largely as a}} matter of timing. The mid and late 19th century was the period that the Canadian state was formed and when many of its secular and religious institutions were established. Canadian Confederation occurred in 1867, and subsequent years saw a large construction programme as the government and civil service established itself in Ottawa and across the country. Rapid growth of cities, especially in Ontario, saw most Christian denominations in most cities build major churches during this period. The downtowns of most Canadian cities are thus dotted with Gothic Revival churches. Canada's historic secular institutions, such as universities and museums, were also founded <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> rapid growth.|$|E

Even though the club did not manage to repeat the win of the Dutch championship in the following years, they still performed well in the Eredivisie with a third place in 1999–00, a second place in 2000–01, and a third place in 2001–02. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> his career, Tomasson each season managed to score a high number of goals, and had the honour of being top scorer of Feyenoord in 2000–01 with a tally of 15 Eredivisie goals.

25|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century Pan-Slavic {{language}} projects were mostly the domain of Slovenes and Croats. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> awakening national consciousness, the Russians were the only Slavs who had their own state; other Slavic peoples inhabited large, mostly non-Slavic states, and clear borders between the various nations were mostly lacking. Among the numerous efforts at creating written standards for the South Slavic languages there were also efforts at establishing a common South Slavic language, Illyrian, that might also serve as a literary language for all Slavs in the future. Of special importance is the work of Matija Majar (1809–1892), a Slovenian Austroslavist who later converted to Pan-Slavism. In 1865 he published Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski ("Mutual Slavic Orthography"). In this work, he postulated that the best way for Slavs to communicate with other Slavs was taking own language as a starting point and then modifying it in steps. First, he proposed changing the orthography of each individual language into a generic ("mutual") Pan-Slavic orthography, subsequently he described a grammar that was based on comparing the five major Slavic languages of his days: Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Polish, Czech and Serbian. Apart from a book about the language itself, Majar also used it for a biography of Cyril and Methodius and for a magazine he published in the years 1873–1875, Slavjan. A fragment in the language can still be seen on the altar of Majar's church in Görtschach. Other Pan-Slavic language projects were published in the same period by the Croatian Matija Ban, the Slovenes Radoslav Razlag and Božidar Raič, as well as the Bulgarian from Macedonia Grigor Parlichev – all based on the idea of combining Old Church Slavonic with elements from the modern South Slavic languages.|$|E

After becoming an accomplished music video director, his interest <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> Australian filmmaking grew and he spent years researching a potential documentary film. He was close to giving up on the project when he sent a 100-page draft of the script to American film director Quentin Tarantino, not expecting to receive a reply. Tarantino was a longtime fan of [...] "Ozploitation" [...] films and had even dedicated his film Kill Bill to Brian Trenchard-Smith's work. He replied the day after, telling Hartley {{that he would do}} whatever he could to get the film made. Hartley traveled to Los Angeles, California to meet with Tarantino, who agreed to sit for hours of interviews as one of the film's most prominent interviewees. Hartley spent the following five years interviewing other actors, directors, screenwriters and producers, collecting original stock footage, and then cutting the 100 hours of interviews and 150 hours of film footage down into a 100-minute film.|$|E
500|$|Within the {{contemporary}} American literary scene Griswold {{became known as}} erratic, dogmatic, pretentious, and vindictive.

Later anthologies such as Prose Writers of America and Female Poets of America helped him become known as a literary dictator, whose approval writers sought even while they feared his growing power. Even {{as they tried to}} impress him, however, several authors voiced their opinion on Griswold's character. Ann S. Stephens called him two-faced and [...] "constitutionally incapable of speaking the truth". Even his friends knew him as a consummate liar and had a saying: [...] "Is that a Griswold or a fact?" [...] Another friend once called him [...] "one of the most irritable and vindictive men I ever met". Author Cornelius Mathews wrote in 1847 that Griswold fished for writers to exploit, warning [...] "the poor little innocent fishes" [...] to avoid his [...] "Griswold Hook". A review of one of Griswold's anthologies, published anonymously in the Philadelphia Saturday Museum on January 28, 1843, but believed to have been written by Poe, asked: [...] "What will be [...] fate? Forgotten, save only by those whom he has injured and insulted, he will sink into oblivion, without leaving a landmark to tell that he once existed; or if he is spoken of hereafter, he will be quoted as the unfaithful servant who abused his trust." ...|$|E

2500|$|European-based piracy of {{the modern}} era began in the [...] "Atlantic Triangle". [...] This common area of oceangoing {{commerce}} between Seville & Cadiz, the Azores Islands, and the northwest coast of Africa, encompassing Madeira and the Canary Islands was haunted by both European, {{as well as the}} Berber Coast pirates of North Africa throughout the sixteenth century. As consistent trade increased between Spain and Portugal and the East and West Indies, respectively, so did piracy. What Spain and Portugal would call piracy was often sponsored by, even if only at times marginally, monarchs such as Elizabeth I and Edward VI of England. Most popular <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> privateers was Francis Drake. Drake raided Spanish settlements and shipping in the South Sea shores of present-day Peru, Chile, Brazil, and Venezuela, along the coasts of Central America. This era was notable for beginning somewhat regular long-term visits to the west Coast of the Americas and further to the East Indies, often after stopping in West Africa to loot slaving ships or towns. Dutch merchants were active in the Caribbean, mining salt and dyewoods on the coast of Brazil. This activity lead to dozens of raids along the West Coast of the Americas and to the formation of the West India Company which had semi-legal standing as privateers. This large continuous harassment incensed Spain and put their the inhabitants in fear. By the turn of the seventeenth century this vast expansion of the Dutch had formed colonies in the East Indies and soon they started feeling as well the wrath of piracy. Shortly buccaneers followed in the seventeenth century. These bandits mostly raided land settlements. They were [...] "embittered Dutch sailors", [...] "abandoned French colonists", [...] "abused English, Scots, and Irish indentures." ...|$|E
