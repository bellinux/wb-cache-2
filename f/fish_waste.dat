25|$|The {{biological}} load, or bioload, is {{a measure}} of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its inhabitants. High biological loading presents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to upset. Several fundamental constraints on biological loading depend on aquarium size. The water's surface area limits oxygen intake. The bacteria population depends on the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement. Biologically, biological loading refers to the rate of biological decay in proportion to tank volume. Adding plants to an aquarium will sometimes help greatly with taking up <b>fish</b> <b>waste</b> as plant nutrients. Although an aquarium can be overloaded with fish, an excess of plants is unlikely to cause harm. Decaying plant material, such as decaying plant leaves, can add these nutrients back into the aquarium if not promptly removed. The bioload is processed by the aquarium's biofilter filtration system.|$|E
25|$|The Nivkh had {{a diverse}} diet being semi-sedentary before colonization. Fish {{was the main}} source of food for the Nivkh, {{including}} pink, Pacific, and chum salmon as well as trout, Red Eye, burbot and pike found in rivers and streams. Salt water fishing provided saffron cod, flatfish, and marine goby caught in the littoral coasts of the Strait of Tartary, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean, though over fishing by Russian and Japanese trawlers have depleted many of these fish stocks. Additionally, industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals in the Amur River have devastated fish stocks and damaged the soil of the estuaries. A traditional preservation process called Yukola, involving slicing the fish in a particular way and drying the strips by hanging them in the frigid air, without salt, was used before foreign influences. The preservation process created a lot of dried <b>fish</b> <b>waste,</b> unpalatable for human consumption but utilized for dog food. Pulverizing dried fish and mixing it with fish skins, water, seal fat, and berries until the mixture had a sour cream consistency is a favorite Nivkh dish called mos. Nivkhs would hunt seal (Larha, Reinged, Reibbon, Sea-lions), duck, sable, and otters. They would gather various berries, wild leeks, lilybulbs, and nuts. Contacts with the Chinese, Manchu, and Japanese from the 12th century on introduced new foods incorporated in the Nivkhs diet such as salt, sugar, rice, millet, legumes and tea. Russian 19th century colonisation introduced flour, bread, potatoes, vodka, tobacco, butter, canned vegetables and fruits, and other meats.|$|E

All diets were provided at five levels: 0. 0625, 0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1. 0 g/l. For all diets, life history parameters showed the highest values at the lowest concentrations, i. e., < 0. 125 g/l. Overall demographic performance was better in M. macrocopa fed the emulsified liquid diets than M. macrocopa raised in the control treatment (dechlorinated water; no diet) but not as good as in M. macrocopa fed the <b>fish</b> <b>wastes.</b> <b>Fish</b> feces was excellent for propagating M. macrocopa.

2500|$|The {{microfauna}} {{found on}} live rock are detrivores and herbivores (as they eat algae and <b>fish</b> <b>waste),</b> and provide fish with a natural, attractive shelter. Live rock usually arrives from online dealers as [...] "uncured", {{and must be}} quarantined in a separate tank while undergoing the curing process, which involves the inevitable die-off {{of some of the}} rock's inhabitants and the subsequent production of undesirable ammonia and nitrite.

2500|$|In a fishless cycle, {{small amounts}} of ammonia are added to an {{unpopulated}} tank to feed the bacteria. During this process, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are tested to monitor progress. The [...] "silent" [...] cycle is basically nothing more than densely stocking the aquarium with fast-growing aquatic plants and relying on them to consume the nitrogen, allowing the necessary bacterial populations time to develop. According to anecdotal reports, the plants can consume nitrogenous waste so efficiently that ammonia and nitrite level spikes seen in more traditional cycling methods are greatly reduced or disappear. [...] "Slow growth" [...] entails slowly increasing the population of fish {{over a period of}} 6 to 8 weeks, giving bacteria colonies time to grow and stabilize with the increase in <b>fish</b> <b>waste.</b> [...] This method is usually done with a small starter population of hardier fish which can survive the ammonia and nitrite spikes, whether they are intended to be permanent residents or to be traded out later for the desired occupants.|$|E
2500|$|Animal fats are a {{by-product}} of meat production and cooking. Although {{it would not be}} efficient to raise animals (or catch fish) simply for their fat, use of the by-product adds value to the livestock industry (hogs, cattle, poultry).

Currently, a 5-million dollar plant is being built in the USA, with the intent of producing 11.4million litres (3million gallons) biodiesel from some of the estimated 1billion kg (2.2billion pounds) of chicken fat produced annually at the local Tyson poultry plant. Similarly, some small-scale biodiesel factories use waste fish oil as feedstock.

50|$|Sea cage {{aquaculture}} {{is responsible}} for nutrient enrichment of the waters {{in which they are}} established. This results from <b>fish</b> <b>wastes</b> and uneaten feed inputs. Elements of most concern are nitrogen and phosphorus which can promote algal growth, including harmful algal blooms which can be toxic to fish.

2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{refers to the}} conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrite and finally nitrate. While <b>fish</b> <b>waste</b> (urine and feces) and decaying matter release ammonia, the majority of ammonia released (approximately 60%) in both marine and freshwater aquariums is excreted directly into {{the water from the}} fishes' gills. Biological (bacterial) nitrification converts the ammonia into nitrite ions, NO2-, and then to nitrate ions, NO3-. Nitrate is readily taken up and assimilated by algae and hermatypic corals. Some nitrate is converted via an anaerobic bacterial process to free nitrogen, but this process is very difficult to maintain. In the recent past, most nitrate, which is less toxic to fishes and most invertebrates than nitrites, accumulated in the water until it was physically removed by a water change. [...] However, many marine aquarists are now employing the use of a special section of the tank or separate tank altogether, called a [...] "refugium." [...] A refugium is, as its name suggests, a sheltered area that shares water with the primary, or display, tank. [...] Refugiums usually contain a deep sand bed to allow anoxic zones to develop within them where anaerobic bacteria can convert nitrate into nitrogen gas, a useful means of nitrate removal. [...] Various types of macroalgae can be grown and harvested from the refugium as another means of nitrate export. [...] As refugiums become more common in marine aquaria, nitrate levels are easily manageable for even the novice hobbyist. [...] Ammonia and nitrite should be tested regularly; any detectable levels (i.e., over 0 ppm) can be indicative of a problem. Nitrates should not exceed 2 ppm in reef tanks, or 20 ppm in fish-only tanks. It is sometimes acceptable to have a small amount of nitrate buildup, as some livestock, especially fish, are fairly tolerant of nitrate. Most corals, while able to assimilate nitrate, cannot be expected to survive, much less thrive, with high nitrate concentrations.|$|E

Large concentration of crude glycerol has been inhibitory in the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge; in fact, the recommended concentration is around 0.6 – 3  %. However, the crude glycerol addition increased the methane yield around 2 – 4 times compared with the control (Fountoulakis et al. 2010; Athanasoulia et al. 2014; Nghiem et al. 2014). Similar to sewage sludge, pig manure anaerobic digestion was improved {{by the addition of}} crude glycerol. Alvarez et al.

Likewise, Astals et al. 2013 incremented the methane generation in 180  % by adding 3  % crude glycerol (Astals et al. 2013). Crude glycerol has been identified as a sustainable carbon source for denitrification processes. In the work of Bodik et al.
