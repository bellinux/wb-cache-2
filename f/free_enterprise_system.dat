Barkley, Governor Gordon Browning, Atomic Energy Commission Chairman David E. Lilienthal, and movie star Marie McDonald were on hand to watch the guards take down the barriers. Access to the nuclear facilities was controlled by three Oak Ridge gatehouses. On 6 June 1951, the Senate Appropriations Committee called on the Atomic Energy Commission to discontinue [...] "the present undemocratic method" [...] of operating the community, and it initiated steps to coerce Oak Ridge residents to establish democratic institutions and adopt a <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, author Timothy Sexton {{wrote an}} article titled [...] "Hoodwinked: A Postmodern Examination of the Dangers of Runaway Capitalism" [...] for Associated Content, in which he posited that Hoodwinked! {{was one of the}} first postmodern {{animated}} films and also carried political undertones. He argued that the relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from the original fairy tale as the film explored the story from each of the central characters' points of view. Calling Hoodwinked! [...] "the most subversive movie released nationwide since Fahrenheit 9/11", Sexton went on to interpret the film as a critique on the <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>system.</b> He drew comparisons between the film's villain and the typical American business owner, going so far as to say that the character was [...] "clearly based on people like Bill Gates and Sam Walton". In Sexton's view, the film exposed the flaws of capitalism, showing that if left unregulated, business owners will establish monopolies and eliminate competition.|$|E

[...] In the documentary Breakfast with Hunter, Hunter S. Thompson is seen in several scenes wearing different Che Guevara T-shirts.

40|$|Recent global {{recession}} has motivated this predominantly historical and exploratory research of thoughts and perceptions. A continuous planning of governmental correction of any market failure, such as {{various types of}} externalities and information asymmetry, has been strongly recommended by the pioneers of <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>systems.</b> Capitalism—in which private ownership of means of production, physical capital, human capital, financial capital, brand-name capital, social capital, land, and mineral deposits are all protected by law without implementation {{of a series of}} certain evolving ethical standards and principles—may not continue to be the same efficient system as implied to be by the cost-benefit balancing forces of free markets. Two survey instruments on perceptions of ethics (with 110 participants) and religion (with 117 different participants), influenced by observations of various events of the recent years, were given to Business and Economics students at the PhD, Master’s, and undergraduate levels to assess the perceptions of some educated and/or being-educated people about the market economic system, ethics, and religion.

40|$|In this {{constantly}} changing global environment, Japan and Korea have shown impressive economic growth by creating formidable industrial powerhouse {{in the past}} two decades that carved out market shares in Asia, Europe, Latin and North America regions. They are known as Asia’s second and third biggest economies with a real gross domestic product (GDP) in the trillions. Their economic development strategies strongly mirror each other because of an industrial group system which was fostered from zaibatsu (prewar), a family owned organization that dominated both the economic activities by controlling industrial and financial policies through single-parent intervention concept. After the postwar (WWII) this organization was broken up by the United States (occupier) and transformed into zeirestu and chaebol conglomerates system which were supposed to promote a more <b>free</b> independent <b>enterprise</b> <b>system.</b> This research paper will address how these two inter-corporate group alliances systems influence their economies’ strategic decision-making processes...|$|R

He wrote: I feel very definitely that the Nixon administration is absolutely correct in cracking down on companies and corporations and municipalities that continue to pollute the nation's air and water.

5000|$|An {{early use}} of the term in English was in 1898 by the French {{economist}} Charles Gide to describe the economic beliefs of the Italian economist Maffeo Pantaleoni, with the term [...] "néo-libéralisme" [...] previously existing in French, and the term was later used by others including the economist Milton Friedman in a 1951 essay. In 1938 at the Colloque Walter Lippmann, the term [...] "neoliberalism" [...] was proposed, among other terms, and ultimately chosen to be used to describe a certain set of economic beliefs. The colloquium defined the concept of neoliberalism as involving [...] "the priority of the price mechanism, <b>free</b> <b>enterprise,</b> the <b>system</b> of competition, and a strong and impartial state". To be [...] "neoliberal" [...] meant advocating a modern economic policy with state intervention. Neoliberal state interventionism brought a clash with the opposing laissez-faire camp of classical liberals, like Ludwig von Mises. Most scholars in the 1950s and 1960s understood neoliberalism as referring to the social market economy and its principal economic theorists such as Eucken, Röpke, Rüstow, and Müller-Armack. Although Hayek had intellectual ties to the German neoliberals, his name was only occasionally mentioned in conjunction with neoliberalism during this period due to his more pro-free market stance.|$|R

40|$|During the 1980 s, {{the rhetoric}} of “supply side ” {{economics}} became dominant in the United States. The individualistic tenor of the dialogue mirrored that of Social Darwinists {{at the turn of}} the century when natural law was deemed to ensure the “survival of the fittest ” (Merino, 1993). However, the draconian nature of the supply side dialogue generated increased awareness of the lack of a moral component in the vocabulary of the dominant economic ideology (Shepard, et al., 1997). Since any <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> economic <b>system</b> requires trust to ensure its long term survival, the amorality of the new dialogue created a new challenge for educators. During the decade of the 1980 s, a wealth of academic literature emerged in all business disciplines that stressed the need for educators to make students aware of the moral dimensions of their discipline. Accounting, which often is referred to as the language of business, was not immune. Stephen Wallman (1995), a recent SEC commissioner captured the mood of the day when he wrote: Accountants are the gatekeepers of our financial markets. Without accountants to ensure the quality and integrity of financial information, the markets for capital would be far less efficient, the cost of capital would be higher, and standard of living would be lower. [Wallman, 1995 p. 82] Wallman emphasizes the important role that accountants play in generating the trust necessary for a fre...|$|R
