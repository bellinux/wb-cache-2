5000|$|If Blair defects with Vagabond, {{he arrives}} with Eisen, Maniac, Vagabond and Catscratch at the BWS Intrepid, an old Durango-class carrier that has {{recently}} suffered damage from a Confed attack. Much {{of the senior}} staff has been killed, including Eisen's contact (and old friend) Captain Dominguez. The two officers currently sharing the command, Colonels Jacob 'Hawk' Manley (Chris Mulkey) and Tamara 'Panther' <b>Farnsworth</b> (<b>Elizabeth</b> Barondes), assign Blair as Wing Commander for the flight group, and Eisen becomes her captain. Other Intrepid natives include Chief Technician Robert [...] "Pliers" [...] Sykes (Richard Riehle), Colonel John 'Gash' Dekker (Jeremy Roberts), head of the ship's contingent of Marines; and communications technician Lieutenant Velina Sosa (Holly Gagnier), whom Catscratch quickly takes a shine to. Eisen confides that he's {{been in touch with}} connections back on Earth, and it seems that the nascent Confed-Border Worlds war is being instigated by elements within Confed. He defected so that he could hunt for proof of this. Blair and Maniac succeed in downing the Lexington, though Paulsen escapes in a shuttle with Seether. Seether kills Paulsen for his failure.|$|R

40|$|Among the {{political}} documentaries produced in Chile in the postauthoritarian era {{there is a}} significant corpus of films that carry out a meticulous process of forensic memory. Both documentaries that dig through skeletal remains and those that excavate the memories of surviving victims or witnesses of state terror are carrying out similar archaeological forensic work. They examine records that, rather than simply evidencing past violence, exhibit the fractures (subjective and discursive) from which the past may be reconstructed. By focusing on these tasks the films La ciudad de los fotógrafos (Sebastián Moreno, 2007), El juez y el general (<b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Farnsworth</b> and Patricio Lanfranco, 2008), and El diario de Agustín (Ignacio Agüero, 2008) become media for reflection that makes it possible for viewers to confront their own history—in order to make ethical judgments that allow them to assume personal and collective responsibility {{in the face of a}} history that they have lived or have assimilated through a process of “post-memory. ” To the question posed by Arendt— whether thinking can help to correct and eradicate acts of radical evil—we could respond that postauthoritarian Chilean documentary finds itself dealing precisely with this possibility through accounts that, by means of personal experience and sifting through one’s own biographical ruins, call on spectators to delve into their own fears and complicities...|$|E
