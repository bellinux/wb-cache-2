50|$|This was {{the opening}} {{number of the}} 1992 Best of Torvill and Dean Tour that they {{performed}} with a Ukrainian ice dancing company. Only a small clip of it {{is known to be}} available on the internet, so not an awful lot is known about the dance except that it is a group number with Torvill and Dean performing with the whole company. Their costumes in this piece are possibly their most unusual of any of their performances. Jayne wears a white fur hat and a blue velvet dress with white <b>fur</b> <b>finish</b> and ornate and decorative gold ties and buttons pattern in the middle. Chris similarly wears a blue velvet top piece with the same gold effect, white trousers with a single blue stripe on each leg, and a velvet blue jacket with <b>fur</b> <b>finish</b> slung over his shoulder throughout the routine. The final section of this show had a weather theme, and the final bow call was done to Over the Rainbow which has the whole company skate on, with Torvill and Dean arriving last to take their bow last with the whole company.|$|R

50|$|The split-horn headdress {{was very}} popular among Northern Plains Indians, {{particularly}} those {{nations of the}} Blackfoot Confederacy. Many warrior societies, including the Horn Society of the Blackfoot, wore the split-horn headdress. The split-horn headdress was made from a single bison horn, split in two and reshaped as slimmer versions of a full-sized bison horn, and polished. The horns were attached to a beaded, rimmed felt hat. Furs from weasels (taken when carrying heavy winter coats) were attached {{to the top of}} the headdress, and dangled from the sides. The side <b>furs</b> were often <b>finished</b> with bead work where attached to the headdress. A similar headdress, called the antelope horn headdress, was made in a similar fashion using the horn or horns from a pronghorn antelope.|$|R
5000|$|When Thomas Jefferson, {{the third}} {{president}} of the United States, completed the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 he opened {{a great deal of}} free land for American fur traders. Forts quickly sprung up along rivers and overland trails to act as parts of the nationally run factory system. The factory system was a nationally funded and operated system, in which Native Americans would meet at certain forts and exchange <b>furs</b> for <b>finished</b> goods. The American government had hoped that nationalizing the fur trade would prevent the debauchery caused by the trading of alcohol with the Natives. The Factory System eventually failed for many reasons. First, the men working the factories were ex-military men and not experienced fur traders. These men often mishandled the furs resulting in major profit shifts. Second, the government failed to stop all private traders who bribed Natives with alcohol. Eager to get access to liquor, the Natives would break treaties with the government to get it. Lastly, the factories were not permitted to give presents to Natives or assimilate into Native culture as many private fur traders could. Miscegeny, or intermarriage between two cultures, was a major uniting force between private fur traders and natives that strengthened their relationship.|$|R
5000|$|Eto-Shin of the Monkey. She {{is ranked}} at #9. She protects the Northern Kanto region. (Her name is {{sometimes}} spelled [...] "Key-tan") Kii-tan has short, yellow hair, {{with a piece}} standing up. Her hair is usually tied up into a pony tail at the side with a pink hawaii flower. She has light-brown amberish eyes and fair skin {{as well as two}} monkey ears and a tail. Her clothes consist of a yellow crop top surrounded by a black stripe at the bottom and a yellow skirt with some short black leggings and a pair of black uggs with red <b>fur</b> to <b>finish</b> the look off. Kii-tan is a owner of positive thinking, knowing how to speak and act, so she is well mannered, but she also is a naughty girl who is very curious and pure. Even if she is well-mannered, she has a mischievous side and enjoys fooling around with Inu-tan. She is also very impulsive and naïve but makes up for it with her trait of 'always learning from mistakes. Despite them both arguing and having disagreements, Kii-tan and Inu-tan seem to be like sisters to each other, their antics ranging from messing with each other to unintentionally synchronizing with each other. :They both seem like best friends and both of them seem to have a twin-bond.|$|R

50|$|The wanted villain enters, peg-legged, guns blazing! He {{makes his}} way to the bar as a terrified Bosko again shines his badge and screws up his courage in {{anticipation}} of a fight. Leveling his pistol, he takes aim at the unimpressed ruffian and fires, only to find that, in lieu of bullets, his gun contained only a tethered cork. But the incensed villain takes out his weapon and, just as he is about to fire upon poor Bosko, the clever little fellow spots and spits on a hanging gas lamp, thereby bringing darkness upon the saloon. There is gunfire in the dark, and the light comes back on to reveal the villain still standing, panting, amidst a multitude of smoke, empty seats, and battered tables. The patrons all seem to have left; the villain turns his back and Bosko pops out from under the floorboards mounting a machine gun, which he fires square upon the bad guy's rump. Undaunted, the angry adversary brandishes a saber and chases Bosko to the double doors: these Our Hero swings just so that, himself leaping from the entryway, the fast-pursuing villain's head becomes stuck in the doors. His foe momentarily incapacitated, Bosko captures the sword and sticks it into the villain's rear end. Enraged afresh and newly energized by this latest affront, the villain chases Bosko again, this time {{to the other end of}} the bar, where Bosko removes a shotgun from its wall mount: aiming, he fires at the antagonist who, because of the blast, is reduced to a scared, scrawny fellow surrounded by his bandoliers and a ring of his erstwhile <b>fur.</b> Quite <b>finished,</b> he runs off, out of the bar and into the distance. The patrons return to the scene of the action to cheer for their rescuer, who takes a few bows as the iris closes.|$|R
