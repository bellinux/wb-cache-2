25|$|Her {{battered}} {{body was}} found 18 March 2004, in a rolled-up carpet {{on the grounds of}} Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire. It weighed only six stone (84 lb or 36kg), and was covered with burns and bruises. There were a total of 60 separate injuries. Her ear was scarred and swollen, had split in half, and become infected; <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> injured so much that her bottom lip had detached. She had eleven broken ribs. The ultimate cause of death had been thrombosis from a blood clot in her brain, brought on by septicaemia, dehydration and repeated assaults. The injuries were such that police at first thought they had found the body of a young boy. Police took weeks to identify her, launching an appeal on the BBC TV programme Crimewatch and consulting Interpol. She was 20 years old.|$|E
500|$|Following refusals from Spain, Portugal, France and Savoy, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, {{suggested}} Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. James II of England {{put forward}} his brother-in-law, Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena, but the Princess deemed a duke too lowly {{in terms of}} protocol for {{the daughter of a}} grand duke. The Elector Palatine obtained the style Royal Highness from the Holy Roman Emperor for Cosimo III in February 1691. (Cosimo had hitherto been outranked by the Duke of Savoy — much to his anger—who derived royal status from his successful pretendership to the abolished Cypriot throne). Consequently, Johann Wilhelm was ultimately chosen. He and Anna Maria Luisa were married by proxy on 29 April 1691. At the accompanying festivities, a contemporary describes the Electress's physical attributes: [...] "In her person, she is tall, her complexion was fair, her eyes large and expressive, both those and her hair were black; <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> small, with a fullness of the lips; her teeth were as white as ivory...." ...|$|E
500|$|Hill was short, {{like all}} her family, and {{indifferent}} to fashion. Her friend Henrietta Barnett wrote: [...] "She was small in stature with long body and short legs. She did not dress, she only wore clothes, which were often unnecessarily unbecoming; she had soft and abundant hair and regular features, but {{the beauty of}} her face lay in brown and very luminous eyes, which quite unconsciously she lifted upwards as she spoke on any matter for which she cared. <b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> large and mobile, but not improved by laughter. Indeed, Miss Octavia was nicest when she was made passionate by her earnestness." [...] Barnett also spoke of Hill's streak of ruthlessness. Gertrude Bell called Hill despotic. Later in Hill's life, the Bishop of London, Frederick Temple, encountered her {{at a meeting of}} the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and wrote, [...] "She spoke for half an hour … I never had such a beating in all my life." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} promote the single, Lohan {{appeared}} on Sessions@AOL on December 2, 2004, where she performed [...] "Over". Her first televised appearance was on Good Morning America, four days later, {{as a part of}} the Women Rule Concert Series, where she sang [...] "Over" [...] accompanied by a performance of [...] "Rumors". While she sang [...] "Over" [...] with no problems, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> not moving for a second during the performance of [...] "Rumors", leading the media to accuse her of lip synching. Lohan denied that she was lip synching, claiming that there was a background track because she had fallen ill recently. Kim Jakwerth, of Casablanca Records, supported this statement by saying, [...] "Yes, on the first song there were background tracks, which were not on the second song." [...] In addition to these performances, she sang the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on December 16. In January 2005, Lohan performed [...] "Over" [...] and [...] "Speak" [...] at Yahoo's Live@Launch, where she also gave an interview.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, {{reading of}} the dove in [...] "and lo, in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> an olive leaf," [...] Rabbi Eleazar (or others say Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar) taught that the dove prayed to God that God might let the dove's {{sustenance}} be as bitter as the olive but given by God, rather than sweet as honey and given by flesh and blood (upon whom the dove was therefore dependent).|$|E
2500|$|Makino {{is an avid}} equestrian {{and keeps}} a horse called Harry. In 2002 she {{suffered}} an accident falling from a horse; in the accident, the horse trampled her jaw and crushed her facial bones, which required massive reconstructive surgery. <b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> wired shut, and she convalesced for months, using the time to write songs. The song [...] "Equus," [...] from the 2004 album Misery is a Butterfly, refers to the accident. Makino has stated that she often gains inspiration from horses while writing music: [...] "They are so musical in their movements and in the sounds they make. Everything they do is rhythmic. I get ideas for grooves—rhythmic ideas—just from riding.” ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{evidence}} given {{on the first}} day of the inquest into Kempton's death by her friend Rose Heinberg, Kempton was at the New Court Club in Percy Street with Heinberg, when a man called [...] "Micky" [...] told her that a Chinese man named [...] "Billy" [...] wanted to meet her. The four of them went by taxi to a Chinese restaurant in Regent Street. There Billy asked her to come outside and according to Heinberg, when Kempton returned <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> twitching. Heinberg asked if Kempton was eating something to which Kempton replied [...] "I have been drugged ... I know I have been drugged, because a year ago, when I used to take drugs, my mouth used to twitch. I used to have to eat chewing-gum to make people think I was eating sweets." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading of {{the dove}} in [...] "and lo, in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> an olive leaf," [...] a Midrash asked where the dove found it. Rabbi Abba taught that the dove brought {{it from the}} young shoots of the Land of Israel. Rabbi Levi taught that the dove brought it from the Mount of Olives, for the Flood had not {{submerged}} the Land of Israel. Thus God told Ezekiel (in [...] ): [...] "Son of man, say to her: 'You are a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon {{on the day of}} indignation.'" [...] Rabbi Birai (or some say Rabbi Berekiah) taught that the gates of the Garden of Eden were opened for the dove, and from there the dove brought the olive leaf. Rabbi Abbahu asked if the dove had brought it from the Garden of Eden, would the dove not have brought something better, like cinnamon or a balsam leaf. But in fact the dove was giving Noah a hint, saying to him in effect that better is bitterness from God than sweetness from Noah's hand.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, the London Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} challenged Houdini {{to escape}} from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinée performance at London's Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his [...] "ghost house" [...] (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage {{and gave him a}} kiss. Many thought that in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due {{to the size of the}} 6-inch key Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career.|$|E
