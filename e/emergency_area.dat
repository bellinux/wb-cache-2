500|$|Many New Orleans {{residents}} took {{precautions to}} secure their homes and prepare for possible evacuation on Friday the 26th and Saturday the 27th. On August 27 the state of Louisiana was declared an <b>emergency</b> <b>area</b> by the Federal Government, and by mid morning of that day, many local gas stations which were not yet out of gas had long lines. Nagin first called for a voluntary evacuation of the city at 5:00p.m. on August 27 and subsequently ordered a citywide mandatory evacuation at 9:30a.m. on August 28, the first such order in the city's history. In a live news conference, Mayor Nagin predicted that, [...] "the storm surge most likely will topple our levee system", and warned that oil production in the Gulf of Mexico would be shut down.|$|E
500|$|As {{the storm}} began to quickly intensify on September 26, {{areas of the}} watch from Savannah, Georgia to Cape Fear, North Carolina were {{upgraded}} to a hurricane <b>emergency</b> <b>area</b> at 1600 UTC. Affected communities were advised to begin precautionary measures immediately and evacuate. Shipping and small craft were told to exercise [...] "extreme caution." [...] Gale warnings were changed to warn areas between Fernandina, Florida to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The heightened warnings caused WFOs to issue local bulletins regarding the impending hurricane. At the time, the Weather Bureau projected Helene to make landfall in South Carolina. These landfall forecasts shifted further north along the coast over time, before they were stopped after Helene recurved away from the coast entirely. At 0400 UTC on September 27, hurricane warnings were extended to include areas between Cape Fear and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Gale warning issuance reflected the changes and were too shifted northwards to the Virginia Capes area, while hurricane watches covered both warning areas. At 1600 UTC later that day, hurricane emergency and gale warnings were extended north to Manteo, North Carolina, while hurricane watches were continued for coastal regions from Savannah, Georgia to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. After Helene began recurving away from the coast, all warnings south of Wilmington, North Carolina were discontinued at 2200 UTC on September 27. As Helene passed certain areas, warnings were discontinued upon the storm's passage. At 1000 UTC the next day, all onshore hurricane warnings were either downgraded to gale warnings or discontinued. However, offshore gale warnings were still issued for oceanic regions from the Virginia Capes to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Shortly after, all warnings, {{with the exception of}} the offshore gale warnings, were discontinued. Remaining warnings lasted until 2200 UTC on September 28. Despite not issuing any warnings, the Weather Bureau cautioned interests in Newfoundland, and forecasted hurricane-force winds to effect the island.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Breathlessness is a {{frequently}} occurring {{symptom of}} cardiorespiratory conditions {{and is a}} common cause of emergency department presentation. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the prevalence of acute-on-chronic breathlessness as a cause for presentation to the major <b>emergencies</b> <b>area</b> of the <b>emergency</b> department. METHODS: A prospective patient self-report survey and clinical record review of consecutive attendees to the major <b>emergencies</b> <b>area</b> of the <b>emergency</b> department in a single tertiary hospital between 12 / 5 / 14 and 29 / 5 / 14 was conducted. Eligible patients were clinically stable and had mental capacity to provide data. RESULTS: There were 2, 041 presentations during the study period, of whom 1, 345 (66 %) were eligible. There was a 90 % survey response rate (1, 212 / 1, 345); 424 / 1, 212 (35 %) self-reported breathlessness most days over the past month of whom 245 gave breathlessness as a reason for this presentation. Therefore, the prevalence of acute-on-chronic breathlessness as a reason to present to the major <b>emergencies</b> <b>area</b> was 20. 2 % (245 / 1, 212, 95 % CI 17. 9 % to 22. 5 %). During this period there were 4, 692 major and minor presentations; breathlessness was therefore a cause of at least 5. 2 % (245 / 4, 692, 95 % CI 4. 6 to 5. 9 %) of all emergency department presentations. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that one in five ambulance presentations to the ED were due to acute-on-chronic breathlessness. Most patients had non-malignant underlying conditions, had experienced considerable breathlessness for an extended period, had discussed breathlessness with their GP and presented out of daytime hours. Others were often involved in their decision to present. This represents clinically significant burden for patients, their family carers and the emergency health services...|$|R
