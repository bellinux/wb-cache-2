5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E
5|$|When Cope {{arrived back}} in the United States after his tour of Europe in 1878, he had nearly two years of fossil {{findings}} from Lucas. Among these dinosaurs was Camarasaurus, {{one of the most}} recognizable dinosaur recreations of the time. The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and north to Oregon, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> at the rich flora and the blueness of the Pacific Ocean. In 1879, the United States Congress consolidated the various government survey teams into the United States Geological Survey with Clarence King as its leader. This was discouraging to Cope because King named Marsh, an old college friend, as the chief paleontologist. The period of Cope's and Marsh's paleontological digs in the American West spanned from 1877 to 1892, by which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources.|$|E

Bombarded with queries and protests from Carlists who found themselves marginalized in FET, after 3 months he and Rodezno ceased to take part in what they considered largely fictitious meetings of the Secretariat. Their relations with Don Javier remained extremely tense yet not broken; it was only after in November 1937 Arellano had accepted seat in a 50-member Consejo Nacional that the claimant declared him one of key rebels against his authority and expulsed them from Comunión Tradicionalista.|$|E
25|$|The {{captain of}} Externsteine later told his captors {{that he thought}} the attack was being carried out by tanks, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> that the ships could break through the ice at the speed they did. He opined that the Americans would have to scuttle his ship as it was trapped in the ice. Externsteine was renamed East Breeze by her captors. However, by using {{explosives}} on the ice, the ship was freed. A prize crew of 36 men from both icebreakers soon had the ship under way. At the time, it was the northernmost combat operation ever undertaken by United States forces. Externsteine was the only enemy surface vessel captured by United States naval forces during World War II.|$|E
25|$|From 1796 Hoffmann {{obtained}} {{employment as}} a clerk for his uncle, Johann Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After passing further examinations he visited Dresden, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of Correggio and Raphael. During the summer of 1798 his uncle was promoted to a court in Berlin, {{and the three of}} them moved there in August—Hoffmann's first residence in a large city. It was there that Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an operetta called Die Maske and sending a copy to Queen Luise of Prussia. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of the Royal Theatre, a man named Iffland. By the time the latter responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of examinations and had already left for Posen (Poznań) in South Prussia in the company of his old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to show him the gallery.|$|E

500|$|Serving as {{a last-minute}} replacement, Tobey Maguire was only {{available}} {{to be on}} set for two hours to film his scenes in Satan's Alley. Downey said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> Maguire would agree to do the film and {{felt like they were}} creating a [...] "karmic pay-off" [...] for their scenes together in the 2000 film Wonder Boys, where Downey's character has a one-night stand with Maguire's character. After Cruise vacated the role of Rick Peck, Owen Wilson was cast to play the part. Following his suicide attempt in August 2007, Wilson dropped out of the film and was replaced by Matthew McConaughey.|$|E
500|$|Lynch {{wrote in}} 1977 that The Homosexual Matrix [...] "had been widely criticized for many reasons", {{including}} for largely ignoring {{the gay rights}} movement and for expressing a negative view of women. According to Lynch, Tripp stated {{in an interview with}} Keith Howes in Gay News that he had not written about the gay liberation movement because he did not know enough about it to be able to discuss the subject, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> at the accusation of sexism directed against his book, and that he believed the [...] "gay press" [...] had reacted with embarrassment to it, while Howes suggested that Tripp was hurt by the negative reaction to his book from some gay people.|$|E

500|$|AJ's Infinite Summer was {{released}} without announcement on May 16, 2014, {{on the official}} website of Cartoon Network. Long Live the Royals, another pilot, {{was released}} on the same day. This pilot was created by Sean Szeles, who has also worked on Regular Show. Jason Krell of io9 found that the plot for AJ's Infinite Summer was simple yet flexible. He described its take on life during summer vacation as [...] "charming" [...] and comparable with an [...] "aged-up Phineas and Ferb". He said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> by both and that his viewership will be granted for both, should they be picked up as full series. John Lamb of The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead recognized features of Fargo in the pilot, namely the high school, which he found analogous to Fargo South where Jones attended. Meanwhile, Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew expected that the pilot would not have continuity from AJ Goes to France.|$|E
500|$|On 1 May 1994, Ayrton Senna {{was killed}} during the San Marino Grand Prix. Prost was a pallbearer at the Brazilian's funeral. Speaking {{four years after the}} Brazilian's death, Prost told Nigel Roebuck that he had [...] "always refused to speak about him". When Senna died, Prost stated that [...] "a part of himself had died also", because their careers had been so bound together. Senna had also felt the same when Prost had retired at the end of 1993, when he {{admitted}} to a close friend that he had realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Prost. Only {{a couple of days before}} his death, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: [...] "A special hello to my,... to our dear friend Alain. We all miss you Alain." [...] Prost said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> and very touched by the comment.|$|E
500|$|The anime's sequel, D.Gray-man Hallow, {{was one of}} the most-anticipated anime {{series of}} summer 2016 by {{followers}} of Anime News Network and the Japanese web portal goo. Since he had not watched the original anime for some time, Alex Osborn of IGN appreciated the brief exposition in the sequel's first episode to remind the audience of the plot. Although he enjoyed the interaction among the main cast, Osborn was confused by the revelation that Allen would become the 14th Noah and had to watch the scene again in order to understand it. In a later review, Osborn said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> by Allen's first possession by the 14th Noah; although it was [...] "disturbing", it enhanced the character's development. Anne Laurenroth remarked Kanda's character development in Hallow, particularly his fight against Alma Karma and his return to the Order in the finale. Laurenroth noted Hallow poor animation and pacing but, although most of its episodes were grim, its final moments were upbeat.|$|E

500|$|Haug said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> {{with the}} highly {{positive}} critical response the album had received, surprised that [...] "even Molly [...] gave it {{nine out of}} ten." [...] The positivity of the album's reception created a feeling of surrealism, and Haug told Juice Magazine [...] "I wish someone would write a really bad [...]" [...] Nonetheless, he appreciated the credibility the album helped Powderfinger develop. Coghill agreed with Haug on the album's popularity, stating [...] "you couldn't ask for much better", and saying he really took notice of the album's positive critical commentary. Juices Benedict Watts said it received [...] "a level of universal praise not yet dished out on an Australian release since You Am I's Hi Fi Way". [...] Despite Polydor telling the band the album would be heavily marketed, Fanning still found its success surprising. HITs Teresa Bolster suggested Fanning feared the worst during songwriting; [...] "Celebrity Head", a song on the album, {{was seen as a}} [...] "pre-emptive, scathing attack on music writers", which he argued was intended as a joke.|$|E
500|$|Eighteen-year-old McLean {{made his}} debut on 17 October 2010, coming on as a {{substitute}} in a 2–2 draw against Hamilton. St Mirren were 2–0 down when he came on and their manager, Danny Lennon, {{thought that they were}} going to lose anyway so he would bring a youngster on. However, The Herald noted that McLean's [...] "drive and energy" [...] lifted St Mirren and helped them to turn the game around and get a draw. Three days after his debut, McLean made his first start for St Mirren, in a 3–0 loss to Hearts. Later in the week he signed a three-year contract extension, tying him to the club until 2014. He then made his first home start, in a 1–0 loss to Celtic on 16 November. After this match he thanked his manager for having faith in him and also said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> by the fact that only six months before he was playing in the Second Division relegation play-off, but was now playing against some of the best players in the country. He went on to make a total of 23 appearances during the 2010–11 season.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg and Janusz Kamiński, who {{has shot}} {{all of the}} director's films since 1993's Schindler's List, {{reviewed}} the previous films to study Douglas Slocombe's style. [...] "I didn’t want Janusz to modernize and bring us into the 21st century", Spielberg explained. [...] "I still wanted the film to have a lighting style not dissimilar to the work Doug Slocombe had achieved, which meant that both Janusz and I had to swallow our pride. Janusz had to approximate another cinematographer's look, and I had to approximate this younger director's look that I thought I had moved away from after almost two decades." [...] Spielberg also hired production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas after admiring his design work for Superman Returns. Spielberg {{did not want to}} fast cut action scenes, relying on his script instead for a fast pace, and had confirmed in 2002 that he would not shoot the film digitally, a format Lucas had adopted. Lucas felt [...] "it looks like it was shot three years after Last Crusade. The people, the look of it, everything. You’d never know there was 20 years between shooting." [...] Kamiński commented upon watching the three films back-to-back, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> how each of them advanced technologically, but were all nevertheless consistent, neither too brightly or darkly lit.|$|E

500|$|... "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] {{has been}} labeled as a satire on American politics. Michael Bitzer, in an edited book by Joseph Foy and Stanley Schultz {{entitled}} Homer Simpson Goes to Washington, said this episode [...] "espouses the virtues, vices, and varieties of American political culture, public opinion, {{and ultimately the}} American Dream." [...] Bitzer also wrote that The Simpsons, through [...] "skillful" [...] use of satire, demonstrates with this episode [...] "insights into the underlying political culture and public opinion of the United States' governing system (and, more broadly, society at large)." [...] In his book Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, Paul Arthur Cantor said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> by how far the episode [...] "willing to take its corrosive satire of national politics." [...] He said it [...] "attacks the federal government at its foundation, the patriotic myths upon which its legitimacy lies. It makes fun of the very process by which patriotism is inculcated in the nation's youth, the hokey contests that lead children to outdo each other in progovernment effusions." [...] When the corrupt congressman is arrested, Lisa proclaims [...] "The system works!" [...] Benedict Anderson wrote in the book The Spectre of Comparisons that series creator Matt Groening [...] "assumes that his tickled audience is confident that the system barely works [...] So why does he need to show a patriot at all, especially one who is a deluded little female block-head? Probably because he, too, wishes {{to be seen as}} giving America another chance. Mr. Lisa guarantees his good intentions." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was {{provided}} by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that [...] "It's nice to hear Mike Barker back on Family Guy.," [...] as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking [...] "I'm going to prison, aren't I?" [...] when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused {{a little bit of}} trouble for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie was still in the tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> that broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, [...] "This isn't what it looks like" [...] was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, [...] "Brian" [...] and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, [...] "Never mind, I'll come back later!"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as a Wal-Mart greeter had Cheney's greeting, [...] "Go fuck yourself" [...] bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the drawstring tight around his mouth, and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation.|$|E
500|$|Producers Lindelof and Cuse were {{initially}} {{worried about how}} the freighter folk characters would be received by fans, after the unhappy reaction to new characters Nikki (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro), introduced in season three. However, following their introduction in [...] "Confirmed Dead", the four characters were well received, with Paige Albiniak of the New York Post citing them as a reason behind the show's improved ratings. Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad wrote that within one episode Fahey had already won her over, and called Frank her favorite new Lost character. IGN's Chris Carabott described Frank, {{as well as the}} other new characters from the freighter, as [...] "great" [...] and [...] "exciting", writing that: [...] "Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts praised the casting of the freighter folk, noting that Fahey had been a personal favourite of his since his appearance in The Marshall. He deemed the group all stronger actors than former Lost stars Michelle Rodriguez, Rodrigo Santoro, Maggie Grace and Ian Somerhalder, and expressed hope that they would remain on the show longer. Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called the new characters [...] "fascinating" [...] and wrote that they [...] "totally worked for me, while their intriguing backstories left me jonesing for more." [...] Peter Mucha of The Philadelphia Inquirer deemed Frank's flashback [...] "mind-bending", and Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] the [...] "perfect introduction" [...] to the new characters, writing that he could not wait to find out more about them. Michael Ausiello of TV Guide also enjoyed their introduction, and praised the actors' performances. Casey Gillis for The News & Advance highlighted the introduction of the freighter folk as one of the highlights of the season, opining that they [...] "fit seamlessly into the ensemble", while Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones praised the season for introducing Frank, who he deemed [...] "a real cult figure." [...] In contrast, James Poniewozik of Time was critical of Lapidus. He wrote that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> by the economy and precision with which the new characters were introduced because [...] "Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet by the end of the episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals." [...] He appended, however, that this was: [...] "with the possible exception of Frank, who seems a bit too generic-drunk-hippie-guy for now." ...|$|E
