Two kinds of burials are distinguished; a primary burial intended to transport the dead into the netherworld, and a secondary burial that was intended to transform the deceased into their ultimate form: an ancestor. The royal hypogeum provides hints at the different rituals taking place during a secondary burial; a noticeable character is that skeletons were not complete, and no skulls are found for the majority of secondary burial remains. There is no evidence that skulls decayed as they would have left behind teeth, of which very few were found, indicating that the skulls were removed to be venerated in another location.|$|E

Again, Sette took charge of a new {{laboratory}} and, from a headquarters {{on the campus of}} Stanford University, pioneered yet another new aspect of fisheries science, namely, an examination of all available <b>data</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> oceans and development of an understanding of how they relate to the abundance and distribution of fish. He again created a team of biologists, oceanographers, and meteorologists, and they analyzed a mass of data on sea surface temperatures, weather observations, and all known data on the abundance of fish over time. By 1961, Sette had published analysis that demonstrated that abundance in a fishery depended not only fish population size itself, but also on the availability of the fish population to exploitation by fishing vessels, with oceanographic and meteorological factors playing a role in the latter as currents and weather differed from year to year. One of the team′s innovative achievements was the publication of an atlas of 168 monthly mean sea surface temperature charts for the Pacific Ocean north of latitude 20° North covering the years 1949 through 1962.|$|E

25|$|Since 1906, Randall {{has been}} among the top 1,000 names {{recorded}} in Social Security card applications for baby boys in the United States. The name was at its most popular point in 1955, when it was ranked the 53rd most popular masculine baby name. Currently, the name was ranked 749th for the year 2009. Randall currently is, and historically has been more popular in the United States than the various other forms of the name. For example, since 1995, Randal has not been among the top 1,000 names recorded in for baby boys. This name first ranked within the top 1,000 boys names in 1938, and it stayed among the top 1,000 names until 1994; the name was at its most popular point in 1958, when it was ranked 189th. According to data released by the Social Security Administration, the forms Randell, Randel, and Randle have never been nearly as popular (see 'popularity graphs' below).

40|$|Two {{different}} sets of data are used to test an apparently new approach {{to the analysis of}} the variance of a numerical variable which depends on qualitative variables. We suggest that this approach be used to complement other existing techniques to study the interdependence of the variables involved. According to our method, the variance is expressed as a sum of orthogonal components, obtained as differences of conditional means, with respect to the qualitative characters. The resulting expression for the variance depends on the ordering in which the characters are considered. We suggest an algorithm which leads to an ordering which is deemed natural. The first set of <b>data</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>the</b> score achieved by a population of students on an entrance examination based on a multiple choice test with 30 questions. In this case the qualitative characters are dyadic and correspond to correct or incorrect answer to each question. The second set of <b>data</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>the</b> delay to obtain the degree for a population of graduates of Italian universities. The variance in this case is analyzed with respect to a set of seven specific qualitative characters of the population studied (gender, previous education, working condition, parent's educational level, field of study, etc.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Indices {{that track}} hedge fund returns are, {{in order of}} development, called Non-investable, Investable and Clone. They play a central and {{unambiguous}} role in traditional asset markets, where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios. Equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes. Hedge funds, however, are actively managed, so that tracking is impossible. Non-investable hedge fund indices {{on the other hand}} may be more or less representative, but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is non-public. This may result in biased estimates of their returns. In an attempt to address this problem, clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data. [...] None of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published <b>data</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> underlying returns.|$|E
2500|$|Yellowfin whiting reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{a length of}} 200 mm in males and 230mm in females, {{with the majority of}} both sexes reaching this length by the end of their second year of life. The timing of spawning varies over the species range, a trait found {{in a number of other}} sillaginids. In the northernmost part of its range in Shark Bay, spawning occurs between August and December, while further south off southern Western Australia, spawning occurs between December and February. The South Australian population also spawns between December and February, with this event preceded by the movement of fish into shallow tidal and estuarine regions where spawning occurs. Ripe fish then break off the main schooling body to form smaller spawning schools, where the eggs are shed. There is conflicting <b>data</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> pattern of spawning in yellowfin whiting, with an earlier Shark Bay study finding the species to be a single spawner, [...] whilst recent studies in the south indicate they are multiple spawners.
