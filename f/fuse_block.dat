Around 1896 with his business in machinery progressing, Hubbell's next patent was a major breakthrough in the fastener industry: the process and machinery for cold rolled screw threads which reduced the rate of material lost in production by more than 50%. He designed and built progressive blanking and forming dies, patented machinery to slot screw heads, a machine to assemble screws and small parts, devised tools to indicate speed, and patented a changeable speed screwdriver. Hubbell's idea was to provide convenience, safety, and control to an electric light with his new [...] "pull socket" [...] which was patented in August 1896. The same familiar device with its on/off pull chain is still in use today. He built three prototypes by hand using metal and insulated wood parts to design a product with individual wires permanently attached in the proper sequence and correct polarity, and one which could be connected or disconnected, easily and safely, to a power supply in the wall. cartridge fuses and <b>fuse</b> <b>block,</b> lamp holders, key sockets - soon followed the same path Later, Hubbell's [...] "separable plug" [...] design took shape on the drawing board back in Bridgeport, and then submitted to the patent office in Washington, D.C. Additional designs based on that basic concept - separable plugs in different configurations, a single flush mounted receptacle - as well as new products for electrical circuits. One of the most successful and the one most familiar today, was the duplex receptacle which is still found everywhere that electrical power is used. In 1901 Hubbell published a 12-page catalogue that listed 63 electrical products of his company's manufacture, and four years later he incorporated his enterprise as Harvey Hubbell, Incorporated , In the same year, the Company registered its trademark of [...] "...a sphere with meridian lines and the name 'Hubbell' centered within."

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the biomechanics {{of the human}} middle ear, {{that part of the}} auditory system which converts sound pressure waves in air to fluid pressure waves in the cochlea. The middle ear's mechanism is analysed in four papers, three main and one supporting; in the main papers the middle ear is treated as a multi-particle, multi-rigid body ensemble possessing a variable number of degrees of freedom depending upon the case being investigated. It is confirmed, using the standard representation of a single <b>fused</b> incudo-malleal <b>block,</b> that the middle ear's motion is linear, but when this <b>fused</b> <b>block</b> restriction is lifted nonlinearity is present which significantly affects the mechanism's behaviour. In view of the linearity of the chain under the <b>fused</b> <b>block</b> conditions, the explanatory veracity of the conventionally accepted `fixed axis hypothesis' of ossicular motion is examined and found to be wanting as a realistic description of the chain's physical movement. The nonlinear behaviour of the ossicular chain centres around the action of the incudo-malleal joint. This joint is shown to have preferential planes of operation, principally the pitch or longitudinal plane and in general to act as an efficient energy dissipator at high driving pressures and low frequencies. Providing the pressure is high enough, it is shown this energy dissipator effect eventually becomes independent of frequency. The supporting paper discusses the dynamics of the imposition and removal of equation constraints justifying methods used to investigate the functioning of the incudo-malleal joint...|$|R

Results have been the undeserved tarnishing of the reputations of the engineers involved and color machine vision in general.

40|$|Spacetrees are {{a popular}} {{formalism}} to describe dynamically adaptive Cartesian grids. Even though they directly yield a mesh, {{it is often}} computationally reasonable to embed regular Cartesian blocks into their leaves. This promotes stencils working on homogeneous data chunks. The choice of a proper block size is sensitive. While large block sizes foster loop parallelism and vectorisation, they restrict the adaptivity's granularity and hence increase the memory footprint and lower the numerical accuracy per byte. In the present paper, we therefore use a multiscale spacetree-block coupling admitting blocks on all spacetree nodes. We propose to find sets of blocks on the finest scale throughout the simulation and to replace them by <b>fused</b> big <b>blocks.</b> Such a replacement strategy can pick up hardware characteristics, i. e. which block size yields the highest throughput, while the dynamic adaptivity of the fine grid mesh is not constrained—applications can work with fine granular blocks.

40|$|Mutants of Salmonella enterica lacking {{polyphosphate}} kinase (ppk) grow {{poorly in}} the presence of the weak organic acids acetate, propionate, and benzoate. This sensitivity is corrected by methionine and seems to result from destabilization of MetA (homoserine transsuccinylase), the first enzyme in methionine biosynthesis. The MetA protein is known to be sensitive to thermal inactivation, and ppk mutants are more sensitive to heat-induced methionine auxotrophy. Peroxide increases the sensitivity of ppk mutants to both heat and acid and may oxidatively damage (carbonylate) destabilized MetA. While acid appears to impair methionine biosynthesis, it leads to derepression of MetA and may inhibit growth by causing toxic accumulation of denatured protein. This is supported by the observation that the overexpression of MetA in ppk mutants causes acid sensitivity that is not corrected by methionine. We propose that polyphosphate acts as a chemical chaperone that helps refold MetA and/or may stimulate proteolysis of toxic denatured protein. The instability of MetA protein may provide a metabolic <b>fuse</b> that <b>blocks</b> growth under conditions that denature proteins; the sensitivity of this fuse is modulated by polyphosphate...|$|R

In a N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis project in Kyoto, the Oune mutant rat strain was isolated due to a short and kinked caudal vertebra phenotype. Skeletal staining of heterozygous rats showed partial loss of the cervical vertebrae as well as hemivertebrae and <b>fused</b> vertebral <b>blocks</b> in lumbar and sacral vertebrae.

The Oune locus was genetically mapped to rat chromosome 1 using 202 backcross animals and 50 genome-wide microsatellite markers.

Although the mutation is located within the Tbox domain near a predicted dimmer-interface, in vitro experiments revealed that the Tbx 6 variant retains normal DNA binding ability and translational efficiency. However, the variant has decreased transcriptional activation potential in response to Notch-mediated signaling. Recently, {{it was reported that}} a dominant type of familial spondylocostal dysostosis is caused by a stoploss mutation in TBX 6.

Hemivertebrae have been related to failure of notochord forma-tion in the early foetal period. 8, 11 Failure of part of vertebral body formation can result in wedge or butterfly vertebrae. A wedge-shaped hemivertebra may result embryologically from improper vascularisation and subsequent incomplete ossifica-tion of the dorsal or ventral portion of the vertebral body. 12 This study describes congenital caudal vertebral malforma-tions in a male alpaca (macho) and eight of his offspring. One other of his offspring was within normal limits. An unrelated case of cervical vertebral malformation in a 2 -month-old female alpaca (hembra) is also described. Scoliosis and kyphosis in alpacas have also been observed by the authors but are not documented here...|$|R
