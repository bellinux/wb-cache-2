40|$|Summary. This paper records a {{theoretical}} {{investigation into the}} effect on aileron flutter of flexibilky in the aileron mass-balance arm. It is shown that this flexibility can affect both wing-aileron and aileron-tab flutter, but each is affected differently. In wing-aileron flutter, mass-balance arm flexibility gives rise to ternary flutter and has a powerful stabilizing effect when the mass-balance natural frequency approaches the flutter frequency. In aileron-tab flutter, the mass-balance flexibility serves to produce an aileron overtone mode equivalent in effect to a rigidly mass-balmlced aileron mode of the same frequency. When this frequency is sufficiently high aileron-tab flutter results. The fundamental aileron mode (the lower frequency normal. mode of the aileron and its <b>mass-balance</b> <b>weight)</b> has no {{significant effect on the}} flutter. 1. Introduction. Th...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Draken {{consisted of}} two sections, front and rear, joined by bolts. The forward section, which was integral with the intake ducts and neighbouring wing structure, accommodates the fire-control radar, cockpit, nose undercarriage, integral fuel tanks and various systems. The rear portion, which was manufactured as a single piece alongside {{the rest of the}} inner wing, contained the engine and afterburner, bag-type fuel tanks, armament, main landing gear, and other systems. The flight control surfaces consisted of a rudder, along with inboard and outboard elevons, the outer sections being fitted with <b>mass-balance</b> <b>weights.</b> Each surface was operated by a tandem hydraulic jack, which was connected to separate circuits. As a weight-saving measure, the hydraulic systems would operate at a line pressure of 2,9871b/sq, which would be greater than double the pressure used in the earlier Saab 29 Tunnan.|$|R
40|$|Abramov glacier, {{located in}} the Pamir Alay, Kyrgyzstan, is a {{reference}} glacier within the Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers. Long-term glaciological measurements exist from 1968 to 1998 and a mass-balance monitoring programme was re-established in 2011. In this study we re-analyse existing mass-balance data and use a spatially <b>distributed</b> <b>mass-balance</b> model to provide continuous seasonal time series of glacier mass balance covering the period 1968 – 2014. The model is calibrated to seasonal mass-balance surveys and then applied to the period with no measurements. Validation and recalibration is carried out using snowline observations derived from satellite imagery and, after 2011, also from automatic terrestrial camera images. We combine direct measurements, remote observations and modelling. The results are compared to geodetic glacier volume change {{over the past decade}} and to a ground-penetrating radar survey in the accumulation zone resolving several layers of accumulation. Previously published geodetic mass budget estimates for Abramov glacier suggest a close-to-zero mass balance for the past decade, which contradicts our results. We find a low plausibility for equilibrium conditions over the past 15 years. Instead, we suggest that the glacier's sensitivity to increased summer air temperature is decisive for the substantial mass loss during the past decade...|$|R
40|$|A 6 year {{application}} of an enhanced temperature-index mass-balance model to Careser and La Mare glaciers, Eastern Italian Alps, is presented. The two glaciers exhibit very different characteristics, and a comprehensive dataset of <b>distributed</b> <b>mass-balance</b> measurements {{was used to}} test the model performance. The model was run using meteorological data acquired outside the glaciers. The work was focused on two main aspects: (1) the development of a morphological redistribution procedure for snow, and (2) the comparison of three different melt algorithms proposed in the literature. The results show that the simple method proposed for snow redistribution can greatly improve simulation of winter balance, and further improvements would be achievable by collecting data on inaccessible and high-altitude areas. All three melt formulations displayed a good skill level and very similar results in modelling the mass-balance distribution over glacier areas, with slightly better results from a multiplicative algorithm in capturing the vertical balance gradient. The simulation errors are related to aspect and elevation, and tend to be spatially aggregated. Some assumptions concerning the spatial and temporal distribution of air temperature and incoming solar radiation, although reasonable and widely used in the literature, may be responsible for this aggregation. Hence, {{there is a need to}} further investigate the processes that regulate the distribution of melt energy, and that appear to control the current deglaciation phase in this area...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{concepts}} of worldwide glacier monitoring include numerical models for (1) interconnecting the {{different levels of}} observations (local mass balance, representative length change, glacier inventories for global coverage) and (2) extrapolations in space (coupling with climate models) and time (backward and forward). In this context, one important new tool is <b>distributed</b> <b>mass-balance</b> modelling in complex mountain topography. This approach builds on simplified energy-balance models and can be applied for investigating the spatio-temporal representativity of the few mass-balance measurements, for estimating balance values at the tongue of unmeasured glaciers in order to derive long-term average balance values from {{a great number of}} glaciers with known length change, and for assessing special effects such as the influence of Sahara dust falls on the albedo and mass balance or autocorrelation effects due to surface darkening of glaciers with strongly negative balances. Experience from first model runs in the Swiss Alps and from applications to the extreme conditions in summer 2003 provides evidence about the usefulness of this approach for glacier monitoring and analysis of glacier changes in high-mountain regions. The main difficulties concern the spatial variability of the input parameters (e. g. precipitation, snow cover and surface albedo) and the uncertainties in the parameterizations of the components of the energy balance. Field measurements remain essential to tie the models to real ground conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Glacier {{net mass}} balance, bn, tends to {{correlate}} well with accumula-tion area ratio (AAR). A method that substitutes {{the long term}} bn – AAR relationship by the transient relationship, derived from repeated measurements during one ablation season, is tested on Storglaciären, a well-investigated glacier in Sweden. We use the 1946 – 2004 long term record, transient mass balance measurements in 2004, and results from a <b>distributed</b> energy-balance <b>mass-balance</b> model. The long term and transient relationships are in good agreement for negative and slightly positive mass balances corresponding to AAR of roughly 0. 2 to 0. 6, but progressively deviate from each other with increasing net balances and larger AARs. The modelling indicates that the deviation becomes smaller as winter mass balance increases. It is concluded that the transient bn,t – AARt relationship should: (a) be established during a highly negative mass balance year, and (b) exclude any data from the earlier part of the melt season. Deriving the relationship from mass balance modelling may provide a powerful alternative, circumventing {{the need for a}} highly negative mass balance year for the transient measurements.

40|$|International audienceA new {{physically}} based <b>distributed</b> surface <b>mass-balance</b> {{model is}} presented for Alpine glaciers. Based on the Crocus prognostic snow model, it resolves both the temporal (1 hour time-step) and spatial (200 m grid-step) variability {{of the energy}} and mass balance of glaciers. Mass-balance reconstructions for the period 1981 - 2004 are produced using meteorological reconstruction from the SAFRAN meteorological model for Glacier de Saint-Sorlin and Glacier d'Argentière, French Alps. Both glaciers lost mass at an accelerated rate in the last 23 years. The spatial distribution of precipitation within the model grid is adjusted using field mass-balance measurements. This is the only correction made to the SAFRAN meteorological input to the glacier model, which also includes surface atmospheric temperature, moisture, wind and all components of downward radiation. Independent data from satellite imagery and geodetic measurements are used for model validation. With this model, glacier sensitivity to climate change can be separately evaluated {{with respect to a}} full range of meteorological parameters, whereas simpler models, such as degree-day models, only account for temperature and precipitation. We provide results for both mass balance and equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) using a generic Alpine glacier. The sensitivity of the ELA to air temperature alone is found to be 125 m °C− 1, or 160 m °C− 1 if concurrent (Stefan-Boltzmann) longwave radiation change is taken into account...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the internal accumulation on Storglaciären, Sweden, we couple a multilayer snow model to a <b>distributed</b> energy- and <b>mass-balance</b> model. The snow model describes the temperature, density and water-content {{evolution of the}} snow/ice pack and includes the processes of percolation and refreezing of water. The model is run for the period 9 May- 2 September 1999 and validated against weather station and mass-balance observations on the glacier. The model performs reasonably well, with an average summer mass balance for the location of stake observations of − 1. 56 m w. e. compared to − 1. 59 m w. e. observed. However, the amount of melt is overestimated in the higher parts of the accumulation area and underestimated in the lower parts of the ablation area. The modelled mass balance is most sensitive to the albedo parameterization, the chosen momentum and scalar roughness lengths and all parameters related to snowfall. The modelled internal accumulation is + 0. 25 m w. e., which amounts to about 20 % of the winter accumulation and results in a positive net balance for 1999 of + 0. 23 m w. e. The modelled internal accumulation is most sensitive to the initial subsurface temperature profile and the irreducible water content...|$|R
