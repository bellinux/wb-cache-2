5|$|Gottesman first {{studied the}} {{genetics}} of schizophrenia {{on a large}} scale using the Maudsley–Bethlem register of twin admissions for 16 years. Later he worked on psychiatric genetics and genomics. In his Twin Cities MMPI study, part of his Ph.D. thesis, Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia, depression, anti-social personality disorder, and social <b>introversion.</b> Genes strongly influenced social <b>introversion</b> and aggressive tendencies. This led to further studies on personality traits of identical twins such as the Minnesota Study of Identical Twins Reared Apart.|$|E
5|$|Chbosky {{took five}} years to develop and publish The Perks of Being a Wallflower, {{creating}} the characters {{and other aspects of}} the story from his own memories. The novel addresses themes permeating adolescence, including <b>introversion,</b> sexuality, and drug use, while also making several references to other literary works, films, and pop culture in general.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the <b>introversion</b> model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E
25|$|Myers–Briggs {{literature}} {{uses the}} terms extraversion and <b>introversion</b> as Jung first used them. Extraversion means literally outward-turning and <b>introversion,</b> inward-turning. These specific definitions differ somewhat {{from the popular}} usage of the words. Note that extraversion is the spelling used in MBTI publications.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion and <b>introversion</b> – {{personality}} traits of degrees of openness or reserve contributing to psychological type.|$|E
25|$|Rather, {{according}} to {{professor of psychology}} Bernardo J. Carducci, introverts choose to avoid social situations because they derive no reward from them or may find surplus sensory input overwhelming, whereas shy people may fear such situations. Research using the statistical techniques of factor analysis and correlation have found shyness overlaps mildly with both <b>introversion</b> and neuroticism (i.e., negative emotionality). Low societal acceptance of shyness or <b>introversion</b> may reinforce a shy or introverted individual's low self-confidence.|$|E
25|$|Emo {{has been}} {{associated}} with a stereotype of emotion, sensitivity, shyness, <b>introversion</b> or angst. Other stereotypes include depression, self-harm and suicide.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to define <b>introversion</b> and {{extraversion}} in a psychological context. In Jung’s Psychological Types, he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, Apollo and Dionysus. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extrovert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. Jungian <b>introversion</b> and extraversion is quite different from the modern idea of <b>introversion</b> and extroversion. Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness etc.) whereas Jungian <b>introversion</b> and extraversion is expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world subjectively, whereas extraverts interpret the world objectively.|$|E
25|$|Mistaking <b>introversion</b> for shyness is {{a common}} error. Introverts prefer solitary to social activities, but do not {{necessarily}} fear social encounters like shy people do.|$|E
25|$|Eysenck {{compared}} this trait to {{the four}} temperaments of ancient medicine, with choleric and sanguine temperaments equating to extraversion, and melancholic and phlegmatic temperaments equating to <b>introversion.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some {{theories}} and systems, traits are something a person either has {{or does not}} have, but in many others traits are dimensions such as extraversion vs. <b>introversion,</b> with each person rating somewhere along this spectrum.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that introverts have more blood flow in the frontal lobes of their brain and the {{anterior}} or frontal thalamus, which are areas dealing with internal processing, such as planning and problem solving. Extraverts have more blood flow in the anterior cingulate gyrus, temporal lobes, and posterior thalamus, which are involved in sensory and emotional experience. This study and other research indicates that introversion-extraversion is related to individual differences in brain function. A study on regional brain volume found {{a positive correlation between}} <b>introversion</b> and grey matter volume in the right prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction, as well as a positive correlation between <b>introversion</b> and total white matter volume.|$|E
25|$|Other cultures, such as Japan {{and regions}} where Orthodox Christianity, Buddhism, Sufism etc. prevail, prize <b>introversion.</b> These {{cultural}} differences predict individuals' happiness in {{that people who}} score higher in extraversion are happier, on average, in particularly extraverted cultures and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Acknowledging that <b>introversion</b> and {{extraversion}} {{are normal}} variants of behavior {{can help in}} self-acceptance and understanding of others. For example, an extravert can accept his/her introverted partner's need for space, while an introvert can acknowledge his/her extraverted partner's need for social interaction.|$|E
25|$|Feminine (Earth and Water signs): The {{feminine}} {{signs are}} Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. A native with these signs predominating will tend towards <b>introversion,</b> shyness and passivity, {{and have the}} ability to nurture, conserve and solve problems by intuitive means.|$|E
25|$|The four {{functions}} {{operate in}} conjunction with the attitudes (extraversion and <b>introversion).</b> Each function is used in either an extraverted or introverted way. A person whose dominant function is extraverted intuition, for example, uses intuition very differently from someone whose dominant function is introverted intuition.|$|E
25|$|In this book, Eysenck {{suggests}} that political {{behavior may be}} analysed in terms of two independent dimensions: the traditional left-right distinction, and how 'tenderminded' or 'toughminded' a person is. Eysenck {{suggests that}} {{the latter is a}} result of a person's <b>introversion</b> or extraversion respectively.|$|E
25|$|For {{those with}} an overall {{preference}} for <b>introversion,</b> the function with the extraverted attitude is the auxiliary; the dominant is the other function in the main four letter preference. So the dominant function for ISTJ is introverted sensing (Si) with the auxiliary (supporting) function being extraverted thinking (Te).|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} {{extraversion}} and <b>introversion</b> is most commonly assessed through self-report measures, although peer-reports and third-party observation {{can also be}} used. Self-report measures are either lexical or based on statements. The type of measure is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties and the time and space constraints of the research being undertaken.|$|E
25|$|Although Humble Bundle makes a {{point of}} {{offering}} games without DRM, the game Uplink in Humble Bundle for Android 3 was delivered with DRM copy-protection measures, both in the Android and the PC versions. A representative for <b>Introversion</b> stated on the forums that it was due to some leftover DRM code on the Android version.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the central}} {{concepts}} of analytical psychology is individuation—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation {{of the self}} out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered {{it to be the}} main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the psychological complex, and extraversion and <b>introversion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Norris has {{described}} his childhood as downbeat. He was nonathletic, shy, and scholastically mediocre. His father, Ray, worked intermittently as an automobile mechanic, {{and went on}} alcohol drinking binges that lasted {{for months at a}} time. Embarrassed by his father's behavior and the family's financial plight, Norris developed a debilitating <b>introversion</b> that lasted for his entire childhood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Introversion</b> is {{the state}} of being {{predominantly}} interested in one's own mental self. Introverts are typically perceived as more reserved or reflective. Some popular psychologists have characterized introverts as people whose energy tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction. This is similar to Jung's view, although he focused on mental energy rather than physical energy. Few modern conceptions make this distinction.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} of Heart and Brain are considered very relatable, as they cover well-known dichotomies such as <b>introversion</b> and extroversion, and logic and emotion. Seluk's {{degree in psychology}} benefited him in reinforcing these aspects. The characters were metaphorically inspired by the concept of Id, Ego and Superego, represented by the heart, Lars, and the brain respectively. In November 2015, Seluk published a collection of Heart and Brain comics in a book.|$|E
25|$|Although neither <b>introversion</b> nor {{extraversion}} is pathological, psychotherapists {{can take}} temperament {{into account when}} treating clients. Clients may respond better to different types of treatment depending on where they fall on the introversion-extraversion spectrum. Teachers can also consider temperament when dealing with their pupils, for example acknowledging that introverted children need more encouragement to speak in class while extraverted children may grow restless during long periods of quiet study.|$|E
25|$|Jung's {{typology}} theories postulated {{a sequence}} of four cognitive functions (thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition), each having one of two polar orientations (extraversion or <b>introversion),</b> giving a total of eight dominant functions. The MBTI is based on these eight hypothetical functions, although with some differences in expression from Jung's model (see Differences from Jung below). While the Jungian model offers empirical evidence for the first 3 dichotomies, {{it is unclear whether}} the Briggs had evidence for the J-P preference.|$|E
25|$|Type not trait: The MBTI sorts for type; it {{does not}} {{indicate}} the strength of ability. It allows the clarity of a preference to be ascertained (Bill clearly prefers <b>introversion),</b> but not the strength of preference (Jane strongly prefers extraversion) or degree of aptitude (Harry is good at thinking). In this sense, it differs from trait-based tools such as 16PF. Type preferences are polar opposites: a precept of MBTI is that people fundamentally prefer one thing over the other, not a bit of both.|$|E
25|$|The term shyness may be {{implemented}} as a lay blanket-term {{for a family}} of related and partially overlapping afflictions, including timidity (apprehension in meeting new people), bashfulness and diffidence (reluctance in asserting oneself), apprehension and anticipation (general fear of potential interaction), or intimidation (relating to the object of fear rather than one's low confidence). Apparent shyness, as perceived by others, may simply be the manifestation of reservation or <b>introversion,</b> character traits which cause an individual to voluntarily avoid excessive social contact or be terse in communication, but are not motivated or accompanied by discomfort, apprehension, or lack of confidence.|$|E
25|$|Introverts {{often take}} {{pleasure}} in solitary activities such as reading, writing, using computers, hiking and fishing. The archetypal artist, writer, sculptor, scientist, engineer, composer and inventor are all highly introverted. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people, though they may enjoy interactions with close friends. Trust is usually an issue of significance: a virtue of utmost importance to introverts is choosing a worthy companion. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity {{at a time and}} like to observe situations before they participate, especially observed in developing children and adolescents. They are more analytical before speaking. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement, <b>introversion</b> having even been defined by some in terms of a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating external environment.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, a {{study by}} Lippa (1978) found {{evidence}} for {{the extent to which}} individuals present themselves in a different way. This is called expressive behaviour, and it is dependent upon the individuals' motivation and ability to control that behaviour. Lippa (1978) examined 68 students who were asked to role-play by pretending to teach a math class. The students' level of extraversion and <b>introversion</b> were rated based on their external/expressive behaviours such as stride length, graphic expansiveness, the percentage of time they spent talking, the amount of time they spent making eye contact, and the total time of each teaching session. This study found that actual introverts were perceived and judged as having more extraverted-looking expressive behaviours because they were higher in terms of their self-monitoring. This means that the introverts consciously put more effort into presenting a more extraverted, and rather socially desirable, version of themselves. Thus, individuals are able to regulate and modify behaviour based on their environmental situations.|$|E
25|$|The affective {{reactivity}} model {{states that}} {{the strength of a}} person's reactions to affect-relevant events are caused by people's differences in affect. This model is based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory by Jeffrey Alan Gray, which states that people with stronger behavioral activation system (BAS) are high in reward responsiveness and are predisposed to the personality trait of extraversion, while people with a stronger behavioral inhibition system (BIS) are lower in reward responsiveness and are more predisposed to personality trait of neuroticism and <b>introversion.</b> Therefore, extraverts are seen as having a temperamental predisposition to positive affect since positive mood induction has a greater effect on them than on introverts, thus extraverts are more prone to react to pleasant effects. For example, Gable, Reis, and Elliot (2000). found in two consecutive studies that people with more sensitive BIS reported higher levels of average negative affect, while people with more sensitive BAS reported higher levels of positive affect. Also Zelenski and Larsen (1999) found that people with more sensitive BAS reported more positive emotions during the positive mood induction, while people with more sensitive BIS reported more negative emotions during the negative mood induction.|$|E
500|$|Academic Charles Hatfield finds [...] "an abiding {{interest}} in the ways people are shaped by their environment" [...] in Brown's autobiographical work, and believes the stories demonstrate [...] "the urgency of Justin Green and the mundane particularity of Harvey Pekar", two influential creators known for their revealing autobiographical comics. [...] Brown is unsparing in his depictions of social awkwardness of his teenage years.

2500|$|Both shyness and <b>introversion</b> can {{outwardly}} manifest with socially withdrawn behaviors, such as {{tendencies to}} avoid social situations, {{especially when they}} are unfamiliar.
