The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper presents an investigation of the driveline torsional vibration behaviour, referred to as judder, which takes place during the clutch engagement process, particularly on small trucks with diesel engines. A non-linear multibody dynamic model of the clutch mechanism is employed to study the effect of various clutch system and driveline components on the clutch actuation performance. The paper demonstrates that judder is affected by driveline inertial changes, variation in the coefficient of friction, μ, of the <b>friction</b> disc <b>linings</b> with slip speed, v, and the loss of clamp load. The results of the simulations show that various friction materials with different μ–v characteristics produce torsional self-excited vibrations of the driveline. The results also show that loss of clamp load relating to the speed of clutch actuation also contributes to judder. Furthermore, it is shown that the simulation results conform closely to the experimental findings...|$|R
40|$|The brake {{architecture}} of hybrid and full electric vehicle includes the distinctive function of brake blending. Known approaches {{draw upon the}} maximum energy recuperation strategy and neglect the operation mode of friction brakes. Within this framework, an efficient control of the blending functions is demanded to compensate external disturbances induced by unpredictable variations of the pad disc friction coefficient. In addition, the control demand distribution between the conventional frictional brake system and the electric motors can incur failures that compromise the frictional braking performance and safety. However, deviation of friction coefficient value given in controller from actual one can induce undesirable deterioration of brake control functions. The main objective of the presented study is to propose a method to compensate disturbances induced by variations of brake <b>linings</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient through modifications of the brake torque demand for the enhancement of both brake performance and active safety. The achievement of a compensation mechanism requires the estimation of relevant vehicle states. Hereunto, a novel technique based on a linear Kalman observer is proposed for the online estimation of the brake friction coefficient by relying upon the wheel speed sensors and inertia measurement unit (IMU). Such a tool enables a more efficient use of the frictional brakes aimed at minimizing losses of friction coefficient by keeping them in the optimal operational conditions. A simulation analysis {{will be carried out}} using the commercial vehicle dynamics simulation software IPG CarMaker to test the functionality of the developed estimator in the real-time mode. Experimental results from brake dynamometric test rig will be considered in the vehicle dynamics simulation software to reproduce the real behaviour of brake <b>linings</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient. The resulting improvements in brake control functions will be analysed against longitudinal base braking cases involving blending functions also in presence of failure of the electric motors...|$|R

Although the use of asbestos containing products is has been reduced, chrysotile brakes continue to be manufactured and/or used {{in many parts of the}} world. This is the first inhalation study designed to provide an understanding of the biokinetics and potential toxicology of chrysotile containing brake dust following short term exposure in rats. The deposition, pathological response and translocation of brake-dust derived from brake pads manufactured with chrysotile were evaluated in comparison to the amphibole, crocidolite asbestos. This presentation presents results from the lung and in particular the quantification of measurements of fibers and pathological response in the pleural cavity. Rats were exposed by inhalation 6 h/day for 5 days to either brake-dust obtained by sanding of brakedrums manufactured with chrysotile, a mixture of chrysotile and the brake-dust or crocidolite asbestos. The crocidolite asbestos fibers initiated a rapid inflammatory response in the lung following exposure resulting in a 5 -fold increase in fibrotic response within 91 days. In addition, marked increase in visceral pleural thickness and collagen deposition was observed following crocidolite asbestos inhalation. No significant pathological response was observed in the lung or the pleural cavity at any time point in either the brake-dust or chrysotile/brake-dust exposure groups. These results provide support that brake-dust derived from chrysotile containing brake drums would not initiate a pathological response in the lung following short term inhalation...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{drive power}} in motor vehicles requires an improved performance of <b>friction</b> <b>linings</b> and counterpart material in clutches. The most important criteria are {{the coefficient of}} friction, the wear rate, the specific weight, the judder and noise inclination.

So far organic <b>friction</b> <b>linings</b> are used preferentially because of their good comfort behaviour and low price. Their properties were improved continually over the last years. However their performance is limited especially by the transferable specific friction energy. Thus the evaluation of alternative friction materials is an important goal of the clutch manufacturers.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesTwo magnesium/silicon {{aluminium}} alloys each reinforced with 20 vol. % SiC particulates have been worn against three different automobile <b>friction</b> <b>linings</b> (brake pads). Two of the <b>friction</b> <b>linings</b> {{are commonly used}} against cast iron brake rotors while the third has been formulated for use against aluminium MMC brake rotors. Wear processes at the interfaces of the specific rotor - pad combinations have been characterised through the analysis of friction traces {{and the use of}} optical and electron microscopy. Models on the interdependence of friction and wear, and models of wear mechanisms for aluminium MMCs and cast iron sliding against friction materials have been proposed and discussed. For an aluminium MMC sliding against an organic pad formulated for use against cast iron, wear rates are low and friction is constant due to the formation of a solid lubricant layer at the wear interface. When this MMC is worn against a semi-metallic pad formulated for use against cast iron, wear rates are extremely high due to two and three body abrasion which lead to subsurface delamination and early melt wear in the MMC. For an aluminium MMC developed for its use in automobile brake rotors sliding against a semi-metallic pad specifically formulated for its use against MMC brake rotors, wear rates at low loads are low although friction traces are irregular and fracture of the SiC particulates occurs at the lowest load and sliding velocity. This fracture of SiC is caused by the abrasive action of hard alumina particles within the pad. At high loads and sliding velocities cohesiveness of materials within the pad is poor and the wear rate of the MMC is extremely high. At the highest load/sliding velocity combination, the wear resistance of the MMC is inferior to that of its unreinforced matrix. If the structure and composition of <b>friction</b> <b>linings</b> are arranged correctly, the wear resistance and frictional performance of aluminium MMC brake rotors are superior to those of cast iron brake rotors. In addition, the lower density of aluminium MMCs provides for an economic advantage over cast iron with respect to efficient use of fuel, and fabrication expenses...|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} of the braking devices is increasing due to the intensification of manufacturing, increase in the moving masses, speeds of movement and frequency of braking. During a short time period the braking device needs to convert {{a significant amount of}} mechanical energy into heat energy and transfer it into the environment without compromising the operability of both devices and machines in general. For electric actuators braking a normally closed mechanical brake is frequently used. When disconnecting the motor from the network the brake friction surfaces are closed and prevent rotation, and when the motor is switched on, they are opens under the action of the electromagnet, electro-hydraulic pusher, special electric motor, mechanical or pneumatic device. In the case of joint implementation of the asynchronous motor and the mechanical brake, the drive of quick stop is more compact and convenient. Such devices are further called asynchronous motors with electromechanical braking systems henceforth. The large number of requirements as well as different conditions of operation cause a large variety of designs of such motors. One of the major shortcomings of the functioning of well-known design is the periodic wear of the <b>friction</b> <b>linings</b> and the need for frequent replacement of them. The solution to this problem is the use of asynchronous motor with recessed combo braking device. However, for some mechanisms that do not require a smooth stop of the motor shaft and that have a speed of rotation of the motor shaft less than 1500 rpm, more simple and cheap solution would be the use of an electromechanical braking device with an air gap compensation. Due to wear of the <b>friction</b> <b>linings</b> the air gap of the electromagnet increases. Due to the compensation of the air gap of the electromagnet these devices make it possible to rub the material of the friction lining longer. The current designs of the electromechanical braking device with compensation of the air gap are quite bulky and complicated to be manufactured. Therefore, the authors developed, experimentally investigated and implemented two new, simple and cheap designs of electromechanical braking device with compensation of the air gap. </p...|$|E
