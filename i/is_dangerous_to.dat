5|$|In {{association}} football, kit (also {{referred to}} as strip or soccer uniform) is the standard equipment and attire worn by players. The sport's Laws of the Game specify the minimum kit which a player must use, and also prohibit the use of anything that <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> either the player or another participant. Individual competitions may stipulate further restrictions, such as regulating the size of logos displayed on shirts and stating that, {{in the event of}} a match between teams with identical or similar colours, the away team must change to different coloured attire.|$|E
5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> human and animal life. It can cause severe damage to the digestive system, and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{equipment}} or kit players {{are required to}} wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals. Headgear is not a required piece of {{basic equipment}}, but players today may choose to wear it {{to protect themselves from}} head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.|$|E

5|$|While {{the venom}} {{of a few}} species <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> humans, {{scientists}} are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides. Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these {{can be used as}} silk factories. As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers. An abnormal fear of spiders is called arachnophobia.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is not {{toxic to}} {{all forms of}} life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus {{has no effect on}} photosynthesising plants. It is easily absorbed through the lungs. Inhaling the gas can lead to hypoxic injury, nervous system damage, and even death. Different people and populations may have different carbon monoxide tolerance levels. On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> human health. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period; in addition, employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ("ceiling") of 100 ppm is reached. Carbon monoxide exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage. The carbon monoxide tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including activity level, rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, sickle cell disease and other hematological disorders, barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.|$|E

25|$|Water has a {{high heat}} of {{vaporization}} and is relatively inert, {{which makes it a}} good fire extinguishing fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.|$|E
25|$|The Gloucester and Sharpness Canal {{connects the}} Severn at Gloucester to the Severn at Sharpness, {{avoiding}} {{a stretch of}} the tidal river which <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> navigate.

25|$|The diver {{needs to}} stay on the bottom to work some of the time, and may need to have neutral {{buoyancy}} some of the time. The diving suit is usually buoyant, so added weight is usually necessary. This can be provided in several ways. Unwanted positive buoyancy <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> a diver who may need to spend significant time decompressing during the ascent, so the weights are usually attached securely to prevent accidental loss.|$|E

25|$|Ozone is {{colourless}} {{or slightly}} bluish gas (blue when liquefied), slightly {{soluble in water}} and much more soluble in inert non-polar solvents such as carbon tetrachloride or fluorocarbons, where it forms a blue solution. At , it condenses to form a dark blue liquid. It <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> allow this liquid to warm to its boiling point, because both concentrated gaseous ozone and liquid ozone can detonate.

25|$|In Arab folklore, sacred {{trees are}} haunted by jinn; sacrifices are made, and the sick who sleep beneath them receive {{prescriptions}} in their dreams. Here, as frequently elsewhere, it <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> pull a bough. This dread of damaging special trees is familiar: Cato instructed the woodman to sacrifice {{to the male}} or female deity before thinning a grove, while in the Homeric poem to Aphrodite the tree nymph is wounded when the tree is injured, and dies when the trunk falls.|$|E
25|$|While {{living in}} one's body an {{individual}} has conjunction with heaven through the angels, and with each person, {{there are at least}} two evil spirits and two angels. Temptation or pains of conscience originates from a conflict between evil spirits and angels. Due to man's sinful nature it <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> have open direct communication with angels and can only be seen when one's spiritual sight has been opened. Thus from moment to moment angels attempt to lead each person to what is good tacitly using the person's own thoughts.|$|E

Breast implant device fillers are biologically inert—saline filler is salt water, and silicone filler is indigestible—because each substance is chemically inert, and environmentally common. Moreover, proponent physicians have said there “should be no absolute contraindication to breast-feeding by women with silicone breast implants.” In the early 1990s, {{at the beginning of}} the silicone breast implant sickness occurrences, small-scale, non-random studies (i.e. “patients came with complaints, which might have many sources”, not “doctors performed random tests”) indicated possible breast-feeding complications from silicone implants; yet no study reported device–disease causality.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{common ragwort}} (Senecio jacobaea) {{is one of}} the five plants named as an {{injurious}} weed under the provisions of the Weeds Act 1959. The word injurious in this context indicates that it could be harmful to agriculture not that it <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> animals, as all the other injurious weeds listed are non-toxic. Under the terms of this Act, a land occupier can be required by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs {{to prevent the spread of}} the plant. However, the growth of the plant is not made illegal by the Act and there is no statutory obligation for control placed upon landowners in general.|$|E

Kendall has seen Ryan angrily voice {{that he never}} wants children, and she fears how Ryan will react to Greenlee's pregnancy. When Greenlee relays to Ryan that they are expecting a child, Ryan goes on an angry rampage, destroying Greenlee's hotel room, and in some time, drives his motorcycle off of a cliff. Everyone presumes Ryan is dead. However, Zach discovers him alive. When Ryan strongly reasons with Zach not to reveal to Greenlee or Kendall, or anyone that he is still alive, Zach agrees, feeling that Ryan's temper <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> Greenlee. He also sees Ryan's need to start fresh, just as he once had.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to heavy}} pollution, the East River <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> people who fall in or attempt {{to swim in}} it, {{although}} as of mid-2007 the water was cleaner {{than it had been}} in decades. As of 2010, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) categorizes the East River as Use Classification I, meaning it is safe for secondary contact activities such as boating and fishing. According to the marine sciences section of the DEP, the channel is swift, with water moving as fast as four knots, just as it does in the Hudson River on the other side of Manhattan. That speed can push casual swimmers out to sea. A few people drown in the waters around New York City each year.|$|E
25|$|In {{slightly}} under 32° S. Lat. {{there is}} a large island, at about 3 miles' distance from the mainland of the South-land; this island has high mountains, with a good deal of brushwood and many thornbushes, so {{that it is hard to}} go over; here certain animals are found, since we saw many excrements, and besides two seals and a wild cat, resembling a civet-cat, but with browner hair. This island <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> touch at, owing to the rocky reefs which are level with the water and below the surface, almost along the whole length of the shore; between it and the mainland there are also numerous rocks and reefs, and slightly more to southward {{there is a}}nother small island.|$|E
25|$|Early Buddhism {{held that}} trees had neither mind nor feeling and might {{lawfully}} be cut; but it recognized that certain spirits might reside in them, such as Nang Takian in Thailand. Propitiation is {{made before the}} axe is laid to the holy trees; loss of life or of wealth {{and the failure of}} rain are feared should they be wantonly cut; there are even trees which it <b>is</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> climb. The Talein of Burma prays to the tree before he cuts it down, and the African woodman will place a fresh sprig upon the tree. Some Ancient Indian tree deities, such as Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the Tamil deity of the tamarind tree, or Kadambariyamman, associated with the kadamba tree were seen as manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in abundance.|$|E
