This shift has been underlined by the transition from broadcast based technology - fixed until this decade firmly in the 4x3 aspect ratio specifications NTSC and PAL - to computer industry technology, where the varied needs of office presentation, immersive gaming and corporate video presentation have led to diversity and abundance in methods of output. Compared to the ~640x480i <b>fixed</b> <b>format</b> of NTSC/PAL, a contemporary laptop using DVI can output a great variety of resolutions up to ~2500px wide, and in conjunction with the Matrox TripleHead2Go can feed three different displays with an image coordinated across them all.|$|E

PPX is a query {{language}} for XML database which has extensive formatting capability that produces HTML {{as the result}} of a query. The <b>fixed</b> <b>formatting</b> method is to completely specify the combination of variables and layout specification operators within the layout expression of the GENERATE clause of PPX. In the experiment, a quick comparison shows that PPX requires far less description compared to XSLT or XQuery programs doing the same tasks...|$|R

Exceptions to recognizing, and processing variable and <b>fixed</b> <b>formats</b> are listed below. The specific edits and validations done on common <b>fixed</b> and variable <b>format</b> headers are listed in Chapter 2. All transactions that reject from Transaction Management do so under output DIC KRU. See volume 8 for the Input/Output <b>fixed</b> length <b>formats.</b> See volume 9 for the Input/Output variable length formats. Variable format Input/Output transactions always begin with a numeric 4 position segment length. The package sequence number for the first record is always “A 01 ” because variable transactions have {{a minimum of two}} records. The header record will only be repeated (using same dcn) for DIC LMX, the nsn will change on each full header. Mini-Headers will be used under DIC LMD to indicate multiple actions that must be processed together. Character/data element occurs counters are required for some data elements in variable format. Following are examples of variable format transactions: Variable Format LMD with Mini-Header...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} L^p Dirichlet {{problem for the}} Stokes system on Lipschitz domains. For any fixed p> 2, we show that a reverse Hölder {{condition}} with exponent p is sufficient for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem with boundary data in L^p_N(∂Ω,d). Then we obtain a much simpler condition which implies the reverse Hölder condition. Finally, we establish the solvability ofthe L^p Dirichlet problem for d≥ 4 and 2 -ε<p< 2 (d- 1) /d- 3 +ε.
