In order to place <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> in a context, Part II outlines the emergence and decline of <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> in the federal system. Part III then traces the origin of <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> in New York to Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 s dictum in Lemon. Part IV explains how <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> is {{an aspect of the}} much broader inherent judicial power, which finds expression in the familiar common law decision-making process. Part V discusses three principal areas in which <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> has been exercised by New York courts since Cardozo: formulating rules of discovery, regulating grand jury practice, and fashioning remedies for governmental misconduct. Finally, Part VI demonstrates that <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> is a legitimate exercise of judicial authority based on two distinct theories: as a sub-constitutional common law of justice and fair dealing, and {{as an integral part of}} the court 2 ̆ 7 s inherent common law power to formulate rules for the proper administration of justice...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article, and of its earlier {{companion}} article (Part (1) Rule-making, 12 European Business Organization Law Review (2011) p. 41), {{is to examine the}} implications of the new European Securities and Markets Authority which was established in January 2011. In the wake of the financial crisis, the case for institutional reform and for conferring regulatory and <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> on a central EU authority became compelling. But any institutional design would have struggled given the necessity for compromise. The central difficulty is one of nuance. Where on the spectrum from national powers to EU powers, and with respect to regulation and supervision, should any new body's powers be placed if optimum outcomes are to be achieved? The question is further complicated by the different dynamics and risks of centralising rule-making and of centralising supervision, even if there is considerable symbiosis between these activities. This article considers ESMA's <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers.</b> It argues that, by contrast with its rule-making powers, the current and potential extent of ESMA's <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> has pushed ESMA too high up the spectrum towards EU intervention. Local supervision of the EU rule-book represents an important safety valve for the EU financial market but this safety valve may be obstructed by ESMA's undue standardisation of supervisory practices. ESMA's extensive direct <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> are also troubling given concerns as to their effectiveness. It was {{always going to be a}} challenge to draw the dividing line between ESMA's <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> and those of national competent authorities. But the line may have been drawn too far on the side of operational centralisation...|$|R

40|$|Relying on {{something}} it calls <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> or <b>supervisory</b> authority, the Supreme Court regularly prescribes {{rules of procedure}} and evidence for inferior courts. Both scholars and the Court have treated the Court 2 ̆ 7 s exercises of this authority as unexceptional exercises of the inherent authority that Article III grants every federal court to regulate procedure {{in the course of}} adjudication. Article III 2 ̆ 7 s grant of inherent authority, however, is conventionally understood as permitting a federal court to regulate its own proceedings. When the Supreme Court exercises <b>supervisory</b> <b>power,</b> it regulates the proceedings of other federal courts. More than a reference to every court 2 ̆ 7 s inherent authority, therefore, is required to justify the Court 2 ̆ 7 s action. If the Supreme Court possesses a unique ability to regulate federal court procedure, it must be because of some unique attribute of the Supreme Court. This Article explores a justification that may well animate the Court 2 ̆ 7 s assertions of supervisory power: the notion that the Court possesses <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> by virtue of its constitutional supremacy. Analyzing this justification requires pursuit of two questions that are wholly unexplored in the literature and case law. Does Article III 2 ̆ 7 s distinction between supreme and inferior courts operate only as a limit on the way that Congress can structure the judicial department, or does it also operate as a source of inherent authority for the Supreme Court? And assuming that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s supremacy grants it inherent authority over inferior courts, is <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> over procedure part of the authority granted...|$|R

The next year, Thomas would himself cite Powell as to how the <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> could not be exercised in conflict with existing statutory or constitutional provisions in Thomas v.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to describe and}} assess the legal position in respect of guidelines, directives, manuals and similar instruments issued by administrative authorities. It first reviews the statutory or other legal basis for the power to issue such instruments. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the recognition by the courts of an implicit authority to formulate instructions to subordinate officials, as part of <b>general</b> managing and <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers.</b> The author then outlines the specific features of directives, as compared with regulations. Both classes of instruments usually contain rules of fairly general application. Both can be seen as useful means of structuring the exercice of discretionary decision-making powers. Directives, guidelines, manuals and the like, however, set a particular emphasis on the provision of guidance or even imperative instructions for officials in the discharge of their duties, while regulations apply just as statutes do, to the general public as well as to civil servants. Great weight —perhaps an excessive weight — was attached to this distinction in the reasons of Pigeon J. in the first Martineau case, which is discussed at some length. The question of unpublished directives becoming in fact a body of « secret law » is then surveyed. The limited scope of the federal Statutory Instruments Act in this respect is underlined, and the author argues for selective adoption of public rule-making procedures, requirements for publication in official gazettes, and referral to parliamentary committees. Finally, the paper surveys the present state of the law as regards judicial review of directives. While review may bear on the vires for the making of the directive, much {{as in the case of}} regulations, it more often occurs when a discretionary decision is challenged before the courts on the grounds that the decision-maker fettered its own discretion by inflexibly applying self-made guidelines where individual determination was called for, or by submitting to directives from some other authority. In cases where judicial intervention is not possible, recourse may be had to ombudsmen ; the experience of the Public Protector in Quebec in connection with directives and guidelines is described...|$|R
