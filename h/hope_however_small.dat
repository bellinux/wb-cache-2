40|$|The {{present study}} {{consists}} of four parts. The first three are a canonical analysis of Isaiah, Micah and Zephaniah, respectively. These chapters attempt to give an answer to why the community {{was reduced to a}} remnant and what characterises them. The final chapter attempts to place the theme of the remnant in biblical theology. This study rests on two convictions: (1) The interpreter needs to wrestle with the biblical texts in their canonical form because these have been transmitted as works of literature; (2) A canonical method is especially suited {{for the study of the}} prophetic literature because of the thematic structure and figurative language of this literary genre. Through a close reading of these prophets, it is shown, that the remnant theme is used as a bridge or hinge between the themes of judgement and salvation. It provides an explanation and reason for the preservation of a community which has faced judgement. The theme can be used both positively and negatively. The absence of a remnant marks the end of a community. But when it is present there is <b>hope</b> (<b>however</b> <b>small).</b> The theme is often associated with the future promises of restoration which the prophets proclaimed. And as such the remnant will be the future eschatological community, the people of the Messiah...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{randomization}} {{ingredient in}} double-blind controlled experi-ments may be objectionable to patients who, in their desperation, come to such trials seeking a last chance of cure. Minogue et ah, who view {{such a situation}} as inherently exploitive and undermining of patient autonomy, propose that such "desperate volunteers " instead be enrolled in the active arm, while other patients, less desperate and more committed to medical progress, continue to be randomized. Their view is critiqued as destructive of medical progress, inappro-priate in its lack of clinical response to such patients, and fatally flawed by unre-alistic notions of autonomy and voluntariness. Key Words: autonomy, voluntariness, exploitation, informed consent, double-blind experimentation, randomization The individual human subject might well perceive the nature of double-blind controlled experimentation as objectionable. Presented the choice of participating in a study where neither subject nor investigator will know if the subject is receiving active therapy or is {{in the control group}} receiving standard therapy or a placebo, not a few individuals have been reported to object and simply insist on the active therapy. Such an insistence by a class of patients has recently occurred with regard to experimental treatments for HIV infection where there is no standard treatment. Why not give the "promising " experimental therapy to those who wish it? Doing so may well offer them their only chance of <b>hope,</b> <b>however</b> <b>small</b> or conjectural, and a little hope is better than none at all. The usual objections to such an accommodation may just seem heartless to the patient. Research progress is certainly secondar...|$|E
