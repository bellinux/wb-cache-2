50|$|The first {{generation}} of MMP inhibitors {{were based on the}} structure of the collagen molecule. This group of inhibitors contain a hydroxamate (-CONHOH) group that binds the zinc atom in the active site of the MMP enzyme. The first MMP inhibitors that were tested in patients were Ilomastat and Batimastat, hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors. However, neither compound showed good oral bioavailability.Thus far, Periostat (active ingredient is doxycycline <b>hyclate)</b> is the only MMP inhibitor that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is used for the treatment of periodontitis. Other MMP inhibitors have exhibited serious side effects during preclinical trials. These side effects are caused by insufficient selectivity. Most MMP inhibitors are unable to target specific MMPs connected to specific pathological conditions. Instead, they inhibit multiple MMPs, some of which have protective functions or are not related to pathology.MMPs have been regarded as promising targets for cancer therapy. Preclinical studies investigating the efficacy of MMP suppression in tumor models were encouraging. Following these results, clinical studies were conducted but turned out to be disappointing. Recent studies have shown that MMPs may even have paradoxical roles in tumor progression. MMPs seem to have tumor-promoting effects as well as tumor suppressive effects dependent on different contexts.|$|E

40|$|To {{characterize}} the thermal behavior and texture analysis of doxycycline <b>hyclate</b> thermosensitive gels developed for periodontitis treatment containing zinc oxide prepared by using poloxamer (Lutrol ® F 127) as polymeric material and N-methyl pyrrolidone {{was used as}} cosolvent. The thermosensitive gel comprising doxycycline <b>hyclate,</b> Lutrol® F 127, and N-methyl pyrrolidone were characterized for the thermal behavior and texture analysis. The topography of the system after the dissolution test was characterized with scanning electron microscope. Differential scanning calorimetric thermogram exhibited the endothermic peaks in the systems containing high amount of N-methyl pyrrolidone in solvent. The sol-gel transition temperature of the systems decreased as the zinc oxide amount was increased. The addition of doxycycline <b>hyclate,</b> zinc oxide, and N-methyl pyrrolidone affected the syringeability of systems. The addition of zinc oxide into the doxycycline hyclate-Lutrol ® F 127 systems decreased the diameter of inhibition zone against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans since zinc oxide decreased the diffusion and prolonged release of doxycycline <b>hyclate.</b> From scanning electron microscope analysis, the porous surface of 20 % w/w Lutrol® F 127 system was notably {{different from that of}} gel comprising doxycycline <b>hyclate</b> which had interconnected pores and smooth surfaces. The number of pores was decreased with increasing zinc oxide and the porous structure was smaller and more compact. Therefore, the addition of zinc oxide could increase the syringeability of doxycycline hyclate-Lutrol® F 127 system with the temperature dependence. Zinc oxide decreased inhibition zone against test microbes because of prolongation of doxycycline <b>hyclate</b> release and reduced size of continuous cells.

The aim of the present clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy of doxycyline <b>hyclate</b> 10 % as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Material and Methods: 60 systemically healthy, chronic periodontitis patients were included in the study. Randomized clinical trial was performed over the 6 month period. Test group was treated by scaling and root planing followed by local delivery of doxycycline <b>hyclate</b> 10 %, while the control group was treated by scaling and root planing along with placebo. Results: Significantly greater (P < 0. 001) reduction in the mean probing pocket depth was demonstrated in the test group (3. 03 ± 0. 92 mm) when compared with the control group (2. 3 ± 0. 65 mm).

The cost is included for detecting glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency before administering primaquine for primary or terminal prophylaxis. For durations of exposure ranging from 3 to 730 days, if no terminal prophylaxis is given, doxycycline (generic) is the least expensive regimen. Compared with doxycycline <b>hyclate,</b> chloroquine costs {{three to four times}} more, and primaquine, after screening for G 6 PD, costs about eight times more. Atovaquone/proguanil is less expensive than mefloquine for a 3 -day exposure, but more expensive for 7 or more days. When terminal chemoprophylaxis with primaquine for 14 days is used in addition to doxycycline, mefloquine, chloroquine, or atovaquone/proguanil, primaquine alone is the least expensive regimen for exposures of < 10 days. Thereafter, doxycycline plus 14 days of primaquine is most economical. For subsequent exposures when G 6 PD status is already known, primaquine alone is the least expensive regimen for up to 9 days of exposure, but doxycycline is less expensive thereafter. In general, generic doxycycline <b>hyclate</b> is the least expensive regimen. Primaquine alone is economically attractive.

The current efficiency and specific electrical energy consumption at optimized conditions of the EC/EF system were calculate...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the effects of two doses of {{doxycycline}} <b>hyclate</b> on red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells and platelets of dogs with ehrlichiosis. Group I, comprised of healthy dogs (n= 6), negative on serology for Ehrlichia canis and Leptospira spp., real time PCR for E. canis and Anaplasma platys, and on semi–nested PCR for Babesia canis; Groups II (n= 6) and III (n= 6), comprised of dogs with suggestive clinical history, positive serology and/or real time PCR for E. canis, negative on research for anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies and real time PCR for A. platys, and on semi–nested PCR for B. canis were studied. Sick dogs were treated with doxycycline <b>hyclate</b> every 12 hours, by mouth, for 30 days (5 mg/kg, group II; 10 mg/kg, group III). Complete blood counts were performed before, after 15 days, and 10 days after period of treatment was complete. No difference between groups at the studied time points were noticed for red blood cells, hemoglobin, haematocrit and white blood cells. Difference was observed for platelets between group I and groups II and III (p< 0. 0001) at the study onset. After 15 days of treatment, the mean platelet for group III was lower than groups I (p= 0. 008) and II (p= 0. 0007), indicative of persistent thrombocytopenia, already absent in group II. No difference between groups was noticed at final time point, which suggests that both treatments increased platelets in dogs naturally infected with E. canis...|$|E
30|$|Three RCTs {{reported}} on the adjunctive local antibiotic therapy to mechanical debridement (Table  8). In particular, minocycline microspheres were either applied once [32] at baseline or repeatedly [29] at 30 and 90  days and compared with local antispectic therapy using CHX gel (1.0  %). At 12  months, minocycline was associated with significantly higher BOP (refers to a repeated application) and PD (refers to a single application) reductions {{when compared with the}} control group. The radiographic (refers to a repeated application) and microbiological analyses failed to reveal any significant differences between both groups. Similar clinical outcomes were also noted when doxycycline <b>hyclate</b> was used as an adjunct to mechanical debridement [26].|$|E
40|$|Balantidium coli, a ciliated protozoan, is {{well known}} to cause {{intestinal}} infection in humans. Extraintestinal spread to the peritoneal cavity and genitourinary tract has rarely been reported. There have also been a few cases of lung involvement from this parasite. A case of B coli causing a thick-walled right upper lobe cavity in an organic farmer who had contact with aerosolized pig manure is reported. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid examined for ova and parasite revealed trophozoites of B coli in large numbers. Treatment with doxycycline <b>hyclate</b> led to marked improvement. Necrotizing lung infection caused by the protozoan B coli {{should be considered in}} individuals who report contact with pigs...|$|E
