25|$|The North Channel naval duel was in {{some respects}} a {{small-scale}} dress-rehearsal, in reverse, for Jones's 1779 battle with HMS Serapis. Drake had been built as a merchant ship with defensive capability, and bought by the Royal Navy to help fill the gap left when many ships had {{to be sent to}} America; even the 20 four-pound guns were not official Navy issue, but her armament as a merchant vessel. The hull was the wrong shape for rapid battle manoeuvres, and not designed to resist cannon fire. Ranger had been built as a <b>fighting</b> <b>ship,</b> and modified by Jones for maximum efficiency: for example, although there were ports for 20 guns, he found it safest to install only 18 six-pound guns. That made for a total broadside weight of 54 pounds, slightly more than Drake 40 pounds total. However, those dozens of Irish volunteers meant that if Drake could grapple and board Ranger the Americans would be in trouble.|$|E

500|$|The ironclad became {{technically}} feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding {{in the first}} half of the 19th century. According to naval historian J.

500|$|In 1844, Prescott {{was painted}} by Joseph Alexander Ames, and also {{commissioned}} a bust from Richard Saltonstall Greenough. He was not active in researching for the Conquest of Peru until spring 1844, {{although he had}} already decided to write a work concerning Inca civilization while researching pre-Columbian Mexico, and listened to Inca Garcilaso de la Vega's Comentarios Reales de los Incas. He further studied Pedro Cieza de León's Crónicas del Perú, the works of Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa and Diego Fernández's Primera y segunda parte de la Historia del Piru. Prescott's progress was stalled by the unexpected death of his brother Edward at sea. His daughter Elizabeth was seriously ill, so Prescott and his family traveled to Niagara, which he considered a more healthy environment for her. After her recovery, they returned to Nahant in the summer, where Prescott started drafting the Conquest, and, as was his custom, spent the autumn in Peperell. Prescott's father {{died at the age}} of 82 on December8, which deeply upset him. He took a two-month break from writing to support his widowed mother and settle matters concerning his father's estate. His father left numerous stocks, shares and property that amounted to $343,736.86, almost all of which was shared between Prescott and his sister. Prescott was elected to the Institut de France in February 1845, in recognition of his accomplishments as a historian. He took the place of Martín Fernández de Navarrete, who had died the previous year, after a vote was cast. He was also admitted to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. In the summer of 1845, a collection of articles Prescott had published in the North American Review were published as Biographical and Critical Miscellanies by Bentley in octavo, and an edition was also prepared simultaneously by Harper & Brothers in New York. Prescott was writing 12pages of the work per day in the summer of 1845, and completed the first two chapters of the Conquest. He used the inheritance from his father to buy a house on Beacon Street in Boston. The building is now a National Historic Landmark, and is also known as the William Hickling Prescott House. Prescott moved into the house during December 1845, and set himself a year to finish the Conquest of Peru. In March, his eyesight, which had recovered significantly, suddenly deteriorated. Prescott was also suffering from acute dyspepsia and rheumatism, and he travelled to Nahant to [...] "benefit from the sea-air". This did not prevent him travelling to Washington, where he dined at the White House with President James K. Polk. He was also entertained by John Y. Mason, the former United States Secretary of the Navy, who informed him that a copy of Prescott's Conquest of Mexico had been placed in the library of every <b>fighting</b> <b>ship.</b> [...] The Conquest of Peru was completed in March 1847. As with previous works, it was published by Harper & Brothers in the United States and Bentley in Britain. The original US print run was 7,500copies, and the books were sold for $1 each. It was translated into Spanish, French, German and Dutch, and sold excellently. As with his previous works, it was also well-received critically.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{scholarship}} is {{divided on the}} provenance of the trireme, Greece or Phoenicia, and the exact time it developed into the foremost ancient <b>fighting</b> <b>ship.</b> Clement of Alexandria in the 2nd century, drawing on earlier works, explicitly attributes {{the invention of the}} trireme (trikrotos naus, [...] "three-banked ship") to the Sidonians. According to Thucydides, the trireme was introduced to Greece by the Corinthians in the late 8th century BC, and the Corinthian Ameinocles built four such ships for the Samians. This was interpreted by later writers, Pliny and Diodorus, to mean that triremes were invented in Corinth, the possibility remains that the earliest three-banked warships originated in Phoenicia.|$|E

Both her and Janus were renamed on 3 March 1788 to fit their latest role, with Mediator being renamed Camel and Janus being renamed Dromedary. The guns on Camels lower gundeck were removed, leaving her with twenty 9-pounder guns on her upper deck and four 6-pounder guns were fitted onto her quarterdeck.|$|E
