40|$|Large surface area, thin, polymer {{optical waveguides}} are an {{emerging}} technology that enable {{a wide variety}} of light collection and illumination systems to be created for passive lighting, solar collectors, and safety lighting for motorized vehicles. This research builds on design of rigid concentrator and diffuser waveguides, proposing and evaluating modifications for the design of a <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguide</b> combining both concentrating and diffusing functionalities. The waveguides are thin, mechanically flexible sheets with thicknesses in the range of mm, and active surfaces from a few cm 2 to several m 2. Regions of the functional surface are designed to act as light concentrators, light diffusers, light transmission conduits or some combination thereof. This research examines how the geometry and spatial distribution of micro-optical features patterned on a bi-layered thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) waveguides can be used to guide captured light rays through flat and flexible configurations. Zemax OpticStudio software simulation tool is used to investigate the design parameters and their impact on concentrator and diffuser performance. A multi-functional concentrator-diffuser waveguide is modelled and analysed in a study which shows the flat waveguide has an overall efficiency of over 94 %, however when it is modelled as a <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguide,</b> less than 1 % of the incident light is successfully guided. Various design modifications are considered to mitigate these losses, and the efficiency of the <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguide</b> is improved to nearly 60 %.

This paper introduces the alignment approach and reports on the development and fabrication of suspended and mechanically <b>flexible</b> photonic <b>waveguides.</b> Single suspended waveguide beams and suspended arrays with two and four coupled parallel waveguide beams of different lengths (250 ?mto 1000 ?m) and different widths (18 ?mto 34 ?m) are designed and fabricated. After fabrication, waveguide beam fracturing is observed. The fabrication process has been extended by an additional under-etching step in order to reduce beam fracturing. The static out-of-plane deflection of the fabricated devices follows a specific profile with a dominating upward curvature resulting in a measured maximum out-of-plane deflection of 2 % of the length.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{progress}} related to a multichannel photonic alignment concept, aiming for sub-micrometer precision in the alignment of the waveguides of two photonic integrated circuits (PICs). The concept consists of two steps: chip-to-chip positioning and chip bonding provide a coarse alignment after which waveguide-to-waveguide positioning and fixing result in a fine alignment. For the waveguide-to-waveguide alignment, an alignment functionality is developed and integrated {{in one of the}} PICs, consisting of mechanically flexible waveguides and MEMS actuators. This paper {{reports on the}} fabrication and characterization of a mechanically <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguide</b> array that can be positioned by two out-of-plane actuators. Thermal actuators are integrated with mechanically <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguide</b> beams to enable positioning them with high precision. By adding a poly-Si pattern on top of SiO 2 beams, an out-of-plane bimorph actuator can be realized. An analytical model enables estimating the curvature and the deflection of a single bimorph beam. Acquiring a small initial deflection while having a large motion range of the actuator proves to have conflicting demands on the poly-Si/SiO 2 thickness ratio. In this paper, we show that suspended waveguide arrays with integrated alignment functionality have an initial deflection- they curl up- due to residual stress in the materials. The actuators can be operated using a driving voltage between 0 V to 45 V, corresponding to ∼ 50 mW. Using higher voltages brings the risk of permanently changing the material properties of the heaters. The actuators can accomplish an out-of-plane crossbar translation up to 6. 5 μm at ∼ 50 mW as well as a rotation around the propagation direction of the light ranging from - 0 : 1 ° to 0. 1 °. At a constant actuation power of ∼ 50 mW, the crossbar shows a drift in vertical deflection of 0. 16 μm over a time of 30 min. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of electronics has changed our daily life for last few decades. The conventional electronic devices are usually based on wafers; they are, in principle, rigid {{and in the}} planar form with Young’s modulus of a few hundreds GPa. On the other hand, our biology system is much soft with Young’s modulus within kPa range. Thus, there is mechanical mismatch between the electronic devices and soft human body, which tackles {{the use of the}} electronics as biomedical devices for diagnosis and therapy. In this study, we introduce a few approaches to minimize the mechanical mismatch by enhancing the flexibility of devices for electronics-based biomedical devices. In the first chapter, the In 2 O 3 based conformal biomolecular sensors were introduced with highly robust and stable performance. The platform of biosensors was based on field effects transistors {{which is one of the}} most popular device types because of its sensitivity and selectivity. In addition, aqueous chemistry was utilized without organic solvent to eliminate organic byproduct, which ensures highly dense In 2 O 3 film with ultrathin-thick (3. 5 nm). Also, the oxide surface of In 2 O 3 was able to be easily functionalized for selective detection. Glucose and pH were detected with the ultrathin In 2 O 3 based transistor as a possible demonstration. In addition, we designed the structure of In 2 O 3 based transistors with the ultra-low stiffness value, which ensures the extreme flexibility of the devices and conformal contact on unconventional substrates. In the second section, wearable pulse sensor was exploited with <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguide</b> plates and micro light emitting diodes (μ-LEDs). Since the pulse sensor is a non-invasive tool monitoring the heart rate and arterial blood oxygen concentration, the {{development of}} wearable pulse sensor can be useful for wearable biomedical devices to diagnose our body system. For flexible devices, the waveguide plates were made of soft elastomer. Through the pattern made on the elastomer, the condition for total reflection of emitted light from μ-LEDs was changed to emit more light from the surface of the waveguide plates. The <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguide</b> plates consisting of two different μ-LEDs were placed on one side and organic photodetectors were placed on another side to understand the arterial blood oxygen saturation. Also, breath condition was monitored by using the wearable biomedical devices to further conform the possibility of our devices for photodiagnosis. Also, devices worked well under 50 % stretching test. In the last section, the wearable light emission device was utilized for phototherapy which is to use light for clinical purpose. The bilirubin was chosen as a target molecule, known as an indicator of mal-function of liver. Using our flexible biomedical devices, we successfully triggered the reaction kinetic of bilirubin and control the level of bilirubin. In addition, it was used to give the drug selectivity using photon-accelerated caged molecules, a caged fluorophore (5 -carboxyfluorescein-bis-(5 -carboxymethoxy- 2 -nitrobenzyl) ether. This is a proof-of-concept for drug targeting. Recent advances for wearable clinics and healthcare systems have brought a new opportunity for new types of biomedical devices available for recognition, prevention, and treatment. I strongly believe that current our study in this dissertation will be helpful for biomedical devices to move forward toward to commercialization...|$|E

Hollow core tube lattice fibers (HC-TLFs) have been recently proposed and experimentally demonstrated to overcome this problem. However, they require very large hollow core size leading to big and hardly flexible fibers. Scaling law analysis plays an important role in determining the best trade-off between low loss and small fiber diameter. The dependence of the confinement on frequency and core radius are here numerically investigated.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an improved approach for {{the propagation of}} electromagnetic (EM) fields {{in the case of}} the <b>flexible</b> hollow <b>waveguide</b> that consists of two bendings in the same direction. In this case, the objective is to develop a mode model for infrared (IR) wave propagation along the <b>flexible</b> hollow <b>waveguide,</b> in order to provide a numerical tool for the calculation of the output fields, output power density and output power transmission. The main steps of the method for the two bendings will introduced in the derivation, in detail, for small values of step angles. The derivation for the first section and the second section of the waveguide with the two bendings is based on Maxwell’s equations. The separation of variables is obtained by using the orthogonal-relations. The longitudinal components of the fields are developed into the Fourier-Bessel series. The transverse components of the fields are expressed as functions of the longitudinal components in the Laplace plane and are obtained by using the inverse Laplace transform by the residue method.

40|$|The {{project was}} aiming at high bitrate short range optical {{interconnection}} systems with parallel links. From potential application fields in telecom systems, {{the requirements for}} the components {{as well as for}} a cost effective assembly technology were derived. Guided singlemode transmission was selected over multimode technology according to its higher bandwidth and its compatibility with passive components of presently available transmission technologies for longer distances. Polymeric materials promise to form a cost effective, <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguide</b> system which can be combined with electrical printed circuit boards. Therefore, a technology for fabrication of buried waveguide arrays based on spin coating of polymethylmethacrylate and polybutylmethacrylate layers and reactive ion etching was elaborated. In order to reduce material attenuation deuterated polymers were synthesized and investigated. A slab waveguide loss of 0. 2. dB/cm (#lambda# = 1300 nm) was achieved. A special flux free flipship technology has been developed for mounting of optoelectronic (OE) arrays onto silicon motherboards, which does not require special alignment structures of the OE arrays (like stand-offs). A placement accuracy of better than one #mu#m has been achieved. Various OE components provided by partners within the Photonik project (850 nm laser arrays and GaAs receiver arrays) were mounted on silicon motherboards without changing their performance and coupled to waveguide arrays. By implementing the developed technologies multichannel transmitter and receiver modules for a wavelength of 850 nm have been assembled and a 622 Mbit/s optical transmission over parallel light paths has been demonstrated.

Patients older than 18 years, with oral, pharyngo-laryngeal or tracheal benign or premalignant lesions were enrolled after signing an informed consent. This prospective study was conducted between October 2010 and May 2011 in two tertiary care university hospitals. Thirty-nine patients {{were enrolled in the}} study. The mean age was 47. 9 years (range 18 - 86 years). There were 21 women and 18 men. Thirteen patients had hypertrophy of lymphoid tissue (palatine and or lingual), nine patients had granulomas, four patients had an exudative glottic lesion, three patients had severe dysplasia (glottic and supraglottic), three patients had leukoplakia, two patients had glottal cysts, two patients had laryngeal papilloma, two patients had bilateral paralysis of the vocal folds and one patient suffered from spasmodic dysphonia. Eighty-two percent of the procedures were performed under general anesthesia with laryngo-tracheal intubation. The CO 2 fiber passed through a handpiece was used with a microscope in the majority of the procedures. The laser delivery mode parameter used was: SuperPulse or Continuous Wave. Power levels were 3 - 15 Watts (W), continuous delivery. Each procedure utilized one CO 2 fiber which performed adequately throughout the procedure. No complications were noted with the use of this technology. A bipolar cautery was needed to control bleeding in eight procedures; all these procedures were tonsillectomies. The CO 2 LWG is a safe and reliable tool for TLS. It is durable enough to last through the entire surgical procedure without the need for replacement. Its use must be tailored depending on the type and location of the lesion, the CO 2 lasers tissue effects as well as the surgeon's experience. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Elastomer-based {{microsystems}} hold {{great promise}} for a {{diverse range of}} applications such as rapid prototyping of lab-on-a-chip device, soft-MEMS, and soft-robotics. For better performance in such applications, unconventional elastomeric structures in terms of size, shape, and patterning trajectory, have been intensely sought after in microtechnology but their realization has been a continuous challenge. Here, as my dissertation work, I present new microfabrication schemes which enable the realizations of unconventional PDMS structures, and their applications, which will enrich the field of soft-microsystems. First, I present a new fabrication scheme for the realization of cylindrical microfluidic (MF) channels with 3 D trajectories based on shaping, bonding, and assembly of sucrose fibers. Due to the high water-solubility of the sucrose templates, the scheme is a simple and environment-friendly. Also, it is cleanroom-free and cost-effective. Despite its simplicity, it enables the realization of essential 3 D MF channel architectures such as highly curved MF channels, internal loops, and proper end-to-side junctions. It can, also, realize tapered junctions and stenosis which can benefit vaso-mimetic lab-on-a-chip applications. Secondly, as a practical application of the sucrose-based MF channel, I report {{the implementation of the}} bokeh-effect-based microfluidic microscopy scheme for point-of care health monitoring in highly resource-limited environment. For this work, I integrated a single polymer microlens over the sucrose-templated MF channel and retrieved magnified intra-channel images with a commercial, off-the-shelf camera. The bokeh microscope exhibited 10 ∼ 40 in magnification and 67 ∼ 252 μm of field-of-view extent, confirming their utility for point-of-care monitoring of micro-scale objects in MF channels Third, I present a new technique that enables facile fabrications of high aspect-ratio PDMS micropillars exceeding 2400 m in height and 100 in aspect-ratio. The key enabling factor is the adoption of the direct drawing technique incorporated with the in situ heating for simultaneous hardening and solidification of PDMS. The technique also allows self-aligned installation of highly reflective microspheres at the tips of the micropillars. Using the transparent PDMS micropillar as a <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguide</b> and the microsphere as a self-aligned reflector, I transformed the microsphere-tipped PDMS micropillars into all optically interrogated air-flow sensors and successfully demonstrated its air-flow sensing capability. Lastly, I present a microscale soft-robotic tentacle with spiral bending capability based on pneumatically driven bending motion of a hollow PDMS microtube. For this work, I establish a new, direct peeling-based technique for building long and thin, highly deformable microtubes and a semi-analytical model for their shape-engineering. Based on them, the artificial microrobotic tentacle exhibits the multi-turn spiraling motion with the final radius of 185 μm and squeezing force of ~ 0. 78 mN. Thanks to the softness of PDMS and the spiraling motion, the micro-tentacle can function as a soft-robotic grabber of fragile micro-objects. The spiraling tentacle-based grabbing modality, the elastomeric microtube fabrication technique, and the concept of microtube shape-engineering will constitute very valuable additions to future microscale soft-robotics.

40|$|The {{development}} of low loss, broadband, small size and <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguides</b> {{has become a}} key issue in terahertz (THz) research due to the poor characteristics of both dielectrics and metals in this frequency range. Hollow core circular tube lattice fibers (HC-CTLFs) have been recently proposed and experimentally demonstrated to match many of these conditions.

CTLFs guide via Inhibited Coupling (IC) which doesn't rely on photonic bandgap and the confinement depends on a strong reduction of the coupling between core modes and cladding modes.

40|$|An innovative, <b>flexible,</b> planar <b>waveguide</b> antenna {{operating}} in dual-band mode for WLAN applications is proposed. This antenna has a simple topology, is compact, and {{is easy to}} manufacture fully using textiles. It involves loading by a composite right/left-handed waveguide to generate similar radiation patterns and low backward radiation in both operating bands. The latter property is extremely desirable for wearable applications as it avoids performance degradation due to dielectric coupling to the body, besides reducing possible health risks. Simulated and measured results indicate a good reflection and radiation performance agreement in both the 2. 45 and the 5. 4 GHz WLAN bands. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} realizations of laser projectors, one example being {{based on the}} {{principle}} of a flying light spot writing the image directly onto a screen. A laser projector of this type consists of three main components — a laser source uses the video signal to provide modulated light composed of the three sharp spectral colors — red, green, and blue — which a <b>flexible,</b> fiber-optic <b>waveguide</b> then transports to a relatively small projection head. The projection head deflects the beam according to the pixel clock and emits it onto a screen at an arbitrary distance. Such laser projection techniques are used in handheld projectors, planetariums, and for flight simulators and other virtual reality applications.|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic {{ultrasound}} angioplasty is {{an emerging}} minimally invasive cardiovascular procedure for disrupting atherosclerotic lesions using small diameter wire waveguides. The lesions are damaged {{through a combination}} of direct ablation, pressure waves, cavitation and acoustic streaming caused by distal-tip displacements at ultrasonic frequencies. Numerical and experimental methods are used to investigate the outputs of the wire waveguides during ultrasonic activation. A commercially available generator and acoustic horn are used in combination with Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) wire waveguides in this study. A laser sensor is used to measure the frequency and amplitude output of the distal tip of the wire waveguide, and this is compared to amplitude estimations obtained using an optical microscope. Power is observed to affect both amplitude and frequency. Clinical devices will require long, <b>flexible</b> <b>waveguides</b> with diameters small enough to access the coronary arteries. A finite element model is used to design tapered sections in long wire waveguides in order to achieve low profile distal geometry, and improve ultrasonic wave transmission. These tapered sections reduce the wire waveguide diameter in two stages, firstly from 1 to 0. 35 mm and then from 0. 35 to 0. 2, while increasing the amplitude of the ultrasonic wave by factors of 2. 85 and 1. 75, respectively. The numerical model also showed damping could potentially be a significant problem in long untapered wire waveguides (>l. 5 m). Experimental ablation trials were conducted using the tapered long wire waveguides, including assessment of the effect of various combinations of bend radii and bend angles. The waveguide was found to perform well, but increased power levels were required to transmit ultrasound through tortuous waveguide configurations...|$|R
