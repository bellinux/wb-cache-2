50|$|<b>EuroMed</b> <b>Rights</b> {{was created}} in {{relation}} to the existence of the inter-governmental Euromediterranean Partnership (EMP), and in particular, the Barcelona Process proposed by the EMP. EuroMed Rights' role is primarily as an intermediary between governmental institutions and grassroots human rights organisations. It received most of its funding during its first years from governmental sources and is closely linked to the EuroMed Civil Forums that constitutes a relatively government-linked alternative to the grassroots Alternative Mediterranean Conference that was organised in 1995. As of 2008, <b>EuroMed</b> <b>Rights</b> had become well recognised both by European Union (EU) institutions and NGOs. Its activities range from communication among NGO members and activist campaigning through to lobbying of institutions.|$|E

It was established in 1997 {{in response to the}} Barcelona Declaration, which led to the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.|$|E
30|$|Two other {{important}} dynamics played {{in favor of}} politicizing migration in the immediate post-revolutionary period. First, the integration into Tunisian institutions of numerous leftist and Islamist political figures who had returned from exile explains the initial dynamism on migration-related issues. A new State Secretariat of Immigration and Tunisians Abroad (SEITE) was created in 2012 to develop a national migration strategy (dormant since 2015 and still not officially adopted) and the Ministry of Justice started elaborating two laws - a law against human trafficking passed in August 2016, and a law on asylum currently blocked at the political level. Second, the multitude of international organizations that arrived in Tunisia brought not only funds, but also their interests and discursive frameworks with them. IOM and UNHCR, the German, Swiss and French Development cooperation or groups such as <b>Euromed</b> <b>Rights</b> have - relatively successfully - increased the pressure on Tunisian state institutions to deal with immigration {{in a process that}} could be coined ‘external agenda setting’: Although Tunisian authorities still consider Tunisia mainly as a country of emigration and transit, a discursive change is visible, as a growing number of public officials start to incorporate the destination country dimension into their discourse.|$|E
