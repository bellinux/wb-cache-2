These circuits endow biological systems with required functional properties. We give an overview on recent research results {{for the analysis of}} <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> in cell-biological systems using methods from control theory. Starting from the known functional roles of <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits,</b> we summarize the biological questions that motivate a control theoretical analysis and perspective. Then, suitable methods for such an analysis are presented. We discuss how to apply these methods to biological research problems by summarizing different research projects that deal with <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> in cell-biological systems.

40|$|Most {{biological}} regulation systems comprise <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> {{as crucial}} components. Negative <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> {{have been well}} understood {{for a very long}} time; indeed, their understanding has been the basis for the engineering of cybernetic machines exhibiting stable behaviour. The importance of positive <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits,</b> considered as "vicious circles", has however been underestimated. In this article we give a demonstration based on degree theory for vector fields of the conjecture, made by Rene Thomas, that the presence of positive <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> is a necessary condition for autonomous differential systems, covering a wide class of biologically relevant systems, to possess multiple steady states. We also show ways to derive constraints on the weights of positive and negative <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits.</b> These qualitative and quantitative results provide respectively structural constraints (i. e. related to the interaction graph) and numerical constraints (i. e. related to the magnitudes of the interactions) on systems exhibiting complex behaviours, and should make it easier to reverse-engineer the interaction networks animating those systems on the basis of partial, sometimes unreliable, experimental data. We illustrate these concepts on a model multistable switch, in the context of cellular differentiation, showing a requirement for sufficient cooperativity. Further developments are expected in the discovery and modelling of regulatory networks in general, and in the interpretation of bio-array hybridisation and proteomics experiments in particular...|$|R

Hence the charging circuit gets unisolated. As isolation problem will cause safety and stability problems to the charging circuit especially when the output voltage gets high, a <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit</b> which samples {{from the input side}} of the flyback charging circuit is brought out in this paper in order to solve the isolation problem. The working process is analyzed. And the choice of the parameters of that <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit</b> is introduced.

40|$|Multiple-positive <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> are {{ubiquitous}} regulatory motifs {{in complex}} bio-molecular networks. A popular topic is why multiple-positive feedback mechanisms have been evolved and selected by organisms. To this end, a two-component dual-positive <b>feedback</b> genetic <b>circuit</b> is investigated, {{which consists of}} an auto-activation loop and a double negative <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit.</b> The auto-activation loop acts as an additional positive feedback loop (APFL), and our aim is to explore the functional characteristics of the APFL. Investigations reveal that the APFL can regulate the size of bistable region and the robust attractiveness of stable steady states. It is {{also found that the}} APFL can regulate global relative input-output sensitivities of the system. Furthermore, the APFL can tune the response speed, noise resistance and stochastic switch behavior of the system, which makes it easy to realize functional tunability and robust decision-making. Therefore, rationalizing why multiple-positive <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> so frequently appear in real-world biological systems. Potential applications of the associated investigations include the design of artificial genetic circuits, the modeling and model reduction for large-scale bio-molecular networks...|$|R
40|$|Bifurcations {{leading to}} complex {{dynamical}} behaviour of non-linear systems are often encountered when {{the characteristics of}} <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> in the system are varied. In systems with many unknown or varying parameters, it is an interesting, but difficult problem to find parameter values for which specific bifurcations occur. In this paper, we develop a loop breaking approach to evaluate the influence of parameter values on <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit</b> characteristics. This approach allows a theoretical classification of <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit</b> characteristics related to possible bifurcations in the system. Based on the theoretical results, a numerical algorithm for bifurcation search in a possibly high-dimensional parameter space is developed. The application of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by searching for a Hopf bifurcation in {{a model of the}} mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is a classical example for biochemical signal transduction.

40|$|An {{electronic}} circuit, {{which can}} be used as a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), comprises two complementary Field Effect Transistors (M 1, M 2 ; M 5, M 6), each having a gate, a source and a drain. The gates are connected together as a common input terminal, and the drains are connected together as a common output terminal. The electronic circuit further has a <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit,</b> e. g. in the form of two anti?parallel Field Effect Transistors (M 3, M 4 ; M 7, M 8), connected between the common input terminal and the common output terminal.

40|$|Epidural {{electrical}} stimulation of lumbar segments facilitates standing and walking in animal models and humans with spinal cord injury. However, the mechanisms through which this neuromodulation therapy engages spinal circuits remain enigmatic. Using computer simulations and behavioral experiments, we {{provide evidence that}} epidural {{electrical stimulation}} interacts with muscle spindle <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> to modulate muscle activity during locomotion. Hypothesis-driven strategies emerging from simulations steered the design of stimulation protocols that adjust bilateral hindlimb kinematics throughout gait execution. These stimulation strategies corrected subject-specific gait and balance deficits in rats with incomplete and complete spinal cord injury. The conservation of muscle spindle <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> across mammals suggests that the same mechanisms may facilitate motor control in humans. These results provide a conceptual framework to improve stimulation protocols for clinical applications. Computer simulations validated experimentally revealed that epidural electrical stimulation of lumbar segments facilitates motor control through the modulation of muscle spindle <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits.</b> Simulations established a clinical framework to design stimulation protocols correcting gait symmetry and balance deficits after injury...|$|R
40|$|A useful {{approach}} to complex regulatory networks consists of modeling their elements and interactions by Boolean equations. In this context, <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> (i. e. circular sequences of interactions) {{have been shown}} to play key dynamical roles: whereas positive circuits are able to generate multistationarity, negative circuits may generate oscillatory behavior. In this paper, we principally focus on the case of gene networks. These are represented by fully connected Boolean networks where each element interacts with all elements including itself. Flexibility in network design is introduced by the use of Boolean parameters, one associated with each interaction or group of interactions affecting a given element. Within this formalism, a <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit</b> will generate its typical dynamical behavior (i. e. multistationarity or oscillations) only for appropriate values of some of the logical parameters. Whenever it does, we say that the circuit is 'functional'. More interestingly, this formalism allows the computation of the constraints on the logical parameters to have any <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit</b> functional in a network. Using this methodology, we found that the fraction {{of the total number of}} consistent combinations of parameter values that make a circuit functional decreases geometrically with the circuit length. From a biological point of view, this suggests that regulatory networks could be decomposed into small and relatively independent <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> or 'regulatory modules'.

40|$|Molecular {{regulation}} {{was initially}} assumed to follow both a unidirectional and a hierarchical organization forming pathways. Regulatory processes, however, form highly interlinked networks with non-hierarchical and non-unidirectional structures that contain statistically overrepresented circuits or motifs. Here, we analyze {{the behavior of}} pathways containing non-unidirectional (i. e. bidirectional) and non-hierarchical interactions that create motifs. In comparison with unidirectional and hierarchical pathways, our pathways have a high diversity of behaviors, characterized by the size and number of attractors.

40|$|Motivation: <b>Feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> are {{important}} motifs in biological networks {{and part of}} virtually all regulation processes that are needed for a reliable functioning of the cell. Mathematically, feedback is connected to complex behavior of the systems, which is often related to bifurcations of fixed points. Therefore, several approaches for the investigation of fixed points in biological networks have been developed in recent years. Many of them assume the fixed point coordinates to be known, and {{an efficient way to}} calculate the entire set of fixed points for interrelated feedback structures is highly desirable. Results: In this paper we consider regulatory network models, which are differential equations with an underlying directed graph that illustrates independencies among variables. We introduce the circuit-breaking algorithm (CBA), a method that constructs one-dimensional characteristics for these network models which inherit important information about the system. In particular, fixed points are related to the zeros of these characteristics. The CBA operates on the graph topology, and results from graph theory are used in order to make calculations efficient.
