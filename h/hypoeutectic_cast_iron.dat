The goal of this work is to study the Titanium effects on {{hypoeutectic}} grey iron. The {{first part of the}} work consists of a brief introduction on the basic necessary concepts to understand the solidification of cast iron and also a short summary of the reported effects of Titanium in cast iron.

40|$|Abstract: The {{most widely}} {{excavated}} iron artifacts used as weapons or farm tools from central southern regions of Korea were subjects of non-metallic inclusion analysis through metallographic examination, microhardness measurement, and {{scanning electron microscopy}} with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Through metallographic inter-pretation and study of the analyzed results, the steel manufacturing and iron smelting using heat processing in the iron artifacts excavated from the central southern region of the ancient Korean peninsula was studied, and {{the analysis of the}} non-metallic inclusions mixed within the metal-lic structures was interpreted as the ternary phase diagram of the oxide to infer the type of iron ores for the iron products and the temperature of the furnace used to smelt them. Most of the ancient forged iron arti-facts showed Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 with high SiO 2 contents and relatively low Al 2 O 3 contents for iron ore, indicating t hat for Al 2 O 3 below 5 %, it is presumed that magnetic iron ores were reduced to bloom iron (sponge iron) with direct-reduction process for production. The temperature for extraction of wustite for Al 2 O 3 below 1 % was found to be 1, 020 ∼ 1, 05 0 ℃. Considering the oxide ternary constitutional diagram of glassy in-clusions, the steel-manufacturing temperature was presumed to have been near 1, 150 ∼ 1, 280 ℃ in most cases, and minimum melting tem-perature of casting iron part excavated in Daeseong-ri. Gyeonggi was near 1, 400 ℃, and it is thought that <b>hypoeutectic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> of about 2. 3 % carbon was casted and fragility of cast iron was improved by de-carburizing in solid state...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} thixoforming process {{variables}} {{on the final}} mechanical properties of a specially designed <b>hypoeutectic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> were studied. An Fe- 2. 6 wt%C- 1. 5 wt%Si alloy was prepared using conventional sand casting molds and thixoformed in an eccentric press. Different temperatures and heat-treatment holding times were tested. After being heated to the semisolid state at 1160 degrees C and 1180 degrees C and held at these temperatures for 0, 30, 60 and 90 s, the samples were subjected to the thixoforming process. The holding time in the semisolid range simulates the industrial heating process, which is time controlled rather than temperature controlled. The {{results indicate that the}} forces applied during thixoforming are closely related to the liquid fraction of the hypoeutectic gray cast iron. A comparative analysis of the behavior of the tensile properties, Vickers microhardness and porosity before and after thixoforming was carried out. The stress-strain curves were similar for the different liquid fractions studied: at 1160 degrees C the average values were YE = 282 MPa, UTS = 289 MPa, E = 0. 21 % and Vickers microhardness = 274 HV, while at 1180 degrees C the corresponding figures were YE = 272 MPa, UTS = 277 MPa, E = 0. 2 % and Vickers microhardness = 257 HV. The small variations in tensile properties {{can be attributed to the}} final graphite morphology of the thixoformed alloy. The results also show that after thixoforming, the porosity of the Fe- 2. 6 wt%C- 1. 5 wt%Si alloy decreased for all experimental conditions and had a maximum value of 5 %. There was no significant difference in hardness between the thixoformed material and the as-cast alloy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{development}} of heat treatment modes of white <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> for structure {{changes in their}} eutectic constituent, namely in disturbing the monolithic structure of ledeburite colonies cementite structure and eutectic net continuity. Also the mentioned heat treatment modes are targeted to the eutectic net shift for the most suitable position {{from the point of}} plastic deforming. Methodology. The <b>hypoeutectic</b> white <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> with 2. 92 … 3. 35 % carbon content and additionally alloyed by 3. 18 % vanadium have been used as the research materials. The mentioned alloys have been pre-heat treated and hot twist tested. Findings. The research results showed that the carbide net breaking by plastic deforming leads to <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> mechanical properties increasing but has difficulties in implementation due to the white <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> low plasticity. The influence of different pre-heat treatment modes on structure and plasticity of white <b>hypoeutectic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> have been investigated. They include the isotherm soaking under the different temperatures as well as multiply soakings and thermo-cycling. The influence of eutectic level, as well as pre heat treatment modes on different composition white <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> hot plasticity have been investigated. Originality. It was determined that the heat treatment, which leads to double α→γ recrystallization under 860 – 950 °С and reperlitization under 720 - 680 °С results in significant increase of plasticity, as well as in un-alloyed and alloyed by vanadium white <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> It takes place due to carbide matrix phase separation in ledeburite colonies by new phase boundaries forming especially due to carbide transformations under vanadium alloying. Practical value. The implementation of pre-heat treatment with phase recrystallization resulted in <b>hypoeutectic</b> white <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> plasticity increasing. The obtained level of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> plasticity corresponds to the one of carbide class steels, which ensures the successful deformation by forging and rolling...|$|R

Chemical composition of the alloy was as follows: 1. 7 to 3. 3 % C, 1. 4 to 3. 1 % Si, 2. 8 to 9. 9 % Ni, 0. 4 to 7. 7 % Mn, 0 to 4. 6 % Cu, 0. 14 to 0. 16 % P and 0. 03 to 0. 04 % S. The discriminant analysis revealed that carbon influences solidification of primary austenite dendrites most intensively. It clearly increases the tendency to volumetric solidification. Influence of the other elements is much weaker.

40|$|Most lost-foam casting {{processes}} involve non-equilibrium solidification {{dominated by}} kinetic factors, while {{construction of a}} common dynamic solidification curve is based on pure thermodynamics, not applicable for analyses and research of non-equilibrium macro-solidification processes, and the construction mode can not be applied to non-equilibrium solidification process. In this study, {{the construction of the}} dynamic solidification curve (DSC) for the non-equilibrium macro-solidification process included: a modified method to determine the start temperature of primary austenite precipitation (TAL) and the start temperature of eutectic solidification (TES); double curves method to determine the temperature of the dendrite coherency point of primary austenite (TAC) and the temperature of eutectic cells collision point (TEC); the “technical solidus” method to determine the end temperature of eutectic reaction (TEN). For this purpose, a comparative testing of the non-equilibrium solidification temperature fields in lost-foam casting and green sand mold <b>casting</b> <b>hypoeutectic</b> gray <b>iron</b> was carried out. The thermal analysis results were used to construct the DSCs of both these casting methods under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. The results show that the transformation rate of non-equilibrium solidification in <b>hypoeutectic</b> gray <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> is greater than that of equilibrium solidification. The eutectic solidification region presents a typical mushy solidification mode. The results also indicate that the primary austenite precipitation zone of lost-foam casting is slightly larger than that of green sand casting. At the same time, the solid fraction (fs) of the dendrite coherency points in lost-foam casting is greater than that in the green sand casting. Therefore, from these two points, lost-foam casting is more preferable for reduction of shrinkage and mechanical burnt-in sand tendency of the <b>hypoeutectic</b> gray <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Due {{to the fact that the}} solidification process (from the surface to center) at primary austenite growth area in the lost-foam cylinder sample lags behind that in the green sand casting, the mushy solidification tendency of lost-foam casting is greater and the solidification time is longer...|$|R

The narrowing of the solidification temperature interval {{and the formation}} of vanadium carbides favours the appearance of a finer structure. Also, the phases volume fraction changes, i. e. the primary γ-phase fraction decreases and the amount of M 7 C 3 carbide increases.

The results indicated that under the proper agitating temperatures and speeds applied, the dendrite structures in white <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> slurry were gradually evolved into spherical structures during a certain agitating time. It also revealed that the bent dendrites were formed by either convection force or by the growth of the dendrites themselves in the bending direction; then, as they were in solidifying, they were gradually being alternated into separated particles and into more spherical structures {{at the end of the}} isothermal cooling process. Especially, the dendrites were granulated as the bending process proceeding, which suggested that they were caused by unwanted elements such as sulfur and phosphor usually contained in engineering <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Convective flow of the melt caused corrosion on the dendritic segments where they were weaker in strength and lower in melting temperature because of higher concentration of sulfur or phosphor. And the granulation process for such dendrites formed in the melt became possible under the condition.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{parameters}} such as liquid fraction, holding time, and cooling rate during thixoforming can help control the final microstructure of the thixoformed part, thus improving its mechanical properties. This study intended to investigate conditions required to obtain martensite in <b>hypoeutectic</b> gray <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> at 3. 1 % CE (carbon equivalent) deformed in the semisolid state. Samples heated up to 1130, 1135, and 1145 °C (liquid fractions of 10, 30, and 45 %) were compressed into platens without any holding time (0 [*]s). If a sample presented a martensitic structure for 0 [*]s holding time, new samples were retested {{at the same}} temperature for 30, 60, and 90 [*]s holding times. The die casting process was simulated by allowing the platens to become locked after hot compression. Samples that cooled in the locked platens were submitted to higher cooling rates than samples that cooled with the platens open and presented martensite instead of the conventional ferrite and pearlite. Thus, the factor that had the greatest influence on the formation of martensite was the cooling rate rather than stress.

40|$|The {{avoidance}} of shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration defects {{as well as}} the control of the size and number of eutectic colonies and the tensile properties of the casting are issues of major importance in the production of lamellar <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> These defects, characteristics and properties are related to the microstructure that develops during solidification. An improved control of this features derive from our understanding of how the microstructure changes until its final state and our capacity to accurately measure such changes. The aim of this work is to enhance such understanding in <b>hypoeutectic</b> grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and provide experimental and analytical techniques to facilitate a deeper investigation of the solidification phenomena. Interrupted solidification, natural solidification, direct austempering after solidification treatment, cooling curve analysis, Fourier thermal analysis, different etching reagents, non-standard image processing techniques and stereological relations are combined {{for the first time to}} study the development of the microstructure from the beginning of the solidification to the as-cast state. Stereological relations are successfully combined with bi-dimensional observations to approximate tri-dimensional parameters of the microstructure in single or multiple sections analysis. The fundamental phenomenon of the coarsening of the primary phase (reduction of the primary austenite surface) and the increase of the secondary dendrite arm spacing are observed to occur prior, during and after the eutectic solidification in different cooling conditions. The validity of the secondary dendrite arm spacing as a measure of coarsening is assessed. The ease of flow for the interdendritic melt is characterized in terms of the hydraulic diameter of the interdendritic phase, which captures the improved flow conditions during the eutectic phase. The change of and interdependence between the inverse surface area per unit volume, secondary dendrite arm spacing, the cube root of time, solidification time, eutectic colony diameter and cooling rate {{as well as the}} change of fraction of primary austenite is presented.

That microstructures is determined by cooling rate, heat treatment and alloys. There are a lot of application of gray <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and they are needed which have high strength. So, because of that the gray <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> are added by other alloys, Copper (Cu) and Chromium (Cr) then they are gave austemper heat treatment. In this research, The Writer evaluated the effect of Chromium (Cr) and Copper (Cu) addition which have given austempered heat treatment to the microstructures and hardness of gray <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> The alloys percentage addition are 0, 5...|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> woks {{can be found}} in the market. Chinese-made <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> woks are very thin (3 mm), {{weighing}} only a little more than a carbon steel wok of similar size, while <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> woks typically produced in the West tend to be much thicker (9 mm), and very heavy. Because of the thickness of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> Western-style <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> woks take much longer to bring up to cooking temperature, and its weight also makes stir-frying and bao techniques difficult.|$|R
