5|$|In his Critique of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In his Critique of Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and <b>happiness,</b> where <b>happiness</b> arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to <b>happiness,</b> so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by <b>happiness.</b>|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and <b>happiness...</b> it's me looking at <b>happiness</b> {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the <b>happiness</b> it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing <b>happiness</b> is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

5|$|Utilitarianism {{is a type}} of consequentialist ethical theory. According to such theories, {{only the}} outcome of an action is morally {{relevant}} (this contrasts with deontology, according to which moral actions flow from duties or motives). Utilitarianism is a combination of consequentialism and the philosophical position hedonism, which states that pleasure, or <b>happiness,</b> is the only good worth pursuing. Therefore, since only the consequences of an action matter, and only <b>happiness</b> matters, only <b>happiness</b> that is the consequence of an action is morally relevant. There are similarities with preference utilitarianism, where utility is defined as individual preference rather than pleasure.|$|E

Whipple to form another bookstore and {{publishing}} business where they published The Game of Authors. Henry P. Ives continued to publish The Mansion of <b>Happiness</b> using other lithographers, including Taylor & Adams of Boston in 1864, Henry P. Ives was free to publish The Mansion Of <b>Happiness</b> and other Ives' games under his name, his brother's name, and his father's name.|$|E

5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human <b>happiness.</b> He argued that to achieve this <b>happiness,</b> humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human <b>happiness</b> and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E
5|$|Some {{arguments}} from moral order suggest that morality {{is based on}} rationality and that this can only be the case {{if there is a}} moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both <b>happiness</b> and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both <b>happiness</b> and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Utilitarians {{believe that}} an action is right if it {{produces}} the best possible state of affairs. Traditional utilitarianism treats this as a claim that people should try {{to ensure that their}} actions maximise overall <b>happiness</b> or pleasure.|$|E
5|$|W. & S. B. Ives {{published}} {{the game in}} the United States in Salem, Massachusetts on November 24, 1843. It was republished by Parker Brothers in 1894 after George S. Parker & Co. bought the rights to the Ives games. The republication claimed The Mansion of <b>Happiness</b> was the first board game published in the United States of America; today, however, the distinction is awarded to Lockwood's Traveller's Tour games of 1822. The popularity of The Mansion of <b>Happiness</b> and similar moralistic board games was challenged in the last decades of the 19th century when the focus of games became materialistic and competitive capitalistic behavior.|$|E

5|$|William and Stephen Bradshaw Ives {{dissolved}} their partnership on April 24, 1854. William {{then put}} {{most of his}} time managing his newspaper, The Salem Observer. Stephen Bradshaw held the copyrights for the games and started a fancy goods importing business in Boston while overseeing the Salem business owned by a partnership of his youngest son, Henry P. Ives, and Henry's partner, Augustus Smith at the same business location. A new Mansion Of <b>Happiness</b> print run was needed but Chandler was no longer in business, With control of the copyright, the Ives family chose lithographer F.F. Oakleys. Consequently, Ives and Smith could sell The Mansion Of <b>Happiness</b> in Salem but had no right to the copyright. F. F. Oakleys needed to two new litho stones so the eighth edition was created. One stone was used to print black and the other to print green. The circle endspace was retained. In addition to continue publishing The Mansion of <b>Happiness,</b> H. P. Ives and A. A. Weeks published at least two new games: Experts and Tournament & Knighthood.|$|E
5|$|Anne Wales Abbot was {{believed}} to be the designer of the Ives' game, The Mansion of Happines for over 145 years, from 1843 to 1989. She, however, did not design Ives The Mansion of <b>Happiness</b> but did design two other Ives' games: Dr. Busby and Master Rodbury and His Pupils.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1778, Boyle Roche married Mary Frankland of Great Thirkleby Hall, near Thirsk, Yorkshire, {{daughter}} of Admiral Sir Thomas Frankland, Bt, whose family name {{goes back to}} the time of William the Conqueror. Although childless, Boyle and Lady Mary appeared to have lived a life of uninterrupted <b>happiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Happiness</b> is {{not solely}} derived from external, {{momentary}} pleasures. Indeed, despite the popular conception that <b>happiness</b> is fleeting, {{studies suggest that}} <b>happiness</b> is actually rather stable over time.|$|E
25|$|Even when <b>happiness</b> can be {{affected}} by external sources <b>happiness</b> has high hedonic adaptation, specify some events such as an increase in income, disability, unemployment, and loss (bereavement) only have short-term (about a year) effects on a person's overall <b>happiness</b> after a while <b>happiness</b> may return to levels similar to unaffected peers.|$|E
25|$|In {{philosophy}} and (western) religion, <b>happiness</b> {{may be defined}} in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. <b>Happiness</b> in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the <b>happiness</b> of virtue to the virtue of <b>happiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2012 World <b>Happiness</b> Report {{stated that}} in {{subjective}} well-being measures, the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports. <b>Happiness</b> {{is used in}} both life evaluation, as in “How happy are you with your life as a whole?”, and in emotional reports, as in “How happy are you now?,” and people seem able to use <b>happiness</b> as appropriate in these verbal contexts. Using these measures, the World <b>Happiness</b> Report identifies the countries with {{the highest levels of}} <b>happiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neo{{classical}}, {{as well as}} classical economics, are not subsumed {{under the}} term <b>happiness</b> economics although the original goal was to increase the <b>happiness</b> of the people. Classical and neoclassical economics are stages {{in the development of}} welfare economics and are characterized by mathematical modeling. <b>Happiness</b> economics represents a radical break with this tradition. The measurement of subjective <b>happiness</b> respectively life satisfaction by means of survey research across nations and time (in addition to objective measures like lifespan, wealth, security etc.) marks the beginning of <b>happiness</b> economics.|$|E
25|$|Authentic human <b>happiness</b> for Plotinus {{consists}} of the true human identifying with that {{which is the best}} in the universe. Because <b>happiness</b> is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human <b>happiness,</b> and thus “… there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.” (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of <b>happiness</b> is one of Plotinus’ greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that eudaimonia (<b>happiness)</b> is attainable only within consciousness.|$|E
25|$|In addition, one’s {{culture may}} also {{influence}} <b>happiness</b> and overall subjective well-being. The {{overall level of}} <b>happiness</b> fluctuates from culture to culture, as does preferred expression of <b>happiness.</b> Comparing various international surveys across countries reveals that different nations, and different ethnic groups within nations, exhibit differences in average life satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Happiness</b> forms {{a central}} theme of Buddhist teachings. For {{ultimate}} freedom from suffering, the Noble Eightfold Path leads its practitioner to Nirvana, a state of everlasting peace. Ultimate <b>happiness</b> is only achieved by overcoming craving in all forms. More mundane forms of <b>happiness,</b> such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships, are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people (see sukha). Buddhism also encourages the generation of loving kindness and compassion, the desire for the <b>happiness</b> and welfare of all beings.|$|E
25|$|<b>Happiness</b> is {{typically}} measured using subjective measures – e.g. self-reported surveys – and/or objective measures. One concern {{has always been}} the accuracy and reliability of people's responses to <b>happiness</b> surveys. Objective measures such as lifespan, income, and education are often used as well as or instead of subjectively reported <b>happiness,</b> though this assumes that they generally produce <b>happiness,</b> which while plausible may not necessarily be the case. The terms quality of life or well-being are often used to encompass these more objective measures.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1960s, <b>happiness</b> {{research}} has been conducted {{in a wide variety of}} scientific disciplines, including gerontology, social psychology, clinical and medical research and <b>happiness</b> economics.|$|E
25|$|Professor Ruut Veenhoven {{showed that}} social {{security}} payments {{do not seem to}} add to <b>happiness.</b> This {{may be due to the}} fact that non-self-earned income (e.g., from a lottery) does not add to <b>happiness</b> in general either. <b>Happiness</b> may be the mind's reward to a useful action. However, Johan Norberg of CIS, a free enterprise economy think tank, presents a hypothesis that as people who think that they themselves control their lives are more happy, paternalist institutions may decrease <b>happiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Relative {{declines in}} female <b>happiness</b> have eroded a gender gap in <b>happiness</b> {{in which women}} in the 1970s {{typically}} reported higher subjective well-being than did men.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} <b>happiness</b> is {{important}} to a society is not new. Many other prominent intellectuals, philosophers and political leaders throughout history, including Aristotle, Confucius, and Plato, incorporated <b>happiness</b> into their work.|$|E
25|$|The word utility {{is used to}} mean general {{well-being}} or <b>happiness,</b> and Mill's view is that utility is {{the consequence}} of a good action. Utility, {{within the context of}} utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people really do desire <b>happiness,</b> and since each individual desires their own <b>happiness,</b> it must follow that all of us desire the <b>happiness</b> of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest <b>happiness</b> of the greatest number.|$|E
25|$|Though {{extraversion}} {{has consistently}} {{been shown to}} have a strong correlation with <b>happiness</b> and well-being, these findings are complicated by the presence of other personality traits that act as strong indicators of <b>happiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Having {{claimed that}} people do, in fact, desire <b>happiness,</b> Mill {{now has to}} show that it is the only thing they desire. Mill anticipates the {{objection}} that people desire other things such as virtue. He argues that whilst people might start desiring virtue as a means to <b>happiness,</b> eventually, it becomes part of someone's <b>happiness</b> and is then desired as an end in itself.|$|E
25|$|I {{used to say}} {{to myself}} that <b>happiness</b> and misery depend on ourselves. If you feel unhappy, raise your self above unhappiness, and so act that your <b>happiness</b> may be {{independent}} of all eventualities.|$|E
