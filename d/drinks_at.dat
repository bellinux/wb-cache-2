5|$|On all flights, {{passengers}} {{are provided with}} food and complimentary beverages on board, in both classes. The food service consists of hot meals, hot or cold snacks, or light refreshments, depending {{on the length of}} the flight and the time of the day. The choice of acquiring complementary <b>drinks</b> <b>at</b> an extra cost is available too. The airline also offers assorted menus for passengers having special meal requirements.|$|E
5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe <b>drinks</b> <b>at</b> intervals no longer than three days.|$|E

25|$|A 2010 study {{confirmed}} the beneficial effect of moderate alcohol consumption on mortality. Subjects were grouped into abstainers, light, moderate, and heavy drinkers. The order of mortality rates from lowest to highest were moderate, light, heavy, and abstainers. The {{increased risk for}} abstainers was twice the mortality rate as for moderate drinkers. This study specifically sought to control for confounding factors including the problem of ex-drinkers considered as non-drinkers. According to another study, drinkers with heavy drinking occasions (six or more <b>drinks</b> <b>at</b> a time) have a 57% higher all-cause mortality than drinkers without heavy drinking occasions.|$|E
25|$|Writer Jack Olsen {{had earlier}} {{advanced}} a similar theory {{in his book}} The Bridge at Chappaquiddick, published early in 1970. Olsen's book was the first full-length examination of the case.

Olsen wrote that Kopechne normally drove a smaller Volkswagen model car, which was much lighter and easier to handle than Kennedy's larger Oldsmobile.|$|E

25|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} The Machine reemerged in August 2013, when sororities and fraternities were mobilized {{to elect}} two former SGA presidents, Cason Kirby and Lee Garrison, in closely contested municipal school board races. Before election day, questions about illegal voter registration were raised when evidence emerged that indicated eleven fraternity members fraudulently {{claimed to be}} living in a single house in one district. And on election day, leaked emails suggested that sorority/fraternity members may have been provided incentives to vote—including free <b>drinks</b> <b>at</b> local bars. As a result of possible voter fraud, Kirby's opponent filed a lawsuit challenging the election results and University of Alabama faculty have questioned whether The Machine has corrupted the democratic process in the City of Tuscaloosa.|$|E
25|$|Using {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} her first three restaurants, Murphy invested one million dollars into the construction of her largest Candlelight restaurant in affluent Westchester County. Built on ten acres of land in Yonkers, with award-winning gardens a large parking lot and an artificial lake, the Westchester Candlelight was said to be the largest restaurant in the East. It seated almost a thousand customers while nearly as many were often waiting for tables. Serving was continuous, and 10,000 customers sometimes ate at the restaurant on a single day, according to Murphy. Engineered to maximize sales, the Westchester Candlelight invited diners enduring long waits to stroll its extensive gardens, browse at a gift shop featuring Patricia Murphy-branded fragrances, and buy <b>drinks</b> <b>at</b> the bar or flowers in the greenhouses. Charter buses from upstate New York and Pennsylvania arrived regularly with tour groups.|$|E
25|$|Utah's laws {{in regard}} to alcohol, tobacco and {{gambling}} are strict. Utah is an alcoholic beverage control state. The Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control regulates the sale of alcohol; wine and spirituous liquors may only be purchased at state liquor stores, and local laws may prohibit the sale of beer and other alcoholic beverages on Sundays. The state bans the sale of fruity alcoholic <b>drinks</b> <b>at</b> grocery stores and convenience stores. The law states that such drinks must now have new state-approved labels {{on the front of}} the products that contain capitalized letters in bold type telling consumers the drinks contain alcohol and at what percentage. The Utah Indoor Clean Air Act is a statewide smoking ban, that prohibits smoking in many public places. Utah is one of few states to set a smoking age of 19, as opposed to 18, as in most other states.|$|E

25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned <b>drinks</b> <b>at</b> each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
