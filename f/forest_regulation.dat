Reports have suggested that there are links between these poaching activities and funding of terrorist organizations.

The details of the new management system were spelled out in the <b>Forest</b> <b>Regulation</b> of 1883. When de Vasselot left the Cape in 1891, the forests of George, Knysna and the Tsitsikamma were being managed on a scientific basis. Two important publications by de Vasselot in 1885 were an [...] "Introduction to the Systematic Treatment of the Crown Forests of the Cape Colony" [...] and a pamphlet on [...] "Selection and Seasoning of Wood", both translated into English by the then Conservator of Transkeian Forests, A.

40|$|The article {{sheds light}} on {{introduction}} and content of <b>Forest</b> <b>Regulation</b> (1861). The idea of producing new <b>Forest</b> <b>Regulation</b> which would replace the existing act regulating same matter, introduced in 1857, came out {{as a result of}} people's discontent with limited opportunities for wood-cutting. The Committee for requests and proposals of so-called Saint Andrew's Day Assembly (1858), on which prince Alexander Karađorđević (1842 - 1858) had been dethroned and ex-prince Miloš Obrenović (1815 - 1839) reinstated to the throne, designed directives on which new forest legislation should have been based. Relying on these directives, in 1859 an unknown author made a Draft <b>Forest</b> <b>Regulation</b> consisting of 43 articles. In January 1861, the Draft was revised and supplemented by a three-membered committee formed by the State Council in the very end of 1860. The Council slightly altered the revised draft. Prince Mihailo Obrenović approved the text and it was enacted as <b>Forest</b> <b>Regulation</b> in 1861. In comparison with previous <b>Forest</b> <b>Regulation,</b> the act passed in 1861 was more liberal towards wood-cutting. Taxes on wood-cutting for economic purpose were lowered. Instead of Ministry of finances, district office was now competent to approve cutting wood for fodder. As a local authority, much more familiar with its fellow-inhabitants, district office was more likely to fulfill their exaggered wishes to destroy woods for above-mentioned purpose. The scope of population having right to be awarded piece of land with forest in order to broaden their insuficient landed property was widened. The reason for this step-back in forest protection in Serbia was obvious. New dinasty had to present itself as better than precedent government.

40|$|The article {{sheds light}} on several data about {{application}} of <b>Forests</b> <b>Regulation</b> (1857) and its amendments. <b>Forests</b> <b>Regulation</b> was aimed to procure better protection of Serbian woods, prescribing restrictive conditions under which deforestation was allowed and the obligation to dismantle illegal enclosures. None of the two aims was turned into reality. In an attempt to broaden their lands, people were persistant in prohibited wood-cutting. Deforestation culminated in 1859, {{for the reason that}} due to a dynastic change new government was still unable to acquire authority. Plus, the Government was unsure about people not resisting to destruction of enclosures and was thus compelled to tacitly legalize illegaly occupied lands. Formally at the initiative of state bodies, but practically at the insistance of people, the Regulation was amended three times. Firstly, the procedure according to which a piece of land is attributed to the poor was significantly simplified. Tax for wood-cutting permits was reduced to a great extent. Alterations regarding enclosure dismantling largely relativized the Regulation's provions in terms of that matter. The Regulation was doomed to failure due to three major factors. People had no consciousness about importance of forests and considered them self-regenerative. However, the authorities tasked with protection of woods were not any better either. On many occasions, they silently approved wood-cutting. Moreover, village and county-chiefs were not rarely actively engaged as accomplices in that crime...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate {{the consequences of the}} use of yield and growth estimates from different prediction yield and growth models in a Linear Programming model applied to <b>forest</b> <b>regulation.</b> Thus, using data of continuous forest inventory, the yield estimation in future volume was obtained using a yield model based on age, another one based on age and site index, and a third model that used age and site index besides density, which was represented by the basal area per hectare. Also a model based on data of continuous forest inventory which uses data of volume on a period of time to make linear projections of yield for the next period was tested. Next, a simplified <b>forest</b> <b>regulation</b> problem was proposed and solved by the model I by means of Linear Programming, using data from the four volume prediction models. At the end, the conclusion was: a) that models of <b>forest</b> <b>regulation,</b> supplied with estimates from different yield models, when solved by Linear Programming, result in different ways of treating the forests; b) that the matrix of technological coefficients, supplied with different yield data and for a same objective function affects in a significant way the decision making process...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study aims {{to assess}} the {{cooperative}} regulation process of forestry producers {{in comparison to the}} traditional individual regulation of properties. Twenty (20) forest properties are studied as examples of the development of three <b>forest</b> <b>regulation</b> scenarios: 1) individual regulation, 2) group regulation, and 3) cooperative regulation. The Net Present Value (NPV) of each of the scenarios is optimized according to mathematical programming models and compared to a baseline scenario without <b>forest</b> <b>regulation.</b> According to the proposed cooperative regulation, properties had a proportion factor for annual net revenue distribution calculated from results of the baseline scenario. By comparing the NPV maximization results from scenarios 1 and 3 with the non-regulation scenario, the cost for individual regulation is on average 25 %, while being only 11 % for cooperative regulation, that is, a 14 % reduction in property regulation costs. Additionally, cooperative regulation had the advantage of dividing properties into fewer areas when compared to individual regulation...|$|E
