I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
25|$|Argon ionises at 15.76eV, {{which is}} higher than hydrogen, but lower than helium, neon or fluorine. Molecules {{containing}} argon can be van der Waals molecules held together very weakly by London dispersion forces. Ionic molecules can be bound by charge induced dipole interactions. With gold atoms there can be some covalent interaction. Experimental methods used to study argon compounds have included inert gas matrices, infrared spectroscopy to study stretching and bending movements, microwave spectroscopy and far infrared to study rotation, and also visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy to study different electronic configurations including excimers. Mass spectroscopy is used to study ions. Computation methods {{have been used to}} theoretically compute molecule parameters, and predict new stable molecules. Computational ab initio methods used have included CCSD(T), MP2 (Møller–Plesset perturbation theory of the second order), CIS and CISD. For heavy atoms, effective core potentials are used to model the inner electrons, so that their contributions {{do not have to be}} individually computed. More powerful computers since the 1990s have made this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> silico study much more popular, being much less risky and simpler than an actual experiment. This article is mostly based on experimental or observational results.|$|E

[...] "I will say that I was proud of the material, but maybe it's not the best version of Diamond Rio," [...] Olander told the publication. [...] "We were <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> a no-man's land. We didn't fit in with country radio and we didn't fit with Christian radio. It was something that wasn't fully realized."

500|$|Hundreds {{of musicians}} have been {{inspired}} by the album. Pianist Lafayette Gilchrist states that Money Jungle was the first jazz album that he bought, and that it [...] "sounds like an orchestra being played by a trio. I was inspired to make something [...] big and grandiose just like that". Drummer Jeff [...] "Tain" [...] Watts observed that the members of the trio were [...] "doing their thing, but they’re together", and compares this with later groups led by Keith Jarrett and Wayne Shorter, stating that the later groups [...] "have a much freer way of doing it, but everybody's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> their own zone and yet they’re [...] definitely [...] playing [...] the [...] composition in tune with each other, just like Duke and Max and Mingus were doing on Money Jungle." [...] Trumpeter Miles Davis had a different view of the session: in a 1964 Down Beat blind listening test, he criticised the record company for putting the three musicians together, saying that [...] "Max and Mingus can play together, by themselves. Mingus is a hell of a bass player, and Max is a hell of a drummer. But Duke can't play with them, and they can't play with Duke." ...|$|E

In his 8.5 out of 10 rating review, Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode was an exceptional showing for the series, adding that it told [...] "a compelling, intense story within its hour" [...] albeit averting from the comics. As Michelle Kung of The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "The first season of The Walking Dead doesn’t exactly end on an optimistic note, but our heroes are left driving into the unknown after escaping certain death at the CDC." [...] Kurt Christenson of New York Daily News analyzed that [...] "almost and everyone's still <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> the dark", and Kelly stated that [...] "TS-19" [...] came to an [...] "abrupt, explosive end". Salon journalist Simon Abrams concluded that the frenetic pace of The Walking Dead was relatable, while Paste television commentator Josh Jackson was keen of the character development in the episode {{as well as the}} varying political themes covered; [...] "After six episodes, the characters are worth caring about. Despite occasional stilted monologues, quick tempers and unfortunate stereotypes, the few living souls in The Walking Dead are a bigger draw than the undead. The show has spent more time on topics like marriage, parenthood, unfaithfulness, loss, domestic violence, gender roles, small-scale politics, loyalty, kindness than it has with kill shots. By filling the world with zombies, Frank Darabont is able to explore the human condition under extreme circumstances." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson was entertained by [...] "TS-19", and asserted that the conclusion [...] "resonated over images of Rick & Co. U-turning into the great unknown, we got the sense that {{as long as they were}} alive, at least there was a chance of a tomorrow." [...] Writing for the same publication, Jeff Jensen was intrigued at how producers approached the themes of the comics, and later noted that it was proof that they were using the comics as a route for thematic inspiration in lieu of a literal interpretation. For Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre, [...] "Tonight's finale [...] did yield much insight, though, into the nature of the plague itself, in relative terms anyway." ...|$|E

[...] Montag addressed the issue by stating [...] "I love it. I'm a very sexual person and I'm married, so it's okay. I think every woman ... has an alter ego. We all have that really sexual, fun side. I just thought the lyrics were so fun and so sexy. They empower women. That song, when my friends hear it, they feel sexier. They have more fun, because the song is like, 'I'll do whatever you want, but I'm still <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> charge here.' The lyrics are definitely a little edgy - and I'm sorry to the little girls - but I am married. Eat the panties off when you're married." ...|$|E
2500|$|The pair bottled {{their first}} vintage Cabernet Sauvignon in 1972, aging the {{wine in the}} old Keig Dairy barn on the {{original}} plot of land Duncan purchased. They {{made the decision to}} produce only Cabernet Sauvignon and to attempt to produce the finest in the world, to age the wine exclusively in American oak barrels. Meyer said of the reason for deciding to concentrate on one wine, [...] "it was kind of a reaction to my days at Christian Brothers, where we made so many wines it was hard to do them all right, and it was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> keeping with what I thought — that Cabernets were what Napa and Sonoma did best, so why not devote our attention to that. This is a pretty common concept in France." [...] According to noted wine critic Robert Parker, Meyer always believed in harvesting ripe, physiologically mature fruit. In {{answer to the question of}} why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only thing I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak. I like tannic wine about as much as I like tough steak." ...|$|E

Fans who purchased the EP through the iTunes Store were able to apply it towards the purchase of their full-length debut album. The EP drew the attention of organizers of March's South by Southwest festival, as well as executives looking to license music for upcoming season finales of television series. Columbia senior director of creative licensing Jonathan Palmer said, [...] "The plan helped {{us a great deal}} to set up more opportunities rather than chasing the release date. So by the time we put the record out in May, we had already placed several songs." [...] Half of Torches songs were licensed—among them are: [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] (Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, Friends with Benefits, Entourage), [...] "Houdini" [...] (Gossip Girl); [...] "Helena Beat" [...] (The Vampire Diaries); [...] "Don't Stop (Color on the Walls)" [...] (Suits, Nissan Motors commercial); and [...] "Call It What You Want" [...] (FIFA 12). Palmer commented, [...] "I haven't seen this kind of a range of song licenses from one album since we worked the first Ting Tings record three-and-a-half years ago.
