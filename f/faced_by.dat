5|$|One theory interprets Putana {{as being}} the first foe <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> Krishna (further {{numerous}} demons are sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna) or as the first obstacle of possessive maternal instinct <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> yogis. The legend assures a devotee liberation if they treat god as their own son. Another theory interprets Putana as an infantile disease that Krishna survived, which can be cured by forcefully suckling the child affected. Further, the theory relates to Krishna's later life when he fights a demon called Jvara (fever).|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact {{version of}} the LFI. She defends the {{distinction}} between doing and allowing harm, and then defends the idea that humans have different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's approach {{is the fact that}} humans are causally responsible for the hardship <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> some animals, but not the hardship <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> others. She then deploys this philosophy in a number of imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need. She closes the book by considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves.|$|E

5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E

The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E
5|$|At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines {{had control}} {{of most of}} Italy, North Africa, and a small {{foothold}} in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and {{setting the stage for}} the early Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.|$|E
5|$|Based on the Virata Parva of the Indian epic Mahabharata, Nartanasala {{focused on}} the trails of the Pandavas {{in the last year}} of their exile.
