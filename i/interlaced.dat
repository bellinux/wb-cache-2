40|$|Through {{a series}} of papers in the 1980 's, Bouchet {{introduced}} isotropic systems and the Tutte-Martin polynomial of an isotropic system. Then, Arratia, Bollobás, and Sorkin developed the <b>interlace</b> polynomial of a graph in [ABS 00] {{in response to a}} DNA sequencing application. The <b>interlace</b> polynomial has generated considerable recent attention, with new results including realizing the original <b>interlace</b> polynomial by a closed form generating function expression instead of by the original recursive definition (see Aigner and van der Holst [AvdH 04], and Arratia, Bollobás, and Sorkin [ABS 04 b]). Now, Bouchet [Bou 05] recognizes the vertex-nullity <b>interlace</b> polynomial of a graph as the Tutte-Martin polynomial of an associated isotropic system. This suggests that the machinery of isotropic systems may be well-suited to investigating properties of the <b>interlace</b> polynomial. Thus, we present here an alternative proof for the closed form presentation of the vertex-nullity <b>interlace</b> polynomial using the machinery of isotropic systems. This approach both illustrates the intimate connection between the vertex-nullity <b>interlace</b> polynomial and the Tutte-Martin polynomial of an isotropic system and also provides a concrete example of manipulating isotropic systems.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>interlace</b> polynomials extend in {{a natural}} way to invariants of graphs with vertex-weights, and these {{weighted}} <b>interlace</b> polynomials have several novel properties. One novel property is {{a version of the}} fundamental three-term formula q(G) = q(G − a) + q(G ab − b) + ((x − 1) 2 − 1) q(G ab − a − b) that lacks the last term; consequently the use of vertex-weights allows for <b>interlace</b> polynomial calculations represented by strictly binary computation trees rather than mixed binary-ternary computation trees. An intuitively pleasing property is that graphs which can be constructed through graph substitutions have vertex-weighted <b>interlace</b> polynomials which can be obtained through algebraic substitutions. Three other novel properties are weighted pendanttwin reductions, which involve removing certain kinds of vertices from a graph and adjusting the weights of the remaining vertices {{in such a way that}} the <b>interlace</b> polynomials are unchanged; these reductions allow for smaller computation trees as they eliminate some branches. If a graph can be completely analyzed using pendant-twin reductions then its <b>interlace</b> polynomial can be calculated in polynomial time, in a manner analogous to the calculation of the cumulative resistance of a collection of resistors wired in series and parallel. Vertex-weighted <b>interlace</b> polynomials also give a combinatorial description of the <b>interlace</b> polynomials of forests and trees, and they directly yield the Jones polynomials of classical links. 1...|$|R

5|$|For the box set release, Quatermass and the Pit was {{extensively}} restored. A {{process called}} VidFIRE {{was applied to}} all of the scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid <b>interlaced</b> video look they would have had on transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process. For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35mm film inserts still existed, as they had been spliced into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and in a few cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.|$|E
