5000|$|Farmers' {{markets can}} offer farmers {{increased}} profit over selling to wholesalers, <b>food</b> <b>processors,</b> <b>or</b> large grocery firms. By selling directly to consumers, produce often needs less transport, less handling, less refrigeration {{and less time}} in storage. By selling in an outdoor market, the cost of land, buildings, lighting and air-conditioning is also reduced or eliminated. Farmers may also retain profit on produce not sold to consumers, by selling the excess to canneries and other food-processing firms. At the market, farmers can retain the full premium for part of their produce, instead of only a processor's wholesale price for the entire lot. However, other economists say [...] "there are relatively few benefits in terms of energy efficiency, quality or cost ... fun though they are, are not good economic models." ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Food</b> <b>processors</b> {{are similar}} to blenders in many forms. The primary {{difference}} is that <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> use interchangeable blades and disks (attachments) rather than a fixed blade. Also, their bowls are wider and shorter, a more proper shape for the solid or semi-solid foods usually worked in a <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> Usually, little <b>or</b> no liquid is required {{in the operation of}} the <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> unlike a blender, which requires a certain amount of liquid for the particles to move around the blade.|$|R

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{case-control study}} of paternal occupation as {{a risk factor}} for Down syndrome was conducted. With the use of the British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry, 1, 008 cases of live-born Down syndrome were identified for the period 1952 - 73. Two controls were matched to each case by using the birth files of British Columbia. Paternal occupation was obtained from the birth notice. Elevated maternal age-adjusted relative risks of Down syndrome were found for fathers employed as janitors (odds ratio [OR] = 3. 26; 95 % confidence interval [C. I. ] = 1. 02 - 10. 44); mechanics (OR = 3. 27; C. I. = 1. 57 - 6. 80); farm managers/workers (OR = 2. 03; C. I. = 1. 25 - 3. 03); material-moving equipment operators (OR = 1. 88; C.

5000|$|The {{shortening}} method, {{also known}} as the biscuit method, is used for biscuits and scones. This method cuts solid fat (whether lard, butter, or vegetable shortening) into flour and other dry ingredients using a <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> pastry blender, <b>or</b> two hand-held forks. The layering from this process gives rise and adds flakiness as the folds of fat melt during baking. This technique is said to produce [...] "shortened" [...] cakes and breads, {{regardless of whether or not}} the chosen fat is vegetable shortening.|$|R
5|$|Myriad {{additional}} ingredients can be used, including onion, {{roasted red}} bell pepper, {{red and green}} chili peppers, cilantro, lime, lime juice and lime zest, lemon juice, sour cream, oil, lard, vinegar and apple cider vinegar, water, and spices such as garlic, cumin, coriander, chili powder and cayenne, hot sauce, salt and pepper. The various ingredients can be mixed or puréed together using a <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> a blender, <b>or</b> by hand. Bean dip is sometimes topped with shredded cheese and garnished with ingredients such as chopped cilantro, chopped green onion, chopped fresh or dried parsley and lime zest, among others.|$|R
50|$|Mincing is a food {{preparation}} technique in which food ingredients are finely divided into uniform pieces.

50|$|Emulsified {{sausages}} {{are cooked}} sausages {{with a very}} fine texture, using the combination of pork, beef, or poultry with fat, salt, cure, flavorings, and water. These ingredients are emulsified at high speed in a <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> blender. During this process, the salt dissolves the muscle proteins, which helps to suspend the fat molecules. Temperature {{is an important part}} of the process: if the temperature rises above 60°F (16°C) for pork or 70°F (21°C) for beef, the emulsion will not hold and fat will leak from the sausage during the cooking process.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{public perceptions}} {{of food safety}} using a national survey conducted in November 2006, soon after the September 2006 nationwide spinach recall. We explore relationships between peoples’ perceived risks of food contamination (spinach in this case) and their trust in the institutions in charge of safeguarding/ensuring safety. Finally, we examine relationships between individual observance of basic good food handling practices and food safety. Trust in institutions through which food passes and regulatory agencies were shown to be critical in determining food safety perceptions. For example, confidence in the USDA as a regulatory agent was viewed positively, and hence contributed toward viewing the four types of spinach as safe for consumption. Conversely, skepticism with which the public views <b>food</b> corporations (<b>processors,</b> transporters, <b>or</b> retailers) impacted food safety perceptions negatively. food recalls, food safety, public perceptions, spinach, Agribusiness, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

The Chanels still don't {{know what to do with}} Chanel #2 (Ariana Grande)'s body, and are worried that they will be blamed if someone finds it. Chanel #3 (Billie Lourd) and Chanel #5 (Abigail Breslin) propose to feed the body to pigs. Then, Hester (Lea Michele) walks in and suggests to put her in a <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> to bone her, disturbing the others with her obsession with death. Chanel rejects all the ideas and decides to put the body in the same freezer where they put Ms. Bean (Jan Hoag)'s body. Hester promises to keep the secret of Number 2's death only if she can call Chanel [...] "Mom". Grace (Skyler Samuels) is in the house basement, where she finds a mysterious locked door and tries to open it but Chanel #5 catches her and says that only Chanel has the key to that door. Grace tells Pete (Diego Boneta) about the secret door, who says that people have been said for years that the Kappa house has a really dark secret. This makes him think that Dean Cathy Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis)'s office may have some archives that can explain that secret, so they both think at the same time that they will have to break in. They start kissing passionately but Grace stops him, saying that they can't kiss if there is a killer on the campus of Wallace University. They both agree that she will break into that secret door at Kappa house and he will break into the dean's office.|$|E
40|$|Die Arbeit behandelt den Einfluss der Amerikanisierung und Verwestlichung auf den Bereich des Kochens, der Küchenausstattung, des Lebensmittelkonsums und des -einkaufs in der Zeit von 1945 bis 1970. Schon bevor sie zur Weltmacht aufstiegen, waren die USA ein Pionier auf dem Gebiet der Konsum-Moderne. Vor allem während der zehnjährigen Besatzungszeit kamen die Österreicher/innen mit dem ‚American Way of Life‘ in Kontakt. Obwohl eine ambivalente Stimmung gegenüber dem Amerikanischen bestand, überwogen Assoziationen mit materiellem Wohlstand, Unabhängigkeit und neuen technischen Errungenschaften, die das Leben vereinfachten. Der Marshallplan nährte nicht nur die ohnehin schon starke anti-kommunistische Einstellung in Österreich, er festigte die ökonomische und politische Integration des Landes in den Westen, wodurch die Österreicher/innen diesem auch kulturell näher kamen. Im Ernährungsbereich stand „amerikanisch“ zunächst für andersartig und modern, zunehmend aber auch für rasch zubereitet, effizient und gesund. Auch in der Küchenausstattung erlangten rationelle Kriterien zunehmende Bedeutung, sodass der Konsum moderner Haushaltsgeräte in den 60 ern deutlich anstieg. Schließlich adaptierte man auch das Einkaufssystem an das amerikanische Modell der Selbstbedienung, da es ökonomische Vorteile gegenüber dem altbekannten Greißler bot. Der Einfluss Amerikas bzw. des Westens zeigte sich auch in der Werbung. Die Analyse von 28 ausgewählten Plakatwerbungen aus dem behandelten Zeitraum ergab, dass Anglizismen neben der Betonung von Modernität, Zeit- und Aufwandsersparnis zu den am häufigsten vorkommenden Merkmalen zählten. Als weitere Anzeichen der Amerikanisierung/Verwestlichung konnten der Ausdruck von Wohlstand, Exotik (besonders in Getränkewerbungen), technischer Fortschritt und moderne Marketingstrategien beobachtet werden, wohingegen die oft mit Amerika assoziierte Lockerheit, Freiheit und Unabhängigkeit kaum inkludiert wurden. This diploma thesis {{examines}} the western – {{in particular the}} American – influence on the area of cooking and food consumption in Austria from 1945 to 1970. The system of mass production and consumption was established in Austria a few decades later than in the US, {{which is why the}} United States were often seen as a role model in terms of efficiency, marketing and technical progress. After the crisis caused by World War 2 America represented modernity in all respects. The Austrians welcomed the American consumption style as it promised them material wealth, freedom, peace and a better life. They came in contact with the American way of life mainly through the GIs during the period of occupation from 1945 to 1955 as well as through the media. Austria’s political and economic integration into the western world has contributed significantly to the social and cultural changes that took place during the postwar period. Whereas in the forties and early fifties, American food was perceived as novel and modern, this notion was gradually extended to rapidly and easily prepared and healthy. The generally increasing importance of speed and rationality also became visible in the household through kitchen appliances and electrical devices such as refrigerator, <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> blender, which made cooking and storing a lot easier. Another field that was influenced was the system of shopping. The model of self-service facilitated grocery shopping on the grounds that most products were available at the same place. Additionally, this system proved to be economically beneficial since shop assistants who served customers were no longer necessary. In the later chapters billboards from the postwar period are analyzed in order to identify signs of the American or western influence. Many of the advertisements show the linguistic influence by using Anglicisms, whereas others clearly emphasize the rapid and convenient cooking of the products. Also the aspects of modernity and technical progress are stressed in some advertisements...|$|E
