The generalized parton distributions (GPDs) related to this latter process being replaced by new non perturbative hadronic matrix elements, the transition distribution amplitudes (TDAs) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{distinction}} between individual and communal aspects {{of social capital}} is introduced, and their roles in production explored. Contacts are required to transact. contact formation and replacement are mediated by either market institutions or, less efficiently, by informal networks. Replacement of contacts is part of Schumpeterian creative destruction, leading to technological progress but with a negative externality. For output to increase, a "fundamental transformation" from informal to formal contact creation institutions is required. This may be blocked if political elite interests are threatened by the externality. Growth experiences in transition and developing countries are interpreted in this <b>frameword.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} general {{framework}} for constructing natural consequence relations for paraconsistent and plausible nonmonotonic reasoning. The framework {{is based on}} preferential systems whose preferences {{are based on the}} satisfaction of formulas in models. We show that these natural preferential systems that were originally designed for paraconsistent reasoning fulfill a key condition (stopperedness or smoothness) from the theoretical research of nonmonotonic reasoning. Consequently, the nonmonotonic consequence relations that they induce fulfill the desired conditions of plausible consequence relations. Hence our <b>frameword</b> encompasses different types of preferential systems that were developed from different motivations of paraconsistent reasoning and non-monotonic reasoning, and reveals an important link between them. ...|$|E
40|$|Natural resource-based {{communities}} are often theoretically {{assumed to be}} vulnerable to {{the negative effects of}} environmental and social change. Such {{communities are}} also seen as being especially vulnerable to risks and disasters. Disaster research perspectives echo this in their emphasis on environmental and social vulnerability. Also, theories of risk largely fail to illuminate comunity level experiences. To address this gap, a community-based approach is advanced that incorporates vulnerability, risk percaption, and the capacity for local action in a <b>frameword</b> forundertstanding comunity response to risk. Th intersection of an interactional theory of comunity and perspectives from risk and disaster research is explored in the context of natural resource-based communiie...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show whether {{international}} policy coordination may be the best response to economic interdependence. We will study the short-run interactions taking pla ce among interdependent economies, where monetary supply is the instrument used to maintain output and price targets. We develop a macroeconomic model in which countries show different preferences regarding objectives and face asymmetric disturbances, analyzing in strategic terms how nonetary policy can deal with real, monetary, adn supply shocks. We also show how the superiority of the cooperative solution depends on the sources of the disturbances, the underlying economic <b>frameword,</b> and the asymmetry of the preferences. Interdependence, asymmetric shocks, coordination of monetary policies. ...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates how {{individual}} policy actors {{can influence}} policy making and become catalysis of change. Its main proposition is that actors who heavily influence policy making and become agents for change are necessarily involved in specific activities and demonstrate particular characteristics. The study employs {{the concept of}} 'policy entrepreneurship' to analyse an episode of policy making which occurred in Australia between 1992 and 1994. The study concludes that in performing certain functions policy entrepreneurs help to affect change, but in doing so are at once constrained and enabled by contextual forces. Based {{on the findings of}} the analysis a theoretical <b>frameword</b> of policy entrepreneurship is developed which augments existing conceptions of policy entrepreneurship...|$|E
40|$|According to the Water <b>Frameword</b> Directive the {{classification}} of water bodies environmental quality and the achievement of “good status” by 2015 are requested for all the European aquatic environment, including transitional waters such as coastal lagoons. Although progresses have been done and many results have been achieved, several aspects of the WFD implementation can be further improved and current limitations are more evident for some categories of water bodies such as coastal lagoons. Accordingly, the E-QUALITY tool was developed with the main aim of enabling the environmental quality assessment of transitional waters, with a particular focus on lagoons, and supporting public authorities responsible {{for the implementation of}} the WFD with the development of management scenarios useful for the definition of new policies on water quality. The tool integrates a geodatabase and GIS functionalities and is accessible through user friendly interfaces. It implements a methodology based on a Weight of Evidence approach which integrates data from five Lines of Evidence (LOE), i. e. Biology, Chemistry, Physico-chemistry, Ecotoxicology, and Hydromorphology. The paper describes the main characteristics of the E-QUALITY tool and the result of the application to the whole Lagoon of Venice based on the use of data collected by several monitoring campaigns from the late 80 ’s. The final output showed that the water bodies located {{in the northern part of}} the lagoon and in the part closest to the sea exhibit a dominance of High/Good quality classes, while the water bodies close to the industrial area and the historical city are more frequently characterized by Poor/Bad quality classes. Accordingly, industrial, agricultural as well as urban discharges of chemicals were identified as the main drivers of low quality...|$|E
