50|$|Bourseul {{was born}} in Brussels, Belgium, {{and grew up in}} Douai, France. His father was a French army officer. Charles worked for the {{telegraph}} company as a civil engineer and mechanic. He made improvements to the telegraph system of L. F. Breguet (a French instrument maker) and Samuel F. B. Morse. Charles Bourseul experimented with the electrical transmission of the human voice and developed an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>microphone,</b> but his telephone receiver was unable to convert electric current back into clear human voice sounds.|$|E
5000|$|An {{analog signal}} is any {{continuous}} signal {{for which the}} time varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., analogous to another time varying signal. For example, in an analog audio signal, the instantaneous voltage of the signal varies continuously with {{the pressure of the}} sound waves. It differs from a digital signal, in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of discrete values which can only take on one of a finite number of values. [...] The term analog signal usually refers to electrical signals; however, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, human speech, and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals. An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an aneroid barometer uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information. In an electrical signal, the voltage, current, or frequency of the signal may be varied to represent the information. Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal; often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena, such as sound, light, temperature, position, or pressure. The physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a transducer. For example, in sound recording, fluctuations in air pressure (that is to say, sound) strike the diaphragm of a microphone which induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>microphone,</b> or the voltage produced by a condenser microphone. The voltage or the current is said to be an [...] "analog" [...] of the sound.|$|E

In practice an analog signal is subject to electronic noise and distortion introduced by communication channels and signal processing operations, which can progressively degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In contrast, digital signals have a finite resolution. Converting an analog signal to digital form introduces a constant low-level noise called quantization noise into the signal which determines the noise floor, but once in digital form the signal can in general be processed or transmitted without introducing additional noise or distortion. In analog systems, it is difficult to detect when such degradation occurs. However, in digital systems, degradation can not only be detected but corrected as well.|$|E

50|$|A ribbon microphone, {{also known}} as a ribbon {{velocity}} microphone, is a type of microphone that uses a thin aluminum, duraluminum or nanofilm of electrically conductive ribbon placed between the poles of a magnet to produce a voltage by <b>electromagnetic</b> induction. Ribbon <b>microphones</b> are typically bidirectional, meaning that they pick up sounds equally well from either side of the microphone.|$|R
50|$|Many {{microphones}} {{operate at}} low voltage levels and some with high output impedance (hi-Z), which makes long microphone cables especially susceptible to <b>electromagnetic</b> interference. <b>Microphone</b> interconnections are therefore {{a common application}} for a balanced interconnection, which cancels out most of this induced noise. If the power amplifiers of a public address system are located at any distance from the mixing console, it is also normal to use balanced lines for the signal paths from the mixer to these amplifiers. Many other components, such as graphic equalizers and effects units, have balanced inputs and outputs to allow this. In recording and for short cable runs in general, a compromise is necessary between the noise reduction given by balanced lines and the cost introduced by the extra circuitry they require.|$|R
