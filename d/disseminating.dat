Fluconazole was compared with the combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine for preventive, early, and late treatment of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis, depending on the model. Fluconazole was most effective when used for preventive or early treatment of acute and subacute <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. When compared with the combination of amphoteri-cin B plus flucytosine, fluconazole was similarly effective in early treatment of acute and sub-acute <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. When treatment was delayed 6 days after established infection, fluconazole was less active in clearing tissues in comparison with its activity in preventive and early treatment. The combination of amphotericin B plus flucytosine, however,was significantly more active than fluconazole in treatment of chronic <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis in all tissues. In summary, fluconazole was most effective against <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis in persistently granulocytopenic rabbits when used for prevention or early treatment. <b>Disseminated</b> candidiasis {{is the most common}} systemic fun...|$|R

SCH- 39304 was an effective as amphotericin B alone and fluconazole alone {{for the prevention of}} <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. SCH- 39304 alone and fluconazole alone were as effective as amphotericin B plus flucytosine for early treatment of subacute <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. When treatment was delayed for 5 days to establish chronic <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis, SCH- 39304 was less effective than amphotericin B plus flucytosine. In comparison with different treatment regimens, SCH- 39304 was more effective in early and preventive treatment. Thus, SCH- 39304 was comparable to treatment control regimens in prevention and early treatment of subacute <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis.

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of extrapulmonary and <b>disseminated</b> tuberculosis (TB) cases is increasing worldwide, and this growth significantly impacts TB-related morbidity and mortality. Little {{is known about}} the host risk factors for extrapulmonary and <b>disseminated</b> TB. In this study, we examined those risk factors. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all TB cases admitted to Sultan Qaboos University Hospital from 2006 to 2015. We compared extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) cases with pulmonary and <b>disseminated</b> TB cases. We evaluated the risk factors associated with the development of extrapulmonary and <b>disseminated</b> TB using logistic regression analysis. Results: We reviewed 260 TB cases, of which EPTB comprised 37 %, PTB comprised 53 %, and <b>disseminated</b> TB comprised 10 %. The most common sites of infection in the EPTB group were the lymph nodes and the abdomen. <b>Disseminated</b> TB and TB meningitis were more common in expatriates than in Omanis. Patients with EPTB were less likely to smoke compared to a patient with PTB. Patients with <b>disseminated</b> TB had a higher mortality when compared to patients with EPTB (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0. 004; 95 % confidence intervals [CI]: 0. 001 – 0. 054;P = 0. 001) and PTB (adjusted OR, 0. 022; 95 % CI: 0. 004 – 0. 115;P = 0. 001). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was the main risk factor for patients with <b>disseminated</b> TB when compared to patients with extrapulmonary and PTB. Conclusion: The rates of extrapulmonary and <b>disseminated</b> TB in Oman are higher than what has been recognized. Expatriates, patients with HIV, and smokers are at high risk for <b>disseminated</b> TB. In these patients, suspected extrapulmonary sites should be evaluated and sampled to exclude <b>disseminated</b> TB...|$|R

5|$|Infection with {{smallpox}} {{is focused}} in small blood vessels {{of the skin}} and in the mouth and throat before <b>disseminating.</b> In the skin it results in a characteristic maculopapular rash and, later, raised fluid-filled blisters. V. major produced a more serious disease and had an overall mortality rate of 30–35 percent. V. minor caused a milder form of disease (also known as alastrim) which killed about 1 percent of those it infects. Long-term complications of V. major infection included characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65–85 percent of survivors. Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis were less common complications, seen in about 2–5 percent of cases.|$|E

40|$|Candidiasis {{is defined}} as an {{infection}} or disease caused by a fungus of the genus Candida. Rate of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis increases {{with the growth of}} the number of immunocompromised patients. In the the last few decades the incidence of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis is in growth as well as the mortality rate. The aim of this survey is to show the importance of serological tests implemenation in <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis diagnose. This is a prospective study involving 60 patients with malign diseases with and without clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis and 30 healthy people who represent the control group. Apart from hemoculture, detection of circulating mannan antigen and adequate antibodies of Candida species applying comercial ELISA test was determined in each patient. This survey deals with relevant factors causing <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. This survey showed that the group of patients with clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> canididiasis had more patients with positive hemoculture to Candida species, then the group of patients without clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis. The number of patients being examined and positive to antigens and antibodies was higher (p< 0. 01) in the group of patients with clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis (7 / 30; 23. 3 %), then in the group of patients without clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis (0 / 30; 0 %). Average value of titra antigen was statistically higher (p< 0. 001) in patients with Candida spp. positive hemocultures rather then in patients with Candida spp. negative hemocultures. In the group of patients with clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis 6 / 30 (20 %) of patients had Candida spp. positive hemocultures while in the group of patients without clinical signs of <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis 1 / 30 (3. 3 %) of patients had Candida spp. positive hemocultures, which was considerably higher (p< 0. 05). Correlation of results of hemoculture and mannan antigens and antibodies in patients with <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis were statistically significant, while correlation of results of hemoculture and antibodies was insignificant. Because of low sensitivity of hemoculture and time needed for isolation of Candida spp., introducing serological tests in regular procedures would speed <b>disseminated</b> candidiasis diagnose...|$|R

METHODS Retrospective analysis of 18 dogs presented with spinal disorders using information from radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging examinations. RESULTS All dogs {{were found to be}} affected with both <b>disseminated</b> idiopathic spinal hyperostosis and spondylosis deformans. Neurological signs due to foraminal stenosis associated with <b>disseminated</b> idiopathic spinal hyperostosis were found in two dogs.
