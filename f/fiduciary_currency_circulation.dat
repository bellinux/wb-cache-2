40|$|The main {{thought of}} the article is the opinion of {{progressing}} phenomenon of demonetization of gold as international reserve currency. Gold as world currency is a restrictive element {{in the range of}} international trades' turnover. It is the restraint of the expansion of world trade that has always had the increasing tendency. In that way you can explain the increase of the position of the United States' dollar as the key currency. National currency performing a duty of international currency in the longway perspective is an embryo of currency crisis and the source of conflicts and contradictions in capitalistic countries. Gold and dollar as international currency can be replaced by international <b>fiduciary</b> <b>currency.</b> Precursor of this conception is Keynes. The author discussed the mechanism of regulation the exchane rates and mechanisms of accomodation in the range of deficits of payments and analised the role of International Monetary Fund. The author pointed that in that range the role of gold is not of basical importance. The essential role of gold is its function as the comparative measure of currency. Price of gold is of conventional character. There were discussed modern international conceptions of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>currency</b> of Prof. R. Triffin and the plan of reform of the International Monetary Fund that depended on introduction of Special Drawing Rights (SDR). Special Drawing Rights are based on international account unit that equals one gold dollar. Finishing his article the author distinguished international <b>fiduciary</b> <b>currency</b> from supranational <b>fiduciary</b> <b>currency.</b> The supranational <b>fiduciary</b> <b>currency</b> is above all the political conception not only organizational or economical one.

Sudden inflation {{during the reign of}} Commodus damaged the credit market. In the mid-200s, the supply of specie contracted sharply. Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Century—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector by the year 300.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is {{therefore}} twofold. First, to establish the claim that <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation</b> has been rising. Second, to empirically quantify and give a full account of the reasons determining the dynamics and volatility of <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation.</b> Using annual data for the 1965 - 2004 period, this paper confirms that <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation</b> as a proportion of money stock has increased. From the initial estimation results, the paper establishes strong positive effects of inflation rate, underground economy activities, financial deepening on the CU/M 2 ratio, and significant negative effect of interest rates on this ratio. The other highlight result from this study is the positive and significant association between small-scale agriculture produce and CU/M 2 ratio. Using annual data, among other things, this study confirms findings from other studies that cash preference is a function of real interest rates. However, one striking finding here is the importance small-scale agriculture as a determinant of <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation.</b> This reflects the agriculture-dependent nature of the economy. Better performance of this sector injects cash in the economy and because of the lack of banking facilities in rural areas, most of the injected cash remains in circulation. The message from empirical results using monthly data is similar, with interest rates, financial deepening, tobacco selling season dummy and inflation rate playing significant roles in determining movements in <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation.</b> As expected, technological innovations in the banking system or payment systems, particularly cash dispensers (ATMs) have a significant impact on the overall level of <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation,</b> whereas no major impact seems to come from the MALSWITCH smart card, however, initial indications reveal its negative effect on the CU/M 2 ratio. Policy implications from these results are many. First, of late the Bank has reduced the bank rate and as is normally the case, all other interest rates were similarly adjusted. While the policy move has or is on course to achieve its intended goals, it has other side repercussions such as deposit taking capabilities by commercial banks. Currently, the minimum saving rate for the four major commercial banks averages around 7. 5 %. This against the current monthly inflation rate of 12. 2 (for October 2004) leaves real savings rate of around – 4. 7 % which rationally discourages savings mobilisation and consequent reduction in the availability of loanable funds for productive investment and economic growth. The public is most likely to hold their assets in cash rather than bank deposit form since the opportunity cost of doing so is essentially zero. However, due to high inflation in the past, savers in Malawi were used to high interest rates so that current demand deposits are considered as unattractive and non-worthwhile form of holding money. It is time the public get used to lower interest rates as in other countries and on the belief that causality direction is from interest rates to inflation, the reduction in the bank rate could eventually lead to a drop in inflation and, therefore, an increase in the real interest rate. Second, if the Bank intends to focus on reducing the CU/M 2 ratio, intensification of smart card use and publicity could play an important role. The smart card is a direct alternative of cash as a means of payment so that its widespread use can directly reduce <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation.</b> This, as is the case in other countries could also reduce the positive impact of ATM transactions on the overall level of <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation.</b> Third, the overall civic education on the use of banking facilities, in rural areas as well as to small-scale business men (vendors) is important for increased deposit taking and, therefore, the reduction in the amount of <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation.</b> <b>Currency</b> in <b>circulation,</b> Seasonality, Money demand model...|$|R

40|$|With the {{deepening}} of urban economic restructuring, two problems {{have become increasingly}} significant. One is {{the rapid expansion of}} consumption funds. Take, for example, the city of Tianjin. In 1984 it put into circulation a total of 7. 014 billion yuan, an increase of 27. 7 percent over 1983. Through the sales of goods, service fees, and savings deposits by both urban and rural residents, a total of 6. 831 billion yuan was withdrawn from circulation, up by 23. 2 percent over the preceding year. The accounts show that a net of 183 million yuan was added to the <b>currency</b> <b>circulation,</b> the first time there has been net growth for the huge industrial and commercial city in close to sixteen years. Thus, its <b>currency</b> <b>circulation</b> on the market was up by 40 percent over 1983, far exceeding the 11. 5 percent growth of the total industrial and agricultural output and 18. 1 percent growth of the retail sales. Things are about the same for the country as a whole. In 1984, wages and bonuses disbursed via bank payments grew by 22. 3 percent over 1983, and consumption funds for groups and individuals paid out of administrative and management expenditures also increased by 38 percent. These, too, far outpaced the 13. 6 percent growth of industrial output value and the 17. 4 percent of retail sales in society. ...|$|R
