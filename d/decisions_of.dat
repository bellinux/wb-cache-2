5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively {{based on the}} Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change {{the outcome of the}} case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the Oregon Supreme Court, <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E

This study is conducted by using an explanatory approach. Four hypotheses that are formulated from the goals of study will be proved in this study. Furthermore, the data analysis method that is used in this study is an inferential statistical analysis Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA). The conclusion of this study are firstly political distribution variable has influence on the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting the candidate; secondly political distribution variable has not a significant influence on the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting political party; thirdly the variable on the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting candidate has influence the variable on the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting political party; and fourthly the variable on the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting candidate has mediated the variable of political distribution to the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> selecting political party...|$|R

5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E

Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.|$|E

Litigants could appeal to the royal court against the decision of the voivode from the 14thcentury, but the voivode often remained involved in the proceedings.

5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> such courts are not binding on Singapore courts. However, {{as a result of}} Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial precedents continue to exercise a strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly as regards the development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.|$|E
