40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{computing}} with faulty shared bits is addressed. The {{focus is on}} constructing a reliable test&set bit from a collection of test&set bits of which some may be faulty. Faults are modeled by allowing operations on the faulty bits to return a special <b>distinguished</b> <b>value,</b> signaling that the operation may not have taken place. Such faults are called omission faults. Some of the constructions are required to be gracefully degrading for omission. That is, if the bound {{on the number of}} component bits which fail is exceeded, the constructed bit may suffer faults, but only faults which are no more severe than those of the components; and the constructed bit behaves as intended if the number of component bits which fail does not exceed that bound. Several efficient constructions are presented, and bounds on the space required are given. Our constructions for omission faults also apply to other fault models. Index Terms—Test&set bits, reliability, omission faults, gracefully degradation, wait-free algorithms. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a variant of}} Martin-Lof type theory extended by the principle of type induction, as introduced in the oyster- 2 theorem proving system. The system has a procedural meta-language in which a variety of search strategies have been written. Theorem proving in the system yields object-level functional programs that implement procedures associated with the theorem that is proved. We demonstrate the application of type induction in proving {{the existence of a}} partial decision procedure for a fragment of type theory inside the theory itself. As a result of that proof, we obtain an object-level program that implements such a partial decision procedure, ie given a type theoretic formula x as input, it returns either a proof of x (formally, an element of the type x), or a refutation of x (formally, an element of the type x Γ! void) or a <b>distinguished</b> <b>value</b> indicating that no decision has been made.

For example, the formula true {begin begin new x; x:= 1 end; begin new x; y: = x end end} y 1 is valid according to the semantics given (because the second declaration of x assigns the same register to x as the first), but it is not provable in Perhaps the simplest way to fix this is to require all newly declared variables to be initialized to some <b>distinguished</b> <b>value</b> 0 e D.

This paper documents reconstructing the model Minbar to be exactly like the original one which was a sole job until the time, especially because of the decorations' diversity and the need to adopt the traditional craft techniques which require deliberate synthesized studies to prepare the drawings and construct the Minbar.

40|$|Abstract: A {{model for}} storage in {{procedural}} languages is presented. Its fundamental notion is to strictly <b>distinguish</b> <b>values</b> from stor-age objects. Several difficulties in current languages are resolved in this model, e. g., {{the problem of}} flexible locations [I] and the mean-ing of the term type [2, 3, 41. In {{the light of the}} storage object/value dichotomy, several notions are found to be covered by the term type. The implications of the model are explored with respect to the more conventional data constructs of procedural languages as well as to sets and how they might be provided. Finally, data extension mechanisms are considered. Whereas the treatment here is not complete, the template concept introduced in the model does suggest a useful framework for providing the much talked of but seldom realized benefits of data extensibility...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{weighted}} proportional fair (PF) scheduling method is {{proposed in the}} context of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver side. The new scheme introduces weights that adapt the classical PF metric to the NOMA scenario, improving performance indicators and enabling new services. The <b>distinguishing</b> <b>value</b> of the proposal resides in its ability to improve long term fairness and total system throughput while achieving a high level of fairness in every scheduling slot. Finally, it is shown that the additional complexity caused by the weight calculation has only a limited impact on the overall scheduler complexity while simulation results confirm the claimed improvements making the proposal an appealing alternative for resource allocation in a cellular downlink system.
