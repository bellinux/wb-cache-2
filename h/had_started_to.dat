5|$|After the battle, Fatah {{began to}} engage in {{communal}} projects to achieve popular affiliation. The battle of Karameh and the subsequent increase in the PLO's strength are considered to have been important catalysts for the 1970 events {{of the civil war}} known as Black September, in which the kingdom managed to expel the Palestinian groups to Lebanon after they <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> gain control over Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} the Austrian Emperor, <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), the military-political council {{responsible}} for decisionmaking in the Austrian armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular with the royal court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria {{decided to go to}} war with France.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} their second album, the Clash <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> {{depart from the}} punk rock sound. While touring in the United States twice in 1979, they chose {{supporting}} acts such as rhythm and blues artists Bo Diddley, Sam & Dave, Lee Dorsey, and Screamin' Jay Hawkins, as well as neotraditional country artist Joe Ely and punk rockabilly band the Cramps. This developed fascination with rock and roll inspired their approach for London Calling.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{restoration}} {{began in}} Mdina, Birgu and the Cittadella. In Mdina, {{some of the}} bastions <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> slip down the clay slopes, and steel rods were inserted in the walls to reinforce them. Throughout the course of restoration, a number of archaeological remains have been found, including remains of Mdina's Punic-Roman and medieval walls, a bastion and a caponier in Birgu, the Cittadella's original entrance, {{and a number of}} other features.|$|E
5|$|Montreal was {{incorporated}} {{as a city}} in 1832. The opening of the Lachine Canal permitted ships to bypass the unnavigable Lachine Rapids, while {{the construction of the}} Victoria Bridge established Montreal as a major railway hub. The leaders of Montreal's business community <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> build their homes in the Golden Square Mile (~) from about 1850. By 1860, it was the largest municipality in British North America and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada.|$|E

In 2012, the DPW <b>has</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> install LED streetlights along Marine Corps Drive. At the same time, construction <b>has</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> replace the Agana Bridge along GH-1.|$|R

5|$|Squire {{later said}} a key {{reason for the}} success {{was that there was}} a postal strike which {{prevented}} chart returns being sent, and reducing the available ones to a few retailers in London. Yes had the largest fanbase in these stores, and that allowed a good chart position. By the time the strike had ended, the album <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> sell well due to its initial apparent success.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airborne Division {{began their}} advance on 17 August, after the German Army <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> withdraw. Fighting several small battles, {{by the end}} of the month they reached their {{objective}} at the River Seine. Here the division halted until early in September, when they returned to England to prepare for further airborne operations later in the war.|$|E
5|$|There are no interventional {{studies that}} {{directly}} show mortality benefit of cholesterol lowering in FH. Rather, evidence of benefit {{is derived from}} a number of trials conducted in people who have polygenic hypercholesterolemia (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that mortality in people with FH <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced.|$|E

5|$|After {{coaching}} North Carolina for one season, Norman Shepard {{went to the}} Far East {{to work as a}} {{sales manager}} for Liggett and Meyer tobacco company, which left the position of head coach open. Even though McDonald has just graduated from North Carolina and <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> attend medical school full-time, he became the next head coach after Shepard's departure. McDonald was the first former player to become head coach of the North Carolina men's basketball team; Matt Doherty would be the second.|$|E
5|$|Although Gibraltar's {{civilian}} inhabitants <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> {{return as}} early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after VJ Day {{was a lack of}} shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of the}} peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.|$|E
5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} the Austrian Emperor, <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat, the military-political council {{responsible}} for the armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular at court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria {{decided to go to}} war with France. Karl Mack became the new main commander in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the eve of the war that called for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies, rather than three battalions of six companies. Austrian cavalry was considered the best in Europe, and one of the best of the time anywhere.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{the horses}} were nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke. The Russian cossacks, {{assembled}} in the reserve, entered the melee, but their light horses were {{no match for the}} French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the previous year. The Russian infantry <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded. Several of his men managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E
5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin {{starting to make}} moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E

In Styria, he reformed the military organization and administration of church properties, and built strong fortresses. For defense against Hungary, he built strongholds at Leibnitz (Seggau) and Pettau (Ptuj), and Brestanica castle. He also expanded the Burg Deutschlandsberg castle {{at the center of}} the Salzburg possessions in western Styria. In 1131, he made peace with King Béla II of Hungary, which was followed by a long period of stability in the border region.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, VAT <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> seek a {{stronger}} partner when it negotiated with AB Scania-Vabis. The companies {{planned to use}} Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan proved too expensive for VAT. This may have led the major owners of VAT to start discussions about merging VAT and SAT. The chairman of VAT held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in VAT and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was interested in co-operation with, or acquisition of, VAT. Valmet is also rumoured to {{have been interested in}} VAT but {{there is no evidence of}} concrete negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border. Petrović accepted that this might become necessary if {{the situation on the}} immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the Slovene {{chief of staff of the}} headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Armijski đeneral Leon Rupnik, who suggested that Trifunović, a Serb, should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back. At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army. Morale in the 7th Army <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy.|$|E
