2500|$|Historians {{agree that}} President Johnson was an inept {{politician}} who lost all his advantages by his clumsy moves. He broke with Congress in early 1866 {{and then became}} defiant and tried to block enforcement of Reconstruction laws passed by the U.S. Congress. He was in constant conflict constitutionally with the Radicals in Congress over the status of freedmen and whites in the defeated South. Although resigned to the abolition of slavery, many former Confederates were unwilling to accept both social changes and political domination by former slaves. In the words of Benjamin F.
