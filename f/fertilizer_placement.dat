30|$|Central to {{the concept}} of {{sustainable}} agriculture is the reduction of environmental costs associated with farming. Among others, it requires responsible use of chemical fertilizers. This can be achieved through use of suitable fertilizer types and application rates timed to crop demand, seasons, and weather conditions with low risk of fertilizer loss to the environment. Responsible use of chemical fertilizers also requires utilization of effective fertilizer application techniques. In contrast to conventional fertilizer application by even broadcast on the soil surface (with or without incorporation), several innovative <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> techniques have been developed, through which fertilizer can be targeted to the seed, root, or canopy of young crop plants. Furthermore, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> in soil improves fertilizer acquisition by target crop plants as opposed to weeds [16, 17] and reduces the risk of nutrient loss to the environment. Based on fertilizer composition, application technique and timing, effective <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> can lead to reduced leaching of nitrate to ground waters [18], low emission of nitrous oxide [19], methane [20], and ammonia [21] originating from fertilizer applied in soil. <b>Fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> can also improve nutrient content in crop above-ground biomass as well as crop yield in comparison to conventional fertilizer broadcast (meta-analysis with 40 field studies, Nkebiwe et al. 2016, submitted unpublished observation).|$|E

40|$|A {{substantial}} portion of the nitrogen (N) fertilizer applied under intensive Midwestern cropping is lost through nitrate-nitrogen (NO[subscript] 3 -N) leaching with percolating water. A tillage and fertilizer-placement system designed to isolate the fertilizer from downward water flow and to minimize NO[subscript] 3 -N leaching is desirable, both environmentally and economically. A ridge-tillage configuration, with placement of the potential NO[subscript] 3 -N source in the elevated portion of the ridge, appears to be one possible best management practice. Therefore, NO[subscript] 3 -N leaching under ridge tillage during the early growing season and immediately following fertilizer application is investigated;Past numerical modeling of water and solute transport for both saturated and unsaturated soil is reviewed. The finite element formulation for two-dimensional water and solute transport is presented. The FEMWATER-FEMWASTE computer code is used for simulation modeling and a comparison is made of the water and solute transport in ridge- and flat-tillage systems;Data from a field experiment indicate that <b>placement</b> of N <b>fertilizer</b> {{in the center of a}} ridge reduces NO[subscript] 3 -N leaching as contrasted to a similar placement for flat tillage, even though total water movement through both systems is comparable. Vertical NO[subscript] 3 -N movement is predominant (in contrast to horizontal movement) and increases as the amount of simulated rainfall increases;Results from model verification indicate that the two-dimensional model has potential application in predicting water and solute movement in the unsaturated soil profile. However, further modeling activities are needed (with additional subroutines to handle runoff-ponding conditions) to insure the validity of the model for microscale applications such as those in this particular study. With further refinements, the model should be a more useful tool to describe water and chemical movement through soil for various <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placements</b> and surface configurations...|$|R

Grain yield was not influenced when basal fertilizer was banded within (2390 - 2500 kg ·ha – 1) or between rows (2530 - 2650 kg ·ha – 1). However, grain yield decreased when basal fertilizer was broadcast on the soil surface (2200 kg·ha – 1).

Forty short-term P-K trials were established in farmers 2 ̆ 7 fields from 1995 to 1997; Treatments were various P (0 to 56 kg P ha- 1) and K (0 to 132 kg K ha - 1) rates broadcast, banded with the planter 5 cm beside and below the seeds, and deep-banded at a 15 [...] 20 cm depth before planting. Plant samples were taken at V 5 to V 6 growth stages, dried, weighed, ground, and analyzed for total P and K content. Soil samples were taken from different depth and position relative to crop rows or fertilizer bands. Mean soil-test P at the 0 [...] 15 cm depth ranged from very low to very high across sites and soil-test K ranged mostly from optimum to very high. Phosphorus increased yields in several sites that tested below optimum {{and there was no}} response to placement. Potassium placement responses however, were observed even in some high-testing soils, and deep-banded K, increased yields more than the broadcast placements did in several fields. Yield responses were poorly correlated to soil-test K alone and seemed related to rainfall amount or frequency in early summer. Early growth responses to P or K fertilizer were fewer and not always coincided with the yield-responsive sites.

40|$|Surface {{broadcasting}} {{is still}} the predominant mode of potassium (K) fertilizer application for soybeans in no-till (NT) systems even though K is relatively immobile and vertical soil K stratification is often evident in NT fields. Soybean yield in conservation tillage systems may be improved by banding K fertilizer below seeding depth. Certain soybean seed quality parameters may also be affected by K fertilizer management systems since K is so essential in plant enzymes. The objectives of this research were to investigate K nutrition, yield, and quality responses of soybeans resulting from alternate K <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placements</b> (band placement versus surface broadcasting, and applied directly before soybeans versus residual effects associated with application to previous corn) in various tillage (such as zone-till, fall disk, and NT) and row-width systems imposed after long-term NT. All 17 experimental site-years had a minimum 5 -yr NT history prior to treatment initiation. Soybean responses to K placement were generally unaffected by tillage and row width (from 18 to 76 cm) on medium- to high-exchangeable K soils. Trifoliate leaf K concentrations were increased by K application even on medium- to high-testing K soils. Yield responded positively to direct K fertilization most frequently on low K soils. Despite vertical soil K stratification, deep banded K increased yield, relative to broadcast K, only on low K soils and only when most soybean rows were {{in close proximity to}} fertilizer bands. On low-testing soils, leaf K concentrations and yield were over 10 % higher for NT soybeans planted over previous corn rows, compared to those between rows, even when corn received no K fertilizer. Soybean seed K concentrations increased up to 3 g kg− 1 after both direct and residual K applications. Potassium fertilization increased daidzein, genistein, and total isoflavone concentrations in soybean seeds. Seed isoflavone concentrations were positively correlated to yield, seed K and oil concentrations. There was no apparent yield or seed composition benefit from banded versus broadcast K application except on low K soils. Possible preceding corn row impacts on horizontal soil K distribution should be considered when narrow-row NT soybeans follow corn on soils with low to medium K concentrations. ...|$|R

Because the hybrids responded similarly to complete starter fertilizer, producers need not manage these hybrids differently with respect to starter fertilizer;Recommended soil-test P and K interpretations for corn and soybean based on conventional tillage are also appropriate for these no-tillage systems.
