She {{has said that}} carbon dioxide is [...] "a natural {{byproduct}} of nature" [...] and is a beneficial gas required by plant life. She stated that because life requires carbon dioxide and {{it is part of the}} planet's life cycle, it cannot be harmful. In a statement she made on the House floor on Earth Day, April 22, 2009, Bachmann stated she was against the cap and trade climate legislation, stating: [...] "Carbon dioxide is not a <b>harmful</b> <b>gas,</b> it is a harmless gas. Carbon dioxide is natural; it is not harmful...

50|$|The use of {{cartridges}} in {{the contaminated}} atmosphere leads to saturation of the sorbent (or the dryer — when using catalysts). The concentration of <b>harmful</b> <b>gases</b> in the purified air gradually increases.

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of this method}} {{is that some of}} harmful gases have no warning properties. For example, there is a list of more than 500 harmful gases in the and more than 60 of them have no warning properties, and there are no any such information for more than one hundred of them. So, if one uses warning properties to replace cartridges, this leads to breathiing air with excess <b>harmful</b> <b>gas</b> concentration in some cases.

In a controversial study commissioned and paid for by Shell, one of the applicants to explore for shale gas in South Africa, developing one tenth of the estimated Karoo for fracking could generate 200 billion rand per year and create 700,000 jobs. Some characterize fracking as a more sustainable energy solution, avoiding the costs of emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, of which South Africa {{is considered one of}} the “worst offenders globally.” Proponents are eager to meet the South African promise to reduce <b>harmful</b> <b>gas</b> emissions by 34% by 2020.|$|E

The main aim of this project is to monitor and control each and every industry present in the state for their limitless toxic gas emission in the environment. This project contain back end MS SQL database and front end asp. net. In the system there is a sensor (MQ 6) installed in the chimneys of the industries which will help in detection of <b>harmful</b> <b>gasses.</b> Every industry is installed with a server which will help in comparison of the data taken from the sensor to monitor whole system. The system consists of a centralized database storing unit for storing all the information about every industry in the respective state. If the industry emits large amount of <b>harmful</b> <b>gases</b> then the mq 6 sensor will detect this activity and will fire a buzzer. Still then the company did not stop to produce the <b>harmful</b> <b>gases</b> in the surrounding then the buzzer will buzz for the final time and the system will automatically shut down the power supply of the industries which leads in blocking of boiler.

50|$|The {{project to}} monitor the air inside residences near the OII site began in 1993 to make sure <b>harmful</b> <b>gas</b> {{migrating}} underground from the landfill did not accumulate in homes. This project involved bi-annual monitoring of the air inside some homes adjacent to the South Parcel. A few homes {{were found to have}} landfill gas problems, and remediation systems were installed following the initial 24-hour testing. With the increased gas collection system and capping that occurred on site, the gas in the landfill became far more controlled. For several years prior to ending the in-home monitoring program in 2001, EPA saw no evidence of an indoor air problem in any of the homes tested. Subsequently, gas collection systems were removed from homes and periodic random sampling was terminated.|$|E

[...] Unfortunately, a closed section of the Saufley Field airfield was also utilized for the Saufley Construction and Demolition Landfill. After Hurricane Ivan, debris disposal in this landfill was grossly mismanaged, resulting in potentially <b>harmful</b> <b>gas</b> emissions, a serious fire hazard, potential groundwater contamination and an air traffic hazard (e.g., increased bird strike/wildlife strike hazard) were created.

50|$|Capture noxious gases may be {{accomplished}} by the sorbents. These materials (activated carbon, aluminium oxide etc.) have a large specific surface area and can absorb gases. Typically, such sorbents used {{in the form of}} granules, and cartridge case is filled with them. Contaminated air travels through the bed of sorbent granules in the cartridge, and movable <b>harmful</b> <b>gas</b> molecules collide with the surface of the sorbent, and remain therein. The sorbent is saturated the molecules caught, and gradually loses its ability to capture the gases. So, contaminated air can pass through the saturated sorbent to the layers of fresh sorbent. The concentration of harmful substances in the purified air after prolonged use of the cartridge increases, and may exceed the Permissible Exposure Limit PEL. Therefore, the service life of the cartridges is limited. The bond strength between the captured molecule and sorbent has a small, and the molecule is able to separate from the sorbent and get into the air again. The ability of the sorbent to capture the gases depends on: the properties of the gases and their concentrations, the air temperature, the air relative humidity, the rate of air consumed by the employee, and many other factors. Activated carbon can be saturated with chemicals that make more stronger ties with molecules of trapped gases - to improve the capture of a number of harmful gases. The saturation of the activated carbon with iodine - improves the capture of mercury; saturation of metal salts - improves the capture of ammonia; saturation metal oxides - improves capture acid gases.|$|E
