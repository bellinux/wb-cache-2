40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to scrutinize whether the rules of origin criteria in Australian trade preference scheme are guided by the desired benefits of non-tariff barrier or not. Trade preference schemes of developed countries to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are important parts of foreign trade policy of advanced nations. For LDCs, availing trade preferences is also important for the success of their exportoriented economic growth and integration to the global economy. However, such measures of trade liberalization from developed countries are clouted by protectionist measures like stringent rules of origin to avail preference, which tend to nullify the welfare-enhancing outcomes of trade preference. With a relatively less protectionist regime, Australia has been providing <b>duty-free</b> and quota-free <b>market</b> access to all products from all LDCs since 2003. Nevertheless, despite being a least developed country, Bangladesh could not get the desirable benefits from Australian trade preference scheme over the last few years.

40|$|Most goods {{imported}} from developing countries, enter Quad <b>markets</b> <b>duty-free,</b> and, average tariffs in Quad markets are very low. But tariffs for some commodities are {{over one hundred}} percent. Such"tariff peaks"are often concentrated in products developing countries want to export: agricultural, and food products - especially such staples as sugar, cereals, and fish; fruits and vegetables; food products with a high sugar content; and, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages - and products from such labor-intensive sectors as apparel, and footwear. Giving least developed countries full duty- and quota-free access in the Quad for peak-tariff products would increase their total annual exports by eleven percent - or roughly $ 2. 5 billion. Exports to Quad countries of peak-tariff products, would expand by 30 - 60 percent. Considering that peak-tariff items account for only a small share of developing countries'exports, granting lest developed countries duty-free access, would have only a negligible impact on other developing countries. For the same reason, Quad imports increase only marginally, suggesting that this factor should not constrain implementation of duty-free access for the poorest countries.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the Canada-U. S. Auto Pact, a {{selective}} trade liberalization agreement which created a <b>duty-free</b> North American <b>market</b> {{for the major}} U. S. multinational automobile producers, but continued {{to protect them from}} offshore producers. The new international trade/I. O. literature predicts that, given the probable unexploited economics of scale and specialization in the tariff-protected small Canadian economy prior to 1965, rationalization leading to large efficiency gains in Canadian production vis a vis U. S. production would occur in a free trade environment. We estimate that the Auto Pact did not induce a substantial improvement in Canadian relative production efficiency. The missing ingredient seems to have been the competition-increasing effects of free trade in an oligopolistic setting that is emphasized by the new trade/I. O. literature. The Auto Pact did not increase the number of rivals in the oligopolistic Canadian industry since the major players in the industry had production facilities {{on both sides of the}} Canada-U. S. border before 1965, and no significant new entry into Canada occurred. In the 1962 - 64 period, Canadian automotive production was 27 % less efficient than U. S. production. By 1970 - 72 this deficiency had been reduced to 19 %, but was not further reduced by the end of the 1970 's. Of the 8 percentage points reduction in the Canadian disadvantage, we attribute only 3 percentage points to the rationalization process induced specifically by the Auto Pact. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studying}} the 1995 EU-Turkey Customs Union (CU) {{reveals that the}} CU {{has been a major}} instrument of integration of the Turkish economy into the EU and global markets, offering powerful tools to reform the Turkish economy. Turkish producers of industrial goods are protected by tariffs from external competition to exactly the same extent as EU producers, and they face competition from duty-free imports of industrial goods from world-class pan-European firms. In return, Turkish industrial producers have <b>duty-free</b> <b>market</b> access to the European Economic Area, which was recently extended to certain Mediterranean countries. Trade liberalisation achieved through the CU has thus successfully moved the Turkish economy from a government-controlled regime to a market-based one, and Turkish producers of industrial goods have performed remarkably well. The paper further shows that market access conditions for Turkish producers are determined, in addition to tariffs, by standards, conformity assessment procedures, competition policy, industrial property rights and contingent protectionism measures. The CU also offered Turkey the opportunity to establish new institutions, and modernise and upgrade rules and disciplines required for the elimination of technical barriers to trade, and for the implementation of the EU’s competition, industrial property rights, and contingent protectionism policies...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{structured}} in two parts: {{the first part}} investigates topics in economics {{of education and the}} second part topics in commodity tax competition. The common thread in the first part is the English 2004 HE reform,we present both theoretical and empirical models that compare the pre-reform and post reform financing schemes, i. e. income contingent loan and mortgage loan. In the first chapter, in a world where graduates are risk averse and receive uncertain earnings, we evaluate which method gives better insurance and returns when the investment in education is risky. In the second chapter we consider the possibility that graduates do not receive an income sufficient to repay completely their loan, that is they are in default. We still develop a theoretical model, structured as a game between government and students, to see whether an ICL or a ML give students higher incentives to put more effort in their studies and avoid the risk of default. In the third chapter we present an empirical analysis, in line with the recent studies on the return to schooling. We first estimate the returns for different levels of education and then we compute the internal rate of return of the investment in higher education versus high school, under a ML and an ICL. In {{the second part of the}} thesis we provide an empirical model to develop the key idea that completion of the Single Market in the EU can be interpreted as a kind of "natural experiment" that allows us to separate the effects of tax competition from other forms of strategic interaction. We first find the conditions of cross-border shopping and the government reaction functions in three different market regimes: <b>duty-free</b> <b>market</b> before 1993, mixed market up to 1999, single market after 1999. Second, we provide an empirical test of the theoretical predictions using a panel data set of 12 EU countries over the period 1987 - 2004. We find that for all excise duties that we consider (beer, ethyl alcohol, still wine, sparkling wine, cigarettes, tobacco, petrol), strategic interaction between countries significantly increased after 1993, consistent with the theoretical prediction...|$|E
40|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Doha Round negotiations is likely to influence Swiss agricultural policy substantially. The same goes for {{a free trade agreement}} in agriculture and food with the European Communities. Even though neither of them will bring about <b>duty-free</b> and quota-free <b>market</b> access, or restrict domestic support measures to green box compatible support, both would represent a big step in that direction. There is no empirical evidence on the effect of such a counterfactual scenario for Swiss agriculture. We therefore use a normative mathematical programming model to illustrate possible effects for agricultural production and the corresponding agricultural income. Moreover, we discuss the results with respect to the provision of public goods under the assumption of continuing green box-compatible direct payments. The aim of our article is to bring more transparency into the discussion on the effects of freer and less distorted trade on the income generation by a multifunctional agriculture. The article will be organized as follows. In the first Section we specify the background of our study. In the second section, we focus on the problem statement and our research questions.

40|$|Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a non-reciprocal {{preferential}} trade agreement where developed countries grant concessions or elimination of their tariffs on imports from developing and less developed countries (LDCs). The primary objective of GSP is to help increase the beneficiaries’ export revenues. Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) acceded as a new member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1997 and {{became a member of}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2013. The country is also a beneficiary of the European Union (EU) ’s GSP since the 1990 s and thus benefits from concessions or elimination of two-third of their tariffs on Lao PDR exports to the EU. In addition, as a LDC, Lao PDR currently enjoys <b>duty-free,</b> quota free <b>market</b> access to the EU via a special arrangement known as Everything but Arms (EBA) that the EU has offered to all LDCs since 2001. This study empirically analyses the impact of EBA on the export volumes of Lao PDR to the EU using an export demand model with quarterly time series data over the period 1996 - 2015. Following (Cuyvers & Soeng, 2013), the impact of EBA has been quantified taking into account changes under the EU GSP, which potentially affect the effectiveness of EBA scheme, such as the complete removal in 2009 of duties and quota on remaining agricultural products (banana, rice, and sugar) and the application of more favourable Rules of Origin (RoO) in 2011. The results of this study show that none of the mentioned changes in the scheme has affected the effectiveness of the EBA on Lao exports to the EU. Instead, it is observed that production supply constraints and declining comparative advantage of Lao PDR’s key export products to the EU are the two important factors affecting the export volumes from Lao PDR to the EU. Thus, in order to increase Lao exports to the EU, it is necessary to address these two crucial constraints in order to take advantage of the EBA GSP...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} benefits of <b>Duty-Free</b> and Quota-Free <b>Market</b> (DFQF) access initiatives of the Republic of Korea for least developed countries (LDCs), which {{have been in place}} since 1 January 2008. Following a brief introduction on the background of this initiative, this paper examines the exports profile of LDCs, reviews the DFQF scheme of the Republic of Korea, and assesses the potential benefits of the DFQF scheme for LDCs as well as Bangladesh. The export profile of LDCs shows that the share of those countries in world exports in recent years has increased; this can be attributed to price increases for petroleum constituting a major share of LDC total exports. The Republic of Korea is the tenth largest destination of LDC exports, which indicates that the DFQF initiatives of the Republic of Korea for LDCs will {{have a positive impact on}} LDC exports. The DFQF scheme of the Republic of Korea covers 6, 967 tariff lines, representing about 59 per cent of the all tariff lines of its Customs Schedule. There are at least 25 chapters where product coverage within the chapter is very low, notably below 10 per cent. These include garments, made-up textiles, and major agricultural products including fisheries. Among the DFQF lines, 1, 464 lines are duty-free on a most-favoured nation (MFN) basis. Hence, LDCs enjoy tariff preferences on 5, 503 tariff lines, while the average margin of preference on these lines is 7. 89 per cent. The margin of preferences in most cases is either 6 per cent or 8 per cent. In order to enjoy the preference granted under the scheme, the products should be wholly obtained, or should have at least 50 per cent value addition. Analysis also reveals that the DFQF scheme covers 36. 1 per cent of LDCs’ export to the Republic of Korea in 2007, keeping 64. 9 per cent of current LDC exports to that country outside the purview of preferential treatment. Only three major export items from LDCs – copper cathodes, raw tobacco and plywood – enjoy -free access. Bangladesh, Congo, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malawi, Myanmar, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia are likely to benefit from duty-free access for these items. The Republic of Korea is the seventh-largest destination for Bangladesh exports. Bangladesh enjoys preferential access to the Republic of Korea under the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA). DFQF access for LDCs adds 5, 471 tariff lines for Bangladesh under preferential access. However, analysis shows that the additional lines cover only 4. 63 per cent of Bangladesh’s exports to the Republic of Korea in 2007. However, there are important apparel articles in the scheme that may yield benefits for Bangladesh. APTA continues to remain attractive to Bangladesh because of higher trade coverage and more relaxed rules of origin. Nevertheless, the DFQF scheme currently offered by the Republic of Korea is a milestone for the developing countries’ initiative for LDCs, and one that is likely to lead to other countries coming up with similar initiatives. In time, the Republic of Korea is likely to incrementally increase the product coverage, which will lead to higher trade coverage and more favourable rules of origin, and will yield significant benefits for LDCs. least developed countries, Bangladesh, Korea, market access,...|$|R
