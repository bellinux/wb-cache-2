40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{that due to}} strong modal interactions through cross-gain saturation, the onset of a new lasing mode can switch off an existing mode via a negative power slope. In this process of interaction-induced mode switching (IMS) the two involved modes maintain their identities, i. e. they do not change their spatial field patterns or lasing frequencies. For a <b>fixed</b> <b>pump</b> profile, a simple analytic criterion for the occurrence of IMS is given {{in terms of their}} self- and cross-interaction coefficients and non-interacting thresholds, which is verified for the example of a two-dimensional microdisk laser. When the spatial pump profile is varied as the pump power is increased, IMS can be induced even when it would not occur with a <b>fixed</b> <b>pump</b> profile, as we show for two coupled laser cavities. Our findings apply to steady-state lasing and are hence different from dynamical mode switching or hopping. IMS may have potential applications in robust and flexible all-optical switching.

Here we study OMIT in parity-time (PT) -symmetric microresonators with a tunable gain-to-loss ratio. This system features a reversed, non-amplifying transparency, i. e., an inverted-OMIT. When the gain-to-loss ratio is varied, the system exhibits a transition from a PT-symmetric phase to a broken-PT-symmetric phase. This PT-phase transition results in the reversal of the pump and gain dependence of the transmission rates.

40|$|Abstract. Both {{theory and}} {{experiment}} {{have suggested that}} parametric decay instability (PDI) is a possible edge power loss mechanism in ICRF (including HHFW and IBW) heating of tokamak plasmas. In this paper, we consider the extension of previous theoretical models to enable a quantitative evaluation of pump depletion and power loss due to PDI. A set of nonlinear coupled equations for a long-wavelength “dipole ” pump and short-wavelength daughter modes is derived. The model recovers the standard PDI dispersion relation for <b>fixed</b> <b>pump</b> wave amplitude, and obeys an appropriate nonlinear energy conservation law. When dissipation is present the model provides a description of energy flow from the pump to the daughter modes and the particles. The equations are intended to describe parametric decay and pump depletion in inhomogeneous plasmas.

A., Cinisello Balsamo, Milan, Italy Purpose: Administration of {{intravenous}} iloprost – a first-line European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) -recommended {{choice for}} the treatment of scleroderma (SSc) -related digital vasculopathy – requires repeated treatment cycles of 6 hours per day in a hospital setting. During the infusion, patient mobility is considerably restricted due to the size and fixity of traditional syringe pumps. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the satisfaction level of patients and nurses, after the introduction of a new portable syringe pump (Infonde®, Italfarmaco S. p.

Patients and methods: Thirty-four consecutive SSc patients receiving stable therapy with iloprost, previously administered with a <b>fixed</b> <b>pump,</b> were treated using the portable Infonde® pump. Patients (n= 34) and nurses (n= 4) were asked to answer a nine- and six-item questionnaire, respectively, to assess the satisfaction of the administration comparing the new device versus the previous one. The health care staff of the ward developed the questionnaire, and the response scores ranged from 0 (fixed device better) to 10 (portable device better); thus a score > 5 indicates a preference for Infonde®. Results: Patients&# 39; answers indicated a preference towards the new portable syringe pump, versus the previous <b>fixed</b> <b>pump.</b> Questionnaires administered to patients generated a total of 306 responses, with over 95 % of the responses in the range 8 – 10, of which 89 % had a score equal to 10. The responses of nurses showed a score equal to 10 in 100 % cases. No significant adverse events were recorded, indicating no change in the tolerability profile of the drug. Conclusion: Iloprost administration with Infonde® pump was preferred by both patients and health care professionals, and was well tolerated. The possibility to perform daily activities and the freedom of movement suggest a positive impact of Infonde® on the treatment, with a potential favorable effect on the quality of life of patients during the many hours spent receiving the infusion.

40|$|We {{describe}} a technique for the adjustment {{and control of}} repetition rates in continuous-wave-pumped, passively Q-switched solid-state lasers.

At a <b>fixed</b> <b>pump</b> power of 5. 4 W, {{we were able to}} continuously adjust the repetition rate between 13. 8 and 25 kHz by translating an intracavity converging lens.

40|$|Small scale (solar-) {{thermally}} driven cooling systems suffer from two important drawbacks: firstly, the systems usually offer {{no means of}} adapting the chilling capacity to the actual load; secondly constantly running pumps and fans lead to high auxiliary electricity consumption even when the available driving and cooling water temperatures only allow a reduced chilling capacity.

We hypothesised that the alternative membranes would improve recovery of low molecular weight N via increased surface area and membrane pore size. The test environments, sampled at <b>fixed</b> <b>pump</b> flow rates, were: (i) stirred 100 mu M N standard solution containing organic (amino acid) and inorganic (ammonium, nitrate) N; (ii) soil spiked with 100 mu M standard N solution; and (iii) in situ boreal forest soil. In general, long membranes recovered more N, but the magnitude of improved recovery varied with test environment. Long membranes recovered more inorganic N regardless of flow rate, except ammonium in stirred solution, where length had no effect at slow flow rates. Long membranes also recovered more organic N from stirred solution regardless of flow rate, and recovered most N at slow flow rates in spiked soil. Longer membranes recovered more amino acids in situ in forest soil, with improved resolution of individual amino acids, but were biased towards soluble, mobile forms. MWCO did not affect N recoveries, indicating that in the test conditions, membrane length had greater control than pore size. We discuss the bottlenecks of microdialysis application in soil research and conclude that optimised membrane configurations will advance its use as a tool for quantifying nutrient fluxes in soils.

40|$|One in {{a series}} of tip sheets to help {{manufacturers}} optimize their industrial pumping systems. As a result of conservative engineering practices, pumps are often substantially larger than they need to be for an industrial plant's process requirements. Centrifugal pumps can often be oversized because of ''rounding up'', trying to accommodate gradual increases in pipe surface roughness and flow resistance over time, or anticipating future plant capacity expansions. In addition, the plant's pumping requirements might not have been clearly defined during the design phase. Because of this conservative approach, pumps can have operating points completely different from their design points. The pump head is often less than expected, while the flow rate is greater. This can cause cavitation and waste energy as the flow rate typically must be regulated with bypass or throttle control. Oversized and throttled pumps that produce excess pressure are excellent candidates for impeller replacement or ''trimming'', to save energy and reduce costs. Trimming involves machining the impeller to reduce its diameter. Trimming should be limited to about 75 % of a pump's maximum impeller diameter, because excessive trimming can result in a mismatched impeller and casing. As the impeller diameter decreases, added clearance between the impeller and the <b>fixed</b> <b>pump</b> casing increases internal flow recirculation, causes head loss, and lowers pumping efficiency. For manufacturing standardization purposes, pump casings and shafts are designed to accommodate impellers in a range of sizes. Many pump manufacturers provide pump performance curves that indicate how various models will perform with different impeller diameters or trims. The impeller should not be trimmed any smaller than the minimum diameter shown on the curve. Net positive suction head requirements (NPSHR) usually decrease at lower flow rates and can increase at the higher end of the pump head curve. The NPSHR at a given flow rate will normally be greater with a smaller impeller, but engineers should consult with the pump manufacturer to determine variations in NPSHR before trimming the impeller. Manufacturers can often provide trim correction charts based on historical test data...|$|E
