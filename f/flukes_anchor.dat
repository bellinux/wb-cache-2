40|$|Anchor hooking on a subsea {{pipeline}} {{has been}} investigated in this thesis. Anchor loads on pipelines is in general a rarely occurring event, however, the severity when it occurs could easily jeopardize the integrity of any pipeline. It is considered as an accidental load {{in the design of}} pipelines. Pipeline Loads, limit state criteria and anchor categories are defined by the DNV standards. For pipeline, DNV-OS-F 101 (08. 2012), Submarine Pipeline Systems is adopted. Offshore standard DNV-RP-E 301 Design and Installation of <b>Fluke</b> <b>Anchors</b> and DNV-OS-E 301 Position Mooring are adopted for the anchor system analysis. SIMLA models are established to check whether the pipelines can be hooked by anchors. A short rigid model is established first, which allows efficient parameter studies with respect to pipe diameter, span height, anchor size and chain length to find the circumstances where hooking can take place. Then long pipe models are investigated for selected cases to show the pipeline response curves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of {{thickened}} oil thermal recovery, the pre-stress cementing needs to be anchored {{at the bottom of}} the casing pipe. And the reliable opening and closing of <b>anchor</b> <b>flukes</b> directly influence the anchoring. In allusion to the problems of how to get the critical value of drilling fluid flow rate of when the <b>anchor</b> <b>flukes</b> begin to open, completely open, begin to close and completely close, whether different nozzles can open or close reliably, getting the corresponding differential pressure and discharge coefficient of the different nozzles, this paper conducts a study from both theory and experiment to obtain the relevant parameters. By simulating the anchor in actual work and dealing with the data, we conclude that: (1) The fluke can open smoothly when the flow rate reaches a certain flow and it can also close smoothly when the flow rate declines. (2) The critical flow rate of the flukes, when two kinds of anchors are with different nozzles, has been acquired. (3) Corresponding differential pressure and discharge coefficient of the different nozzles in different flow rate have been ascertained...|$|R

"Some idea of {{the power}} exerted on this {{occasion}} may be gathered from this:--At the moment which I am now describing, the fore-part of the ship was literally buried {{as high as the}} <b>flukes</b> of the <b>anchors</b> in a dock of perpendicular walls of ice; so that, in that part, she might well have been thought immovable. Still, such was the force applied to her abaft, that after much cracking and perceptible yielding of the beams, which seemed to curve upwards, she actually rose by sheer pressure above the dock forward; and then, with sudden jerks, did the same abaft. During these convulsions, many of the carpenters and others stationed below were violently thrown down on the deck, as people are in an earthquake. It was a moment of intense suspense.|$|R
50|$|Later that day, Magicienne {{was ordered}} to approach, to draw the fire of the batteries. Strachan ordered Lieutenant Hannah and a party of seamen and marines into four boats, which were towed into the harbour by Suwarrow; while Nile and HMS Lurcher towed another four more boats manned by Marlborough’s {{men who had been}} rescued by Strachan three weeks previously.

The Sea Lion, of Holmes' Hole, was to windward a cable's length when this accident happened to her consort, and {{about half a mile}} to the southward. Just at that instant the breakers trended seaward, ahead of that schooner, rendering it indispensable for her to ware. This was done bringing her head to the southward, and she now came struggling directly on towards her consort. The operation of waring had caused her to lose ground enough to bring her to leeward of the anchored craft, and nearer to the danger.|$|R

60|$|The anchor {{was one of}} Ostjak manufacture.

Comparison of the measured net resistance force profiles with the model predictions shows fair agreement at 1 : 12 scale and good agreement at 1 : 7. 2 and 1 : 4. 5 scales. For all scales the embedment model predicts the final anchor embedment depth to a high degree of accuracy...|$|R

40|$|A {{dynamically}} embedded {{plate anchor}} (DEPLA) is a rocket-shaped anchor that penetrates to a target depth in the seabed by the kinetic energy obtained through free-fall {{and by the}} anchor’s self-weight. After embedment, the central shaft is retrieved leaving the <b>anchor</b> <b>flukes</b> vertically embedded in the seabed. The flukes constitute the load bearing element as a plate anchor. This paper presents and considers field data on the embedment depth loss due to the plate anchor keying process and the subsequent bearing capacity factor of the plate anchor element. The loss in plate anchor embedment {{was significantly higher than}} that reported from corresponding centrifuge tests and is reflected in the larger padeye displacements required to mobilize peak capacity in the field tests. Measured plate capacities and plate rotations during keying indicate that the end of keying coincides with the peak anchor capacity. Experimental bearing capacity factors are in the range Nc = 14. 3 – 14. 6, which is appreciably higher than existing solutions for vanishingly thin circular plates. The higher Nc for the DEPLA is considered to be due to a combination of the cruciform fluke arrangement and the fluke (or plate) thickness...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an upper bound plastic limit analysis for predicting drag anchor trajectory and load capacity. The shank and <b>fluke</b> of the <b>anchor</b> are idealized as simple plates. The failure mechanism involves {{the motion of}} the anchor about a center of rotation, the coordinates of which are systematically optimized to determine the minimum load at the shackle. For a given anchor orientation, the direction of the shackle force is varied to establish a relationship between the magnitude and direction of the shackle load. Coupling this relationship to the Neubecker-Randolph anchor line solution produces a unique solution for the magnitude and orientation of the shackle force. The anchor is then advanced a small increment about the optimum center of rotation and the process is repeated. The upper bound method (UBM) provides a practical means to determine the trajectory of the anchor and the anchor load capacity at any point in the trajectory. To better understand of the anchor behavior, extensive parameter studies were carried out varying the properties of the anchor, anchor line, and soil. The UBM show good agreement with six full-scale tests covering several different anchor types and centrifuge model tests...|$|R

40|$|Dynamically {{embedded}} plate anchors are rocket shaped anchors that penetrate to {{a target}} depth in the seabed by the kinetic energy obtained through free-fall.

The experimental work indicates that expected tip embedments are in the range 2 to 3. 3 times the anchor length and depend on the impact velocity, anchor mass and shear strength of the soil. As with other plate anchors, the anchor needs to key before maximum capacity can be mobilised. Both the centrifuge and field experiments show that this keying and pullout behaviour is typical of other vertically installed plate anchors, where the main issue is the loss in embedment during keying. Both the experimental and numerical studies showed that the capacity of the DEPLA is much higher than that of other dynamically installed anchors with capacities up to 40 times the dry weight of the plate and plate bearing capacity factors of about 15...|$|R
