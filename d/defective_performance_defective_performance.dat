40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the topic of "Sale of {{consumer}} goods - rights arising from a defective performance". This topic is coherently and comprehensibly explained, with an emphasis on a comparison between the former legal regulation governing exercising of rights arising from a <b>defective</b> <b>performance</b> under the sale of consumer goods (under Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll., Civil Code) and current legal regulation governing this area (under Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., Civil Code), especially with regard to changes in the position of a buyer. Formally, the thesis is divided into six chapters, which are further split into individual subchapters. The first chapter introduces the legislation containing provisions concerning rights arising from a <b>defective</b> <b>performance</b> under the sale of consumer goods. The second chapter deals with the term "sale of consumer goods", with the scope of application of this special area and its purpose. The third chapter describes the procedure of the proper exercise of a right arising from a <b>defective</b> <b>performance,</b> mainly reasons for which this juridical act can be made, what form, content or other elements it must have, who is actually entitled to this act and against whom. This chapter also presents a deadline for exercising of this right, along with arguments for and against [...] ...|$|R

50|$|As it has developed, {{the law of}} unjust {{enrichment}} has frequently {{been referred to as}} the 'law of restitution'. The difficulty with this is that it emphasises a legal response (restitution) rather than the event which gives rise to it ({{unjust enrichment}}). In doing so, it is akin to treating contract (an event which gives rise to an obligation to perform) as coterminous with compensation (the law's response to non-performance or <b>defective</b> <b>performance).</b> That approach is problematic: the law of compensation is wider than contract, encompassing compensation claims arising out of tortious conduct. This is equally true of restitution: a claimant can obtain restitution not only for an unjust enrichment, but also for a tort. It is in this sense that one can say that restitution is multi-causal: it is a legal response to a number of different events.|$|R
40|$|A {{patient with}} an ischaemic lesion {{involving}} the right frontal lobe and basal ganglia showed left spatial hemineglect in visuomotor exploratory tasks, requiring {{the use of}} the right unaffected hand. Her performance was, however, entirely preserved, with no evidence of neglect, when she was required to identify targets among distractors in both the left and right halves of space, and in the Wundt-Jastrow illusion test. The latter tasks do not require any arm movement in extrapersonal space. In this patient spatial hemineglect may be explained in terms of defective organisation of movements towards the left half-space (directional hypokinesia). The frontal lesion of the patient may be the neural correlate of this selective disorder. This pattern of impairment may be contrasted with the typical deficit found in patients with right brain damage with perceptual neglect. One case had a <b>defective</b> <b>performance</b> both in visuomotor and in purely perceptual tasks...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} neuropsychological battery (the Mental Deterioration Battery) {{was utilized}} to distinguish, within {{a sample of}} 24 idiopathic Parkinsonians, those showing signs of diffuse mental deterioration (n = 9) from those without deterioration (n = 15). Performances of control subjects {{on a wide range}} of tests exploring mnesic, visuo-constructive, linguistic and general intellectual functions (n = 21) did not differ from analogous performances of Parkinsonians without signs of diffuse mental deterioration. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was then used to verify the hypothesis that a selective impairment of cognitive functions subsumed by the integrity of frontal lobes could be demonstrated in Parkinsonian patients. Our results provide evidence that in this task, <b>defective</b> <b>performances</b> are obtained by Parkinsonians and even by patients without signs of diffuse cognitive impairment. These findings seem to confirm that a deficit in concept formation, maintenance and shifting is largely independent of the dementia frequently noticed in Parkinson's disease...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{dyscalculia}} is {{a learning}} disability that affects the acquisition of knowledge about numbers and arithmetic. It is widely assumed that numeracy is rooted on the ‘‘number sense”, a core ability to grasp numerical quantities that humans share with other animals and deploy spontaneously at birth. To probe the links between number sense and dyscalculia, we used a psychophysical test to measure the Weber fraction for the numerosity of sets of dots, hereafter called number acuity. We show that number acuity improves with age in typically developing children. In dyscalculics, numerical acuity is severely impaired, with 10 -year-old dyscalculics scoring {{at the level of}} 5 -year-old normally developing children. Moreover, the severity of the number acuity impairment predicts the <b>defective</b> <b>performance</b> on tasks involving the manipulation of symbolic numbers. These results establish {{for the first time a}} clear association between dyscalculia and impaired ‘‘number sense”, and they may open up new horizons for the early diagnosis and rehabilitation of mathematical learning deficits...|$|R

The absence of any language disorder, general mental deterioration or other cognitive impairments in this patient allowed an in-depth study of AT.

However, A does such a careless job painting the house that B has to pay another painter $400 to correct A's work. If C sues B to collect the debt, B can raise his counterclaim for the expenses caused by the poor paint job, and can reduce the amount owed to C by that $400, leaving only $100 to be collected.|$|R
40|$|Background: Motor and nonmotor timing {{functions}} and cross-modal processing of visual-tactile signals {{may be linked}} to basal ganglia. These neural structures are thought to be dysfunctional in dystonia. Objective: To test whether cross-modal stimulation influences deficits of temporal discrimination in dystonia. Methods: Eight patients with generalized dystonia and 10 control subjects were asked to discriminate whether pairs of unimodal (tactile or visual) and cross-modal (visual and tactile) stimuli were simultaneous or sequential and, in the latter case, which stimulus preceded the other. Visual stimuli consisted of red lights and tactile stimuli of non-noxious electrical shocks. Intervals between stimuli in each pair were increased from 0 to 400 msee (in steps of 10 msec). Results: Patients with dystonia recognized the asynchrony between the experimental stimuli and judged correctly which stimulus in a pair came first, at significantly longer intervals than did controls. Moreover, differences in performance between patients and controls were maximal for cross-modal stimuli. The <b>defective</b> <b>performance</b> of patients with dystonia in the cross-modal combinations showed a high positive correlation with the severity of symptoms. Conclusions: Patients with generalized dystonia present with difficulties both in timing {{functions and}} in cross-modal processing of visual-tactile stimuli...|$|R

40|$|Learning new {{information}} {{is crucial in}} daily activities and occurs continuously during a subject’s lifetime. Retention of learned material is required for later recall and reuse, although learning capacity is limited and interference between consecutively learned information may occur. Learning processes are impaired in Parkinson’s disease (PD); however, {{little is known about}} the processes related to retention and interference. The aim of this study is to investigate the retention and anterograde interference using a declarative sequence learning task in drug-naive patients in the disease’s early stages. Eleven patients with PD and eleven age-matched controls learned a visuomotor sequence, SEQ 1, during Day 1; the following day, retention of SEQ 1 was assessed and, immediately after, a new sequence of comparable complexity, SEQ 2, was learned. The comparison of the learning rates of SEQ 1 on Day 1 and SEQ 2 on Day 2 assessed the anterograde interference of SEQ 1 on SEQ 2. We found that SEQ 1 performance improved in both patients and controls on Day 2. Surprisingly, controls learned SEQ 2 better than SEQ 1, suggesting the absence of anterograde interference and the occurrence of learning optimization, a process that we defined as “learning how to learn. ” Patients with PD lacked such improvement, suggesting <b>defective</b> <b>performance</b> optimization processes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} Parkinson Disease (PD) {{patients}} are impaired at perceiving emotions from facial and prosodic cues and whether any putative <b>defective</b> <b>performance</b> concerns {{recognition of a}} particular emotion. BACKGROUND: Braak et al. [1] demonstrated that in different stages PD pathology involves the nigrostriatal system, the amygdala, and the insular cortex. Discrete brain lesions to these structures can cause selective deficits in recognising facial and prosodic stimuli expressing particular emotions. However, the investigation of facial and prosodic emotional processing in PD patients has lead to conflicting results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared 27 cognitively unimpaired PD patients with control subjects {{by means of the}} Facial Emotion Recognition Battery and the Emotional Prosody Recognition Battery. RESULTS: PD patients were impaired in recognising, selecting, and matching facial affects. In particular, the Facial Emotion Recognition Battery demonstrated a severe impairment in recognising sad and fearful faces. In the Emotional Prosody Recognition Battery PD patients demonstrated a diffuse impairment, including the recognition of emotional and propositional prosody. CONCLUSIONS: Face emotion processing is impaired in PD patients, with a disproportionate deficit involving fear and sadness. The pattern of face expression processing impairment in PD patients might depend on the regional distribution of the pathology. The widespread involvement of both emotional and propositional prosodic processing parallels the aprosodic characteristics of Parkinsonian speech production...|$|R

Martin Šíp Praha 2016 RESUME This thesis aims to {{describe}} the legal regulations applicable to defects of tours as enshrined in the Civil Code of 2012. Based on the analysis of various defects of tours, I {{have come to the}} concept of defects of tours in the Czech law and have assessed whether the defects of tours allows liberation reasons or not. When dealing with the issue chosen, I analysed the sources of inspiration for the interpretation and inference of legal concepts of the current legislation applicable to defects of tours, which present interpretive guidance for the interpretation and understanding of the defects of tours. First, I analysed the regulation of the consequences of a breach of contract as contained in the Package Tour Directive, which is a model for defects of tours in the Czech law and which regulates the reasons for liberation from the responsibility of a tour organiser for any breach of contract. Within the Czech legal order, I examined the relationship between the defects of tours and compensation for damage incurred as a result of any breach of a tour contract. I also considered the possibility of applicability of the general regulation of <b>defective</b> <b>performance</b> to defects of tours. Finally, I tried to define the defects of tours in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} continued existence and enforceability of exemption clauses {{within the framework of}} the subsequent movement towards consumer protection. It is argued that the provisions of the Act will lead to the consequence that unfair exemption clauses will be phased out because it could be declared void in terms of this Act and consequently its use will become impractical. Although exemption clauses can be viewed as an essential part of most contracts, such clauses are regarded as one of the most contentious clauses in practice, because they usually exclude the liability of the supplier for losses resulting from <b>defective</b> <b>performance.</b> This Act will lead to a shift away from the strict rule of freedom of contract towards a position of consumer awareness and fair contracting. The Act further provides consumers with the right to, inter alia, good quality goods and services and guarantees these rights by prescribing and controlling the liability of the suppliers. As a result, liability due to defective goods and services may no longer be exempted through exemption clauses. Disputes regarding the fairness of such clauses must further also be considered in view of the guidelines set out in the Act. This study however welcomes the enactment of the Act and believes that it could benefit the country as a whole. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.
