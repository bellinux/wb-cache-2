40|$|The book {{begins with}} a quote from J. H. Dales’ Pollution, Property, and Prices, "If it is {{feasible}} to <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>to</b> implement a policy, no policy-maker can afford to do without one. " This book provides important {{evidence in support of}} Dales’ statement. The book is a thorough examination of the first several years of the U. S. Acid Rain Program. This innovative program uses a cap-and-trade approach, rather than the traditional command-and-control approach, to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions. The book offers substantial evidence of the program’s success. The analysis is of both practical and scientific importance. From a practical viewpoint, the acid rain program is an ambitious effort to reduce a major pollutant. It is important for us to understand whether the program is successful and how it might be improved. From a scientific viewpoint, the authors’ analysis provides a framework and methodology for evaluating similar programs. There is much we can learn about effective regulation from the analysis.

This name is derived from the Clarisse religious order who used to have a monastery at this location, when it still was a sandy hill (Jer refers in the local dialect to dirt, thus unpaved, as contrary to the adjacent Stiënkarlisse, the former paved Graanmarkt, now Herbert Hooverplein). In 1783 the monastery was abolished and the city of Leuven bought the estate from the Belgian authorities, who had inherited it, in order <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> dedicated <b>to</b> the sale of wood.

40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} based on {{research}} that seeks to estimate the probabilities that the purchaser of a given property will have certain characteristics. The use of ordered probit models for this use is explained. Ordered probit models are used {{with the number of}} houses previously owned as the dependent variable. This is modeled with an array of independent variables that are property attributes such as building area, condition and location. The aim is <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>marketing</b> tool <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> the probabilities of particular buyer groups, buying a specific property. The basis of this research is a survey of some 3000 house purchasers who purchased detached and semi detached houses in Adelaide over the period June 1994 to March 1997. Results are presented as a spreadsheet where particular property attributes are entered and the probability of specific buyer groups are calculated from the ordered probit models.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the impact that performance based contracting (PBC) can have on program management in the Department of Defense. Interviews are utilized to gather information from Army, Navy, and Marine Corps program Management Offices involved in the acquisition process. The study identifies how program management has been affected by the implementation of PBC and describes its use in three DoD acquisition programs. The advantages, disadvantages, and risks associated with PBC are analyzed to determine potential areas for improvement of the process, and the study develops guidelines that future program managers can use in the setup of PBC acquisitions. Based on key findings and conclusions, the study recommends the Government determine metrics for measurement of the effectiveness and efficiency of PBC, evaluate the waiver process associated with this initiative, and increase the training opportunities for the acquisition workforce. The study further recommends that DoD <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>marketing</b> plan <b>to</b> foster positive cultural change towards PBC and outlines a number of areas for further research. NAU.

40|$|EU law <b>establishes</b> <b>an</b> {{internal}} <b>market.</b> <b>To</b> {{achieve that}} goal, it acts {{to a large}} extent as a regulator, setting standards. These standards are often legally binding inside of the jurisdiction of the European Union, but increasingly travel beyond the borders of the European Union {{on the back of the}} traded goods. In some areas, this leads to a “Brussels Effect,” where EU standards factually harmonize legislation at transnational level, creating a “race to the top” in international standards. This generates a level playing field for transnational trade, directed by the European Union as a de facto transnational regulator. Professor Anu Bradford brought forward the argument that a de facto or de jure transnational harmonization by EU standards might be facilitated or constrained by the World Trade Organization (“WTO”). The WTO could strike down such regulations as purely domestic ones without taking into account the fact that these EU standards have factually already achieved what the WTO aspires: removing barriers to trade between its member countries by establishing equal treatment of all trading partners as the norm. We will call this phenomenon of the Brussels Effect the “Reversed Harmonization Effect. ” The WTO could also facilitate the Brussels Effect by providing a specific forum for negotiations, which favors the European Union as a dominant regulator, leading to a horizontalization of standards across the WTO. One may hence claim normatively that the WTO should take into account a broader view on the economic effect of these measures beyond their formal domestic jurisdiction by differing between domestic and horizontalized standard...|$|R

40|$|The Chinese currency, Renminbi Yuan (RMB), has had {{restricted}} convertibility {{outside the}} mainland, namely in Hong Kong, from early 2004. From July 2009, much wider convertibility has been permitted, with the RMB {{being used as}} a cross-border trade settlement currency. This paper attempts to assess the factors that have motivated RMB internationalisation, and the role Hong Kong has played in the process, against the background of China’s evolving foreign exchange markets and the RMB exchange rate benchmarking to the Hong Kong market. It shows that China’s ultimate goal of full convertibility of the capital account has provided the underlying motivation for RMB internationalisation, and that the 2008 global financial crisis acted as a catalyst in the process. With the political blessing of the central authorities and its extensive business and financial links with the mainland, Hong Kong has gradually <b>established</b> <b>an</b> RMB offshore <b>market</b> <b>to</b> supplement capital account liberalisations on the Mainland.

40|$|The authors examine risk {{management}} options for Egyptian cottons, the export prices for which are volatile. They use regression analysis to establish whether Egyptian cotton's prices can be effectively hedged by using existing futures contracts on the New York Cotton Exchange. They find {{no relationship between}} the movements in prices of Egyptian long and extra-long cottons and prices for the base quality of U. S. medium staple cotton traded on the New York futures market. (Probably because Egyptian cotton prices are government-determined, U. S. medium staple cotton prices are influenced by price support policies unrelated to the longer staple markets, and the fiber of the cottons analyzed have different physical characteristics.) So, the New York cotton futures market's No. 2 contract is not an appropriate mechanism for hedging the price risk facing Egyptian cotton under present procedures for determining prices - and probably not under market-determined prices. If the cotton market in Egypt is liberalized, cotton prices there may correlate more with prices elsewhere - especially for the longer staple cottons. The authors extend their regression analysis to the prices of other medium staple cottons - Australian, Central Asian, Mexican, Pakistani, and Turkish - to determine how they behave relative to U. S. medium staple cotton prices. None of these prices had short-term movements closely related to U. S. cotton prices, indicating mainly the influence of domestic policies on the U. S. market. Again, the New York futures No. 2 contract {{does not provide a}} satisfactory hedge for these cottons. The cotton futures contract recently introduced in New York (world cotton contract) - based on the Cotlook A Index - may prove useful for hedging the price risk for some cottons (especially Australian, Central Asian, and Pakistani) but apparently not Egyptian cotton. The authors recommend (together with privatizing the industry) <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> domestic spot <b>market</b> <b>to</b> give transparency to the price-forming process. When the spot market is functioning well, <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> foward <b>market</b> could provide <b>a</b> hedging instrument for Egyptian cotton.

40|$|Building consumers’ {{brand loyalty}} {{has always been}} of major {{importance}} for brands. Many previous studies have comprehensively studies how consumers’ brand loyalty is affected through brand satisfaction and brand trust from different perspectives. However, {{in the development of}} new technologies, social media gradually {{plays an important role in}} people’s daily life. In the same time, social media based brand community appeared corresponding to this development and a growing number of brands became alert to this change and began to use this platform to build their consumers’ brand loyalty. As a result, how brand satisfaction and brand trust would influence consumers’ brand loyalty nowadays in social media based brand communities became of great interest for marketers and companies. Moreover, social media based brand communities are beyond the limitation of national boundaries. And therefore if brands want <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>an</b> effective <b>marketing</b> strategy <b>to</b> strengthen consumers’ brand loyalty through social media based brand communities in a global context, they should take culture into consideration. In the meantime, shopping experiences with a brand could have more impact than product features and product benefits and leaves a more memorable impression on consumers so that consumers with different levels of shopping experience may have different attitudes towards a brand in social media based brand communities. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to study and investigate how brand satisfaction and brand trust from a separate perspective would influence brand loyalty in social media based brand communities when considering the effects of cultural difference and consumers’ level of shopping experiences on brand loyalty in social media based brand communities so as to provide more comprehensive and profound suggestions for marketers to develop appropriate and efficient marketing strategies under targeted international marketing backgrounds.
