25|$|At {{the behest}} of our leader Herzl, I came to Basle to make {{preparations}} for the Zionist Congress. Among many other problems that occupied me then was one that contained something of {{the essence of the}} Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck me. We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So <b>I</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.|$|E
25|$|In 1304, King Albert <b>I</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> Gothic three-nave choir to be {{constructed}} {{east of the}} church, wide enough to meet {{the tips of the}} old transepts. Under his son Duke Albert II, work continued on the Albertine choir, which was consecrated in 1340 on the 77th anniversary of the previous consecration. The middle nave is largely dedicated to St. Stephen and All Saints, while the north and south nave, are dedicated to St. Mary and the Apostles respectively. Duke Rudolf IV, the Founder, Albert II's son, expanded the choir again to increase the religious clout of Vienna. On 7 April 1359, Rudolf IV laid the cornerstone for a westward Gothic extension of the Albertine choir {{in the vicinity of the}} present south tower. This expansion would eventually encapsulate the entirety of the old church, and in 1430, the edifice of the old church was removed from within as work progressed on the new cathedral. The south tower was completed in 1433, and vaulting of the nave took place from 1446 to 1474. The foundation for a north tower was laid in 1450, and construction began under master Lorenz Spenning, but its construction was abandoned when major work on the cathedral ceased in 1511.|$|E
2500|$|Patriarch Michael <b>I</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> {{letter to}} be written to the bishop of Trani in which he {{attacked}} the [...] "Judaistic" [...] practices of the West, namely the use of unleavened bread. The letter was to be sent by John to all the bishops of the West, including the Pope. John promptly complied and the letter was passed to one Humbert of Mourmoutiers, the cardinal-bishop of Silva Candida, who translated the letter into Latin {{and brought it to}} the Pope, who ordered a reply to be made to each charge and a defence of papal supremacy to be laid out in a response.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} protect this growing trade, Tsar Alexis <b>I</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> naval {{shipbuilding}} program. [...] The shipyard was constructed south-east of Moscow in Dedinovo, a town on the Oka River in present-day Moscow Oblast. [...] The project was placed under the Novgorod Chancery, supervised by the boyar Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin. [...] Experienced sailors were hired from Amsterdam, and the Karnelius van Bockhoiven, a Dutchman living in Moscow, was hired for his shipbuilding expertise. The Oryol was the first large ship produced, along with a yacht and two smaller vessels. [...] It was a three-masted sailing ship, 24.5 meters in length, 6.5 m wide, and displacing 250 metric tons. [...] It had a crew of 23 sailors and 35 soldiers, and was armed with 22 guns.|$|E

2500|$|The {{commissioning}} of {{the very}} powerful Italian s in 1880 caused a naval scare in Austria-Hungary, prompting Kaiser Franz Josef <b>I</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>a</b> joint army-navy commission to examine the problem. Pöck argued that the fleet would have to seek parity with the Italian fleet, which planned to build a fleet of sixteen battleships by 1888. Archduke Albrecht, then the inspector general of the army, argued that parity was impossible, and that the navy would have to focus instead on defensive weapons and tactics. In response, Pöck formulated a new fleet plan in 1881 that aimed simply to maintain the number of ironclads in service, replacing only the oldest four by 1888. Two would be replaced by new ships, {{and the other two}} would be [...] "rebuilt" [...] like the Kaiser Maxes a decade earlier. The plan was accepted by parliament, but they delayed its completion to 1892, which would reduce the annual expenditure from 2.15million gulden to 1.7million.|$|E

60|$|I {{went back}} to the restaurant. It was like a hundred others of its class--stuffy, smelly, {{reminiscent}} of the poorer business quarters of a foreign city.
