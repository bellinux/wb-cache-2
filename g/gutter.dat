5|$|Mack 10 left Priority Records after The Paper Route, and {{his next}} album, Bang or Ball (2001), was {{released}} through Cash Money and Universal Records. His album sales continued to decelerate with his 2003 album, Ghetto, <b>Gutter</b> & Gangsta, which was released through Bungalo Records. In 2005, he released Hustla's Handbook under Capitol Records. The album did {{significantly better than}} his previous, peaking at number sixty-five on the Billboard 200—forty places above Ghetto, <b>Gutter</b> & Gangsta. His most recent solo album, Soft White (2009), was released through Fontana Distribution and at number 141, it is his lowest charting album on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|Many booklet stamps can be {{identified}} by one non-perforated edge, though a few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a <b>gutter</b> dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. The <b>gutter</b> was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those panes could be stitched on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E
5000|$|The first mass {{production}} cars without any visible rain <b>gutters</b> were the 1975 AMC Pacer and Chevrolet Monza. Other vehicles were introduced {{on the market}} with hidden rain <b>gutters</b> during the 1980s, and by 1990, vehicles with external rain <b>gutters</b> were becoming rare.|$|R
25|$|Leaking <b>gutters</b> and downspouts {{can cause}} serious {{damage to a}} building's {{interior}} and exterior. Copper {{is a good choice}} for <b>gutters</b> and downspouts because it makes strong leak-proof joints. <b>Gutters</b> and downspouts made with copper are expected to outlast other metal materials and plastics. Even in corrosion-prone seacoast environments or in areas with acid rain or smog, copper <b>gutters</b> and downspouts can provide 50 years or more of service.|$|R
50|$|High {{maintenance}} <b>guttering</b> scheme:To {{simplify the}} drainage of the pathways and avenues, Ted Hollamby {{did not use}} the standard design of external <b>guttering</b> for the roofs, with multiple drain pipes along a terrace. Instead he designed <b>gutters</b> which were integral with the roof leading to one drain pipe {{at the end of the}} terrace. This simplified land drainage of the paths and avenues. Supposedly the maintenance costs for this scheme are higher than for traditional <b>guttering</b> methods, but this hasn't been proven, and integral <b>guttering</b> used in Europe and the US over the last half century doesn't carry a maintenance premium over and above conventional <b>guttering.</b> Ted Hollamby did not foresee the abolition of property taxes, and shrinking of the council tax base, and the sale of council houses and reduction in the council rental income. The consequential reduction in the council maintenance budgets, has meant that the requirement to clear the <b>gutters</b> frequently, has not been fulfilled. On a number of occasions the <b>gutters</b> have got blocked and overflowed, which has let to damage to some of the brickwork.|$|R
5|$|In Pezuelas Lebrón {{began her}} {{education}} in a small community school. Early in her life, Lebrón contracted pneumonia when she accidentally fell into a <b>gutter</b> that was full of water, as a consequence she grew with a frail body {{and was unable to}} keep up with the constant activities of her brothers without feeling fatigue. She developed an introverted and contemplative personality, often spending her time admiring nature around the hacienda.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{has many}} uses in the {{construction}} industry; lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, flashing, gutters and <b>gutter</b> joints, and on roof parapets. Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. Lead is still used in statues and sculptures, including for armatures. In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased {{out in favor of}} other materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene of}} the crime which took place along Bathurst Gardens showed the course of events of the violent confrontation. Pryce's book and gloves were lying outside No 56, a silver Audi car was smeared with blood outside No 82 and a list of wedding venues outside 84. Pryce was found {{collapsed}} in the <b>gutter</b> between parked cars outside No 90.|$|E
50|$|The {{philatelist}} makes {{a distinction}} between horizontal and vertical <b>gutters.</b> A specific characteristic of the <b>gutters</b> {{is the heart of}} the printing sheet, where all four panes are connected. <b>Gutters</b> and hearts are very popular with collectors and reach high catalog prices, especially for classic issues.|$|R
50|$|The empty fields {{connecting}} the single counter sheets are called <b>gutters.</b> Normally they are separated {{in the middle}} after printing {{in order to obtain}} four counter sheets. The half empty fields or <b>gutters</b> then form the edge of the sheet. However, from many issues, unseparated <b>gutters</b> with connected stamps of the neighbouring sheets come on the market (stamp - empty field - stamp). These <b>gutters</b> may be either empty or printed, if printed edges were intended.|$|R
50|$|They {{are also}} sometimes, but {{incorrectly}} {{referred to as}} other paracolic <b>gutters.</b> Paracolic <b>gutters</b> are recesses between the abdominal wall and the colon.|$|R
5|$|The {{police had}} only two clues: some {{footprints}} in the garden, and a hat that they found in a nearby <b>gutter.</b> The police took moulds of the footprints and endeavored to trace the hat, but with no success. However, during routine questioning of local residents, police learned that earlier in {{the afternoon of the}} murder, a man had been seen sitting with a heavily-pregnant young woman on a bench at one end of South Cliff Avenue; the man had also been seen wandering the street while the young woman sat on the bench alone, leading police to suspect that the man was assessing the lay of the land.|$|E
5|$|A third {{issue was}} made up of seven labels and issued in decimal {{currency}} in the following values: 1p, 1p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 7p and 8p. In the fourth issue the 3p, 4p and 5p values were reissued in non-watermarked paper on 20 March 1978. A new design, printed by photogravure, and appeared on 20 June 1980 in ten values: 1p, 2p, 4p, 6p, 8p, 18p, 20p, 24p, 30p and 50p made up the fifth issue. The sheet format was two panes of 100 divided by a <b>gutter</b> margin. The sixth issue consisted of ten newly designed labels by Q Design and lithographically printed by ISSP on non-watermarked paper on 6 October 1988. The values were: 1p, 2p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 17p, 20p, 24p, 30p, 50p and £1. No Euro currency postage dues have been produced.|$|E
5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the <b>gutter</b> in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E
50|$|Cast iron <b>gutters</b> were {{introduced}} in the late 18th century {{as an alternative to}} lead. Cast iron enabled eaves <b>gutters</b> to be mass-produced: they were rigid and non-porous while lead could only be used as a liner within timber <b>gutters.</b> Installation was a single process and didn't require heat. They could be attached directly to the fascia board. Cast iron <b>gutters</b> are still specified for restoration work in conservation areas, but are usually replaced with cast aluminium made to the same profile. Extruded aluminium <b>gutters</b> can be made to a variety of profiles from a roll of aluminium sheet on site in lengths of up to 30m. They feature internal brackets at 400mm spacing.|$|R
50|$|Placement of {{heat trace}} cable on roofs or in <b>gutters</b> to melt ice during winter months. When used in <b>gutters</b> the cable {{is not meant to}} keep the <b>gutters</b> free of ice or snow, but only to provide a free path for the melted water to get off the roof and down the {{downspout}} or drain piping.|$|R
50|$|In UK {{commercial}} and European {{commercial and}} domestic architecture, <b>guttering</b> {{is made from}} zinc. Metal <b>gutters</b> with bead stiffened fronts is governed in the UK by BS EN612:2005.|$|R
5|$|At the {{procession}} to George's lying in state in Westminster Hall {{part of the}} Imperial State Crown fell from {{on top of the}} coffin and landed in the <b>gutter</b> as the cortège turned into New Palace Yard. The new king, Edward VIII, saw it fall and wondered whether it was a bad omen for his new reign. As a mark of respect to their father, George's four surviving sons, Edward, Albert, Henry, and George, mounted the guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes, at the catafalque on the night before the funeral. The vigil was not repeated until the death of George's daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. George V was interred at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 28 January 1936. Edward abdicated before the year was out, leaving his brother Albert, Duke of York, to ascend the throne (taking the regnal name George VI).|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a <b>gutter</b> for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the <b>gutter</b> or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
50|$|Clogged <b>gutters</b> {{can also}} cause water ingress into the {{building}} as the water backs up. Clogged <b>gutters</b> {{can also lead to}} stagnant water build up which in some climates allows mosquitoes to breed.|$|R
50|$|The {{cafeteria}} and <b>gutters</b> are {{the spots}} students congregate during breaks or free hours. The <b>gutters</b> are popular hangouts for intellectual conversation {{and often the}} birthplace of artistic or culturally significant initiatives by students.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Gutters</b> and downspouts {{are used}} to catch rain water as it falls and to {{discharge}} it away from houses and buildings. When <b>gutters</b> are clogged or downspouts are broken, rainwater is absorbed by the soil near the foundation, increasing hydrostatic pressure.|$|R
5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the <b>gutter,</b> crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} hall was flanked {{on either side}} by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard. The one on the west contained washing facilities and a <b>gutter</b> leading to a soak-away in {{the central part of}} the building, the room to the east may possibly have been a guardroom. On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level. The function of these rooms is uncertain, but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of the mansio. The largest room in the mansio lay in the north-east corner, the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after the building was first completed.|$|E
5|$|Victor's death {{scene was}} filmed outside The Bridge Hotel and pub at Shawford railway bridge, {{next to the}} River Itchen, Hampshire, on 21 July 2000. The cold {{temperature}} {{on the night of}} the shoot and the various technical considerations meant that the scene did not have a big emotional impact upon the cast and crew during filming. However, Renwick briefly felt emotional as he watched Victor's arm falling into the shot and his cap drift away in the <b>gutter.</b> After the exterior sequences had been filmed, the remainder of the episode was recorded at BBC Television Centre in West London on 17 September 2000. Unlike the location shoot, Renwick was too concerned with the complexities of filming to be emotionally affected by the filming of the final episode.|$|E
50|$|In Saxon times, the thanes erected {{buildings}} with large overhanging roofs {{to throw the}} water clear of the walls {{in the same way}} that occurs in thatched cottages. The cathedral builder used lead parapet <b>gutters,</b> with elaborate gargoyles for the same purpose. With the dissolution of the monasteries- those buildings were recycled and there was plenty of lead that could be used for secular building. The yeoman would use wooden <b>gutters</b> or lead lined wooden <b>gutters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} smaller {{concrete}} arch culverts, similar in construction {{to the bridge}} over Little Crystal Creek, and sections of dry stone walling (battering) and stone-paved <b>gutters</b> at various points along {{the full length of}} the road. The sections of stone <b>guttering</b> range from 10m to 140m in length and were constructed only where needed to divert run-off into pipe culverts. Most of the stone <b>guttering</b> occurs on the left-hand side of the road on the drive up the range, although one section of <b>guttering</b> survives {{on the outside of the}} slope, some 2.8 km from the beginning of the road. Over 200 reinforced concrete culverts, or [...] "pipe culverts", occur along the road.|$|R
50|$|Not all streets have <b>gutters,</b> {{and they}} are most often found in areas of a city which have high {{pedestrian}} traffic. In past centuries when urban streets did not have sanitary sewers, <b>gutters</b> were made deep enough to serve that purpose as well.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Gutter</b> Twins is {{the long-awaited}} {{collaboration}} between Mark Lanegan and former Afghan Whigs/current Twilight Singers vocalist Greg Dulli. Working on a collaborative album {{since at least}} 2003, the pair first played as The <b>Gutter</b> Twins in Rome in September 2005.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gutter</b> Ballet was an {{unpublished}} Broadway project Paul O'Neill {{wrote back}} in 1979. In 1989, Savatage already used this title for their previous album {{but decided to}} focus their next release, , on it. Trans-Siberian Orchestra reprised, in recent years, the idea to release a <b>Gutter</b> Ballet musical close to O'Neill original script featuring Savatage's music as well.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{who prefer}} {{homelessness}} and wish to remain off the grid {{for political and}} ideological purposes. Often self-identified as <b>Gutter</b> Punks or Urban Survivalists. The Department of Housing and Urban Development rarely reports on this counter-cultural movement since <b>Gutter</b> Punks and similar individuals often refuse to participate in governmental studies and do not seek governmental assistance for ideological or political purposes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Guttering</b> in its {{earliest}} form consisted of lined wooden or stone troughs. Lead {{was a popular}} liner and is still used in pitched valley <b>gutters.</b> Many materials {{have been used to}} make guttering: cast iron, asbestos cement, UPVC (PVCu), cast and extruded aluminium, wood, and bamboo.|$|R
50|$|All Dominos (as {{indeed is}} the case with most {{fibreglass}} car body shells) are seamless and thus feature none of the distinctive <b>guttering</b> found on a steel shelled Mini. Some owners choose to add their own sections of <b>gutters</b> above doorways to avoid being dripped on.|$|R
