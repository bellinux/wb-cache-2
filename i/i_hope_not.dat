2500|$|In 1901 Wilson {{spent nine}} months working under Ian Hamilton in the War Office, working to {{allocate}} {{honours and awards}} from the recent South African War. He himself received a Mentioned in Despatches as [...] "an officer of considerable ability" [...] who displayed [...] "energy and success", and a Distinguished Service Order, which Aylmer Haldane later claimed Wilson had insisted on receiving out of jealousy {{that he had been}} awarded it. Wilson was also recommended for brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel on attaining a substantive majority. On 31 December, referring to the bruising of egos involved in the distribution of honours (Nicholson and Kelly-Kenny both felt that they had received insufficient recognition), he commented that the job had [...] "lost some of my old friends, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>not</b> many".|$|E
2500|$|Derek Chavis of the Baltimore Sun {{gave the}} episode a more {{negative}} review, saying [...] "While {{it seems the}} productions of each number are getting bigger, the show’s spirit gets smaller. Does Ryan Murphy think that because American Horror Story is amazing he can slack off on Glee? <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>not.</b> It was officially announced recently that Glee will end after next season (Season 6) so let’s end this show as great as we started it, shall we?" [...] Lauren Hoffman of Vulture gave the episode a 2 out of 5, signaling mixed to negative reviews, saying [...] "The main problem with last night’s episode is that “Are you a Katy or a Gaga?” isn’t a particularly interesting question. I’m not even sure what that question is asking. Lady Gaga and Katy Perry certainly aren’t the same , but they’re not exactly polar opposites." [...] Despite negative reviews of the episode's theme, she did comment positively on Adam Lambert's role, calling his audition [...] "undeniably great." ...|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{reception}} that Vestiges received, and the mockery {{which was}} made of its evolutionary ideas, has been cited by some historians as a factor leading to Darwin's caution in publishing his own theory of evolution. In a letter to Thomas Henry Huxley in 1854 (five years before his own book on evolution was published but twelve years after its ideas had first been sketched out in an unpublished essay), Darwin expressed sympathy for the (still anonymous) author of Vestiges {{in the face of}} a savage review by Huxley: [...] "I must think that such a book, if it does no other good, spreads the taste for Natural Science. But I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox about species as the Vestiges itself, though <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>not</b> quite so unphilosophical." [...] However, later the same year, in a letter to Hooker, Darwin mentioned Vestiges in a more sober tone: [...] "I should have less scruple in troubling you if I had any confidence what my work would turn out. Sometimes I think it will be good, at other times I really feel as much ashamed of myself as the author of the Vestiges ought to be of himself." ...|$|E
