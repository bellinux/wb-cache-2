5|$|Steuart was {{exchanged}} {{later in}} the summer of 1864, returning to command a brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia, in the division of Major General George Pickett. Steuart's brigade consisted of the 9th, 14th, 38th, 53rd and 57th Virginia regiments, and served in the trenches north of the James River during the Siege of Petersburg (June 9, 1864– March 25, 1865). By this stage of the war, Confederate supplies had dwindled to the point where Lee's army began to go <b>hungry,</b> <b>and</b> the theft of food became a serious problem. Steuart was forced to send armed guards to the supply depot at Petersburg {{in order to ensure that}} his men's packages were not stolen by looters.|$|E
5|$|The Confederates {{continued}} their pursuit on July 25. However, all soldiers were soaked in cold hard rain, {{and by now}} were <b>hungry</b> <b>and</b> thirsty. An ambush by Hayes' men brought the Confederate pursuit to a halt. Powell's cavalry brigade was used to drive the Confederates back. Crook was ordered to retreat north across the Potomac River, and the Confederates reoccupied Martinsville (in addition to controlling Winchester). While most of Averell's division camped at Hagerstown, Maryland, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry guarded a river crossing near Shepherdstown, West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The French Resistance in Paris rose {{against the}} Germans on 19 August. Eisenhower {{initially}} wanted {{to bypass the}} city to pursue other targets, but amid reports that the citizens were going <b>hungry</b> <b>and</b> Hitler's stated intention to destroy it, de Gaulle insisted {{that it should be}} taken immediately. French forces of the 2nd Armoured Division under General Philippe Leclerc arrived from the west on 24 August, while the U.S. 4th Infantry Division pressed up from the south. Scattered fighting continued throughout the night, and by the morning of 25 August Paris was liberated.|$|E

5|$|The Pranatoshini Tantra (18th century) narrates two {{tales of}} Chhinnamasta's birth. One legend, {{attributed}} to the Narada-pancharatra, tells how once, while bathing in Mandakini river, Parvati becomes sexually excited, and turns black. At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely <b>hungry</b> <b>and</b> beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads herself with her nails and gives her blood to satisfy their hunger. Later, they return home after Parvati rejoins her head.|$|E
5|$|To {{art critic}} Robert Hughes, the {{painting}} represents {{the theme of}} family continuity, virtue, homeliness, and abundance without extravagance in a Puritan tone, as confirmed by the modest beverage choice of water. Historian Lizabeth Cohen says that by depicting this freedom as a celebration in the private family home rather than a worker with a job or a government protecting the <b>hungry</b> <b>and</b> homeless, Rockwell suggests that ensuring this freedom was not as much a government responsibility as something born from participation in the mass consumer economy.|$|E
5|$|When Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) are {{threatened}} with banishment by Michael after they constantly gaze happily on each other, Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) invites {{them to have}} lunch with her and her husband Bob Vance (Robert R. Shafer). Their meal initially goes well, but Phyllis and Bob disappear for a while after their food arrives. <b>Hungry</b> <b>and</b> not wanting to be rude by eating before they get back, Jim and Pam check the bathrooms and hear Phyllis and Bob having sex in the disabled bathroom. Phyllis and Bob finally come back to their table and Jim and Pam lose their appetites and look on in disgust as Phyllis and Bob seductively put food in each other's mouths.|$|E

Needy goes to the school library's occult section and determines that Jennifer is a succubus; she is weakest when she is <b>hungry</b> <b>and</b> must feed on flesh in order to sustain her life and appearance. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him {{in order to protect}} him. Chip still goes to the dance, hoping to meet with Needy, but is instead intercepted by Jennifer, who seduces him and takes him to an abandoned pool house. Needy arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip. Needy tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer, hovering in the air, attacks her. She is then stabbed with a pool skimmer by a fatally injured Chip. Jennifer escapes while Needy watches her boyfriend die.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, Kabandha {{appeared}} before them. The demon blocked {{the path of}} the brothers, who tried to escape by taking a different route, but were finally caught by Kabandha. The demon grabbed Rama in his right arm and Lakshmana in his left. Finding themselves helpless in Kabandha's clutches, Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita, leaving him behind as a sacrifice to the demon. Rama consoled him. Kabandha declared that he was extremely <b>hungry</b> <b>and</b> asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger. At this time, Lakshmana realized that the strength of the demon lay in his hands and suggested that they cut off the demon's hands. Annoyed by the brothers' conversation, Kabandha decided to eat them at once and drew them closer to his mouth. The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of the demon, who fell down with a mighty roar.|$|E
5|$|The Dhumavati Tantra {{describes}} {{her as an}} old and ugly widow. She is thin, tall, unhealthy, and has a pale complexion. She is described as restless and wicked. Unadorned with jewellery, she wears old, dirty clothes and has dishevelled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and crooked, {{and some of her}} long fang-like teeth have fallen out, leaving her smile with gaps. Her ears are ugly and rough; her breasts hang down. In one of her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always <b>hungry</b> <b>and</b> thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E
