5000|$|The show did {{not meet}} with {{commercial}} success during its run on Kids WB! and on Cartoon Network's Toonami block, a fact that is hinted at during the review for the tie-in game Astro Boy: Omega Factor with comments such as, [...] "Astro Boy receive any love here in the States".

That, plus the <b>general</b> <b>switch</b> of the show's visuals from childish simplistic to near 3-D complexity, and the name changes for so many of the main characters (from Uran to Zoran and Dr. Elefun to Dr. O'Shay) were deemed by the older fans to be unnecessary for a formerly plot-driven show.|$|E

In either case the interior was normally lined with a refractory fireclay. In some cases, especially in later periods, the fire box was approached by a tunnel. Initially the kilns were fired with wood, but during the Northern Song period (960-1127) there was a <b>general</b> <b>switch</b> to coal, easily found in north China, which required a smaller fire box, but the introduction of saggars to protect the pieces from gritty coal ash.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis, {{based on the}} Forward Flux Sampling (FFS) simulation method, of the switching dynamics and stability of two models of genetic toggle switches, consisting of two mutually-repressing genes encoding transcription factors (TFs); in one model (the exclusive switch), they mutually exclude each other's binding, while in the other model (<b>general</b> <b>switch)</b> the two transcription factors can bind simultaneously to the shared operator region. We assess the role of two pairs of reactions that influence the stability of these switches: TF-TF homodimerisation and TF-DNA association/dissociation. We factorise the flipping rate k into {{the product of the}} probability rho(q*) of finding the system at the dividing surface (separatrix) between the two stable states, and a kinetic prefactor R. In the case of the exclusive switch, the rate of TF-operator binding affects both rho(q*) and R, while the rate of TF dimerisation affects only R. In the case of the <b>general</b> <b>switch</b> both TF-operator binding and TF dimerisation affect k, R and rho(q*). To elucidate this, we analyse the transition state ensemble (TSE). For the exclusive switch, varying the rate of TF-operator binding can drastically change the pathway of switching, while changing the rate of dimerisation changes the switching rate without altering the mechanism. The switching pathways of the <b>general</b> <b>switch</b> are highly robust to changes in the rate constants of both TF-operator and TF-TF binding, even though these rate constants do affect the flipping rate; this feature is unique for non-equilibrium systems.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} age differences in executive functioning, using an externally cued task-switching paradigm. Two components of task switching were assessed: {{the ability to}} maintain and select among task sets (<b>general</b> <b>switch</b> costs) {{and the ability to}} switch between task sets (specific switch costs). In contrast to previous findings, we found large age-related differences in specific switch costs, especially when the number of potentially relevant task sets is increased from two to four. Age-related differences in <b>general</b> <b>switch</b> costs were absent when external task cues subserved executive processing in task switching.

We assess the role of two pairs of reactions that influence the stability of these switches: TF-TF homodimerization and TF-DNA association/dissociation. In both cases, the switch flipping rate increases with the rate of TF dimerization, while it decreases with the rate of TF-operator binding. We factorize the flipping rate k into {{the product of the}} probability ρ(q*) of finding the system at the dividing surface (separatrix) between the two stable states, and a kinetic prefactor R. In the case of the exclusive switch, the rate of TF-operator binding affects both ρ(q*) and R, while the rate of TF dimerization affects only R. The <b>general</b> <b>switch</b> displays a higher flipping rate than the exclusive switch, and both TF-operator binding and TF dimerization affect k, R, and ρ(q*). To elucidate this, we analyze the transition state ensemble. For the exclusive switch, the transition state ensemble is strongly affected by the rate of TF-operator binding, but unaffected by varying the rate of TF-TF binding. Thus, varying the rate of TF-operator binding can drastically change the pathway of switching, while changing the rate of dimerization changes the switching rate without altering the mechanism.
