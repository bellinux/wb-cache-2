Further funds were raised from an edition of Burns' booklet published at Leicester.|$|E

[...] The inaugural Foundation scholar was nobel laureate Linus Pauling and the Foundation has brought many other eminent research chemists to Australia.

60|$|July 6th.--The {{day after}} my arrival, {{by way of}} Lichfield and Uttoxeter, at Liverpool, {{the door of the}} Consulate opened, and in came the very sociable personage who accosted me at the railway station at Leamington. He was on his way towards Edinburgh, to <b>deliver</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> of lectures or a lecture, and had called, he said, to talk with me about spiritualism, being desirous of having the {{judgment}} of a sincere mind on the subject. In his own mind, I should suppose, he is past the stage of doubt and inquiry; for he told me that in every action of his life he is governed by the counsels received from the spiritual world through a medium. I did not inquire whether this medium (who is a small boy) had suggested his visit to me. My remarks to him were quite of a sceptical character in regard to the faith to which he had surrendered himself. He has formerly lived in America, and had had a son born there. He gave me a pamphlet written by himself, on the cure of consumption and other diseases by antiseptic remedies. I hope he will not bore me any more, though he seems to be a very sincere and good man; but these enthusiasts who adopt such extravagant ideas appear to one to lack imagination, instead of being misled by it, as they are generally supposed to be.|$|E
