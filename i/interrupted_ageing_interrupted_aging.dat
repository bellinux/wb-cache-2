40|$|Yield {{strength}} and elongation are both important properties of engineering alloys, but they typically exhibit an inverse correlation and engineers {{are forced to}} design around this constraint in applications of the alloys. It was recently reported that precipitation hardenable Al alloys subjected to {{a new type of}} heat treatment called ‘interrupted ageing’ exhibited simultaneous increases in both yield {{strength and}} elongation, i. e. the inverse correlation was broken. This finding is of considerable technological significance but the physical origin of the effects is not currently understood. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a quantitative explanation for the simultaneous enhancement of yield strength and uniform elongation in age hardenable Al alloys subjected to the <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing</b> schedule. The investigation of the simultaneous improvement of yield strength (y) and uniform elongation (u) in a model Al- 4 Cu- 0. 05 Sn (wt. %) alloy has been the main focus of this work and a quantitative model explaining the improvements has been developed. The experiments confirm the reports of Lumley et al. that simultaneous improvements in both y and u are possible through the <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing</b> procedure. Low temperature ageing of the model Al- 4 Cu- 0. 05 Sn alloy induces the precipitation of a fine distribution of shearable GP zones with no major change in the precipitate distribution that is formed in the elevated temperature step of the <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing</b> schedule. Tensile tests demonstrate that the strain hardening behaviour of the samples with and without GP zones is approximately the same at low strains (< 6 %). However, at strains greater than  6 %, the samples containing GP zones clearly exhibit enhanced strain hardening and this results in the enhanced elongations experimentally measured. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) were used to demonstrate that strain-induced dissolution of GP zones occurs during deformation and this leads to a dynamic repartitioning of Cu into solid solution during straining. A quantitative model has been developed to describe the strain hardening behaviour for the Al-Cu alloy after <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing</b> that includes the effects of strain-induced GP zone dissolution. It is shown that the effect of the dynamically repartitioned Cu in solid solution on the dislocation-dislocation junction strength is able to quantitatively explain the enhanced strain hardening observed experimentally and the resulting enhanced uniform elongation. The model predictions are also qualitatively consistent with experimental observations of the temperature and strain-rate dependence of the deformation behaviour of the alloys. This ‘strain-induced dissolution’ effect requires two key characteristics: a) strain-induced dissolution of shearable precipitate must occur in the strain range of interest and, b) the repartitioned solutes must affect the strain hardening of the matrix in a substantial way. In order to further test this proposed mechanism, the commercial 6061 alloy has also been investigated after <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing.</b> Experimentally it is observed that whilst an increase in the yield strength results from the <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing</b> schedule, no significant increase in uniform elongation is observed, in comparison to material subjected only to the primary ageing condition. DSC results suggest that strain-induced dissolution of GP zones does occur during deformation of <b>interrupted</b> <b>aged</b> 6061. Tensile results show that the effect of the dynamically repartitioned Si and Mg on the strain-hardening behaviour of the matrix is comparatively small compared with Cu. Therefore, even though strain-induced dissolution does accompany deformation, the small effect of Si and Mg on the strain hardening behaviour is probably the reason for the absence of the simultaneous improvement in both yield strength and uniform elongation as observed in the Al- 4 Cu- 0. 05 Sn alloy. Further studies has been carried out to test the potential possibility of simultaneous improvements in y and u in other age hardenable Al alloys (e. g. 7 xxx Al alloys) after <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing.</b> Tensile results show that the effect of Zn (up to 5 wt. %) in solid solution probably does not influence significantly the strain hardening behaviour of Al, suggesting that simultaneous improvements in strength and elongation of 7 xxx series alloys are unlikely. This appears consistent with literature reports of no simultaneous improvement in the yield strength and elongation for the 7050 alloy...|$|R

Experimental results show that, depending on the interruption temperature, two secondary precipitation strengthening regimes exist during re-ageing: below 50 degrees C displaying almost no influence on the peak hardness of the alloy, and above 50 degrees C where a significant increase in hardness is observed. This behavior is modeled using the Kampmann-Wagner numerical (KWN) method. The developed age-hardening model is then combined with the Kocks-Mecking work-hardening model. The results indicate that although secondary precipitation above 50 degrees C could improve the yield strength, hardly does it have any effect on the work hardening behavior of the alloy.

However, once these structures are formed, the long time dynamics is no longer pure ferromagnetic. After a quench from a disordered state to low temperatures the system develops growing domains of stripes (lamellae).

40|$|Al-Mg-Si alloys are heat treatable alloys {{in which}} {{strength}} is obtained by precipitation hardening. Precipitates, formed from a supersaturated solid solution during ageing heat treatment, are GP-zones, B", B´ and B-Mg 2 Si. Precipitation kinetics and strength vary with alloy composition and process parameters. There {{is still a}} need for property and process optimization and therefore to investigate precipitation in this system. Therefore, the general objective is to develop process models to study precipitation kinetics and precipitation sequence in Al-Mg-Si alloys. Precipitates in Al-Mg-Si alloys usually nucleate with a spherical morphology but grow with an elongated shape. An age-hardening model is used to {{study the effects of}} morphology of precipitate on the strengthening of Al-Mg-Si alloys (Chapter 2). The results show that age-hardening models, assuming elongated precipitates of constant aspect ratio, do not give an overall better prediction of precipitation and strength evolution during ageing and the assumption of spherical precipitates remains, as a first approximation, an acceptable assumption. The Kampmann-Wagner numerical (KWN) framework, as a base ageing model, is introduced in chapter 3. The KWN model is a method for modelling coupled nucleation, growth, and coarsening. In this method, the precipitate size distribution is simulated using a finite difference method. Current precipitation models, applied to aluminium alloys, usually assume that thermodynamic equilibrium is always fulfilled at the precipitate-matrix interface. This implies the assumption of an infinite interface mobility, which means very fast transformation of matrix to precipitate as soon as the local equilibrium is disturbed by diffusion. The validity of this assumption has been investigated in chapter 4. A modified version of KWN model is introduced in which a mixed-mode growth model has been implemented instead of the only diffusion-controlled growth equation. Using this model a comprehensive systematic study has been done on the effects of diffusivity, and type of precipitate, i. e. interface energy and mobility, on the kinetics and character of precipitation in Al-Mg-Si alloys. The results show that changes in the interfacial energy have almost no effect on the precipitation character. However, changes in diffusivity and interface mobility have significant influence on the character of precipitation. For example, it is shown that there is a certain radius below which precipitation character is always interface controlled. In chapter 5, the complexity of the precipitation sequence and its effect on the precipitation kinetics during ageing has been investigated with a multi-component multi-precipitate model, based on the assumption of maximum Gibbs free energy dissipation. In this modelling framework it is possible to consider simultaneous formation of GP-zones, B'', B', B, and free-Si. The model predicts that a large fraction of nuclei of different precipitate species form during quenching from solutionizing temperature and during heating to ageing temperature. Nucleation is first followed by the growth of the less stable species, which dissolve at some point in favor of more stable precipitates. In the end, only thermodynamically stable precipitates like b and free-Si remain in the alloy. The model also confirms that maximum strength is reached when B'' is the dominant precipitate. The effects of secondary precipitates, induced by <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing,</b> on the age hardening of Al-Mg-Si alloys have been presented in chapter 6. In the <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing</b> the alloy is first aged at an elevated temperature (e. g. 170 °C), quenched and then exposed to a lower temperature (e. g. 25 - 100 °C), and aged again at elevated temperatures. From the results it appears that the influence of secondary precipitates is highly dependent on the interruption temperature. Secondary precipitation stimulated by interruption at temperatures below 50 °C has almost no influence on the alloy strength, while when the interruption temperature is above 50 °C, it increases the hardness significantly. The proposed scenario to explain this behavior is based on the temperature-dependent competitive growth of GP-I and GP-II precipitates. According to this model, interruption temperature below 50 °C stimulates the formation of GP-I zones, which have a very slow kinetics of transformation and therefore they have almost no influence on the mechanical properties. On the other hand, when the alloy is interrupted at temperatures above 50 °C, the formation of GP-II zones is more likely to take place, consequently resulting in the higher density of ?" precipitates during re-ageing and better mechanical properties. Previous precipitation models were linked to a strength model to predict the yield strength evolution during ageing. However, the whole work-hardening behavior is also important for many applications of Al-Mg-Si alloys. In the last chapter, the influence of ageing on work-hardening is investigated from tensile tests. A modified version of Kocks-Mecking-Estrin (KME) model is then employed to simulate the work-hardening response {{as a function of the}} precipitation state. Results reveal that underaged material shows a linear decrease of the work-hardening rate with flow stress, while overaged material shows an initial constant work-hardening rate before decreasing linearly. This distinct behavior has been related to the stability of the Orowan loops. In conclusion, the thesis addresses several important issues concerning precipitation and work-hardening behavior of Al-Mg-Si alloys, including precipitates morphology, precipitation sequence, precipitation character, and <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing.</b> This allows for a better understanding of precipitation sequence, precipitation and hardening kinetics in these alloys.

40|$|Understanding {{the changes}} {{occurring}} in the mechanical properties during martensite tempering is essential {{in the development of}} new industrial grades. The aim of this research was to develop new ultra-high strength steels via nanoprecipitation control, which requires an understanding of the processing-microstructure-property relationship in medium carbon (0. 5 - 0. 6 wt. %) steels throughout tempering. Much of the work has been centred in understanding the role of silicon at the precipitation level and in the recovery of martensite. By using an existing spring steel grade, the effect of <b>interrupted</b> <b>ageing</b> (IA) in tempered martensite has been studied. In IA, an intermediate step between quenching and tempering is introduced, where quenched martensite is left to rest at room temperature for a defined period of time. By allowing carbon segregation into dislocation cores, the incorporation of IA resulted in a more stable microstructure and hardness improvement. The effect of silicon in the epsilon to cementite carbide transition has also been studied. The classical nucleation theory was applied in order to model cementite formation under paraequilibrium conditions, thus incorporating silicon during nucleation. Characterisation using high energy X-rays showed the inhibiting effect of silicon in the overall cementite precipitation. The second effect of silicon was observed in the martensite recovery. A series of experiments were carried out in order to capture the various microstructural changes taking place during tempering: precipitation, grain size and dislocation density evolution. It was observed that the addition of silicon reduces the rate of martensite recovery, owing to the reduced cross-slip in the ferrite lattice. A plasticity model based on irreversible thermodynamics and EBSD characterisation was applied to identify the effective grain size. The results from these two techniques require further research. Nevertheless, based on the post-failure analysis by TEM, it appears that at relatively early tempering stages, even low angle lath boundaries can contribute to strengthening, where piled-up dislocations have been observed at lath boundaries.

40|$|Aluminum-silicon-copper cast alloys of the 319 -type have {{attained}} a commercially important status {{because of their}} widespread use. Artificial aging treatments are routinely applied to these alloys {{in order to obtain}} precipitation hardening and improve their mechanical properties. Standard treatments may not always yield the optimum achievable properties, thus Mg and Sr are commonly added to improve the response of the alloy to aging and to modify the eutectic Si morphology from acicular to fibrous, respectively. The present study was carried out to investigate aging behavior of four 319 -type alloys in regard to such mechanical properties as their ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, microhardness, percent elongation and impact toughness. Non-conventional aging cycles were applied so as to evaluate the degree of the improvement in strength obtainable.

In fact, when the peak-aged (T 6) condition is desired, the optimum treatment consists of a continuous artificial treatment at 170 °C for 8 h; when the overaged (T 7) condition is desired, a T 7 -type multi-temperature treatment consisting of underaging at 170 °C for 1 h, then at 190 °C for 1 h, and finally overaging at 240 °C for 2 h is the best option...|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} Viking raid in Irish history occurred in 795 AD when Vikings from Norway looted the island. Early Viking raids were generally fast-paced and small in scale. These early raids <b>interrupted</b> the golden <b>age</b> of Christian Irish culture and {{marked the beginning}} of two centuries of intermittent warfare, with waves of Viking raiders plundering monasteries and towns throughout Ireland. Most of those early raiders came from western Norway.|$|R
50|$|Julia {{was born}} in the Algerian town of Sidi Bel Abbes, at the time governed by the French. During his youth, he had an {{interest}} in mathematics and music. His studies were <b>interrupted</b> at the <b>age</b> of 21, when France became involved in World War I and Julia was conscripted to serve with the army. During an attack he suffered a severe injury, losing his nose. His many operations to remedy the situation were all unsuccessful, {{and for the rest of}} his life he resigned himself to wearing a leather strap around the area where his nose had been.|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{fatty acid}} {{metabolism}} in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) induced by vegetable oil (VO) replacement of fish oil (FO) and high dietary oil in aquaculture diets can have negative {{impacts on the}} nutritional quality of the product for the human consumer, including altered flesh fatty acid composition and lipid content. A dietary trial was designed to investigate the twin problems of FO replacement and high energy diets in salmon throughout the entire production cycle. Salmon were grown from first feeding to around 2 kg on diets in which FO was completely replaced by a 1 : 1 blend of linseed and rapeseed oils at low (14 - 17 %) and high (25 - 35 %) dietary oil levels. This paper reports specifically {{on the influence of}} diet on various aspects of fatty acid metabolism. Fatty acid compositions of liver, intestinal tissue and gill were altered by the diets with increased proportions of C 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreased proportions of n- 3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in fish fed VO compared to fish fed FO. HUFA synthesis in hepatocytes and enterocytes was significantly higher in fish fed VO, whereas β-oxidation was unaltered by either dietary oil content or type. Over the entire production cycle, HUFA synthesis in hepatocytes showed a decreasing trend with <b>age</b> <b>interrupted</b> by a large peak in activity at seawater transfer. Gill cell prostaglandin (PG) production showed a possible seasonal trend, with peak activities in winter and low activities in summer and at seawater transfer. PG production in seawater was lower in fish fed the high oil diets with the lowest PG production generally observed in fish fed high VO. The changes in fatty acid metabolism induced by high dietary oil and VO replacement contribute to altered flesh lipid content and fatty acid compositions, and so merit continued investigation to minimize any negative impacts that sustainable, environmentally-friendly and cost-effective aquaculture diets could have in the future.

40|$|Inner {{channels}} {{are the best}} evidence found of sustained fluid flow on Mars. The first inner channels have been observed in high-resolution MOC imagery in Nanedi and Nirgal Vallis. These channels have widths between 50 m to 150 m, but only small parts of the channel lengths of a few kilometer are covered by MOC. New inner channels have been obseserved in the image data of the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) onbord of Mars Express in Libya Montes, south of Isidis Planitia (0 °- 5 °N and 82 °E and 90 °E). The great advantage of the HRSC-images is the large covering of the surface in one image (50 km x ~ 1500 km) in combination with a high resolution of 12 m/pxl, and the additional stereo imaging. This gives {{us the opportunity to}} retrack inner channels over a long distance. The {{channels are}} located in kilometer broad valley networks and have an average width of about 150 m with observable lengths up to 130 km. They show meandering patterns, are sometimes <b>interrupted</b> and <b>age</b> relations can be seen by superimposed craters...|$|R
40|$|The {{precipitation}} {{and evolution}} of microstructure in a spray-cast Al- 7034 alloy and a commercial wrought Al- 2024 alloy were studied after equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) using transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Microstructural examination showed the grain sizes of both alloys were reduced to the range of ~ 0. 3 – 0. 5 µm through ECAP. The DSC analysis identified the occurrence of thermal effects involving the formation, coarsening, dissolution and melting of the precipitate phases and concurrent recrystallization. The heating and ageing response of the alloys processed by ECAP was identified by micro-hardness testing of the samples after <b>interrupted</b> heating and <b>ageing</b> treatments...|$|R
