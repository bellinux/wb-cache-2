5|$|Weather {{conditions}} typically {{vary greatly}} depending on altitude; <b>hot</b> <b>countries</b> can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive {{very little in}} low-lying areas, increasing the accident rate among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, road surface temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid frost formation. As a result, gritting and plowing runs are often prioritised in favour of clearing these mountain roads, especially at the start {{and end of the}} snow season. The hazardous roads through mountain passes pose additional problems for the large winter service vehicles. The heavy metal frame and bulky grit makes hill climbing demanding for the vehicle, so vehicles have extremely high torque transmission systems to provide enough power to make the climb. Furthermore, because the tight hairpin turns found on mountain slopes are difficult for long vehicles to navigate, winter service vehicles for use in mountainous areas are shortened, usually from six wheels to four.|$|E

25|$|Thermally {{lethargic}} {{technologies like}} coal and nuclear are physically incapable of fast ramping. Capital intensive {{technologies such as}} wind, solar, and nuclear are economically disadvantaged unless generating at maximum availability since the LCOE is nearly all sunk-cost capital investment. Intermittent power sources, such as wind and solar, may incur extra costs associated with needing to have storage or backup generation available. At the same time, intermittent sources can be competitive if they are available to produce when demand and prices are highest, such as solar during summertime mid-day peaks seen in <b>hot</b> <b>countries</b> where air conditioning is a major consumer. Despite these time limitations, leveling costs is often a necessary prerequisite for making comparisons {{on an equal footing}} before demand profiles are considered, and the levelized-cost metric is widely used for comparing technologies at the margin, where grid implications of new generation can be neglected.|$|E
2500|$|The Matterhorn is {{mentioned}} in a guide-book to Switzerland by Johann Gottfried Ebel, {{which was published}} in Zürich {{towards the end of the}} eighteenth century, and translated into English in 1818. The mountain appeared in it under the three names of Silvius, Matterhorn, and Mont Cervin, and was briefly described as one of the most splendid and wonderful obelisks in the Alps. On Zermatt there was a note: [...] "A place which may, perhaps, interest the tourist is the valley of Praborgne (Zermatt); it is bounded by huge glaciers which come right down into the valley; the village of Praborgne is fairly high, and stands at a great height above the glaciers; its climate is almost as warm as that of Italy, and plants belonging to <b>hot</b> <b>countries</b> are to be found there at considerable altitudes, above the ice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Ponce Creole {{style is}} {{characterized}} by wood and stucco buildings with broad columned porches and balconies and painted in the tasty pinks, peaches, and limes common to <b>hot</b> <b>countries.</b> The style {{is a blend of}} Spanish Creole and neoclassical architecture: “In the late 19th century, Ponce developed its own blend of Spanish Creole and neoclassical architecture called Ponce Creole; it's characterized by the use of Corinthian columns, wrought-iron balconies, and gas lamps. It was dubbed Creole because it reminded some of New Orleans's French Quarter. Wealth from Ponce's sugarcane industry financed most of the elegantly ornamented buildings.” Some of the other prominent characteristcis of this architectural style have been described by Pablo Ojeda O'Neill as [...] "a long raised porch, stone rostrium-raised homes to achieve ventilation and to protect the wood foundation, a series of front doors with wooden windows to maximize ventilation." ...|$|E
