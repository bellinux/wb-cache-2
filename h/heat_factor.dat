40|$|Extremes {{of climate}} are not {{uncommon}} in Australia and heatwaves are not infrequent. Periods of high ambient temperature may result in clusters of heat related deaths, which may place strain on forensic facilities. This paper describes the formulation of the Excess <b>Heat</b> <b>Factor</b> using meteorological data to provide a means of predicting death resulting from periods of extreme heat stress. The 2009 South Australian heatwave had the highest ranked Excess <b>Heat</b> <b>Factor</b> in Adelaide's records. There were 58 heat related deaths, with {{the bulk of the}} heat related deaths following the peak Excess <b>Heat</b> <b>Factor</b> value (144 °C(2)). The 2008 heatwave had a lower peak Excess <b>Heat</b> <b>Factor</b> value (36 °C(2)); there was only one heat related death, which followed the peak in the Excess <b>Heat</b> <b>Factor.</b> It is proposed that calculation of the Excess <b>Heat</b> <b>Factor</b> from meteorological data could provide a means to predict and identify heat related deaths resulting from extreme weather conditions.

40|$|Abstract: To {{get more}} {{appropriate}} louvered fin {{structure of a}} series of subcompact radiators, Fluent was used to analyze the subcompact radiator louvered fins numerically. The fin model was verified availably by testing the error between the simulation results and experimental ones. Through modifying the critical dimension of louvered fin models, the friction factor f and the <b>heat</b> <b>factor</b> j of subcompact radiator louvered fins under different fin height were obtained. The regression analysis indicated that the friction factor was linear with fin height, and the <b>heat</b> <b>factor</b> was the power function of fin height. The dimensionless parameter j/f 1 / 3 was introduced to evaluate the comprehensive performance of fins, and the research indicated that the performance would be best when the fin height was 8. 94 mm. The result has a certain practical value for improving the performance of subcompact radiators...|$|E
40|$|Background & Objective: Nowadays, {{according}} to growth {{of industry and}} increasing population, water resources are seriousely shortened. This lack of water resources will require special management {{to be considered in}} industry and agriculture. Among the various sources of water, surface waters are more susceptible to infection. The most important of these sources of pollution are industrial pollution, detergent, pesticides, radioactive materials, heat and salt concentration.  Materials & methods: In this article, at first the importance of each pollutant will be evaluated base on the effects and its results and then quality evaluation of surface water will be studied. In order to assess the relative importance of these pollutants primarily using TOPSIS software, prioritize these factors as one of the hierarchical analysis and then is modeled with decision tree method using Weka software, the importance of each factor is evaluated and if it does not meet the minimal importance of the decision tree will be removed. Results: The results obtained from the Topsis fuzzy analysis indicate that surface water and groundwater are exposed to pollution about 74 % and 26 % respectively among the six pollutants examined in this study. In addition, results obtaned from the hierarchical tree in software Weka has shown that the <b>heat</b> <b>factor,</b> soluble salts and industrial pollutants give impac factor or purity about 0. 1338, 0. 0523 and 1. 2694 respectively. Conclusion: Surface water is at greater risk of being polluted compared with groundwater. The <b>heat</b> <b>factor</b> and low concentration of dissolved salts have the low impact and industrial pollutants are considered as the most influential factors in surface water pollution...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Heatwaves {{represent}} a significant natural hazard in Australia, arguably more hazardous {{to human life}} than bushfires, tropical cyclones and floods. In the 2008 / 2009 summer, for example, many more lives were lost to heatwaves than to that summer’s bushfires which were among {{the worst in the}} history of the Australian nation. For many years, these other forms of natural disaster have received much greater public attention than heatwaves, although there are some signs of change. We propose a new index, called the excess <b>heat</b> <b>factor</b> (EHF) for use in Australian heatwave monitoring and forecasting. The index is based on a three-day-averaged daily mean temperature (DMT), and is intended to capture heatwave intensity as it applies to human health outcomes, although its usefulness is likely to be much broader and with potential for international applicability. The index is described and placed in a climatological context in order to derive heatwav...|$|E

Heat pump is an energetic device able to withdraw (at relatively low temperature) thermal energy from surrounding environment and transform it to heat usable for heating {{a house or}} warming up water or a swimming pool.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of a climate model's capability to simulate trends in extreme events is not straightforward. This {{is due to the}} role of internal climate variability, the simulated phases of which are unique to each individual model realization. We undertake an assessment of the 21 -member Community Earth System Model (CESM) {{on the basis of its}} ability to simulate heat wave days frequency over Australia. We employ the extreme <b>heat</b> <b>factor</b> definition to measure heat waves and study events for all summers (November-March) between 1950 and 2005. The spatial pattern, magnitude, and significance of trends in CESM were found to be reasonable since the corresponding observed trends were within the CESM ensemble range. There is a suggestion that the model produces higher interannual variability than what is observed. The trends between realizations of the same model differ strongly, which suggest that internal climate variability can strongly amplify or mask local trends in extreme events...|$|E
40|$|Georgia {{has been}} {{affected}} by {{an increasing number of}} temperature extreme events during the last decades, which had serious impacts on human health, agriculture and natural ecosystems. This cumulative dissertation contains four research articles, which investigate annual and seasonal climatology, changes and driving forces of temperature extremes focusing on summer heat waves over Georgia during the last 50 years. A new dataset of 22 homogenized, daily maximum and minimum air temperature series is developed. Temperature extremes are investigated using ETCCDI extreme indices to quantify annual and seasonal trends for the periods 1961 - 2010, 1971 - 2010 and 1981 - 2010. Pronounced warming trends for all Georgia-averaged trends are observed during the most recent analysis period, whereas the magnitude of trends for night-time indices is larger than those for daytime. Largest trend magnitudes could be proven for warm temperature extremes in summer. In order to identify heat wave events, a well-established heat wave index based on the Excess <b>Heat</b> <b>Factor</b> is used, which considers heat-health as a combined measure of excess heat and heat stress. It is studied with respect to eight heat wave aspects: event number, duration, participating heat wave days and peak and mean magnitude. In addition, a severe Excess <b>Heat</b> <b>Factor</b> threshold for each station was calculated empirically as the 85 th percentile of the distribution of positive Excess <b>Heat</b> <b>Factor</b> values based on the observation record of each station. As a result, three new aspects have been developed in this study to be able to differentiate between low-intensity, severe and extreme heat waves and their potential heat-health impacts: the number of heat wave days, severe and extreme heat wave days. The spatial distribution of heat wave characteristics over Georgia shows a concentration of high heat wave intensities in the Southwest. The longest and most frequently occurring heat wave events are observed in the Southeast of Georgia. Most severe events are found in both regions. Trends for all Georgia-averaged heat wave aspects demonstrate significant increases in the number, intensity and duration of low- and high-intensity heat waves. Largest significantly positive trend magnitudes for the number, intensity and duration of low and high-impact heat waves have been found during the last 20 years. As a case study, Tbilisi station is chosen to investigate heat wave changes considering the urban heat island effect. Heat wave trend magnitudes for Tbilisi exceed the Georgia-averages and its surrounding stations, implying urban heat island effects and synergistic interactions between heat waves and these effects. The five longest and most intense heat waves between 1961 and 2010 are detected in the summers of 2007, 2006, 2001, 1998 and 1995. To investigate the relationship between heat waves and their potential driving forces a daily composite analysis and a Canonical Correlation Analysis is carried out regarding the Mean Sea Level Pressure, Geopotential Height at 500 mb, Sea Surface Temperature, Zonal and Meridional Wind at 500 mb, Vertical Velocity at 500 mb, Outgoing Longwave Radiation, Relative Humidity, Precipitation and Soil Moisture during major events. As main driving mechanism for heat waves over Georgia a large anticyclone over the Southern Ural is detected, which blocks westerlies, attracts warm air masses from the Southwest, enhances subsidence and surface heating over Georgia, shifts the African Intertropical Convergence Zone northwards, and causes a northward shift of the subtropical jet. In addition to the synoptic features triggering heat wave formation, it is shown that strong soil moisture and precipitation deficiencies contribute to the heat wave persistence over Georgia...|$|E

40|$|Although heatwave-related excess {{mortality}} and morbidity {{have been widely}} studied, results are not comparable spatially and often longitudinally because of different heatwave definitions applied. The excess <b>heat</b> <b>factor</b> (EHF) quantifies heatwave intensity relative to the local climate, enabling cross-regional comparisons.

This paper analyzes the association of EHFs with daily morbidity between 2008 and 2014 in the Adelaide metropolitan region, South Australia, and probes three different approaches to calculate the EHF. The EHF is found to differentiate days with heatwave-related excess morbidity significantly better than other widely used weather parameters, resulting in fewer days per year with heatwave alerts than using previously proposed methods. The volume of excess morbidity can be predicted by the EHF more reliably with a model proposed for the SA Ambulance Service to support their heatwave preparation plan...|$|E

A neural network model based on the training of a black box model with experimental data was developed as a method based on experimental results predicting the state conditions of air at the process and regeneration stream.

40|$|As the {{frequency}} and intensity of heatwaves are growing in Australia, strategies to combat heat are becoming more vital. Cities are exposed to urban heat islands (UHIs) due to excess urbanisation. In this study, a definition of urban heatwave (UHW) is conceptualised to investigate the combined impacts of heatwaves and UHIs. To quantify the negative impacts of UHW, indicators—such as excess morbidity, electricity and water consumption—are considered. The intensity of UHWs is calculated using the unit of excess <b>heat</b> <b>factor</b> (EHF), developed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. EHF enables the comparability of UHWs in different geographical locations. Using the indicators {{and the intensity of}} UHWs, a calculation method to quantify heatwave resilience at a precincts scale is proposed. The study summarises the assumed influential factors of precinct heatwave resilience based on the existing literature and propose a “cool retrofitting toolkit” (CRT). CRT creates the framework to assess the adaptation to and mitigation of UHWs available to retrofit existing precincts, and to evaluate potential retrofitting strategies in terms of energy and carbon efficiency, financial affordability and perceived acceptability by population.

A neural network model based on the training of a black box model with real data was developed and compared to a non-linear analogy method as well as a prediction method based on experimental results for the state of air at the process and regeneration stream. The key parameters are the effectiveness of the desiccant wheel, the effectiveness of the sensible heat exchanger and of the evaporative cooler as well as the regeneration temperature, the sensible <b>heat</b> <b>factor</b> of the room and the ratio of the mass flow rate in the regeneration and process stream. The results of this analysis reveal that all the parameters investigated affect the performance of the desiccant cooling system in all models.

40|$|The {{application}} of room radiators {{for the purposes}} of cooling and dehumidification in buildings for hot and humid climates is investigated. The radiator is purposely brought below the dew point temperature of the room air thereby creating condensation on the radiator surface. The condensate is then collected {{at the base of the}} radiator and removed. Mathematical models describing the heat transfer regime within a room when this system is used have been verified using climate chamber tests. The models show good agreement with the experimental results for radiator (a) with a height of 1 m, but not as accurate for radiator (b) with a height of 2 m. The underestimation of the real values by the convective heat transfer model used for the geometric construction of the radiator tested is attributed to the effect of air entrainment along the height of the radiator. Results indicate the importance of the radiant transfer component of the radiator, as well as its effectiveness to remove latent heat. In view of improving thermal comfort and energy efficiency, the implication of the results from this investigation of the heat transfer characteristics of the radiator used for cooling and dehumidification is such that the chilled radiator may offer a definite alternative to conventional air conditioning systems. Partial or full matching of the sensible and latent component of the radiator output to the load requirements of a building should prove particularly effective in hot and humid regions where the latent <b>heat</b> <b>factor</b> of the total cooling load is high...|$|E

The aims were to preserve the original appearance of the buildings and improve living conditions inside them. Mould appeared in particular areas and using different measurements, I have tried to find its source. Using a lazar heat detector, I recorded the walls' surface temperature and how it oscillated at different points. At the same time, I also took measurements with a multi- unction detector, which consists of 4 functions in one aparatus. With this I recorded the relativity of moisture and the air temperature in the area. The collected data were put together with the air temperature readings and comparative moisture in the air, using the ARSO website, based on the TEDI calculation programme. With this programme, I have examined the corresponding constructional complex to see if from the selected data diffusion dampness is shown {{in any of the}} layers from the construction unit.
