40|$|The recent Polish {{translation}} of the Psalms, entitled Księga Psalmów. Nowy Przekład Dynamiczny (The Book of Psalms. A New Dynamic Translation) was published in 2013. According to the editor’s preface the translation was made {{in compliance with the}} rules of dynamic equivalence. If we assume that the dynamic equivalence amounts to the similarity of receptor’s responses to the original and to its translation, then the reviewed translation turns out to be rather formal than dynamic equivalent of the source, because it translates poetry into prose. It seems that the editors accepted a narrowed and simplified notion of dynamic equivalence, which confines it to the faithful expression of the original meaning in contemporary, easy-to-understand language. The translators did not gain even this result to the full, because they rendered many constructions and idioms literally, distorting the meaning or the style of the source text. On the other hand the reviewed translation gives proper dynamic equivalents of some grammatical constructions (for example sentences with names of body parts whose Polish version contains possessive dative). In accordance with the rules of dynamic equivalence, male-oriented expressions are often translated in a <b>gender-inclusive</b> way. The <b>language</b> used in the translation is a mixture of old and modern elements (contemporary vocabulary of the translation clashes into few grammatical archaisms) ...|$|R

5000|$|Feminists are sometimes, {{though not}} exclusively, proponents of using non-sexist language, such as using [...] "Ms." [...] {{to refer to}} both married and {{unmarried}} women.

5000|$|At Banks and Grove Hill, Crotwell instituted {{small changes}} {{to make the}} {{institutions}} more inclusive of women.

50|$|Gender-neutral language, <b>gender-{{inclusive}}</b> <b>language,</b> {{inclusive language}} or gender neutrality {{is a form}} of linguistic prescriptivism that aims to eliminate (or neutralize) reference to gender in terms that describe people. This can involve discouragement of the use of gender-specific job titles, such as policeman/policewoman, fireman, stewardess, and, arguably, chairman, in favour of corresponding gender-neutral terms such as police officer, firefighter, flight attendant and chairperson (or chair). Other gender-specific terms, such as actor and actress, may be replaced by the originally male term (actor used for either gender).|$|E
5000|$|The Spanish and Portuguese word amigos is {{an example}} of the @ being used for gender-inclusive purposes.. When the word {{represents}} not only male friends, but also female ones, the proponents of a <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> replace it with amig@s. In this sense, amigos would be used only when the writer is sure the group referred to is all-male. Usage of amigas is the same in traditional and such new forms of communication. Alternative forms for a gender-inclusive at-sign would be the slash sign (amigos/as) and the circle-A, (amigⒶs). However, it is more common to use the masculine ending first and include the feminine in parentheses, as in amigos(as). For more about this, see Satiric misspelling. Lately, though, it's becoming more and more common (since slashes and parentheses put first the masculine form and the other two are seen as [...] "an 'a' inside an 'o'", meaning, in their eyes, that the feminine is supedited to the masculine) to use the 'x' letter instead, a use that is the choice of advocates of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language,</b> but strongly frowned upon by people not adhered to said movement (but not necessarily against it). The Real Academia Española disapproves of the use of the at-sign as a letter.|$|E
50|$|Bernardino {{was also}} {{involved}} in creating and later chairing the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), which was established in 1946. Although subordinate to the Commission on Human Rights, the CSW was known for exercising independence and initiative. This commission's accomplishments include the <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights {{and the creation of}} the 1967 Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The Commission also promoted women's rights through studies of the treatment of women, and used their findings to call for more change.|$|E
5000|$|Casey Miller and Kate Swift {{have been}} advocating for <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> {{since the early}} 1970s, when they wrote the essay, [...] "Desexing the English Language." [...] Their intent in The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing was [...] "to give people the background, to make them aware of what was {{happening}} right underneath their noses...we didn’t want to tell people, Do This or Don’t Do That!” Due in large part to their work on the topic, by 1980 when The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing was written the movement supporting non-sexist language was gaining traction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{translation}} {{was very}} well received; Swedish bishop Bo Giertz asserted {{that it was the}} best Bible translation. This edition had a great influence on Bible translation in the other Nordic countries, and was important when Sweden and Denmark got new Bible translations, in 2000 and 1992 respectively. The 1978 translation {{was also one of the}} first in the world to use <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> in places, for example, where the original text had used masculine language like [...] "brother" [...] despite referring to both sexes that translation used [...] "brothers and sisters." ...|$|E
5000|$|At the North Carolina Conference, Crotwell {{used her}} {{position}} as an elder to make gender equality a central concern. She {{served as the}} chairperson of the Commission on the Status and Role of Women. During her time on the commission, she worked to prevent what she called a [...] "women’s circuit", a practice in which women clergy are only rotated among the churches that seem comfortable with female pastors. She served {{as a member of}} the Board of Ordained Ministry as well, and for the general church served on the Curriculum Resource Commission and General Board of Discipleship. She also served on a revision committee of the United Methodist Hymnal, editing it for more <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
50|$|The NETS translators {{selected}} the best critical {{editions of the}} Septuagint, primarily the larger Göttingen Septuagint (as far as it was completed {{at the time of}} translation) and Alfred Rahlfs's manual edition for the books still missing from the Göttingen edition. The text was not rendered into a brand new translation; instead, the translators revised the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV), altering it to match the wording of the Greek and removing <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> that was not warranted by the underlying source texts. It was hoped the relationship between the NETS and the NRSV would mirror the relationship between the LXX and its underlying Hebrew text, making it easy for readers to study the discrepancies between the two textual traditions without extensive study of the original languages.|$|E
5000|$|In literature, {{the use of}} {{masculine}} language to refer to men, women, intersex people, and nonbinary people may indicate a male or androcentic bias in society where men are seen as the 'norm' and women, intersex people, as well as nonbinary people are seen as the 'other'. Some examples are forms of address (such as [...] "Hey guys" [...] or [...] "Dear Sirs") and masculine nouns and pronouns (such as 'mankind', 'man' or 'he') to refer to men, women, intersex people, and nonbinary people. Philosophy scholar Jennifer Saul argued {{that the use of}} male generic language marginalizes women in society. In recent years, some writers have started to use more <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> (for instance, using the pronouns they/them, and using gender-inclusive words like humankind, person, partner, spouse, businessperson, fire-fighter, chairperson and police-officer).|$|E
50|$|Of all her contributions, Bernardino is {{best known}} for arguing in favor of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> {{in the early stages of}} the UN's development. At the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, {{although}} she was technically a delegate of the Dominican Republic—sent by dictator Rafael Trujillo as a “low-risk opportunity to appear progressive”—Bernardino entered the conference with her own agenda, representing the interests of the Inter-American Commission of Women (IACW). Bernardino and her colleague Berta Lutz were acknowledged as “instrumental” in the inclusion of the phrases “equal rights of men and women,” “faith in fundamental human rights” and “the dignity and worth of the human person” in the preamble to the UN's charter. She is also credited with the wording “equal rights of men and women” in the preamble for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—she believed that omitting “and women” would have seemed intentional and invited discrimination.|$|E
50|$|Gender-neutral {{language}} or <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> is language that avoids bias toward a particular sex or social gender. In English, this includes use of nouns {{that are not}} gender-specific to refer to roles or professions, as well as avoidance of the pronoun he (including the forms him and his) to refer to people of unknown or indeterminate gender. For example, the words policeman and stewardess are gender-specific; the corresponding gender-neutral terms are police officer and flight attendant. Other gender-specific terms, such as actor and actress, may {{be replaced by the}} originally male term; for example, actor used regardless of gender. Some terms, such as chairman, that contain the component -man but have traditionally been used to refer to persons regardless of sex are now seen by some as gender-specific. When the gender of the person referred to is unknown or indeterminate, a gender-specific pronoun such as he may be avoided by using a gender-neutral pronoun - possibilities in English include he or she, s/he, or singular they.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{the use of}} {{masculine}} pronouns in place of generic was regarded as non-sexist, but various forms of gender-neutral language became a common feature in written and spoken versions of many languages {{in the late twentieth}} century. Feminists argue that previously the practice of assigning masculine gender to generic antecedents stemmed from language reflecting [...] "the prejudices of the society in which it evolved, and English evolved through most of its history in a male-centered, patriarchal society." [...] During the 1970s, feminists Casey Miller and Kate Swift created a manual, The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing, on gender neutral language that was set to reform the existing sexist language that was said to exclude and dehumanize women. In the 1980s, many feminist efforts were made to reform the androcentric language. It has become common in some academic and governmental settings to rely on gender-neutral language to convey inclusion of all sexes or genders (<b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{translation}} {{is intended to}} be somewhat gender-inclusive, though not to the same extent as translations such as the NRSV. Psalm 1 offers an illustration of the REB's middle-ground approach to <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language.</b> On one side are more traditional translations such as the KJV and the ESV that use the word [...] "man" [...] and the masculine singular pronoun in Psalm 1. The ESV, for example, has [...] "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked [...] [...] [...] but his delight is in the law of the Lord." [...] On the other side are more gender-inclusive translations such as the NRSV that avoid any masculine nouns and pronouns in Psalm 1. The NRSV uses plurals: [...] "Happy are those who do not follow the advice of the wicked [...] [...] [...] but their delight is in the law of the Lord." [...] In between these two approaches is the translation of Psalm 1 in the REB, which avoids using a male noun ("man") but retains the masculine singular pronouns ("his"): [...] "Happy is the one who does not take the counsel of the wicked for a guide [...] [...] [...] [...] His delight is in the law of the Lord." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> {{has been}} {{consciously}} applied {{in almost all}} significant English Bible translations over the last thirty years. It has only recently been introduced into Swedish Bible translations practices, however, with the test translation of Luke 9 : 51 – 19 : 28 and Galatians issued by the Swedish Bible Society. This fact signals that the next Swedish Bible translation will implement <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language.</b> This article describes three different types of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> that can be implemented cumulatively. The first, gender-accurate language, {{involves the use of}} <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> in cases where the original text clearly refers to both men and women. The second type, gender-muted language, implements <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> in all passages except those that exclusively refer to men. The third type, radically inclusive language, is found in those translations that seek to resist sexist language and be inclusive to all present readers even if that involves a departure from the meaning of the original text. Examples are given of how each type of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> can be implemented in Swedish translations of a number of New Testament passages...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> aims at {{reducing}} discrimination and exclusion of women by replacing masculine forms, such as policeman with gender-inclusive forms such as police officer, the student, he or she. The use of sexist language {{was found to}} be related to gender-role identity, sexist beliefs and attitudes. However, it is still unclear whether people act on these beliefs when using sexist language or whether these are more implicit, habitual patterns. In two studies with German-speaking participants we measured whether people deliberately or habitually act on their beliefs about gender so as to use or not use <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language.</b> By using a fill-in-the-blanks task we measured the use of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language.</b> Study 1 included attitudes towards <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language,</b> norms, perceived behavioral control and intention as deliberate and frequency of past behavior and experienced automaticity as habitual predictors, and Study 2 additionally measured sexist beliefs. Study 1 showed that explicitly favorable intentions and habitual processes involving past use guide the spontaneous use of gender-inclusive forms. Study 2 revealed that language-use intentions are embedded in explicit sexist ideologies. Participants who used sexist language in the past may rely on whatever is the standard form without considering the possibility of alternative language forms and their implications for social change. Other participants used or failed to use <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> more deliberately. They act on their intentions along with their attitudes. Secondly, participants who endorse sexist beliefs failed to use gender-inclusive forms because of their negative attitudes toward using it along with their intentions not to use it. These participants might deliberately avoid using <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> because {{it as a kind of}} political correctness which they do not support, or they might claim it as unnecessary because masculine generics equally include women and men...|$|E

This fact signals that the next Swedish Bible translation will implement <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language.</b> In this article I have discerned and described three different types of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> that can be implemented cumulatively. The first, gender-accurate language, is found in most recent English Bible translations and {{involves the use of}} <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> in cases where the meaning of the original text clearly refers to both men and women. Eight different strategies can be implemented to create gender-accurate translations of generic “he”, instances in which the original text employs gender-specific language to refer to both men and women. The second type, gender-muted language, which is found in NRSV and CEV, implements <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> in all passages except those that exclusively refer to men. The dominance of masculine language is further weakened through minor strategies, such as reducing the number of personal pronouns that refer to God. The third type, radically inclusive language, is found in those translations (such as ILL, NTPI and IB) that seek to resist sexist language and be inclusive to all present readers even if that involves a departure from the meaning of the original text. The strategies employed to achieve this include abolishing all masculine personal pronouns that refer to God and reducing the number of those that refer to Jesus or men, implementing gender-neutral language for some unnamed lesser characters, and avoiding discriminating stereotypes. Finally, I have given examples of how each type of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> can be implemented in Swedish translations of a number of New Testament passages. Although I do not argue in favor of a specific type (or, indeed, any of them), I hope that this descriptive model and the practical examples of translations will provide a solid foundation for deliberation about whether, in what manner, and to what extent <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> should be implemented in the next Swedish Bible translation...|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{analyses}} and compares the two Bible translations New International Version 2011 (NIV 2011) and Bibel 2011, and their audience reception, {{with the aim}} of discovering what the differences are between the two translations. The thesis uses a three-pronged approach, as it analyses textual material, audience reception, and uses data from an interview about the translational process of Bibel 2011. The textual passages in the analysis correspond to passages that the audience has reacted to. The main difference between the two translations is that Bibel 2011 uses a more radically modern language than NIV 2011. In the audience reception, the main difference is that while people reacted strongly towards NIV 2011 ’s use of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language,</b> this was hardly discussed at all in the reception for Bibel 2011, even though it uses <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> as well. The reception for Bibel 2011 was also a lot more scattered than the reception for NIV 2011, as people focused on many different elements for Bibel 2011, like for instance the radically modern language and the change of the Lord’s Prayer, while the reception for NIV 2011 focused almost exclusively on the <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language...</b>|$|E
40|$|The way media depict {{women and}} men can {{reinforce}} or diminish gender stereotyping. Which part does language play in this context? Are roles perceived as more gender-balanced when feminine role nouns are used in addition to masculine ones? Research on <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> shows {{that the use of}} feminine-masculine word pairs tends to increase the visibility of women in various social roles. For example, when speakers of German were asked to name their favorite "heroine or hero in a novel," they listed more female characters than when asked to name their favorite "hero in a novel. " The research reported in this article examines how the use of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> in news reports affects readers' own usage of such forms as well as their mental representation of {{women and men}} in the respective roles. In the main experiment, German participants (N = 256) read short reports about heroes or murderers which contained either masculine generics or gender-inclusive forms (feminine-masculine word pairs). Gender-inclusive forms enhanced participants' own usage of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> and this resulted in more gender-balanced mental representations of these roles. Reading about "heroines and heroes" made participants assume a higher percentage of women among persons performing heroic acts than reading about "heroes" only, but there was no such effect for murderers. A post-test suggested that this might be due to a higher accessibility of female exemplars in the category heroes than in the category murderers. Importantly, the influence of <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> on the perceived percentage of women in a role was mediated by speakers' own usage of inclusive forms. This suggests that people who encounter gender-inclusive forms and are given an opportunity to use them, use them more themselves and in turn have more gender-balanced mental representations of social roles...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} theorized {{link between the}} use of gender-exclusive language and ostracism. In two experiments, women and men read a job overview that contained either masculine gender-exclusive language (he), <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language</b> (he or she), or gender-neutral language (one). They then rated their feelings of exclusion (i. e., ostracism), described their personal investment in the described job (Experiments 1 and 2) and evaluated the work environment (Experiment 2). In both experiments, women reported feeling most ostracized when they were exposed to gender-exclusive language compared to <b>gender-inclusive</b> <b>language.</b> Furthermore, women in Experiment 1 reported least personal investment in the job when exposed to gender-exclusive versus –inclusive language, but this pattern of results did not replicate in Experiment 2. As expected, men did not respond differently to language type in either experiment. The divergence in women’s responses between Experiments 1 and 2 are discussed in terms of the role that awareness of one’s ostracized status might play in women’s reactions to this form of subtle ostracism...|$|E
