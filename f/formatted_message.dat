The framework then hands the <b>formatted</b> <b>message</b> to the appropriate Appender for disposition. This might include a console display, writing to disk, appending to a database, or email.|$|E

50|$|Email {{messages}} are composed, delivered, {{and stored in}} a multiple step process, which starts with the message's composition. When the user finishes composing the message and sends it, the message {{is transformed into a}} standard format: an RFC 2822 <b>formatted</b> <b>message.</b> Afterwards, the message can be transmitted. Using a network connection, the mail client, referred to as a mail user agent (MUA), connects to a mail transfer agent (MTA) operating on the mail server. The mail client then provides the sender’s identity to the server. Next, using the mail server commands, the client sends the recipient list to the mail server. The client then supplies the message. Once the mail server receives and processes the message, several events occur: recipient server identification, connection establishment, and message transmission. Using Domain Name System (DNS) services, the sender’s mail server determines the mail server(s) for the recipient(s). Then, the server opens up a connection(s) to the recipient mail server(s) and sends the message employing a process similar to that used by the originating client, delivering the message to the recipient(s).|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to exchange meaningful and useful data in a multinational environment. However, several nations have different data dictionary and data models. There are also cases where there are different data models in a nation, e. g. The Army data model and the Navy data model could be different for their information systems. In such cases, {{it is almost impossible}} to exchange data and utilize these data to obtain a situation display. Several techniques have been developed to take over this problem. One of them is database replication and other is the <b>Formatted</b> <b>Message</b> approach. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. <b>Formatted</b> <b>Message</b> Approach is used to exchange data among the different information systems in our study. We have developed an algorithm, which tries to handle this interoperability issue. In the algorithm, core software is developed which checks all the received formatted messages and corrects the possible specific errors according to ADatP- 3 rules and inserts or updates the database with this received and corrected data. Software can be thought as a gateway between the GIS application and National information systems that send formatted messages. It converts formatted messages to database entries so that GIS application can use the received data and display them...|$|E

In this note, we describe our forgery attack against PANDA-s. Our attack works in the nonce misuse model. It exploits the fact that the message processing function and the finalization function are identical, and thus a variant of the length-extension attack can be applied. We can find a tag for a pre-specified <b>formatted</b> <b>message</b> with 2 encryption oracle calls, 264 computational cost, and negligible memory...|$|E

Research used was survey by using questionnaire. Data collection used Judgmental sampling technique to 70 respondents. The research aimed {{to find out}} advertising variable (message contain, <b>message</b> structure, <b>message</b> <b>format</b> and <b>message</b> source) of Yamaha Mio motor vehicle which significantly influenced to the product image and also to find out advertising variables which gave the largest contribution to the product image. The research usage, especially for the advertiser as consideration in planning and deciding marketing action related with advertising by using television media. By using logistic analysis, there could be said that advertising variables (message contain, <b>message</b> structure, <b>message</b> <b>format</b> and <b>message</b> source) has significant influence to the product image with signification value <α value or 0, 000 < 0, 05. From all advertising variables (message contain, <b>message</b> structure, <b>message</b> <b>format</b> and <b>message</b> source) of Yamaha Mio motor vehicle there could be concluded that message structure variables was variable which gave the largest contribution by R value = 0, 517. Assume several weakness in this research, there needed to study another variables influenced television advertising. The company should also pay attention to another variables like <b>message</b> contain, <b>message</b> <b>format,</b> and <b>message</b> source to make the message stated through television more effective.

40|$|Although {{literally}} {{trillions of}} emails are sent annually, little empirical research exists about how formatting of emails impacts email effectiveness. Abundant research exists {{about the use}} of subject lines, yet little research addresses the formatting of email content. Many experts from the business communication field have offered advice on effective formatting. We conducted an experiment that controlled for formatting of email messages. The first email message was a job announcement. The second email message contained identical content yet employed what are considered best practices for formatting. We found that university students who viewed the <b>formatted</b> <b>message</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} perceive the advertised job as attractive. Furthermore, they were significantly more likely to correctly recall facts about the job. This lends credibility to existing advice from the business communication field about effective formatting.

40|$|The {{results of}} efforts to apply {{powerful}} Ada constructs to the <b>formatted</b> <b>message</b> handling process are described. The goal of these efforts was to extend the state-of-technology in message handling {{while at the same}} time producing production-quality, reusable code. The first effort was initiated in September, 1984 and delivered in April, 1985. That product, the Generic Message Handling Facility, met initial goals, was reused, and is available in the Ada Repository on ARPANET. However, it became apparent during its development that the initial approach to building a message handler template was not optimal. As a result of this initial effort, several alternate approaches were identified, and research is now on-going to identify an improved product. The ultimate goal is to be able to instantly build a message handling system for any message format given a specification of that message format. The problem lies in how to specify the message format, and one that is done, how to use that information to build the message handler. Message handling systems and message types are described. The initial efforts, its results and its shortcomings are detailed. The approach now being taken to build a system which will be significantly easier to implement, and once implemented, easier to use, is described. Finally, conclusions are offered...|$|E
