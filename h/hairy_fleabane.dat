40|$|Auxyn type {{herbicides}} such as dicamba and 2, 4 -D are alternative herbicides {{that can}} be used to control glyphosate-resistant <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane.</b> With the forthcoming possibility of releasing dicamba-resistant and 2, 4 -D-resistant crops, use of these growth regulator herbicides will likely be an alternative {{that can be}} applied to the control of glyphosate resistant <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> (Conyza bonariensis). The objective of this research was to model the efficacy, through dose-response curves, of glyphosate, 2, 4 -D, isolated dicamba and glyphosatedicamba combinations to control a brazilian <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> population resistant to glyphosate. The greenhouse dose-response studies were conducted as a completely randomized experimental design, and the rates used for dose response curve construction were 0, 120, 240, 480, 720 and 960 g a. i. ha- 1 for 2, 4 -D, dicamba and the dicamba combination, with glyphosate at 540 g a. e. ha- 1. The rates for glyphosate alone were 0, 180, 360, 540, 720 and 960 g a. e. ha- 1. Herbicides were applied when the plants were in a vegetative stage with 10 to 12 leaves and height between 12 and 15 cm. <b>Hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> had low sensitivity to glyphosate, with poor control even at the 960 g a. e. ha- 1 rate. Dicamba and 2, 4 -D were effective in controlling the studied <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane.</b> <b>Hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> responds differently to 2, 4 -D and dicamba.

40|$|ABSTRACT Weeds {{compete with}} crops for {{essential}} inputs, {{but they are}} also important hosts for pests, both during the crop and between crops. <b>Hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> (Conyza bonariensis) is an important weed growing in both summer and winter crops. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the occurrence and population fluctuations of soybean pests using <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> as an alternative host. Samples of <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> plants were collected fortnightly over twelve months at two sites (Boa Vista do Incra and São Vicente do Sul) in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. The results showed that <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> plants provided shelter to important soybean pests, including the pentatomid stink bugs Edessa meditabunda, Piezodorus guildinii, Dichelop sp. and Euschistus heros, especially after soybean maturation, and also served as an alternative food source.

40|$|In Brazil, <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> {{stands out}} among the main weeds of soybean crops, due to its {{aggressiveness}} and resistance to glyphosate. Thus, to avoid the selection of resistant populations to the glyphosate herbicide, the use of other herbicides has become critical to the management of this weed. This study aimed to evaluate the control efficiency of glyphosate and saflufenacil herbicides in <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> plants (Conyza bonariensis), {{as well as the}} type of interaction of the combination of those herbicides for controlling glyphosate-resistant <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane.</b> A randomized blocks design, with four replications, was used. Treatments consisted of glyphosate doses (0 g ha- 1; 270 g ha- 1; 540 g ha- 1; 1, 080 g ha- 1; 2, 160 g ha- 1; 4, 320 g ha- 1; 8, 640 g ha- 1; 17, 280 g ha- 1) combined with saflufenacil (0 g ha- 1; 0. 55 g ha- 1; 1. 09 g ha- 1; 2. 18 g ha- 1; 4. 37 g ha- 1; 8. 75 g ha- 1; 17. 5 g ha- 1; 35 g ha- 1), making six dose-response curves. A synergistic effect was observed between the glyphosate and saflufenacil herbicides for controlling the glyphosate-resistant <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane,</b> being the mixture considered efficient for the biotype studied. Furthermore, the addition of glyphosate (540 g ha- 1) to the saflufenacil herbicide (35 g ha- 1) prevented the occurrence of regrowth and the dispersion of new <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> seeds, what does not occur in plants treated exclusively with saflufenacil...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, glyphosate-tolerant legumes {{have been}} used as cover crops for weed {{management}} in tropical areas of Mexico. Mexican cologania (Cologania broussonetii (Balb.) DC.) is an innate glyphosate-tolerant legume with a potential as a cover crop in temperate areas of the country. In this work, glyphosate tolerance was characterized in two Mexican cologania (a treated (T) and an untreated (UT)) populations as being representatives of the species, compared in turn to a glyphosate-susceptible <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> (S) (Conyza bonariensis (L.) Cronq.) population. Experiments revealed that T and UT Mexican cologania populations had a higher tolerance index (TI), and a lower shikimic acid accumulation and foliar retention than the <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> S population. Absorption and translocation, leaf morphology and metabolism studies were only carried out in the Mexican cologania T population and the <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> S population. The latter absorbed 37 % more 14 C-glyphosate compared to the Mexican cologania T at 96 h after treatment (HAT). Mexican cologania T translocated less herbicide from the treated leaf to the remainder of the plant than <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> S. The Mexican cologania T presented a greater epicuticular wax coverage percentage than the <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> S. This morphological characteristic contributed to the low glyphosate absorption observed in the Mexican cologania. In addition, the Mexican cologania T metabolized glyphosate mainly into AMPA, formaldehyde and sarcosine. These results indicate that the high glyphosate tolerance observed in Mexican cologania is mainly due to the poor penetration and translocation of glyphosate into the active site, and the high glyphosate degradation into non-toxic substances.

40|$|Weed {{competition}} in the soybean causes changes in morphological and physiological characteristics that reduce the competitive ability of the crop. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the control periods and coexistence of glyphosate-resistant <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> and its interference in morphological and photosynthetic variables and RR soybean yield. A field experiment was conducted during the 2011 / 2012 growing season, the treatments consisted of weed interference and weed free periods of the glyphosate-resistant <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> with soybean (BRS Estância RR). The periods were 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 154 days after the soybean emergence. The results sugested no differences between the control periods for the variables evaluated. The increase interference period of the weed reduced growth, development and the photosynthetic variables in the soybean.

40|$|Glyphosate-resistant (GR) {{populations of}} <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> (Conyza bonariensis) were {{documented}} in the Central Valley (CV) in 2007. However, poor control of these populations was also observed with paraquat, a common contact herbicide also widely used in the CV. Therefore, {{it was hypothesized that}} <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> may have evolved resistance to both glyphosate and paraquat. Greenhouse studies were conducted in 2010 and 2011 to determine the response of different populations of <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> in the CV to both herbicides. Plants were grown in pots and sprayed at the 5 - to 8 -leaf stage with 0. 01, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 -fold the recommended label rate of either herbicide separately (1. 1 kg ae ha- 1 and 0. 5 kg ai ha- 1, respectively) as well as a non treated. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with six replicates. Plants mortality and aboveground dry weights were recorded. Results showed that some of the populations had resistance to both herbicides, with levels of resistance varying among herbicides and populations. In a separate study, glyphosate and paraquat- resistant plants were treated with other postemergence herbicides to determine mortality. Glufosinate, saflufenacil-alone or in combinations with other tested herbicides, and glyphosate with 2, 4 -D or carfentrazone controlled both biotypes of <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane.</b> These herbicides could be utilized as alternate treatments to manage glyphosate and paraquat resistant biotypes...|$|E

Hairy or flax-leaved fleabane is a ma-jor weed infesting roadsides, ditch-banks, orchards, vineyards and fallow areas in California. This weed belongs to the Asteraceae family and is an an-nual or short-lived perennial native to South America (Noyes 2000). At the seedling stage, <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> (Conyza bonariensis) looks very similar to horse-weed (Conyza canadensis) and can often be found growing in the same loca-tions. The most common methods used to control <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> in California include the use of pre- and postemer-gent herbicides, fall and/or spring cul-tivation, and hand-pulling. Generally, broad-spectrum postemergent herbi-cides, primarily glyphosate (Roundup), are used to control these weeds in or-chards, vineyards and noncrop areas in California (Shrestha et al. 2007). Glyphosate is considered the world’s most important herbicide because it provides broad-spectrum weed con-trol and has favorable environmental characteristics and low mammalian toxicity (Baylis 2000; Woodburn 2000). These characteristics, combined with its cost-effectiveness, have led to frequent applications of glyphosate in peren-nial cropping systems and noncro...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT With the {{increase}} of glyphosate resistance evolution in <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane,</b> the knowledge of genetic diversity is essential {{to assist in the}} weed management. The objective was to characterize the genetic diversity of glyphosate resistant Conyza species in Rio Grande do Sul. <b>Hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> biotype seeds were collected in fields of glyphosate-resistant soybean, generating seedlings used for extracting DNA from the leaves to perform a genetic diversity analysis, using the RAPD technique. The DNA was used in polymerase chain reaction and DNA fragments were assessed for polymorphism bands in electrophoresis. Biotypes were identified as Conyza bonariensis and microcephala varieties. In molecular analysis, among 25 primers RAPD, eight were reproducible generating polymorphisms of high intensity for the separation of biotypes. Cluster analysis revealed five groups, which had a genetic similarity of 53 %. The results indicate that all known biotypes are of the same species, but exhibit different varieties.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{resistance}} of weeds to herbicides {{is a consequence}} of one or more mechanisms in the plant, responsible for not allowing the herbicide to act properly at the active site. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the mechanism(s) of resistance to glyphosate in Conyza bonariensis. An experiment was conducted in November and December, 2012 and repeated in February and March, 2013 using a factorial arrangement of the treatments, where the factor A corresponded to biotypes of <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane,</b> susceptible (S) and resistant (R); the factor B to seven rates of glyphosate from 0 to 11, 520 g e. a. ha- 1, and factor C were simulated environmental conditions of winter (12 / 8 oC day/night of temperature and 10 / 14 h of photoperiod) and summer (28 / 20 oC day/night of temperature and 14 / 10 h of photoperiod). An assay evaluating the shikimic acid was performed twice in the month of July 2013, with treatments arranged in a factorial arrangement, being factor A biotypes of <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane,</b> S and R and the factor B seven glyphosate rates (0 to 28, 8 mg a. e. L- 1). The R biotype of C. bonariensis does not appear to present the sequestration of herbicide in the vacuole as the mechanism of resistance. However, the low accumulation of shikimate by the R biotype characterizes lower sensitivity of EPSPs enzyme to glyphosate, inferring that this is the present mechanism of resistance in plants of C. bonariensis. However, the resistance cannot be associated to a unique mechanism of resistance, requiring further studies to its understanding...|$|E

40|$|Paraquat-resistant <b>hairy</b> <b>fleabane</b> (Conyza bonariensis L. Cronq.) {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied, with some contention. A single, dominant gene pleiotropically controls levels of oxidant-detoxifying enzymes and tolerance to many photooxidants, to photoinhibition, and possibly to other stresses. The weed forms a rosette on humid short days and flowers in dry long days and, thus, needs plasticity to photooxidant stresses. In a series of four experiments over 20 months, the resistant and susceptible biotypes were cultured in constant 10 -h low-light short days at 25 [deg]C. Resistance was measured as recovery from paraquat. The concentration required to achieve 50 % inhibition of the resistant biotype was about 30 {{times that of the}} susceptible one just after germination, increased to > 300 times that of the susceptibles at 10 weeks of growth, and then decreased to 20 -fold, remaining constant except for a brief increase while bolting. Resistance increased when plants were induced to flower by long days. The levels of plastid superoxide dismutase and of glutathione reductase were generally highest in resistant plants compared to those of the susceptibles at the times of highest paraquat resistance, but they were imperceptibly different from the susceptible type at the times of lower paraquat resistance. Photoinhibition tolerance measured as quantum yield of oxygen evolution at ambient temperatures was highest when the relative amounts of enzymes were highest in the resistant biotype. Resistance to photoinhibition was not detected by chlorophyll a fluorescence. Enzyme levels, photoinhibition tolerance, and paraquat resistance all increased during flowering in both biotypes. Imperceptibly small increases in enzyme levels would be needed for 20 -fold resistance, based on the moderate enzyme increases correlated with 300 -fold resistance. Thus, it is feasible that either these enzymes {{play a role in the}} first line of defense against photooxidants, or another, yet unknown mechanism(s) facilitate(s) the lower level of resistance, or the enzymes and unknown mechanisms act together...|$|E
