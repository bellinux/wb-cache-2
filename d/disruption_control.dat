50|$|Small {{and colleagues}} {{performed}} a controlled experiment on retired NFL players and {{an equal number}} of control participants. Unfortunately the sample size was very small as only 5 players of the 19 contacted were eligible for the study. Though the sample size was small, a good range of positions were represented (linebacker, quarterback, offensive lineman, defensive lineman, and a center) and all players had played in the league at least 10 years. The players had to be at least 45 years of age and currently exhibit symptoms of cognitive and mood <b>disruption.</b> <b>Control</b> participants had to meet certain criteria as well to ensure that they were as similar as possible to the NFL players in order to eliminate any biases or confounding variables. Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), years of education, and family history of dementia were all selected as the selection criteria for control participants. All participants received intravenous injections of the FDDNP tracer and were tested over 4 weeks using PET imaging technology. The injection of the FDDNP tracer was successful, and {{the results of the study}} showed significant differences between the NFL players and control participants. The NFL players had significantly higher FDDNP signals than control participants, indicating a greater amount of tau protein accumulation. The cortical regions of all the participants studied showed no significant difference, but the NFL players had FDDNP levels that were significantly higher in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, sub thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar white matter regions of the brain as compared to the control participants. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the number of head injuries the players sustained and the levels of FDDNP binding. This suggests that players with a more severe history of head trauma will likely have significantly more accumulation of tau protein. This, in turn, gives rise to the suggestion that a more severe history of head trauma will result in greater deterioration of the brain, cognitive functioning, and mood regulation.|$|E
40|$|Controlling pest insects is a {{challenge}} of main importance to preserve crop production. In the context of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs, we develop a generic model to study the impact of mating <b>disruption</b> <b>control</b> using an artificial female pheromone to confuse males and adversely affect their mating opportunities. Consequently the reproduction rate is diminished leading {{to a decline in}} the population size. For more efficient control, trapping is used to capture the males attracted by the artificial pheromone. The model, derived from biological and ecological assumptions, is governed by a piecewise smooth system of ODEs. A theoretical analysis of the model without control is first carried out to establish the properties of the endemic equilibrium. Then, control is added and the theoretical analysis of the model enables to identify threshold values of pheromone which are practically interesting for field applications. In particular, we show that there is a threshold above which the global asymptotic stability of the trivial equilibrium is ensured, i. e. the population goes to extinction. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical results via numerical experiments. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Moving beyond ITER {{toward a}} {{demonstration}} power reactor (Demo) {{will require the}} integration of stable high fusion gain in steady-state, advanced methods for dissipating very high divertor heat-fluxes, and adherence to strict limits on in-vessel tritium retention. While ITER will clearly {{address the issue of}} high fusion gain, and new and planned long-pulse experiments (EAST, JT 60 -SA, KSTAR, SST- 1) will collectively address stable steady-state high-performance operation, none of these devices will adequately address the integrated heat-flux, tritium retention, and plasma performance requirements needed for extrapolation to Demo. Expressing power exhaust requirements in terms of P{sub heat}/R, future ARIES reactors are projected to operate with 60 - 200 MW/m, a Component Test Facility (CTF) or Fusion Development Facility (FDF) for nuclear component testing (NCT) with 40 - 50 MW/m, and ITER 20 - 25 MW/m. However, new and planned long-pulse experiments are currently projected to operate at values of P{sub heat}/R no more than 16 MW/m. Furthermore, none of the existing or planned experiments are capable of operating with very high temperature first-wall (T{sub wall} = 600 - 1000 C) which may be critical for understanding and ultimately minimizing tritium retention with a reactor-relevant metallic first-wall. The considerable gap between present and near-term experiments and the performance needed for NCT and Demo motivates the development of the concept for a new experiment [...] the National High-power advanced-Torus eXperiment (NHTX) [...] whose mission is to study the integration of a fusion-relevant plasma-material interface with stable steady-state high-performance plasma operation. Such a device would not have a high-fluence NCT mission, but would advance the science and technology necessary to accelerate the NCT mission at reduced risk in a separate nuclear facility. For the NHTX mission, flexibility to test multiple divertor configurations and first-wall components is critical, and flexibility in plasma exhaust configuration and boundary shape is important for understanding the plasma-wall interaction. Sufficient profile control must be available to generate high-performance fully non-inductive plasmas with high P{sub heat}/R {le} 50 MW/m and long pulses= 200 - 1000 s.

40|$|Rail {{transit systems}} {{are subject to}} {{frequent}} disruptions caused {{by a variety of}} random disturbances, signal problems and door problems, for example. Such disruptions usually last for 10 to 20 minutes, which degrades the level of service significantly. To improve service reliability, transit agencies employ various real time control strategies, such as holding, expressing and short turning, to deal with these disruptions. The effectiveness of these control strategies relies upon the bird's-eye-view of the whole system. Unfortunately, it is difficult for human dispatchers to assess the situation and make good decisions in real time, even with the aid of advanced information technologies such as automatic vehicle location systems. This thesis focuses upon the development of a real-time <b>disruption</b> <b>control</b> model for rail transit systems during disruptions. A deterministic model to representing the rail transit system is first introduced. In the model, the passenger flow rates and running time between stations are constant but station-specific. Assuming that the disruption duration is known, a formulation is developed that makes use of real time vehicle location information and considers holding, expressing and short turning strategies to reduce the impact of the disruption. The objective is to minimize the sum of total platform waiting time and weighted in-vehicle delay. The original formulation is transformed into a linear mixed integer problem, which can be solved by any linear optimizer. The formulation is applied to a disruption scenario on a simplified system based on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Red Line. The sensitivity of different control strategies to the disruption duration assumption is investigated. The results showed that holding strategies combined with short turning strategies can reduce the weighted waiting time (the sum of platform waiting time and weighted in vehicle delay) by about 10 - 60 %, compared with not applying any control strategies. Expressing only provided modest additional benefits. For the deterministic disruption duration assumption, sensitivity analysis showed that holding and expressing strategies are fairly robust, but the effectiveness of short turning strategies is quite sensitive to the accuracy of the disruption duration estimate. Most problem instances of the formulation can be solved in real-time with the proposed branching sequence used in the branch-and bound algorithm to solve this mixed integer problem. by Su Shen.

40|$|Progress in {{the area}} of MHD {{stability}} and disruptions, since the publication of the 1999 ITER Physics Basis document (1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2137 - 2664), is reviewed. Recent theoretical and experimental research has made important advances in both understanding and control of MHD stability in tokamak plasmas. Sawteeth are anticipated in the ITER baseline ELMy H-mode scenario, but the tools exist to avoid or control them through localized current drive or fast ion generation. Active control of other MHD instabilities will most likely be also required in ITER. Extrapolation from existing experiments indicates that stabilization of neoclassical tearing modes by highly localized feedback-controlled current drive should be possible in ITER. Resistive wall modes are a key issue for advanced scenarios, but again, existing experiments indicate that these modes can be stabilized by a combination of plasma rotation and direct feedback control with non-axisymmetric coils. Reduction of error fields is a requirement for avoiding non-rotating magnetic island formation and for maintaining plasma rotation to help stabilize resistive wall modes. Recent experiments have shown the feasibility of reducing error fields to an acceptable level by means of non-axisymmetric coils, possibly controlled by feedback. The MHD stability limits associated with advanced scenarios are becoming well understood theoretically, and can be extended by tailoring of the pressure and current density profiles as well as by other techniques mentioned here. There have been significant advances also in the control of disruptions, most notably by injection of massive quantities of gas, leading to reduced halo current fractions and a larger fraction of the total thermal and magnetic energy dissipated by radiation. These advances in <b>disruption</b> <b>control</b> are supported by the development of means to predict impending disruption, most notably using neural networks. In addition to these advances in means to control or ameliorate the consequences of MHD instabilities, there has been significant progress in improving physics understanding and modelling. This progress has been in areas including the mechanisms governing NTM growth and seeding, in understanding the damping controlling RWM stability and in modelling RWM feedback schemes. For disruptions there has been continued progress on the instability mechanisms that underlie various classes of disruption, on the detailed modelling of halo currents and forces and in refining predictions of quench rates and disruption power loads. Overall the studies reviewed in this chapter demonstrate that MHD instabilities can be controlled, avoided or ameliorated {{to the extent that they}} should not compromise ITER operation, though they will necessarily impose a range of constraints...|$|E

Periodic steady-state is a new concept defined as a state {{of a system that}} maintains itself despite transitory effects caused by periodic, but <b>controlled</b> <b>disruptions</b> (state of <b>controlled</b> operation).

Our data demonstrated that isolated cardiac mitochondria from MI-HF rats displayed decreased oxygen consumption, reduced maximum calcium uptake and elevated H 2 O 2 release.

Moreover, exercise training restored mitochondrial oxygen consumption, increased Ca 2 +-induced permeability transition and reduced H 2 O 2 release in MI-HF rats.

40|$|Peripheral neural {{trauma is}} known to induce blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) {{breakdown}}, but if and how BSCB breakdown contributes to pain is unknown. The studies in this thesis use rat models of cervical nerve root insults (compressive and inflammatory) to investigate which components of injury contribute to BSCB disruption and if BSCB <b>disruption</b> <b>controls</b> the pain responses. Further, whether serum-derived thrombin extravasates into the spinal parenchyma during BSCB breakdown and contributes to the associated spinal astrocyte activation and pain through its activation of PAR 1 is investigated. BSCB breakdown occurs transiently early after root compression exclusively when pain develops; blocking BSCB breakdown with activated protein C prevents pain. During increased BSCB permeability, thrombin acts enzymatically in the spinal cord. By inhibiting spinal thrombin with intrathecal hirudin before a painful compression, and separately by administering exogenous rat thrombin intrathecally to naïve rats, spinal thrombin is found to contribute to BSCB breakdown, spinal astrocyte activation and pain. Additionally, spinal thrombin initiates spinal neuroinflammation and pain through its activation of PAR 1, which is determined using pharmacological inhibition of spinal PAR 1 with SCH 79797. In contrast to mammalian thrombin, studies using the same painful in vivo model and complementary endothelial and astrocytic in vitro experiments also demonstrate that salmon thrombin exerts opposite effects on vascular permeability, astrocytic inflammation, and pain. Using synthetic fluorogenic peptides and in silico protein models, the vascular protection and anti-inflammatory effects of salmon thrombin are hypothesized {{to be controlled by}} its unique affinity for protein C over PAR 1. Lastly, spinal astrocytic and endothelial expression of the intermediate filament, vimentin, are shown to undergo a delayed increase at day 7 after a painful compression, suggesting that spinal cells may modulate their cellular mechanics in response to a painful neural injury. These studies identify how one pathological response, BSCB breakdown, that occurs in the spinal cord early after painful injury initiates a host of immediate and delayed biochemical and biomechanical responses that contribute to pain development. Findings further establish the powerful, yet diverse, role of spinal thrombin and its ability to initiate pathological or protective effects based on the signaling cascades it activates. ...|$|R

Replication elongation was inhibited within minutes after amino acid starvation, regardless of where the replication forks were located on the chromosome. We found that small nucleotides ppGpp and pppGpp, which are induced upon starvation, appeared to inhibit replication directly by inhibiting primase, an essential component of the replication machinery. The replication forks arrested with (p) ppGpp did not recruit the recombination protein RecA, indicating that the forks are not disrupted. (p) ppGpp appear {{to be part of a}} surveillance mechanism that links nutrient availability to replication by rapidly inhibiting replication in starved cells, thereby preventing replication-fork <b>disruption.</b> This <b>control</b> may be important for cells to maintain genomic integrity.
