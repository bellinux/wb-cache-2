Purpose: This study evaluates the therapeutic effects of iontophoresis using GNPs and diclofenac <b>diethylammonium</b> on inflammatory parameters in rats challenged with traumatic tendinitis. Methods: Wistar rats were divided in three treatment groups (n = 15) : (1) iontophoresis + diclofenac diethylammonium; (2) iontophoresis + GNP; and (3) iontophoresis + diclofenac <b>diethylammonium</b> + GNP.

Results: The levels of both inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in untreated challenged rats, when compared with the control (5. 398 &plusmn; 234 for interleukin 1 beta and 6. 411 &plusmn; 432 for tumor necrosis factor alpha), which confirms the occurrence of an inflammatory stage in injury (P &lt; 0. 05).

Pioneering studies by Barraud and co-workers (2006) firstly showed the potential dispersion of biofilm preformed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dispersal was induced with low, sub-lethal concentrations (25 – 500  nmol/L) of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (Barraud et al. 2006). Other studies showed the dispersal potential of donors such as molsidomine, MAHMA NONOate, diethylamine NONOate <b>diethylammonium,</b> PROLI NONOate (Marvasi et al. 2014; Barnes et al. 2015). The mechanisms leading to the NO donor-mediated dispersal of biofilm are not completely clear, but it appears to function in the transition of sessile biofilm organisms to free-swimming bacteria (Barraud et al. 2015). Genetic studies have revealed that genes involved in nitric oxide signaling are regulated in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria showing a universal regulation of nitric oxide in bacteria (Firoved et al. 2004; Xiong and Liu 2010; Narayanasamy 2011; Hong et al. 2014).

In the sham-operated group, the rats were submitted to all surgical procedures, but the caecum was neither ligated nor perforated. All animals were observed and developed signs of infection (piloerection, lethargy, tachypnea or weight loss). The number of animals that survived is consistent with our previous reports.|$|E
30|$|With this study, {{we focused}} {{on the effects of}} {{off-the-shelf}} NO donors on the biofilms formed by seven strains of S. enterica and pathogenic E. coli on surfaces that mimic those found in food processing facilities. The five compounds selected for these tests based on their low potential toxicity, commercial availability and predicted potency demonstrated varying levels of specificity and efficacy. Of the compounds tested, molsidomine and diethylamine NONOate <b>diethylammonium</b> are the most promising as they are capable of dislodging biofilms formed by S. Typhimurium 14028, a cocktail of six Salmonella strains isolated from outbreaks and E. coli O 157 :H 7 under most of the tested conditions. For most of the compounds tested, their highest activity appears to be in the picomolar range, suggesting that their applications could be further optimized for the economical and effective industrial applications. The activity of the compounds in the nano- and picomolar ranges further suggests that NO acts as a potent cue, consistent with previous reports. Low biofilm-dispersing activity of the nitric oxide donors at higher concentrations is, perhaps, not surprising considering that NO can be bactericidal at a concentration of mg L− 1 (McDougald et al. [2012]; Miller et al. [2009]), and the methods employed in this study would not necessarily distinguish between live and dead bacteria within an existing biofilm.|$|E
30|$|Biofilms in the {{industrial}} environment could be problematic. Encased in extracellular polymeric substances, pathogens within biofilms are significantly more resistant to chlorine and other disinfectants. Recent studies suggest that compounds capable of manipulating nitric oxide-mediated signaling in bacteria could induce dispersal of sessile bacteria and provide a foundation for novel approaches to controlling biofilms formed by some microorganisms. In this work, we compared the ability of five nitric oxide donors (molsidomine, MAHMA NONOate, diethylamine NONOate, diethylamine NONOate <b>diethylammonium</b> salt, spermine NONOate) to dislodge biofilms formed by non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica and pathogenic E. coli on plastic and stainless steel surfaces at different temperatures. All five nitric oxide donors induced significant (35 - 80 %) dispersal of biofilms, however, the degree of dispersal and the optimal dispersal conditions varied. MAHMA NONOate and molsidomine were strong dispersants of the Salmonella biofilms formed on polystyrene. Importantly, molsidomine induced dispersal of up to 50 % of the pre-formed Salmonella biofilm at 4 °C, suggesting {{that it could be}} effective even under refrigerated conditions. Biofilms formed by E. coli O 157 :H 7 were also significantly dispersed. Nitric oxide donor molecules were highly active within 6  hours of application. To better understand mode of action of these compounds, we identified Salmonella genomic region recA-hydN, deletion of which led to an insensitivity to the nitric oxide donors.|$|E
40|$|Interest in elucidating the {{mechanisms}} of action of various classes of anticancer agents and exploring the pathways of the induced-nitric oxide (NO) release provides an impetus to conceive a better designed approach to locally detect NO in tumors, in vivo. We report here on the first use of an electrochemical sensor that allows the in vivo detection of NO in tumor-bearing mice. In a first step, we performed the electrochemical characterization of a stable electroactive probe, K 4 Fe(CN) 6, directly injected into the liquid microenvironment especially created around the electrode in the tumor. Second, {{the ability of the}} inserted electrode system to detect the presence of NO itself in the tumoral tissue was achieved by using the chemically modified Pt/Ir electrode as NO sensor and two NO donor molecules: <b>diethylammonium</b> (Z) - 1 -(N,N-diethylamino) diazen- 1 -ium 1, 2 -diolate (DEA-NONOate) and (Z) - 1 -[N-(2 -aminopropyl) -N-(2 -ammonio propyl) amino]diazen- 1 -ium 1, 2 -diolate (PAPA-NONOate). These two NO donor molecules allowed proving the electrochemical detection of (i) directly injected exogenous NO phosphate buffer solution into the tumor (decomposed DEA-NONOate) and (ii) biomimetically induced endogeneous release of NO in the tumoral tissue, upon injection of PAPA-NONOate into the tumor. This approach could be applied to the in vivo study of candidate anticancer drugs acting on the NO pathways...|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} the thermal changes of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues exposed to different aerosols. Thirty-six adults Wistar rats were arranged in two treatment groups, one exposed to methyl salicylate (GSM; n = 9 skin and n = 9 subcutaneous) {{and the other}} exposed to diclofenac <b>diethylammonium</b> (GDD; n = 9 skin and n = 9 subcutaneous) aerosols. Five jets were applied for one-second through an apparatus to reduce spray dispersion (3 cmdiameter) in the lateral left thigh of the animals. Temperatures were measured every minute (min.) during 30 min., with a digital thermometer. In the skin tissue the sensor was positioned manually, in the subcutaneous tissue it was surgically inserted through the rear face and positioned in the lateral thigh. The skin temperature has homogeneously reduced in both groups. In the subcutaneous tissue the GDD has induced hypothermia from the 2 nd to 20 th min., the lowest temperature was recorded on the 7 th min. (- 3. 6 ± 0. 2 ºC in relation to basal). Lowering the temperature by GSM took place from the 1 st to 21 st min, and the lowest temperature occurred on the 1 st min (- 9. 7 ± 0. 5 ºC in relation to basal). In the three initial minutes the GSM had temperatures 25, 10 and 5 % lower than the GDD. Aerosols have induced hypothermia in the tissues, while the GSM has decreased faster and reached lower values of temperature shown in the subcutaneous tissue...|$|E
