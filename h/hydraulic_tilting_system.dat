50|$|The next {{attempt was}} made with DMUs and the well proven Italian <b>hydraulic</b> active <b>tilting</b> <b>system.</b> Between 1988 and 1990 DB {{commissioned}} 20 class 610 units for fast regional traffic. This time the results were quite satisfying and allowed a significant reduction of running times. Class 610 was followed by class 611 which basically was built for the same purpose (fast regional traffic with up to 160 km/h on twisting non-electrified lines). Class 611's <b>tilting</b> <b>system</b> was electric, with a maximum 8° tilt, based on military technology from the Leopard tank. However, after coming into service in 1996 this 50-unit class experienced problems both with the newly developed <b>tilting</b> <b>system</b> as well as chassis and axles, so it was judged not successful. The <b>tilting</b> <b>system</b> was out of service until 2006, when hardened axles and system updates finally solved the problems. In consideration of these problems DB ordered a full re-engineering, resulting {{in the development of}} class 612. Starting in 1998, a total of 192 units were commissioned by DB. The <b>tilting</b> <b>system</b> was reliable, but when in 2004 cracks were detected in a number of wheel sets, again wheels and axles had to be replaced. Today class 612 is back to tilting operation and forms the backbone of DB's fast regional service on non-electrified lines. Additional units were sold to Croatia, where they are used for InterCity services.|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour of the nepheline family: (3) Thermal {{expansion of}} kalsilite THE published structures of SrA 120 4 and BaA 120 4 (Schulze and Mfiller-Buschbaum, 1981; H 6 rkner and Mfiller-Buschbaum, 1979) {{and the change}} in the cell parameters of their solid solution series as a function of temperature and composition (Henderson and Taylor, 1982; Paper 1 of this series) indicated that their structural behaviour could be pictured in terms of two <b>tilt</b> <b>systems.</b> One (<b>tilt</b> l) is a cooperative rotation of the framework tetrahedra about the three-fold axes which lie par-allel to the c-axis, and the other (tilt 2) is a cooperative tilting of the framework tetrahedra relative to the 0001 plane. Both increasing tem-perature and increasing the size of the cavity cation were deduced to cause partial removal of both <b>tilt</b> <b>systems.</b> Distance Least Squares (DLS) modelling of the monoclinic (Ba,Sr) A 1204 solid-solution series has confirmed significant changes in both <b>tilt</b> <b>systems</b> for compositional effects, but smaller changes for thermal effects (Taylor et al., 1985; Paper 2 of this series). It was not possible to explore the behaviour of the two <b>tilt</b> <b>systems</b> for the hexagonal (Ba,Sr) A 1204 solid-solution series by the DLS method because of severe problems in modelling their structures.

40|$|Narrow tilting {{vehicles}} {{offer an}} opportunity to reduce both traffic congestion and carbon emissions by having a small road footprint, a low weight and a small frontal area. Their narrow track requires that they tilt into corners to maintain stability; this may be achieved {{by means of an}} automated <b>tilt</b> control <b>system.</b> Automated <b>tilt</b> control <b>systems</b> can be classed as steering tilt control in which active control of the front-wheel steering angle is used to maintain stability, direct tilt control in which some form of actuator is used to exert a moment between the tilting part(s) of the vehicle and non-tilting part(s), or a combination of the two, namely steering–direct tilt control. Combined steering–direct <b>tilt</b> control <b>systems</b> have the potential to offer improved performance as, unlike steering <b>tilt</b> control <b>systems,</b> they are effective at low speeds while offering superior transient roll stability to direct <b>tilt</b> control <b>systems.</b> This paper details the implementation of a steering direct <b>tilt</b> control <b>system</b> on a prototype narrow tilting vehicle and presents experimental results which demonstrate a 36 % reduction in load transfer from the inside wheel to the outside wheel during a ramp-steering manoeuvre when compared with a direct <b>tilt</b> control <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy, x-ray diffraction, {{relative permittivity}} {{as a function}} of temperature, and polarization versus field loops were used to study the antiferroelectric/ferroelectric (AFE/FE) phase boundary in Pb 1 − 1. 5 xLaxZr 0. 9 Ti 0. 1 O 3 (PLZT, 100 x/ 90 / 10) ceramics. X-ray diffraction and electrical measurements indicated a FE rhombohedral (R) to AFE tetragonal (T) phase transition between PLZT 2 / 90 / 10 and 4 / 90 / 10. Both phases exhibited superstructure reflections in electron-diffraction patterns at 1 ⁄ 2 hkl positions consistent with rotations of the octahedra in antiphase. Previously, neutron diffraction suggested that the FER has an a−a−a− <b>tilt</b> <b>system</b> (Glazer notation), in agreement with its macroscopic symmetry.

The octahedral tilting distortion increases as the average ionic radius of the Ln/A cations, [rA], decreases. The two crystallographically distinct Mn-O-Mn bonds [Mn-O(eq) -Mn and Mn-O(ax) -Mn] are almost identical for Ln(0. 5) Ca(0. 5) MnO(3) compounds, with the exception of La 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 MnO 3. The La 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 MnO 3 compound and the entire Ln(0. 5) Sr(0. 5) MnO(3) series adopt structures where the Mn-O(eq) -Mn bond angle is consistently and significantly larger (2 - 6 degrees) than the Mn-O(ax) -Mn bond angle. All of the Ln(0. 5) Ca(0. 5) MnO(3) compounds have Pnma symmetry, whereas across the Ln(0. 5) Sr(0. 5) MnO(3) series with increasing (rA), an evolution from Pnma (<b>tilt</b> <b>system</b> a(-) b(+) a(-)) over Imma (<b>tilt</b> <b>system</b> a(-) b(0) a(-)) to I 4 /mcm (<b>tilt</b> <b>system</b> a(0) a(0) c(-)) symmetry is observed. It appears that the latter two <b>tilt</b> <b>systems</b> are stabilized with respect to the rhombohedral (R (3) over bar c) a(-) a(-) a(-) <b>tilt</b> <b>system,</b> by short-range layered ordering of A-site cations. Changes in the octahedral <b>tilt</b> <b>system</b> at room temperature are linked to changes in the low-temperature magnetic structure. In particular, the simultaneous onset of charge ordering and CE-type antiferromagnetism in the Ln(0. 5) Sr(0. 5) MnO(3) series appears to be closely associated with the Imma structure. The average Mn-O bond distance is relatively constant across the entire series, but individual Mn-O bond distances show the presence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller effect (orbital ordering) at room temperature in Sm 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 MnO 3 and Sm 0. 25 Y 0. 25 Ca 0. 5 MnO 3...|$|R
