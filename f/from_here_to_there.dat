500|$|Longtime scout Charlie Metro {{remembered the}} havoc caused by Henderson: '"I {{did a lot}} of study and I found that it's {{impossible}} to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>there</b> to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it." ...|$|E

[...] "I've had a vision for my name since I was very young, that I {{was going to take}} it to the top of my industry", he says. [...] His wirewalking [...] "wishlist" [...] includes traversing the Bosphorus continental divide in Turkey and Inca ruins at Machu Picchu. [...] He would like to do an event with the Eiffel Tower and Egypt's pyramids. [...] "There's a lot of expectations on my end", he says, adding that he wants to [...] " [...] the circus". [...] "Whenever we're someplace unique or different," [...] says Erendira, [...] "he's always looking around – 'Oh, I could string a wire <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>there</b> and walk there.'" [...] Wallenda, who spent the summer of 2014 in Western New York with shows at Darien Lake and the Erie County Fair, hopes to develop a longer-term tourist attraction near Niagara Falls honoring stuntmen such as his family.|$|E

2500|$|Welch {{did with}} Fox her first {{starring}} vehicle, the British Modesty Blaise-style spy movie Fathom (1967), filmed in Spain. Second unit director Peter Medak said Welch [...] "was {{at that time}} quite inexperienced, exactly {{like one of those}} American drum majorettes. But she tried very hard and went to see the rushes each day, gradually improving. 'Who's this dumb broad?' people used to say. But I said: 'You wait. I'll bet she makes it.' I liked her very much because she was such a genuine person. And she had a beautiful body which always helps." [...] Welch said her role was [...] "a blown up Barbie doll." [...] Reviewing her performance, the Los Angeles Times film critic said that [...] "each new Raquel Welch picture brings further proof that when Maria Montez died they didn't break the mold. Like Maria, Raquel can't act <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>there,</b> but both ladies seem to have been born to be photographed... this sappiest of spy pictures." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} called Waterloo Road {{when it opened}} in 1903, at the junction with a newly built express Marton Line direct from Kirkham.

6000|$|The {{human mind}} {{has a much}} more complex and {{fluctuating}} process than most of those explanatory people who write about psychology would have us believe. Instead of that simple, direct movement, like the movement of a point, forward and <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>there,</b> one's thoughts advance like an army, sometimes extended over an enormous front, sometimes in échelon, sometimes bunched in a column throwing out skirmishing clouds of emotion, some flying and soaring, some crawling, some stopping and dying.... In this matter of Labor, for example, I have thought so much, thought over the ground again and again, come into it from this way and from that way, that {{for the life of}} me I find it impossible to state at all clearly how much I made of these questions during that Johannesburg time. I cannot get back into those ancient ignorances, revive my old astonishments and discoveries. Certainly I envisaged the whole process much less clearly than I do now, ignored difficulties that have since entangled me, regarded with a tremendous perplexity aspects that have now become lucidly plain. I came back to England confused, and doing what confused people are apt to do, clinging to an inadequate phrase that seemed at any rate to define a course of action. The word [...] "efficiency" [...] had got hold of me. All our troubles came, one assumed, from being [...] "inefficient." [...] One turned towards politics with a bustling air, and was all for fault-finding and renovation.|$|E
60|$|Dickory did {{not care}} to go anywhere, but he had hardly said so when a revulsion of feeling came upon him, and turning away so that his face might not be noticed, {{he said he thought}} the land air might do him good. While the men were at work {{carrying}} their pails from the well-known spring to the water-barrels in the boat, Dickory strolled about to view the scenery, for it could never have been expected that a first lieutenant in uniform should help to carry water. At first the scenery {{did not appear to be}} very interesting, and Dickory wandered slowly <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>there,</b> then sat down under a tree. Presently he rose and went to another tree, a little farther away from the boat and the men at the spring. Here he quietly took off his shoes and his stockings, and, having nothing else to do, made a little bundle of them, listlessly tying them to his belt; then he rose and walked away somewhat brisker, but not in the direction of the boat. He did not hurry, but even stopped sometimes to look at things, but he still walked a little briskly, and always away from the boat. He had been so used, this child of outdoor life, to going about the world barefooted, that it was no wonder that he walked briskly, being relieved of his encumbering shoes and stockings.|$|E

The two-lane roads heads east through a mostly forested {{area of the}} county, staying between 1 to 1+1/2 mi north of the Roanoke Rapids Lake shoreline. At the intersection of River Road, North Carolina Bicycle Route 4 joins to form a concurrency with NC 46 <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> Gaston. <b>There</b> is a small cluster of homes as the road passes the settlement of Vultare. Forested areas begin {{to give way to}} a mix of farms and small single-family houses. Soon, the road enters the town of Gaston intersecting NC 48 {{in the center of the}} town. This intersection marks the end of the Bike Route 4 concurrency.|$|R

50|$|The Central {{bus station}} in Erode is the Erode Central Bus Terminus. A large network of interstate and intrastate buses ply <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> various destinations. <b>There</b> {{is a good}} co-existence of {{both private and public}} {{transport}} networks in the city round the clock. The Erode division of the TNSTC (Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation), Coimbatore Limited, services the district's road transport needs with a string of local and mofussil (out-of-town) services. The State Express Bus Corporation (SETC) operates express services to various places. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) has a sub-divisional headquarters at Erode falling under the Coimbatore division. Originally called as Jeeva Transport Corporation (JTC), it started functioning from 1 April 1983, with the principal area of operation in the Erode district, parts of Tirupur, Namakkal, Salem and Karur Districts. The fleet strength as on 31 March 2005 was 1218. During the year 2003-2005, 114 buses were purchased for replacement. One another Bus station is under construction in the city at Solar to reduce traffic in central BS and in the city. Also there is another plan to construct another Bus terminal near Chithode, off NH-47 bypass.|$|R
50|$|The {{base in the}} Kaiserbach {{valley is}} the pine oil {{distillery}} (Latschenölbrennerei, 900 m) between the Fischbachalm and the Griesner Alm (car parks on the toll road from Griesenau). The signposted mountain path climbs steeply into the Kleine Griesner Tor, a rock-strewn cirque. From there it branches off, unsigned, to the left; the main path carries on to the Fritz Pflaum Hut. <b>From</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> the summit <b>there</b> are only occasional and very faded signs (as at 2009) and the danger of falling rocks is ever present. The route traces a way roughly {{through the middle of}} an extremely steep, unstable scree slope to about 1,850 metres on the rock face of the summit block. There the climbing path leads up out of the cirque and runs across steep terrain (Schrofen), bands of rock and steep gullies. At the most difficult spot a cable has been fixed to which climbers must attach themselves. Immediately thereafter, is a challenging, unsecured grade II climb. In front of a rocky ledge (view over to the Chiemsee) the route runs right (view of St. Johann) and then over the north arête to the summit cross. Three hours should be allowed for the whole climb, the descent on this route takes 2.5 hours.|$|R
50|$|Green Mountain is {{situated}} on the Eastern bank of the Grand Chipineticook Lake, Grand Lake {{being one of the}} lakes that form part of the boundary line between the Province of New Brunswick and the State of Maine. The place is about 22 miles from Canterbury and about 18 miles from Danforth and Forest Station; the latter two stations being {{situated on the}} line of the Maine Central Railway in the State of Maine.The first settler that came to this place was Elias Foster in the year of 1853. When he first came here he lived in a log house on the farm occupied now by W.B. Foster. He lived there about a year and then moved up to the farm occupied now by J.L. Foster. He and {{his wife and two children}} lived there for two years with no settlers any nearer than Foster’s Corner -- now called Fosterville, with the exception of two young men who lived here in the summer seasons on the farms occupied now by H.H. Veysey and George McMinn. The next settler that came was William Rollins who lived on the farm occupied now by Whiteford Peck.About three years after the first settler came, other settlers began to come in quite quickly.In the year 1863, Henry Pray and George Robinson came <b>here</b> and moved <b>to</b> what is called the Balm of Gilead Point. They lived there for a while when they sold out and other settlers began to come in.When the first settlers came here there were no roads, only sled roads <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> Fosterville. <b>From</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> Canterbury <b>there</b> were no roads only a spotted line. After a few years roads were made between here and Canterbury Station.The mail came in once a week and it was carried part way by a team and the rest of the way on foot by Samuel Cropley. The North Lake Post Office was located at that time what is now called Fosterville and it was kept by William Foster. About the year 1876 it was transferred to Green Mountain and kept by J.R. Foster for about 10 years. It was then transferred to H.H. Veysey where it is kept at the present.|$|R
