50|$|Volunteer Centres Ireland {{began in}} the year 2000 {{when some of the}} {{earliest}} volunteer centres in the Republic of Ireland (including what is now the South Dublin County Volunteer Centre, the Volunteer Centre Fingal and Volunteering Ireland), came together to discuss common issues that affected them.

Volunteer Centres Ireland merged with Volunteering Ireland in 2011 to <b>form</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Ireland, the national volunteer development agency and a support body for all local Volunteer Centres in Ireland.|$|E

5000|$|One month later, World War I {{broke out}} and the newly {{established}} General Ukrainian Council published in a Lviv newspaper [...] "Dilo" [...] the call for Galician Ukrainians to <b>form</b> <b>volunteer</b> units to fight the Russian Empire. The Ukrainian leaders in Austria-Hungary hoped that the formation of these units would {{advance the cause of}} national liberation. They also sought to dispel the suspicions of some Galician Russophiles that the Ukrainians in that area were sympathetic to Russia. The Austrian war ministry was not prepared for this initiative of the General Ukrainian Council and allowed creation of a unit with only 2,500 men. The first volunteers were mainly members of Ukrainian nationalist organizations such as Sich, Sokil and Plast.|$|E
5000|$|Firefighters - Firefighters are {{emergency}} response teams that {{can deal with}} any number of emergencies. Most of which involve fighting and protecting citizens from fires, but {{can also be utilized}} in search and rescue, providing assistance in car accidents, and chemical spills. Firefighting, while normally is made up of formally trained members, can also consist of volunteers. Many smaller towns, that large fire stations can not be established in, will <b>form</b> <b>volunteer</b> departments that are made up of citizens that work other jobs and come together {{in the event of a}} fire to protect the town. On top the common firefighting departments, which are known as urban or suburban firefighters, firefighters can be categorized as wild-land, industrial, airport, and contract firefighters.|$|E
50|$|The {{first time}} volunteers were {{organised}} {{on a national}} basis was in 1744 {{in response to a}} French invasion threat. Lords-lieutenant of counties and mayors of towns were given authority to <b>form</b> <b>volunteer</b> associations, and Northamptonshire formed the first of these, on 4 April 1744. The proposal was signed by 530 'substantial freeholders, yeomen and yeomen's sons', and unlike most such associations they were willing to serve in any part of the realm, and not only in their own area. During the Jacobite invasion of 1745, the Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire, John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, raised a county regiment, probably from the nucleus of the association. The volunteer associations lapsed on the peace of 1748, but new volunteer units were raised in 1779 when Britain was again threatened by French invasion during the American Revolutionary War.|$|E

5000|$|In 1863 Watts {{was elected}} Governor of Alabama. Assuming office on December 1, he began an eighteen-month {{governorship}} {{at a time}} when impressment, the tax-in-kind, and other severe wartime economic measures had become most odious. Worthless Confederate money, lack of credit possibilities, irregular supplies of goods, impressment efforts that often amounted to pillage and plunder, and harsh (and unevenly applied) taxes-in-kind levied on agriculture convinced many people that they preferred the [...] "Old Union" [...] to the [...] "new despotism". The need to raise troops for the defense of the state became more urgent. Appeals to the male population to <b>form</b> <b>volunteer</b> companies and appeals to the state legislature to reorganize the state's awkward two-class militia were met with insurmountable resistance. Some critics of Watts thought he should concentrate on forcing deserters back into military service. The legislature's failure to act meant that the state, and the Confederacy, would not have an effective militia in the final critical months of the war. Furthermore, the Confederate Conscription Act of February 17, 1864, inaugurated a policy of conscription that inevitably led to conflict {{between the state and the}} Confederacy.|$|E
5000|$|Freikorps {{were the}} brainchild of Major Kurt von Schleicher. The Freikorps were also called the [...] "Black Reichswehr" [...] (Black Army) for they were a 'secret' army outside the bounds of the Versailles Treaty. The idea was {{developed}} after the failure of an army unit to quell a small rebellion in Berlin at the Battle of the Schloss. The army unit, when confronted by a socialist group with women and children, threw down their weapons and either ran away or joined the protest group. This led Major von Schleicher to conceive an alternative to using Reichswehr units to quell [...] "red" [...] (socialist or communist) uprisings. He suggested to his superiors to <b>form</b> <b>volunteer</b> units recruited from the old Reichswehr and commanded by former Imperial officers under governmental control. This way the Reichswehr would avoid the stigma of having to fire on civilians and the government would be financially supporting these freikorps, leaving the Reichswehr to concentrate on training for real battle. Men who joined these units were called [...] "Freebooters", and they often held strong right-wing and nationalist political views. The central Berlin government thought along with the central Reichswehr command that by paying and arming these 'black' soldiers, {{they might be able}} 'to tie them to the crib' and thus render them harmless.|$|E

40|$|The Spanish-American War, {{which began}} in 1898, coincided with a virulent {{campaign}} of racial violence and legal segregation directed at African Americans throughout the "Jim Crow" South. As the jingoism of the day stirred American nationalism, {{the question of whether}} to support the war against Spain was much more complicated to even the most patriotic African Americans as they faced an unceasing assault on their civil rights. Utilizing numerous editorials from the black press, and letters from African Americans written to President William McKinley, the Secretary of War, the U. S. Army Adjutant General, and various state governors, this dissertation analyzes the African American response to the Spanish-American War, and discusses how they attempted to use the conflict as a new battleground in the larger struggle for equal rights. By outlining the efforts of African Americans to be allowed to volunteer for the army during the war with Spain this study shows how they considered the opportunity to fight to be a right as American citizens. Additionally, I detail how once African Americans earned the right to <b>form</b> <b>volunteer</b> regiments they strove to guarantee the fair treatment of black soldiers, and labored to insure that African American service and sacrifice was honored and remembered properly. Finally, I chart the evolution of disillusionment as it became increasingly apparent that their contribution to the war effort would not bring lasting change...|$|E
