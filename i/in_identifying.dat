40|$|Motor {{functions}} are often guided by sensory experience, most convincingly illustrated by complex learned behaviors. Key to sensory guidance in motor areas {{may be the}} structural and functional organization of sensory inputs and their evoked responses. We study sensory responses in large populations of neurons and neuron-assistive cells in the songbird motor area HVC, an auditory-vocal brain area involved in sensory learning and in adult song production. HVC spike responses to auditory stimulation display remarkable preference for the bird’s own song (BOS) compared to other stimuli. Using two-photon calcium imaging in anesthetized zebra finches we measure the spatio-temporal structure of baseline activity and of auditory evoked responses <b>in</b> <b>identified</b> populations of HVC cells. We find strong correlations between calcium signal fluctuations in nearby cells of a given type, both <b>in</b> <b>identified</b> neurons and <b>in</b> astroglia. <b>In</b> <b>identified</b> HVC neurons only, auditory stimulation decorrelates ongoing calcium signals, less for BOS than for other sound stimuli. Overall, calcium transients show strong preference for BOS <b>in</b> <b>identified</b> HVC neurons but not in astroglia, showing diversity in local functional organization among identified neuron and astroglia populations...|$|R

Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E

5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems. Ethnobotany {{is the study of}} the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of Canada <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> edible plants from inedible plants.

With the help of a new acquaintance the Duke de Blacas in 1824, Champollion finally published the Précis du système hiéroglyphique des anciens Égyptiens dedicated to and funded by King Louis XVIII. Here he presented the first correct translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the Egyptian grammatical system.|$|E
5|$|If one {{of these}} tests shows a {{deficiency}} of hormones produced by the pituitary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary {{is the first step}} <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> an underlying cause.

Computed tomography with radiocontrast may be used if MRI is not available. Formal visual field testing by perimetry is recommended, as this would show evidence of optic nerve compression by a tumor.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, an Italian-led {{consortium}} {{announced they}} had sequenced the complete genome {{of the apple}} in collaboration with horticultural genomicists at Washington State University, using 'Golden Delicious'. It had about 57,000 genes, {{the highest number of}} any plant genome studied to date and more genes than the human genome (about 30,000). This new understanding of the apple genome will help scientists <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. The genome sequence also provided proof that Malus sieversii was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>identifying</b> {{the remains}} {{as those of}} Palaeoscincus, Broom {{initially}} classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed {{by the research of}} Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{wings are}} {{fundamental}} <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> and classifying species {{as there is}} no other set of structures in studying insects more significant. Each order and insect family has distinctive wing shapes and features. In many cases, even species may be distinguished from each other by differences of color and pattern. For example, just by position one can identify species, albeit to a much lesser extent. Though most insects fold their wings when at rest, dragonflies and some damselflies rest with their wings spread out horizontally, while groups such as the caddisflies, stoneflies, alderflies, and lacewings hold their wings sloped roof-like over their backs. A few moths wrap their wings around their bodies, while many flies and most butterflies close their wings together straight upward over the back.|$|E
