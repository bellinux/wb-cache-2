Kirk's second-in-command, the Vulcan Spock, is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. DeForest Kelley plays Leonard McCoy, the {{chief medical officer}} of the Enterprise; Kelley's {{appearance}} as the doctor in The Undiscovered Country was to be his last screen role. With Leonard Nimoy the film's executive producer, the 71-year-old Kelley was paid US$1million for the role, assuring a comfortable retirement for the veteran actor. Kelley and Shatner shot their prison scenes {{over the course of}} six to eight nights; the two actors <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other better than they ever had.|$|E
5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other. They stayed in {{contact with each other}} in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other, highlighting the idea that Gary and Val were always destined to end up together one way or another.|$|E

40|$|The 1911 Revolution {{is deeply}} {{related to the}} Japanese supporters. Kayano Nagatomo （ 1873 - 1947 ） {{is one of the}} most {{important}} Japanese people who supported the 1911 Revolution. He developed friendships with many Chinese revolutionaries, and especially had a deep contact with Chü Cheng（ 1876 - 1951 ）, who was a close associate of Sun Yat-sen in the revolution. Kayano and Chü <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> with <b>each</b> other after the Tongmenghui’s establishment in 1906. After the Mukden Incident launched by Japanese military, Kayano went to China as a secret emissary of Inukai Tsuyoshi （ 1855 - 1932 ）, the Prime Minister of Japan and had communication with Chü Cheng in order to find a peaceful solution to avoid military conflict between China and Japan, but in vain eventually because of the obstruction of Army. This paper analyzes the relationship between Kayano Nagatomo and Chü Cheng and points out how it influenced the 1911 Revolution and Sino-Japanese relations. 東アジアの歴史と動...|$|R

500|$|Curtis {{stated that}} casting an actor to play Van Gogh was done carefully, {{as he wanted}} him to feel to the {{audience}} as Van Gogh, not [...] "like a bloke they’ve seen acting lots of other parts, in an orange wig". Tony Curran was ultimately cast as the part; Curtis called him a [...] "wonderful actor" [...] who [...] "really could not look more like" [...] Van Gogh. Curran, Smith and Gillan <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other very well, which Gillan hoped would be evident in their chemistry in the episode. Bill Nighy appears uncredited as the Musée d'Orsay's expert on Van Gogh. Nighy was rumoured to have been considered {{for the role of}} the Ninth Doctor when the show was revived. Campbell stated that they were [...] "very fortunate" [...] to have Nighy in the role, who he believed was someone people paid attention to, and the audience needed to pay attention to his character as he said facts which would become important later in the story.|$|E
500|$|In the 1964U.S. presidential election, Senator Barry Goldwater {{quickly became}} the likely Republican Party nominee. Goldwater {{represented}} {{a new wave of}} American conservatism, of which the moderate Romney was not a part. Romney also felt that Goldwater would be a drag on Republicans running in all the other races that year, including Romney's own (at the time, Michigan had two-year terms for its governor). Finally, Romney disagreed strongly with Goldwater's views on civil rights; he would later say, [...] "Whites and Negroes, in my opinion, have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other.

50|$|Independent {{from the}} {{decisions}} {{made during the}} international meeting in Paris, the Students council from the Netherlands (NSR) also planned to organise an international seminar on agriculture from 22 till 29 June 1957. Around December 1956, NSR (Netherlands) and UGET (Tunis) <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about <b>each</b> other's plans and this caused a conflict. UGET didn’t {{like the idea of}} having two international seminars so close to each other. However, several careful and diplomatic dialogues per mail, and a meeting in Leiden (the Netherlands) on 15-16 March 1957, resulted in a cooperation and a tight friendship between Tahar Belkhodja (president of UGET) and R. van den Berg (president of NSR). The NSR decided to cancel its congress in Wageningen in favour of the one in Tunis and to cooperate intensively with UGET. It seems to be just an anecdote, but there are reasons to believe that this cooperation between The Netherlands and Tunisia was crucial for the continuity of IAAS in the first years. When the Dutch cancelled their seminar, they asked all participants to come to the seminar in Tunis instead. This seminar {{turned out to be the}} founding World Congress of IAAS and Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and of course Tunisia were the participating countries. A few other countries attended the congress as observers. Mr. Tahar Belkhodge (Tunisia) was elected as President and Mr. Fehr (France) was elected as Secretary General.|$|R

In June 2009, Lewis confirmed that she was over halfway through the recording process for Echo in an interview with Digital Spy, and that she and Timberlake had collaborated on several tracks together.

500|$|Before filming took place, David-Lloyd {{met with}} Caroline Chikezie and <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other to help give their {{respective}} characters their chemistry. The episode was filmed {{as part of}} the third production block of the first series, along with eighth episode [...] "They Keep Killing Suzie". Director James Strong wanted to film the episode in a sort of real time format. Filming largely took place at the Upper Boat Studios outside Pontypridd, where the Torchwood Hub set is located. The scene where Jack threatens to kill Ianto if he does not kill Lisa was the first scene to be shot. The flashback scene where Ianto finds a half-converted Lisa in Canary Wharf took a full day to film; it was originally supposed to take only a few hours, but the camera failed to record the scene. It was replaced, but the second camera failed to record also. Eve Myles and Burn Gorman were both trained how to handle guns and a torch like a [...] "secret agent." [...] Strong noted that they both held the gun and torch in each hand like professionals.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{stop-start}} {{sessions for}} The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, where Kiedis would frequently disappear to seek drugs, pre-production for Mother's Milk went smoothly.

[...] The band recorded basic tracks at Hully Gully studios in Silver Lake; songs like [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] were formed from jam sessions without any input from returning producer Michael Beinhorn. According to Flea, the Hully Gully sessions bore fruit: [...] "We played hard and fast more than [...] any other time in our career, I think. A lot of chops were going down [...] we played constantly, <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other, {{and came up with a}} record." [...] Kiedis and Flea recognized that Frusciante's presence had become a significant influence on the band's new material as the Hully Gully sessions were proving to be extremely productive; Flea recalled that [...] " [...] was an immense new element to the sound of our band and a big opening up for us." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} social contexts on similarity in personal relationships. We argue {{that the effect of}} social contexts is larger for weaker, and smaller for stronger relationships. Using data from The Survey of the Social Networks of the Dutch (collected in 1999 / 2000, n = 1007), we first describe where people <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> their acquaintances, friends and partner and that similarity in these relationships with regard to age, level of education, sex, and religion, generally varies. We then inquire whether getting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>each</b> other in a certain context affects similarity, and whether this effect is different for relationships of different strength. Our main conclusion, however, is that the effect of social contexts on similarity is remarkably consistent across partnerships, friendships, and acquaintanceships. ...|$|R
