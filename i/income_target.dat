50|$|Market monetarists {{are skeptical}} of {{traditional}} monetarism's use of monetary aggregates as policy variables and {{prefer to use}} forward-looking markets. They advocate a nominal <b>income</b> <b>target</b> as a monetary policy rule because it simultaneously addresses prices and growth.|$|E
50|$|Market monetarists {{maintain}} a nominal <b>income</b> <b>target</b> is the optimal monetary policy. Market monetarists are skeptical that interest rates or monetary aggregates are good indicators for monetary policy and hence look to markets to indicate demand for money. Echoing Milton Friedman, {{in the market}} monetarist view, low interest rates are indicators of past monetary tightness not current easing, and as such, are not an indicator of current monetary policy. Regarding monetary aggregates, they believe velocity is too volatile for a simple growth in base money to adequately accommodate market demand for money. In contrast, a nominal <b>income</b> <b>target</b> accommodates fluctuations in velocity by ensuring monetary policy is loose or tight enough in order to hit the target. This approach leaves interest rates {{to be decided by}} the market, while addressing inflation concerns as nominal GDP is also not allowed to grow faster than the level specified.|$|E
50|$|Few {{academic}} publications analyze nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting,</b> {{although it}} has been shown that similar monetary policy performs better than real <b>income</b> <b>targeting</b> during a crisis.|$|R
5000|$|Australian {{economist}} John Quiggin supports nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting,</b> on {{the basis}} that [...] "A system of nominal GDP targeting would maintain or enhance the transparency associated with a system based on stated targets, while restoring the balance missing from a monetary policy based solely on the goal of price stability." [...] Supporters of nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting</b> often self-identify as market monetarists, although market monetarism encompasses more than nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper compares nominal <b>income</b> and {{monetary}} <b>targets</b> {{in a standard}} aggregate demand - aggregate supply framework. If the desirability of policies is measured by their effect on the unconditional variance of output, nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting</b> is preferable {{if and only if}} the aggregate elasticity of demand for real balances is greater than one. This is precisely the opposite of the condition that in Bean (1984) is sufficient to make nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting</b> preferable. This points out the importance of specification of supply and of objective function in work on nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "market monetarism" [...] {{was coined}} by Danish {{economist}} Lars Christensen in August 2011, and was quickly adopted by prominent economists who advocated a nominal <b>income</b> <b>target</b> for monetary policy. Scott Sumner, a Bentley University economist {{and one of}} the most vocal advocates of a nominal <b>income</b> <b>target,</b> adopted the label of market monetarist in September 2011. Sumner has been described as the [...] "eminence grise" [...] of market monetarism. In addition to Scott Sumner, Lars Christensen attributes economists Nick Rowe, David Beckworth, Joshua Hendrickson, BillWoolsey and Robert Hetzel to be [...] "instrumental in forming the views of Market Monetarism". Yue Chim Richard Wong, professor of economics at the University of Hong Kong, describes market monetarist economists as [...] "relatively junior in the economics profession and ... concentrated in the teaching universities." [...] The Economist states that Sumner's blog [...] "drew together like-minded economists, many of them at small schools some distance from the centre of the economic universe"; consequently, Christensen considers market monetarism to be the first economic school of thought born in the blogosphere.|$|E
5000|$|Supporters of {{a nominal}} <b>income</b> <b>target</b> criticize the {{propensity}} of inflation targeting to neglect output shocks by focusing {{solely on the}} price level. Adherents of market monetarism, led by Scott Sumner, argue that in the United States, the Federal Reserve's mandate is to stabilize both output and the price level, and that consequently a nominal <b>income</b> <b>target</b> would better suit the Fed's mandate. Australian economist John Quiggin, who also endorses nominal income targeting, stated that it [...] "would maintain or enhance the transparency associated with a system based on stated targets, while restoring the balance missing from a monetary policy {{based solely on the}} goal of price stability". Quiggin blamed the late-2000s recession on inflation targeting in an economic environment in which low inflation is a [...] "drag on growth". In reality, however, it is not true that inflation targeters focus solely on the rate of inflation and disregard economic growth: instead they tend to conduct [...] "flexible inflation targeting" [...] where the central bank strives to keep inflation near the target except time periods when such an effort would imply too much output volatility.|$|E
50|$|In April 2011, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand {{responded to}} Sumner's {{critique}} of inflation targeting, arguing that a nominal GDP target {{would be too}} technically complicated, and make monetary policy difficult to communicate. By November 2011, however, economists from Goldman Sachs were advocating that the Federal Reserve adopt a nominal <b>income</b> <b>target.</b> Nathan Sheets, a former top official at the Federal Reserve {{and the head of}} international economics at Citigroup, proposed that the Federal Reserve adopt a nominal consumption target instead.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{incorporates}} {{both the}} traditional aggregate demand-interest rate channel {{and the cost}} channel of monetary policy in a baseline ‘new Keynesian’ model and study two targeting regimes [...] - price-level <b>targeting</b> and nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting.</b> In light of empirical considerations, alternative specifications for the aggregate demand and aggregate supply side of the economy also considered. The main {{result is that the}} cost channel matters: in case of a moderate policy response and with the cost channel operating the volatility of real output decreases under both price-level and nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting,</b> while it increases in case of an aggressive policy response. The paper also finds that nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting</b> performs better than price level targeting in bringing down the volatility of real output in almost all the specifications of the macro models used in the analysis. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{conference in}} honor of the Barnett {{critique}} {{will be held at the}} Bank of England in London on May 23-24, 2017. The Barnett critique was a primary motivation for the creation of the international Society for Economic Measurement. While controversial as potential targets of monetary policy, the Divisia monetary aggregates have been the subject of increasing research on monthly indicators of the state of the economy, as emphasized by the Center for Financial Stability. An example of the potential indicator role is its relevancy to nominal <b>income</b> <b>target</b> proposals, since nominal GDP is measured only quarterly.|$|E
50|$|A nominal <b>income</b> <b>target</b> is a {{monetary}} policy target. Such targets are adopted by central banks to manage national economic activity. Nominal aggregates are not adjusted for inflation. Nominal income aggregates {{that can serve}} as targets include nominal gross domestic product (NGDP) and nominal gross domestic income (GDI). Central banks {{use a variety of}} techniques to hit their targets, including conventional tools such as interest rate targeting or open market operations, unconventional tools such as quantitative easing or interest rates on excess reserves and expectations management to hit its target. The concept of NGDP targeting was originally proposed by James Meade (1978) and James Tobin (1980).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, Sumner began authoring a blog where he vocally criticized the view that the United States economy was stuck in a liquidity trap. Sumner advocates that central banks such as the Federal Reserve create a futures market for the level of nominal gross domestic product (NGDP, also known as nominal income), and adjust monetary policy to achieve a nominal <b>income</b> <b>target</b> on the basis of information from the market. Monetary authorities generally choose to target other metrics, such as inflation, unemployment, the money supply or hybrids of these and rely on information from the financial markets, indices of unemployment or inflation, etc. to make monetary policy.|$|E
40|$|Traditional labour {{economics}} {{predicts that the}} supply of labour will increase as earnings increase. However, labour supply need not be positive, especially if workers {{make decisions based on}} short-term <b>income</b> <b>targets.</b> <b>Income</b> <b>targeting</b> may best describe jobs where workers decide on working hours and where wages are uncorrelated across days. This paper examines the labour supply of sex workers in Cape Town, whose working conditions largely fulfill these criteria.

50|$|Related {{to money}} <b>targeting,</b> nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting</b> (also called Nominal GDP or NGDP targeting) {{originally}} proposed by James Meade (1978) and James Tobin (1980) was advocated by Scott Sumner and {{reinforced by the}} market monetarist school of thought.|$|R
5000|$|Market monetarists {{contend that}} by not paying {{attention}} to nominal income, the Federal Reserve has actually destabilized the US economy; nominal GDP fell 11% below trend during the 2008 recession, and has remained there since. Market monetarists believe that by explicitly following a nominal <b>income</b> <b>target,</b> monetary policy would be extremely effective in addressing aggregate demand shocks; summarizing this view, The Economist stated: [...] "If people expect the central bank to return spending to a 5% growth path, their beliefs will help get it there. Firms will hire, confident that their revenues will expand; people will open their wallets, confident of keeping their jobs. Those hoarding cash will spend it or invest it, because they know that either output or prices will be higher in the future." ...|$|E
5000|$|Market monetarism is {{a school}} of {{macroeconomic}} thought that advocates that central banks target the level of nominal income instead of inflation, unemployment, or other measures of economic activity, including in times of shocks such as the bursting {{of the real estate}} bubble in 2006, and in the financial crisis that followed. In contrast to traditional monetarists, market monetarists do not believe monetary aggregates or commodity prices such as gold are the optimal guide to intervention. Market monetarists also reject the New Keynesian focus on interest rates as the primary instrument of monetary policy. Market monetarists prefer a nominal <b>income</b> <b>target</b> due to their twin beliefs that rational expectations are crucial to policy, and that markets react instantly to changes in their expectations about future policy, without the [...] "long and variable lags" [...] postulated by Milton Friedman.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{flexible}} inflation <b>targeting</b> and nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting</b> as two different monetary strategies {{in a simple}} dynamic macromodel. Furthermore we analyze inflation targeting in a two-period time-lag version of the model. The key results of our paper are: First, for both targeting regimes optimal monetary policy response leads to a shock-dependent feedback rule. Second, a demand shock is completely offset by both monetary strategies. Third, {{in case of a}} supply shock there is {{a significant difference between the}} two different targeting regimes. Under inflation targeting the policy makers face a trade-off between inflation and output stabilization. This trade-off depends on the weight F the policy makers attached to output stabilization relative to inflation stabilization in the loss function. In contrast, under nominal <b>income</b> <b>targeting</b> policy makers face a constant trade-off between inflation and real output growth: An increase in inflation leads to a fall in real output growth by an equal amount. Finally we analyze inflation targeting in a two-period time-lag version of the model. The qualitative results about the trade-off between inflation and output growth remain the same as in the basic model without time lag.

40|$|In a much {{talked about}} paper, Camerer, Babcock, Lowenstein and Thaler (1997), (hereafter CBLT) outline some {{potentially}} cautionary {{news about the}} intertemporal labour supply hypothesis. The basis of their paper is that cab drivers will face day to day variation in their wage rates due {{to a variety of}} factors (weather, subway breakdowns etc) which will affect demand, but that this variation is transitory. Their main conclusion is that there is some possibility that New York cabdrivers, who are the subject of their paper, might make their decisions one day at a time, using a daily <b>income</b> <b>target.</b> Chou (2002) in another paper looking at taxi divers in Singapore arrives at very similar conclusions. CBLT do take pains to point out that their result should be treated with some caution. However target income behaviour, of course, generates predictions which are counter to the intertemporal labour supply hypothesis, as on high wage days the cabdrivers will hit the <b>income</b> <b>target</b> earlier and work fewer hours. This short note looks at some of the CBLT data again and suggests that certain conclusions of the original article may be modified, particularly with respect to the effect of level of experience of the cabdriver, as the title suggests...|$|E
