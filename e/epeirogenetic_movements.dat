40|$|The {{age of the}} non-metamorphic {{sedimentary}} {{series in}} the Cantabrian mountains ranges from the Cambrian through the Tertiary. The Lower Palaeozoic deposits mainly show a sandy or quartzitic facies, and were deposited in an extensive Cambro-Ordovician geosyncline of which only the miogeosynclinal part is accessible for investigation, the orthogeosynclinal part now being covered by the Mesozoic-Tertiary deposits of the Spanish Meseta. The Caledonian orogeny is expressed in phenomena resulting from igneous activity. The Hercynian orogeny started with <b>epeirogenetic</b> <b>movements</b> during the Upper Devonian (Bretonic phase of Stille). The uplift caused a varying hiatus on which Upper Famennian transgressive sediments are found unconformably overlying anything between the Lower Famennian and the Middle Cambrian. The E-W-trending León line {{played an important role}} during these <b>epeirogenetic</b> <b>movements.</b> In the Asturides north of it, a Central Asturian dome shows an almost constant amount of uplift. Over a very wide area the Upper Famennian rests unconformably on the Lower Ordovician quartzite. Two main stratigraphic and tectonic units are distinguished: 1. The Isidro-Tarna-Ponton subarea. 2. The Mampodre-Fontasguera-Ten subarea. The Upper Famennian transgression was followed by the sedimentation of a uniform limestone during the Visean and Namurian. In the Central Asturian dome region a period of non-deposition or slow sedimentation set in after the sedimentation of the Namurian limestone. Locally, even this limestone was deposited under such conditions. South of the León line, the sedimentation continued with a thick series of mainly clastic deposits (San Emiliano Formation). During the Upper Namurian-Lower Westphalian, tectonic forces (Sudetic phase of Stille) caused nappe and overthrust structures south of the León line, whereas the areas north of this line, the Central Asturian dome region included, acted as a marginal trough to this orogene. The Asturian folding phase started in the Upper Westphalian, during which the Carboniferous basins north of the León line became folded. In the Central Asturian dome region, for example, SW-NE-moving thrust sheets developed, and were refolded in a predominantly E-W direction. Stephanian intramontanous coal basins are found in the present area along the León line. These basins were folded in an E-W direction at some time between the Triassic and Upper Stephanian (Saalic phase of Stille). Features indicative of a Würm glaciation are frequently found in the area under consideration...|$|E
40|$|The Upper Devonian {{shelf of}} the studied area {{was divided into}} two {{platforms}} separated by a significant break in the slope, related to the deep-seated fault system of the Sabero-Gordón Line. As differentiated block movements influenced the depositional history of the area, an External Zone, an Intermediate Zone and an Internal Zone can be distinguished. Each zone runs parallel to the east-west striking Upper Devonian coast and has a characteristic sedimentary succession. Due to upheaval, tilting and erosion of the area north of the Sabero-Gordón Line and intermitted subsidence south of this line, related to progradation of the linear shoreline from north to south, three regressive coarsening upward sequences were deposited in the External Zone. The first sequence is capped by a calcareous transgressive unit of minor importance. Based on these sequences the Nocedo Formation {{is divided into three}} members. The Gordon Member and the Millar Member are newly introduced in this paper. The Fueyo Member was already officially introduced by Evers (1967). After deposition of the three cycles <b>epeirogenetic</b> <b>movements</b> decreased and a levelling stage occurred in which coastal sands spread out over the whole area forming the transgressive upper part of the Ermita Formation...|$|E
40|$|Late Sandbian {{to early}} Katian δ 13 Ccarb chemostratigraphy has in Norway been {{described}} in only two previous reports that dealt with two geographically rather widely separated areas, namely the Oslo-Asker district and the Nes-Hamar district. No data have been available from the Ordovician outcrop areas between these districts that could help clarify the partly unclear regional stratigraphic relations across the Oslo region. A chemostratigraphic study of the classical road section at Tønnerud in the northwestern Hadeland district about halfway between the previously investigated districts resulted in the recognition of two δ 13 C excursions, namely one in the uppermost Furuberget Formation tentatively identified as the Guttenberg Isotopic Carbon Excursion {{and one in the}} lower Solvang Formation that is classified as the KOPE (RAKVERE) excursion. Based on these results, the Furuberget and Solvang formations are interpreted to be separated by a significant gap in the study area corresponding to the Oandu and lower Rakvere regional Baltoscandic stages. This suggests that the Tønnerud succession is less complete stratigraphically than those in the Oslo-Asker district. Similar gaps are not uncommon in this interval in Baltoscandia and in North America and probably reflect both eustatic and local <b>epeirogenetic</b> <b>movements</b> that make it difficult to establish a regionally applicable sequence stratigraphy...|$|E
40|$|Many pebbles of igneous rocks, both {{plutonic}} and effusive, and of {{sedimentary rocks}} {{were collected from}} a submarine ridge known as the Yamato Bank in the Japan Sea. They are round or subangular with well polished surface, and vary in size from sand-grade to gravel over 50 cm. in diameter. If these pebbles had been found only in a limitted area lying 011 the track of steamships, their presence might be attributed to ballast thrown overboard from passing vessels. But {{the distribution of the}} pebbles is evidence of its improbability. Neither is it likely that ocean currents transport pebbles of this size so far from the present shores. On the other hand, there can be no wearing down of the surface of hard rocks on the sea-floor with a depth of 500 - 600 in. The only alternative is that the sea-floor that yielded these pebbles was at one time either a land-surface or a shallow sea near the shore, when they were formed by erosive action of the water flowing over their respective parent rock-masses, t'le shores submerging later to their present depths. All the pebbles described in this paper have the general petrographic characters common to their respective rock-types now exposed in the Japanese Islands. Hence it is inferred that the pebbles are derived from land which is now below the sea and which is geologically connected with the Japanese Islands, or that it was transported from some part of the present Japanese Islands before its submergence to where they lie on the sea-floor at present. The granite pebbles does riot show characteristics that could be correlated with any Japanese granite whose geological age has been established; while the andesite arid basalt pebbles have characteristics common to the late-Tertiary and Quaternary volcariics in the Japanese Islands. It is therefore highly probable that the sea-floor where these pebbles exist was a land-surface or a very shallow sea near the shore during the post-Neogene. If the latest land-submergence had occurred in a very remote geological past, the pebbles could riot have remained for long, geologically speaking, in the condition in which they are found at present without the aid of some auxiliary agent such as earthquake disturbances at the sea-bottom, since a sea-floor with a depth of 500 -average along its outer margin, and the lower one, which is far less incomplete in form than the other, extends down to 720 m. These two are regarded by him as the prolongations respectively of the T arid PN terraces on the present land-surface of the Japanese Islands. Thus, the present discovery of the pebbles and the inferences drawn from a petrographic study made of them may be strong evidences in support of Dr. Yabe's views concerning the <b>epeirogenetic</b> or eustatic <b>movement</b> of the Japanese Islands in recent geologic times, regardless of the cause, the magnitude, or the mechanism of the movement. Further studies of these pebbles may supply data that will afford more weighty evidence in favor of some particular age-span for the latest land-stage of the seas now bordering the present Japanese Islands. In conclusion the writer desires to express his sincere thanks to Lieutenant-Commander Asahina, who supplied him with a piece of the granite pebble, and also to Mr jSTiirio, through whose kindness the writer obtained many pebbles from the collection of the Imperial Fisheries Experimental Station of Tokyo...|$|R
40|$|The Devonian and Carboniferous rock-sequence in the Cantabrian Mountains is {{developed}} {{in two different}} facies which are separated by an E-W tectonic line, the León Line, and called the Leonide and Palentian facies, respectively to the S and N. The Leonide facies is widely exposed throughout the Cantabrian Mountains and its tectonic history is now well known. The most complete sequence of the Palentian facies occurs in the present area, which lies across {{the boundaries of the}} provinces of Palcncia, León and Santander. Towards the west and north the Devonian and Lower Carboniferous gradually plunge below the younger strata. The Palentian facies in this region is only found north of a second fundamental tectonic feature, the SE-NW Cardaño Line. This line joins the León Line in the SE of the area near the village of Santibañez but can be traced far to the NW into the province of Oviedo. Immediately south of the Cardaño Line there is the Sicro basin filled with Upper Carboniferous elastics which even overlap in places the León Line further south. The pre-Westphalian rocks of the present area are limited to the north by the Peña Prieta Line, the fundamental nature of which is emphasised by a large granite intrusion. To the east the Polentinos fault separates the present area from the mainly Westphalian, Pisuerga basin. The fundamental lines are partly expressed at the surface as large fault systems. It is remarkable that in the Palentian facies sedimentation was not interrupted by the major erosional periods known from the Leonide facies. The post-Silurian and pre-Westphalian sequence of the Palentian facies is on average about 850 m thick and consists mainly of shales with thin limestone intervals. The corresponding sequence of the Leonide facies is on average about 1750 m thick and shows important, thick Devonian reef limestone intervals. Only the lower and uppermost of the Devonian contain clearly higher-energy deposits (sandstone sequences). Both the lithology and fossil association confirm that the Palentian facies sequences developed in a more offshore (middle to outer neritic) environment of deposition than indicated for the Leonide facies (littoral to inner neritic), Important <b>epeirogenetic</b> <b>movements</b> in the late Namurian and in the Westphalian disturbed the preceding long period of quiet sedimentation. Between the Cardaño Line to the south, the Peña Prieta Line to the north and the Polentinos fault to the east the Cardaño block was subjected to a regional tilting during the deposition of the rocks of the Yuso Group. The maximum uplift and erosion are indicated in the N and E whereas the deepest subsidence and maximum deposition have been detected in the S and W of the Cardaño block. The pre-Westphalian rocks, where unconformably overlain by those of the Yuso Group, show local, gentle, pre- or synsedimentary folded structures. The present study has not revealed pre-Westphalian structures that would justify {{the use of the term}} orogenic phase (i. e. Sudetic) for their origin. They are rather interpreted as the results of local compression accompanying pre- and synsedimentary <b>epeirogenetic</b> <b>movements.</b> The unconformable Yuso Group consists of a conglomerate facies — the Curavacas Formation — up to about 700 m thick and a sandstone-shale facies — the Lechada Formation — of at least 750 m N of Cardaño de Arriba (probably up to 2000 m to the W). The Westphalian rocks were deformed during the main compressive phase, which therefore is thought to correspond with the Asturian folding phase (pre-Stephanian). The tectonic transport here was from north to south in contrast to the Leonides where it was from south to north. This correlates with the theory that the folding of the two areas took place at different times; Asturian in the Asturides (Palentian facies) and Sudetic in the Leonides. The inhomogeneity of the Palentian facies rock sequence is reflected in the very complicated final tectonic picture. The Cardaño Area can be subdivided into 4 subareas (Northern, Central, Southern and Arauz), in each of which a different lithofacies is related with a corresponding minor tectofacies. Simultaneous cross folding can be related to the rapid facies changes in the affected rocks. The present area gives very instructive examples of the close interaction of tectonics and sedimentation. <b>Epeirogenetic</b> <b>movements</b> between fundamental tectonic lines controlled the deposition of the sedimentary sequence. These heterogeneous rocks were then acted upon by a relatively short compressive tectonic phase which created out of them the present architecture of the Cardaño Area...|$|E
40|$|Three {{members are}} informally {{distinguished}} in this formation (A, B, and C from base to top). They are {{present at the}} western part of the outcrop (thickness ca. 246 m). On the eastern and southeastern part, only member A and basal part of member B are present and the thickness is reduced to ca. 20 m. A sharp surface of discontinuity separates member A from member B. The Portilla Formation abounds in reef-building elements associated with other groups. Five major carbonate facies types are established that belong to a complex biostromal ‘reef’ facies. Vertical and lateral facies changes are demonstrated. The carbonate facies was deposited in a shallow-marine environment. Towards end of deposition of member A, sharp changes in depositional conditions occurred, soon followed by a notable influx of siliciclastics. A distinctive barrier ‘reef’ pattern was established during deposition of member B. It protected a back-reef area from the open shallow sea. This back-reef environment was separated from an area of dominantly siliciclastic deposition in the southeast by an extremely shallow marine or shoal area which might have been emergent. During deposition of member B there occurred a rhythmic alternation of the back-reef carbonates and the carbonates continuous with the ‘reef’ barrier, probably reflecting minor changes in sea level likely due to <b>epeirogenetic</b> <b>movements</b> of the bottom. Eventually organic growth and associated carbonate sedimentation exceeded the rate of subsidence and as a result the ‘reefs’ laterally shifted seawards, followed by the back-reef facies. The facies pattern suggests an increasingly emergent tendency of the marginal part of the carbonate basin due to bottom movements. The barrier ‘reef’ pattern of member B probably terminated due to changes in relative subsidence during deposition of member C. A strong supply of siliciclastics during the deposition of the Nocedo Formation brought an end to the carbonate sedimentation of the Portilla Formation. The variation in thickness in the Portilla Formation has been mainly due to a slow and prolonged differential subsidence of the carbonate depositional basin. The absence of a large part of member B and member C in the easterly and southeasterly directions is probably largely due to non-deposition of sediments. Seventeen species are described of rhynchonellid brachiopods, out of which four species are new. Three new genera are established. Wherever available some critical German rhynchonellid species have been sectioned for comparison. The rhynchonellid and atrypid brachiopod fauna from the Portilla Formation show a great affinity with the Middle Devonian fauna of Eifel region, Germany. The Spanish fauna could be assigned to the mixed or Eifel facies, or close to this type. Striking similarity exists also between the Spanish fauna and the Middle Devonian fauna from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland. The rhynchonellids and atrypids strongly suggest that the Eifelian — Givetian boundary lies in the basal part of member B. It is suggested that member A is of Eifelian age and that members B and C, apart from the basal part of member B are of Givetian age...|$|E
