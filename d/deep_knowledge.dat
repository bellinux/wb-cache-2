As a teenager, Charles served as a tour guide at the house and {{acquired}} a <b>deep</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Althorp. At the time he inherited the estate it was losing some £400,000 annually, and the staff of 14 had to be significantly reduced. Charles' older sister was Diana, Princess of Wales, who grew up with him at Althorp.|$|E

5|$|Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), {{the score}} for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and {{incidental}} music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916. Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's <b>deep</b> <b>knowledge</b> of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{arterial}} ultrasound study, {{when the}} sonographer studies venous insufficiency, the vein wall itself has no relevance and attention will {{be focused on}} the direction of blood flow. The objective of the examination is to see how the veins drain. In this way, venous ultrasonography has at times become a hemodynamic examination which is reserved for experienced sonographers who have completed hemodynamic studies and training and have acquired a <b>deep</b> <b>knowledge</b> of this subject.|$|E
5|$|Integrated {{education}} {{models are}} {{emerging in the}} academic world, a model which {{is referred to as}} T-shape and π-shaped education. T-shaped professionals are taught general knowledge in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, <b>deep</b> <b>knowledge</b> in a single domain (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from small T innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) to big T innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, lead user, etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.|$|E

50|$|The Ananda Valli is {{remarkable}} for its Kosha (Sanskrit: कोष) theory (or Layered Maya theory), expressing that man reaches his highest potential and understands the <b>deepest</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{by a process}} of learning the right and unlearning the wrong. Real <b>deeper</b> <b>knowledge</b> is hidden in layers of superficial knowledge, but superficial knowledge is easier and simplistic. The Ananda Valli classifies these as concentric layers (sheaths) of knowledge-seeking. The outermost layer it calls Annamaya which envelops and hides Pranamaya, which in turn envelops Manomaya, inside which is Vijnanamaya, and finally the Anandamaya which the Upanishad states is the innermost, deepest layer.|$|R
5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in London in 1817, {{the son of a}} musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to both a <b>deep</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the Bible and a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and six years later was proficient enough as an artist to earn a living as a portrait painter and cricket illustrator. Aged 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E

Also, task times can be predicted (given the limitations) without having to build a prototype, recruit and test users, which saves time and money. See the example for a practical use of the KLM as a system design tool.|$|E

25|$|Eden was {{notoriously}} “unclubbable” and offended Churchill by {{declining to}} join The Other Club. He also declined honorary {{membership in the}} Athenaeum. However, he maintained friendly relations with Opposition MPs; for example, George Thomas received a kind two-page letter from Eden on learning that his stepfather had died. Eden was a Trustee of the National Gallery (in succession to MacDonald) between 1935 and 1949. He also had a <b>deep</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Persian poetry and of Shakespeare and would bond with anybody who could display similar knowledge.|$|E

Arthur Bryant published his three-volume study in 1933–1938, {{long before the}} definitive edition of the diary, but, thanks to Bryant's lively style, it is still of interest. In 1974 Richard Ollard produced a new biography that drew on Latham's and Matthew's work on the text, benefitting from the author's <b>deep</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Restoration politics. Other biographies include: Samuel Pepys : a life, by Stephen Coote (London : Hodder & Stoughton, 2000) and, Samuel Pepys and his world, by Geoffrey Trease (London : Thames and Hudson, 1972).|$|E
25|$|In 1661 another Jesuit, Johann Grueber, crossed Tibet from Sining to Lhasa (where {{he spent}} a month), before heading on to Nepal.

Secondly, {{at the beginning of the}} third millennium, they face a test of their creativity when confronted by the new evangelisation. Thirdly, they cultivate a <b>deep</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Francis the prophet, an example from the past, leading them into the future.|$|E

The recording received a special mention award from the Cátedra de Flamencología, and was followed by Cantes antiguos del flamenco (1969), with guitarist Niño Ricardo. His first recordings were strictly orthodox and showed <b>deep</b> <b>knowledge</b> of traditional flamenco, a rare quality for singers of his generation. During this period he also {{made his first}} contact with guitarist Manolo Sanlúcar, with whom he would cooperate on several occasions. Sanlúcar accompanied him in his concert in Ateneo de Madrid, the first occasion in which a flamenco singer performed in that prestigious cultural institution.|$|E
