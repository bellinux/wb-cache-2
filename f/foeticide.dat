25|$|Estimates {{for female}} <b>foeticide</b> vary by scholar. One group {{estimates}} more than 10 million female foetuses {{may have been}} illegally aborted in India since 1990s, and 500,000 girls were being lost annually due to female <b>foeticide.</b> MacPherson estimates that 100,000 abortions every year continue to be performed in India solely because the fetus is female.|$|E
25|$|Female <b>foeticide</b> in India is the {{abortion}} {{of a female}} foetus outside of legal methods.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate as to whether these high sex ratios are only caused by female <b>foeticide</b> {{or some of the}} higher ratio is {{explained}} by natural causes. The Indian government has passed Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PCPNDT) in 1994 to ban and punish prenatal sex screening and female <b>foeticide.</b> It is currently illegal in India to determine or disclose sex of the foetus to anyone. However, there are concerns that PCPNDT Act has been poorly enforced by authorities.|$|E

50|$|Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994 is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted to stop female <b>foeticides</b> {{and arrest}} the declining sex ratio in India. The act banned {{prenatal}} sex determination.|$|R
50|$|Gender {{selection}} and selective abortion were banned in India under Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostics Technique Act in 1994. The practice continues illegally. Other institutional efforts, such as advertisements calling female <b>foeticides</b> a sin by the Health Ministry of India and annual Girl Child Day {{can be observed}} to raise status of girls and to combat female infanticide.|$|R

25|$|The {{frequency}} of female <b>foeticide</b> in India {{is assumed to}} be an estimation derived from its high birth sex ratio, that is the ratio of boys to girls at birth. The natural ratio {{is assumed to be}} between 103 and 107, and any number above it is considered as suggestive of female <b>foeticide.</b> According to the decennial Indian census, the sex ratio in the 0 to 6 age group in India has risen from 102.4 males per 100 females in 1961, to 104.2 in 1980, to 107.5 in 2001, to 108.9 in 2011.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{different}} linguistic, cultural and geographical environment, and its peculiar complications, the diverse tribal world of Madhya Pradesh has been largely {{cut off from the}} mainstream of development. Madhya Pradesh ranks very low on the Human Development Index value of 0.375 (2011), which is below the national average. According to the India State Hunger Index (2008) compiled by the International Food Policy Research Institute, the malnutrition situation in Madhya Pradesh was [...] "extremely alarming", receiving a severity rating between Ethiopia and Chad. The state ranks is also the worst performer in India, when it comes to female <b>foeticides.</b> The state's per-capita gross state domestic product (nominal GDP) is the fourth lowest in the country (2010-11). MP is also the lowest-ranked state on the India State Hunger Index.|$|R
25|$|India {{passed its}} first abortion-related law, the {{so-called}} Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971, making abortion legal in most states, but specified legally acceptable reasons for abortion such as medical risk to mother and rape. The law also established physicians who can legally provide the procedure and the facilities where abortions can be performed, {{but did not}} anticipate female <b>foeticide</b> based on technology advances. With increasing availability of sex screening technologies in India through the 1980s in urban India, and claims of its misuse, the Government of India passed the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PNDT) in 1994. This law was further amended into the Pre-Conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) (PCPNDT) Act in 2004 to deter and punish prenatal sex screening and female <b>foeticide.</b> However, there are concerns that PCPNDT Act has been poorly enforced by authorities.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{variation}} in birth sex ratios and implied female <b>foeticide</b> may be due to disparate access to resources. As MacPherson (2007) notes, there can be significant differences in gender violence and access to food, healthcare, immunizations between male and female children. This leads to high infant and childhood mortality among girls, which causes changes in sex ratio.|$|E

25|$|Infanticide in India, and {{elsewhere}} in the world, is a difficult issue to objectively access because reliable data is unavailable. Scrimshaw states that not only accurate frequency of female infanticide is unknown, differential care between male and female infants is even more elusive data. Reliable data for female infanticide is unavailable. Its frequency, and that of sex-selective abortion, is indirectly estimated from the observed high birth sex ratio; that is, the ratio of boys to girls at birth or 0–1 age group infants, or 0–6 age group child sex ratio. The natural ratio is assumed to be 106, or somewhere between 103 and 107, and any number above or below this range is considered as suggestive of female or male <b>foeticide</b> respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} Indian laws on female <b>foeticide</b> and its {{enforcement}} is unclear. United Nations Population Fund and India's National Human Rights Commission, in 2009, asked the Government of India {{to assess the}} impact of the law. The Public Health Foundation of India, an premier research organization in its 2010 report, claimed a lack of awareness about the Act in parts of India, inactive role of the Appropriate Authorities, ambiguity among some clinics that offer prenatal care services, and the role of a few medical practitioners in disregarding the law. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has targeted education and media advertisements to reach clinics and medical professionals to increase awareness. The Indian Medical Association has undertaken efforts to prevent prenatal sex selection by giving its members Beti Bachao (save the daughter) badges during its meetings and conferences. However, a recent study by Nandi and Deolalikar (2013) argues that the 1994 PNDT Act may have had a small impact by preventing 106,000 female foeticides over one decade.|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{supports}} various causes {{related to}} the girl child through her foundation [...] "The Priyanka Chopra Foundation for Health and Education", which works towards providing support to unprivileged children {{across the country in}} the areas of Education and Health. She donates ten percent of her earnings to fund the foundation’s operations, and pays for educational and medical expenses for seventy children in India, fifty among whom are girls. She often speaks out on women's issues: against female infanticide and <b>foeticide,</b> and in support of education for girls. A believer in feminism, Chopra has always been vocal about women's rights, gender equality, and gender pay inequality. In 2006, a [...] "day with Chopra" [...] was auctioned on eBay; the proceeds were donated to an NGO, Nanhi Kali, which helps educate girls in India. She has made appearances in support of other charities, such as the 2005 HELP! Telethon Concert to raise funds for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.|$|E
500|$|Family {{values are}} {{important}} in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other elders in the family. Marriage {{is thought to be}} for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low. , just 1.6 percent of Indian women were divorced but this figure was rising due to their education and economic independence. Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age. Female infanticide and female <b>foeticide</b> in the country have caused a discrepancy in the sex ratio, [...] it was estimated that there were 50 million more males than females in the nation. However a report from 2011 has shown improvement in the gender ratio. The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines. Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.|$|E

2500|$|One {{school of}} {{scholars}} suggest that female <b>foeticide</b> {{can be seen}} through history and cultural background. Generally, male babies were preferred because they provided manual labor and success the family lineage. The selective abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where cultural norms value male children over female children {{for a variety of}} social and economic reasons. A son is often preferred as an [...] "asset" [...] since he can earn and support the family; a daughter is a [...] "liability" [...] since she will be married off to another family, and so will not contribute financially to her parents. Female <b>foeticide</b> then, is a continuation in a different form, of a practice of female infanticide or withholding of postnatal health care for girls in certain households. Furthermore, in some cultures sons are expected {{to take care of their}} parents in their old age. These factors are complicated by the effect of diseases on child sex ratio, where communicable and noncommunicable diseases affect males and females differently.|$|E
2500|$|Female <b>foeticide</b> {{has been}} linked to the arrival, in the early 1990s, of {{affordable}} ultrasound technology and its widespread adoption in India. Obstetric ultrasonography, either transvaginally or transabdominally, checks for various markers of fetal sex. It can be performed at or after week 12 of pregnancy. At this point, [...] of fetal sexes can be correctly determined, according to a 2001 study. Accuracy for males is approximately 50% and for females almost 100%. When performed after week 13 of pregnancy, ultrasonography gives an accurate result in almost 100% of cases.|$|E
2500|$|Higher sex ratios than in India {{have been}} {{reported}} for the last 20 years in China, Pakistan, Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and some Southeast European countries, and attributed in part to female infanticide, among other factors. There is an ongoing debate as {{to the cause of}} high sex ratios in the 0–1 and 0–6 age groups in India. The suggested reasons for high birth sex ratio include regional female <b>foeticide</b> using amniocentesis regardless of income or poverty because of patrilineal culture, the under-reporting of female births, smaller family size and selective stopping of family size once a male is born, ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholarly}} publications on infanticide use {{the legal}} definition. Others, {{such as the}} collaboration of Renu Dube, Reena Dube and Rashmi Bhatnagar, who describe themselves as [...] "postcolonial feminists", adopt a broader scope for infanticide, applying it from <b>foeticide</b> through to femicide at an unspecified age. Barbara Miller, an anthropologist, has [...] "for convenience" [...] used the term to refer to all non-accidental deaths of children up {{to the age of}} around 15–16, which is culturally considered to be the age when childhood ends in rural India. She notes that the act of infanticide can be [...] "outright", such as a physical beating, or take a [...] "passive" [...] form through actions such as neglect and starvation. Neonaticide, being the killing of a child within 24 hours of birth, is sometimes considered as a separate study.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian {{census data}} {{suggests}} {{there is a}} positive correlation between abnormal sex ratio and better socio-economic status and literacy. This may be connected to the dowry system in India where dowry deaths occur when a girl is seen as a financial burden. Urban India has higher child sex ratio than rural India according to 1991, 2001 and 2011 Census data, implying higher prevalence of female <b>foeticide</b> in urban India. Similarly, child sex ratio greater than 115 boys per 100 girls is found in regions where the predominant majority is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian; furthermore [...] "normal" [...] child sex ratio of 104 to 106 boys per 100 girls are also found in regions where the predominant majority is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian. These data contradict any hypotheses that may suggest that sex selection is an archaic practice which takes place among uneducated, poor sections or particular religion of the Indian society.|$|E
