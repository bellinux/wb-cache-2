40|$|Ectoparasite size can be {{influenced}} by many factors; one is host size. Harrisonâ€™s rule states that larger hosts typically have larger parasites. In this study, <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (Insecta: Anoplura) were used to test this rule. <b>Sucking</b> <b>lice</b> should provide a good test for this rule because they are generally host-specific and because, as a group, they parasitize hosts of different sizes. Also, <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> use their tibio-tarsal claws to grasp host hairs, therefore, correlations between claw size and host hair diameters were also tested. Raw analyses including 206 species of slide-mounted <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> from throughout the world, followed by analyses of phylogenetically subtracted data, were {{used to test the}} hypotheses that <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> body size is correlated with host body size and that <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> claw size is correlated with host hair diameters. Data from 3 separate louse families, Hoplopleuridae, Linognathidae and Polyplacidae, were also analyzed.

40|$|Background: <b>Sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (suborder Anoplura, class Insecta) parasitize eutherian {{mammals and}} feed {{exclusively}} on blood. <b>Sucking</b> <b>lice</b> {{have one of}} the most complex mitochondrial genome structure seen in eukaryotes. While eukaryotes typically have a single, circular mitochondrial chromosome with all genes on it, the <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> investigated so far have their mitochondrial genes scattered over 9 to 20 mini-chromosomes. Most mini-chromosomes have only one gene or a few genes. Furthermore, the mitochondrial genome structure varies from species to species even in the same genus. Aims: This study aims to understand how the complex mitochondrial genomes of <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> evolved. Methods: We sequenced the mitochondrial genome of the guanaco louse, Microthoradus praelongiceps, and compared it with other <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> that infest humans, chimpanzees, pigs, horses and rats. Research findings: The mitochondrial genome of the guanaco louse has 37 genes on 12 mini-chromosomes. The guanaco louse resembles the rat lice much more than the human lice, chimpanzee lice, pig lice and horse lice in its mitochondrial genome structure. However, phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial genome sequences revealed that the guanaco louse is more closely related to the human lice, chimpanzee lice, pig lice and horse lice than to the rat lice. Thus, the common features in mitochondrial genome structure shared between the guanaco louse and the rat lice can be inferred to be ancestral to all <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> according to the principle of parsimony. By comparison to the ancestral features of <b>sucking</b> <b>lice,</b> it is clear that at least 4 mini-chromosomes have split in the lice of humans and chimpanzees, whereas at least 6 mini-chromosomes have merged in the lice of pigs and horses. We conclude that both split and merge of mini-chromosomes played major roles in shaping the complex mitochondrial genomes of the <b>sucking</b> <b>lice...</b>|$|R

In this study, we use molecular data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of 65 <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> taxa with phylogenetic analyses and compare the results to findings based on morphological data. We also estimate divergence times among anopluran taxa and compare our results to host (mammal) relationships. Results This study represents the first phylogenetic hypothesis of <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> relationships using molecular data and we find significant conflict between phylogenies constructed using molecular and morphological data. We also find that multiple families and genera of <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> are not monophyletic and that extensive taxonomic revision will be necessary for this group. Based on our divergence dating analyses, <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> diversified in the late Cretaceous, approximately 77 Ma, and soon after the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (ca. 65 Ma) these lice proliferated rapidly to parasitize multiple mammalian orders and families. Conclusions The diversification time of <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> approximately 77 Ma is in agreement with mammalian evolutionary history: all modern mammal orders are hypothesized to have diverged by 75 Ma thus providing suitable habitat for the colonization and radiation of <b>sucking</b> <b>lice.</b> Despite the concordant timing of diversification events early in the association between anoplurans and mammals, there is substantial conflict between the host and parasite phylogenies. This conflict is likely the result of a complex history of host switching and extinction events that occurred throughout the evolutionary association between <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> and their mammalian hosts. It is unlikely that there are any ectoparasite groups (including lice) that tracked the early and rapid radiation of eutherian mammals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fragmented {{mitochondrial}} (mt) genomes {{have been}} reported for 11 species/subspecies of <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (suborder Anoplura) that infest humans, chimpanzees, pigs, horses and rodents. There is substantial variation among these lice in mt karyotype: the number of minichromosomes of a species/subspecies ranges from 9 to 20; the number of genes in a minichromosome ranges from 1 to 8; arrangement of genes in a minichromosome differs between species, even in the same genus. We sequenced the mt genome of the guanaco louse, Microthoracius praelongiceps, which is from a major branch of <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> not sampled previously. We aim to establish the ancestral mt karyotype for <b>sucking</b> <b>lice,</b> and to understand how mt genome organization evolved in <b>sucking</b> <b>lice.</b> The 37 mt genes of the guanaco louse are on 12 minichromosomes; each minichromosome is 2, 274 to 2, 940 bp in size, and has 2 to 5 genes and a non-coding region. The guanaco louse shares many features with the rodent lice in mt karyotype, more than with other <b>sucking</b> <b>lice.</b> Phylogenetic analysis of mt genome sequences, however, showed that the guanaco louse is {{more closely related to}} the human lice, chimpanzee lice, pig lice and horse lice than to the rodent lice. By analysis of shared features in mt karyotype, we infer that the most recent common ancestor of <b>sucking</b> <b>lice,</b> which lived ~ 75 MYA, had 11 minichromosomes; each minichromosome has 1 to 6 genes and a non-coding region. As <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> diverged, split of mt minichromosomes occurred many times in the lineages leading to the lice of humans, chimpanzees and rodents whereas merge of minichromosomes occurred in the lineage leading to the lice of pigs and horses, resulting in a complex and dynamic mt genome organization not seen in any other animal...|$|R

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} (mt) genomes {{of animals}} typically {{consist of a}} single circular chromosome that is âˆ¼ 16 -kb long and has 37 genes. Our analyses of the sequence reads from the Human Body Louse Genome Project and the patterns of gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization revealed a novel type of mt genome in the <b>sucking</b> <b>louse,</b> Pediculus humanus. Instead of having all mt genes on a single chromosome, the 37 mt genes of this louse are on 18 minicircular chromosomes. Each minicircular chromosome is 3 â€“ 4 kb long and has one to three genes. Minicircular mt chromosomes are also present in the four other species of <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> that we investigated, but not in chewing lice nor in the Psocoptera, to which <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> are most closely related. We also report unequivocal evidence for recombination between minicircular mt chromosomes in P. humanus and for sequence variation in mt genes generated by recombination. The advantages of a fragmented mt genome, if any, are currently unknown.

40|$|Parasitic lice (order Phthiraptera) infest {{birds and}} mammals. The typical animal {{mitochondrial}} (mt) genome organization, {{which consists of}} a single chromosome with 37 genes, was found in chewing lice in the suborders Amblycera and Ischnocera. The <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (suborder Anoplura) known, however, have fragmented mt genomes with 9 â€“ 20 minichromosomes. We sequenced the mt genome of the elephant louse, Haematomyzus elephantis â€“ the first species of chewing lice investigated from the suborder Rhynchophthirina. We identified 33 [*]mt genes in the elephant louse, which were on 10 minichromosomes. Each minichromosome is 3. 5 â€“ 4. 2 [*]kb in size and has 2 â€“ 6 genes. Phylogenetic analyses of mt genome sequences confirm that the elephant louse is {{more closely related to}} <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> than to the chewing lice in the Amblycera and Ischnocera.

Nine of the 10 [*]mt minichromosomes of the elephant louse differ from those of the <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (Anoplura) known in gene content and gene arrangement, indicating that distinct mt karyotypes have evolved in Anoplura and Rhynchophthirina since they diverged ~ 92 [*]million years ago...|$|R
40|$|Phylogenetic trees {{can reveal}} {{the origins of}} endosymbiotic {{lineages}} of bacteria and detect patterns of co-evolution with their hosts.

Here we examined how different sampling strategies of Gammaproteobacteria sequences affect {{estimates of the number}} of endosymbiont lineages in parasitic <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (Insecta: Phthirapatera: Anoplura). We estimated the number of louse endosymbiont lineages using both newly obtained and previously sequenced 16 S rDNA bacterial sequences and more than 42, 000 16 S rDNA sequences from other Gammaproteobacteria. We also performed parametric and nonparametric bootstrapping experiments to examine the effects of phylogenetic error and uncertainty on these estimates. Sampling of 16 S rDNA sequences affects the estimates of endosymbiont diversity in <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> until we reach a threshold of genetic diversity, the size of which depends on the sampling strategy. Sampling by maximizing the diversity of 16 S rDNA sequences is more efficient than randomly sampling available 16 S rDNA sequences.

50|$|The {{body of a}} louse is dorsoventrally {{flattened}} and {{the eyes}} are absent or nearly so. The legs are strong for holding onto fur or feathers of the host. Amblycera have chewing mouthparts, and Anoplura have true sucking mouthparts with stylets. Chewing lice feed on feathers, hair and skin surface detritus, whereas <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> feed exclusively on blood. Most species of lice are host specific, with the <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> being more host specific than chewing lice. There is strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution in some groups. Because lice are wingless, transfer between hosts usually involves direct contact during mating, brooding and nursing of young, sharing of communal nest sites or even during predator-prey interactions. Lice have the fewest number of life stages of any insect (egg, 3 larval instars, and adult).|$|R

40|$|Extract] <b>Sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (Alloplurn) are ectoparasites of mammals. The highly {{specialised}} blood-sucking insects {{complete their}} entire life cycle on the host. As mammalian blood differs widely among species {{in terms of}} suitability for louse nutrition, lice are usually host-specific. A paradigmatic example is the head louse Pediculus capitis, with humans as the only hosts...|$|R
50|$|These {{insects are}} {{very much like the}} {{familiar}} advanced <b>sucking</b> <b>lice,</b> except they do not stay on their host permanently. They roam freely over the surface of their host and, unlike other lice, do not form permanent attachments. They feed by chewing soft areas of skin, causing an area of localized bleeding from which they drink.|$|R
50|$|Earlier all chewing lice were {{considered}} to form the paraphyletic order Mallophaga while the <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> were thought to form the order Anoplura. Recent reclassification (Clay, 1970) has combined these orders into the order Phthiraptera. The bird lice belong to two suborders, Amblycera and Ischnocera, although some members of these suborders do not parasitize birds and are therefore not bird lice.|$|R
50|$|Dogs, cats, foxes, and coyotes {{are some}} of the predators of the species. The eastern mole harbors many parasites.

50|$|Phthiraptera, the lice, {{includes}} 5,000 described species {{divided into}} 4 suborders. The Amblycera {{is the most}} basal group and parasitize birds and mammals.
