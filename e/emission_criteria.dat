The critical stress intensity factor for dislocation emission increases with the increasing size of dislocation-free zone and the number of piled-up dislocations in the plastic zone, but decreases with increasing grain size. The ductile versus brittle behavior of material was determined by the competition of critical stress intensity factors for dislocation emission and crack propagation. A material with larger grain size is easier to emit dislocation and allows more dislocations to be piled up, so that it behaves more ductile...|$|R

40|$|Ultra-precision {{machining}} causes {{materials to}} undergo a greatly strained deformation process {{in a short period}} of time. The effect of shear strain rates on machining quality, in particular on surface anisotropy, is a topic deserving of research that has thus far been overlooked. This study analyzes the impact of the strain rate during the ultra-precision turning of single-crystal silicon on the anisotropy of surface roughness. Focusing on the establishment of cutting models considering the tool rake angle and the edge radius, this is the first research that takes into account the strain rate dislocation <b>emission</b> <b>criteria</b> in studying the effects of the edge radius, the cutting speed, and the cutting thickness on the plastic deformation of single-crystal silicon. The results of this study show that the uses of a smaller edge radius, faster cutting speeds, and a reduced cutting thickness can result in optimally uniform surface roughness, while the use of a very sharp cutting tool is essential when operating with smaller cutting thicknesses. A further finding is that insufficient plastic deformation is the major cause of increased surface roughness in the ultra-precision turning of brittle materials. On this basis, we propose that the capacity of single-crystal silicon to emit dislocations be improved as much as possible before brittle fracture occurs, thereby promoting plastic deformation and minimizing the anisotropy of surface roughness in the machined workpiece...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{demand for}} palm oil is driving its {{expansion}} into the African tropics, potentially leading to significant carbon emissions if tropical forest {{is converted to}} palm monoculture. In this first study of a Central African oil palm concession (31, 800 ha), we predict that the conversion of 11, 500 ha of logged forest to a palm plantation in Gabon will release 1. 50 Tg C (95 % CI = [1. 29, 1. 76]). These emissions could be completely offset over 25 years through sequestration in planned forest set-asides given a 2. 6 : 1 ratio of logged to converted forest. Using an agricultural suitability model, we find that careful national land-use planning could largely avoid high carbon emissions while meeting goals for palm oil production. We recommend that Gabon adopts a national carbon threshold for land conversion and requires concession-level set-aside ratios that meet no-net <b>emissions</b> <b>criteria</b> as mechanisms for steering plantations away from high carbon forests...|$|R

40|$|According to the EU Directive (96 / 29 /Euratom), the EU {{member states}} must {{identify}} activities where {{the exposure of}} members of the public due to the presence of natural radiation sources increases to such an extent from the viewpoint of radiation protection that it cannot be disregarded. Processing industries carrying out these activities use large amounts of raw materials like ore, marl or clay, which contain natural radionuclides. These radionuclides, present in the releases into air and water, may impose a radiological risk to the population residing near an industrial site. A system of reporting and authorization for such releases is now under development in the Netherlands. An activity is entered into the system when the maximum individual dose or collective dose due to releases to air or water exceeds a certain value: the so-called basic dose criteria. Choosing a maximum individual dose of 10 microSv/a and a collective dose of 1 manSv/a as dose criteria is under consideration. In developing the system the processing industry is classified into a limited set of reference situations, for which the dose criteria are then translated into operational <b>emission</b> <b>criteria</b> per radionuclide by calculating the releases that result in a maximum individual dose of 10 microSv/a and a collective dose of 1 manSv/a. Along with the description of the system, its practical use for a few specific processing industries in the Netherlands is demonstrated.

40|$|The gas (mainly NO and SO 2) {{emission}} and ash characteristics from combustion of high {{ash content}} antibiotic mycelial residue (AMR) rich in N and S were investigated using a laboratory scale fluidized bed combustor, {{and the effects}} of addition of water vapor studied at the same time. The tested combustion temperature, excess air ratio (alpha) and mass ratios of water vapor-to-fuel (WV/F) varied in 750 - 950 degrees C, 1. 3 - 1. 9 and 0. 4 - 1. 4, respectively. Without additional water vapor present, both the concentrations of NO and SO 2 in flue gas increased with elevating combustion temperature and excess air ratio, corresponding to the increases in conversion ratio of fuel-N to NO and emission ratio of S. The addition of water vapor facilitated excavating organic matters in the ash to result in its lower C and N contents. Additional water vapor formed partial reducing atmospheres, which were characterized by high CO and H- 2 concentrations in combustion atmosphere and low valence S in the ash, to thus visibly reduce NO. The SO 2 concentration became slightly lower at the presence of additional water vapor and further decreased with more water vapor addition. Additional water vapor strengthened capture of SO 2 by the ash. Higher WV/F ratios led to more porous structures in ash, accountable for NO reduction by catalytic effect as well as SO 2 absorption. Nevertheless, it seems less possible to reduce NO and SO 2 concentrations to meet their respective <b>emission</b> <b>criteria,</b> and other measures will thus have to be taken to control their emissions when directly combusting AMR for energy recovery.

California's RPS mandates that by 2020, 33 % of the electricity sold in the state must be generated from renewables.

Decisions and direction in these are based on carbon emission models which show the optimum mix of interventions required to achieve carbon emission reductions or stabilization. Developing countries and countries in Africa are now under increasing pressure to adopt carbon <b>emission</b> <b>criteria</b> as the key focus of their built environment policies and strategies. This paper argues against this. It suggests that focusing on carbon emissions is {{likely to result in}} limited resources and timeframes being exhausted trying to achieve reductions and valuable opportunities to build long term sustainable solutions will be lost. It also argues that increasingly scarce resources, infrastructure backlogs, the lifespan of infrastructure and buildings (50 + years) and the limited timeframes for addressing climate change mean that African countries cannot address carbon emission reductions first, and then address sustainability later; they need to address both at once. This paper also argues that while reducing carbon emissions may benefit companies involved in renewable energy and energy efficient technologies, it does not lead to sustainability. Sustainability is complex and requires the achievement of minimum quality of life standards as well as a balance between environmental and human systems. Carbon emission reduction technologies, by themselves, will not achieve this. This paper draws on a definition of sustainability developed by the World Wildlife Fund to show how a sustainable development approach can address carbon emissions while building more sustainable systems.

Studying building skins and their status in terms of energy, economic costs, and CO 2 emissions will allow renovation to produce benefits in the medium and long-term. This study was conducted in the neighborhood of Montbau, a housing development of around 30 buildings, each with different characteristics, built in the 70 ’s and currently having energy losses through their skins, which results in a high demand of internal energy for heating and cooling purposes, in addition to doubled emission of CO 2 e released into the atmosphere. Improvements are proposed to adapt the conditions of these buildings. Two solutions are proposed in addition to evaluating energy costs caused by CO 2 e emissions and any other economic costs year 2012. Other studies analyze the behavior of buildings already implementing such solutions and their corresponding energy, emission, and economic reductions. The importance of such studies lays on the need to analyze options such as renovation instead of considering demolition as an alternative, and to suggest the future building of housing developments in pro of the sustainability of our planet and offer an alternative for a sustainable future, housing and shelter under optimal conditions. The figures herein offer solid results in terms of expenses, costs and energy savings, as well as the reduction of CO 2 emissions released into the atmosphere.

40|$|ABSTRACT Climate {{change has}} been {{influenced}} more by human activities now than previously. These influences are largely attributed to industries, whose activities can potentially produce enormous amounts {{of carbon dioxide and}} other greenhouse gases, and exacerbate the speed of climate change. This thesis examines how the financial markets evaluate corporationsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 greenhouse gas emission performance. We consider various <b>emission</b> <b>criteria,</b> and distinguish between the better and worse performers in different emission policy regimes, including the US, the UK {{and the rest of the}} EU. The investigations have been conducted at three stages, presented in chapter 3, 4 and 5. Firstly, in chapter 3 we examine the carbon effects at the portfolio-level, where total return indices are our main concern. By adopting the long-short strategy, we report that investors in the UK and EU markets, can make an arbitrage profit at the lower cut-off levels, when applying various carbon screening policies and forming equally-weighted portfolios. However, no such profit opportunities can be achieved in the US market. We further consider the reason for such arbitrage opportunities, which is the link between corporate governance/management efficiency and different levels of carbon constraint. Secondly, in chapter 4, the carbon effects are investigated at firm-level, where firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 financial market values act as the dependent variable. Our regression models are based on the Ohlson framework, which considers firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 financial market value in relation to its accounting performance, and the â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 other informationâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9, which in our case is the carbon emission performance. We find a significant relationship between the US firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 values and their carbon emission performances; however, this relationship has been weakened for UK companies, and in fact becomes even unreliable for EU companies. Further, in order to explore the reason for this relationship, we have focused on energy efficiency and firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 reputation that are associated with carbon reduction activities. The scale effects have also been discussed in this chapter, as the various deflators are adopted. Finally, in chapter 5, again at firm-level, cash flow expectation and cost of capital have been considered to possibly be the source that drives firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 value. Cash flow expectation is measured at the short-, medium- and long- term, by profitability, earnings growth, and residual income growth rate, respectively. Two portfolios for each target parameters are constructed according to different carbon screening criteria at different cut-off levels, the differences between each pair of portfolios are then calculated and tested for significance. A sub-sample regression, which is based on the observations available from analystsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 earnings forecast, has been conducted for each of the three regimes. After matching the portfolio and regression results, we report that the implied cost of equity is only reduced for the less carbon emission firms, in regimes where more stringent carbon constraints are applied; whereas in regimes where less stringent carbon constraints exist, the less carbon emission firms have not gained any advantage through their implied cost of equity. Also, cash flow expectations indicate diverse outcomes for different time horizon and regimes. Furthermore, various market participants, such as governments, investors, distributors and clients etc, who could possibly influence firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 carbon behaviour, have also been considered in association with their roles in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our work contributes to the existing literature through a wide ranging examination of major financial evaluation methods relating to emerging carbon emission issues...|$|E

The model is based on poroelasticity and allows us to obtain estimations of the hydraulic diffusivity {{on the basis of}} the location of the micro-earthquakes (defining the CO 2 plume) and the triggering time. Wave propagation of P and S waves is simulated with a full-wave solver, where each emission point is a source proportional to the difference of the pore pressure and the tensile and shear pressure thresholds. Finally a reverse-time migration algorithm is outlined to locate the asynchronous sources induced by the fluid flow, determinated by the maximum amplitude at each cell versus the back propagation time...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses an integrated set of policies {{designed to reduce}} U. S. carbon emissions {{over the next four}} decades. This innovation path also aims to promote environmental quality, particularly by reducing <b>emissions</b> of <b>criteria</b> air pollutants, to reduce U. S. dependence on imported oil, and to induce technological innovation and diffusion in energy production and consumption. The innovation path would reduce economy-wide carbon emissions by 26 % below baseline projections for 2010 and by 62 % below baseline projections for 2030; this translates into 10 % below 1990 levels in 2010 and 45 % below 1990 levels in 2030. <b>Emissions</b> of <b>criteria</b> pollutants also would be significantly reduced, as would petroleum imports by the United States. Moreover, the innovation path would yield cumulative net savings for the United States of $ 218 billion (1993 dollars) through 2010, or $ 19 billion on a leveled annual basis, and would result in 800, 000 additional jobs nationwide by 2010. Although the overall findings from the innovation path analysis are robust, the results should be taken as indicative, rather than precisely predictive, owing to uncertainties in future costs, prices, technology performance, and consumer behavior...|$|R
