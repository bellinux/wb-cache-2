40|$|AbstractHelicobacter pylori {{commonly}} infects {{the human}} stomach lining {{is one of}} the risk factors that can lead a gastric ulcer to develop into gastric cancer. Studies have found that burdock can enhance the protection of gastrointestinal mucosa with antibacterial property that can reduce the damage of the stomach by H pylori. <b>Great</b> <b>burdock</b> essence compounds are prepared using a nanomicell formulation, which contains Arctium lappa Linn, Arnebia euchroma, and Angelica sinensis. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of <b>great</b> <b>burdock</b> essence compounds in the adjuvant treatment of H pylori infected clinical patients. Forty-four patients with gastric ulcers, 21 of whom were taking <b>great</b> <b>burdock</b> essence compounds and 23 taking placebo, were included in this study. After taking <b>great</b> <b>burdock</b> essence compounds or placebo for 1 month, 13 C-Urea Breath Test showed 20 (20 / 21) patients with negative results and only one person with positive results among the burdock group; in addition, it also indicated that there were 1 6 (16 / 23) with negative results and seven (7 / 23) patients with positive results among the placebo group. The statistical results also showed that the positive 13 C-Urea Breath Test results in patients who took <b>great</b> <b>burdock</b> essence compounds were significantly lower than that of the control group (p =  0. 027).

40|$|Aims The {{present study}} aimed to {{identify}} new hemostyptics by assessing the coagulation enhancing activity of 117 Chinese herbal extracts in vitro. Methods Herbs were {{boiled in water}} for about 30 min, filtered and then lyophilized filtrates (10 mg/mL) were dissolved in water. Coagulation was assayed as prothrombin time (PT). Plasma diluted in saline was incubated with each extract for five minutes and then PT reagent was added followed by CaCl 2 solution and the time taken to form clots was measured. Extracts that decreased coagulation time were regarded as containing active compounds. The abilities of extracts to activate Factor XII were assessed and the activated form of factor XII (XIIa) was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Results Coagulation time was obviously shortened by extracts of Alpinia Rhizome, Areca, Artemisia Leaf, Cassia Bark, Danshen Root, Ephedra Herb, Epimedium Herb, Forsythia Fruit, <b>Great</b> <b>Burdock</b> Achene, Moutan Bark, Perilla Herb, Red Paeony Root, Schizonepeta Spike, Senticosus Rhizome, Sweet Annie, Uncaria Thorn and Zanthoxylum Peel.

40|$|<b>Great</b> <b>burdock</b> (Arctium lappa) is an edible {{vegetable}} that is {{also used}} as herbal medicines in many countries. Traditionally, burdock is used to slow aging, cure male impotence and in beauty care. However, the relevant mechanisms and scientific proof of its actions {{have not yet been}} elucidated. The expansion of the corpora cavernosum smooth muscle cells of the penis is the main regulating factor of erection, and the nitric oxide-soluble guanylyl cyclase-cyclic guanine monophosphate (NO-sGC-cGMP) pathway {{plays an important role in}} maintaining expansion of the corpora cavernosum. The current study aims are to investigate the effects of burdock extract on a rabbit's corpora cavernosum. The effects of burdock on the protein expression in the cavernosum tissues and smooth muscle cells were investigated, and the changes in cGMP level were determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit analysis. Our results showed that burdock extract increased the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, cGMP-dependent kinase, sGCα 1 and sGCβ 1 in the smooth muscle cells and tissues of the corpora cavernosum, while the expression of phosphodiesterase- 5 was inhibited. Additionally, cGMP levels become elevated in the smooth muscles after treatment with burdock extract. In summary, our data suggest that burdock can facilitate in the relaxation of the corpora cavernosum; however, the benefits of burdock in treating erectile dysfunction remain to be resolved...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 26 herbal {{medicines}} were examined for their inhibitory effects on cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 (CYP 3 A 4) and 2 D 6 (CYP 2 D 6). A methanol extract of each herbal medicine was prepared and then preincubated with human liver microsomes {{in the presence}} of an NADPH-generating system. Residual microsomal CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 D 6 activity was then determined by measuring the N-demethylation of erythromycin and the O-demethylation of dextromethorphan, respectively. Of the 26 herbal medicines tested, 16 were found to decrease the residual CYP 3 A 4 activity in a preincubation time-dependent manner. The extract of Evodia Fruit caused the most dramatic decrease in residual CYP 3 A 4 activity (i. e. 22. 3 % residual activity after 30 min preincubation). A substantial decrease in residual CYP 3 A 4 activity was also observed from extracts of Sappan Wood, Incised Notopterygium Rhizome, Schisandra Fruit, <b>Great</b> <b>Burdock</b> Achene, Angelica Dahurica Root and Rhubarb (residual activity of 40. 6, 41. 2, 53. 4, 47. 1, 53. 4 and 59. 2 % after 30 min preincubation, respectively). These results are comparable to those using troleandomycin, a known irreversible inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4, which gave a residual activity of 49. 4 % under identical conditions. 26 種の生薬のシトクロムP 450 3 A 4 (CYP 3 A 4) 及び 2 D 6 (CYP 2 D 6) に対する阻害作用を調べた。生薬エキス粉末から調製されたメタノール可溶性画分をNADPH生成系存在下, ヒト肝ミクロソームとプレインキュベーションした後のCYP 3 A 4 の残存活性(erythromycin N-demethylation活性) とCYP 2 D 6 の残存活性(dextromethorphan O-demethylation活性) を測定した。その結果, 16 種の生薬がCYP 3 A 4 活性をプレインキュベーション時間依存的に低下させた。中でも, 呉茱萸によるCYP 3 A 4 活性の低下作用が最も顕著であった(30 分間プレインキュベーションした後の活性の残存率は 22. 3 %) 。次いで, 蘇木, 羌活, 五味子, 牛蒡子, 白止, 大黄が顕著な低下を示した(30 分間プレインキュベーションした後の活性の残存率は, それぞれ 40. 6, 41. 2, 53. 4, 47. 1, 53. 4, 59. 2 %) 。これら 7 種生薬によるCYP 3 A 4 活性低下作用は, CYP 3 A 4 に対する不可逆的阻害剤であるtroleandomycinによる残存率(49. 4 %) に匹敵した。CYP 2 D 6 活性に対してプレインキュベーション時間依存的な活性の低下を示した生薬は, 5 種であった。最もCYP 2 D 6 活性の低下作用が大きかった生薬は, 羌活であり, 30 分間プレインキュベーションした後の活性の残存率は 61. 9 %であった。以上の結果から, 呉茱萸, 蘇木, 羌活, 五味子, 牛蒡子, 白止, 大黄等の複数の生薬エキス中に, CYP 3 A 4 に対するmetabolism-dependent inhibitorが含まれていることが示唆された。relation: isVersionOf: [URL] Century COE Program Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical Universit...|$|E
40|$|Dear colleagues, {{continuing}} {{the rubric of}} the journal about the treatment of infectious diseases by medicinal plants, we want to present the methods of using medicinal plants as an additional therapy for treatment of viral hepatitis {{in addition to the}} main treatment according to the generally clinical standards of antiviral therapy. Viral hepatitis compiles a large group of human infectious diseases characterized by a predominant liver damage. “Currently, viral hepatitis is recognized as a major public health problem requiring urgent action”, said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General (WHO Global hepatitis report, 2017). Treatment of viral hepatitis is a complex task and involves the use of generally clinical recommendations or standards. There are criteria for determining the need for pharmacotherapy and the most rational scheme for antiviral treatment in every case of viral hepatitis. The purpose of antiviral therapy is to achieve a stable virologic response, to prevent the progression of the disease, the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, at the present stage a stable virologic response in the general population of patients can be achieved in approximately 60 % of cases. In addition, standard antiviral drugs have side effects, are of high cost and are contraindicated in a number of clinical situations, for example, with a {{decrease in the number of}} blood elements (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia), at the stage of decompensated liver cirrhosis. Probably, all this induces to use alternative methods of therapy, which remain popular both among general practitioners and patients with this infection. The question of the treatment of viral hepatitis with medicinal herbs has been studied for a long time. According to some authors, there is no scientific evidence that hepatitis C can be cured by herbs. The only scientifically proven method of fighting the virus is antiviral therapy. However, there are other points of view on this issue. A review of the results of randomized trials on the effectiveness of drugs containing herbs in the treatment of hepatitis C and the advisability of their use in this category of patients found that in 2001 a review was published on the analysis of the efficacy and safety of hepatitis C treatment with drugs based on medicinal herbs (Yarnell E., Abascal K. and others). The authors turned to the register of controlled studies of the hepatobiliary Cochrane group, the Cochrane libraries, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, and also to Chinese and Japanese databases. For the analysis, randomized clinical trials were selected comparing the results of using medicinal herbs (one herb or herb collection) with placebo or no treatment, or with general nonspecific treatment, other methods of phytotherapy or with interferon α (IFN-α) and/or ribavirin. Analysis of randomized clinical trials has shown a proven positive role in the treatment of viral hepatitis following such medicinal herbs as: traditional Chinese herbs, Sophora Japanese (Milk thistle, Silybum marianum), Licorice (Liquorice, sweetwood, licorice root), Andrographis paniculata, St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), Chinese Schisandra chinensis (wu wei zi), Astragalus membranaceus root (huang qi), dandelion root (Taraxacum officinale), root of the <b>great</b> <b>burdock</b> (Arctium lappa), Curcuma longa, root of the red sage (or danshen, Salvia miltiorrhiza), etc. The authors of this article based on available literature data recommend the plant groups used in the treatment of viral hepatitis, principles, as well as prescription of plant collections, the method of preparation and recommendations for the application of the prepared preparations with indication of the dose, the frequency of administration and the duration of phytotherapy for this group of patients. It is indicated at which stage of the disease and which herbs can be added to the collection, depending on the general state and complains of the patient, the causative agent of viral hepatitis and laboratory examination data. For the therapy of viral hepatitis, it was recommended to use medicinal herbs only as an addition to the main treatment with antiviral drugs according to clinical recommendations or standards for the treatment of viral hepatitis...|$|E
