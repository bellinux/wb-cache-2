40|$|Screen {{size and}} display {{resolution}} limit {{the experience of}} watching videos on mobile devices. The viewing experience can be improved by determining important or interesting regions within the video (called regions of interest, or ROIs) and displaying only the ROIs to the viewer. Previous work focuses on analyzing the video content using visual attention model to infer the ROIs. Such content-based technique, however, has limitations. In this paper, we propose an alternative paradigm to infer ROIs from a video. We crowdsource from {{a large number of}} users through their implicit viewing behavior using a zoom and pan interface, and infer the ROIs from their collective wisdom. A retargeted video, consisting of relevant shots determined from historical users behavior, can be automatically generated and replayed to subsequent users who would prefer a less interactive viewing experience. This paper presents how we collect the user traces, infer the ROIs and their dynamics, group the ROIs into shots, and automatically reframe those shots to improve the aesthetics of the video. A user study with 48 participants shows that our automatically retargeted video is of comparable quality to one <b>handcrafted</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> expert user...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} general {{approach}} to forming structure-activity relationships (SARs). This approach {{is based on}} representing chemical structure by atoms and their bond connectivities {{in combination with the}} inductive logic programming (ILP) algorithm PROGOL. Existing SAR methods describe chemical structure by using attributes which are general properties of an object. It is not possible to map chemical structure directly to attribute-based descriptions, as such descriptions have no internal organization. A more natural and general way to describe chemical structure is to use a relational description, where the internal construction of the description maps that of the object described. Our atom and bond connectivities representation is a relational description. ILP algorithms can form SARs with relational descriptions. We have tested the relational approach by investigating the SARs of 230 aromatic and heteroaromatic nitro compounds. These compounds had been split previously into two subsets, 188 compounds that were amenable to regression and 42 that were not. For the 188 compounds, a SAR was found that was as accurate as the best statistical or neural network-generated SARs. The PROGOL SAR has the advantages that it did not need the use of any indicator variables <b>handcrafted</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> expert, and the generated rules were easily comprehensible. For the 42 compounds, PROGOL formed a SAR that was significantly (P < 0. 025) more accurate than linear regression, quadratic regression, and back-propagation. This SAR is based on an automatically generated structural alert for mutagenicity...|$|E

50|$|While early mass {{production}} of guitars dramatically {{increased the number}} of guitars in circulation, each instrument was still <b>handcrafted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single or team of luthiers. For luthiers who still choose to handcraft their instruments, methods have changed very little over the past 500 years. As more advanced tooling options become available, however, less of the work in manufacturing a guitar is necessary to complete <b>by</b> hand. <b>Handcrafting</b> guitars is a time and labor-intensive method of production. Some common tools used by luthiers today are a Band saw, Drill Press, Table Saw, Stationary Sander, Jointer, C Clamps, Sanding Board, Column Sander, Power Planer, Dovetail Saw, Scraper blades, Hand Files, Router, and Sand Paper.|$|R

50|$|A large, decorative, half-winding {{internal}} staircase, <b>handcrafted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Maltese timber sculptor Mick Farrugia, ascended {{from the}} centre of the ballroom to the upper level. Behind the staircase on the ground floor, doors led to an undercroft space with washing facilities and another plainer stair leading to the rear verandah on the upper level. A bathroom and toilet, enclosed with chamferboards, was located in the south-west corner on each level. The timbers used inside included maple, silky oak, and Johnstone River hardwood. Farrugia and his family were sponsored immigrants nominated by the Zammits. Apart from the staircase and curved walls installed in the entry when the ballroom became small flats, he also custom-made furniture for the main and guest bedrooms.|$|R
50|$|Lenca {{heritage}} {{tourism is}} expanding. It has encouraged attention to indigenous Lenca traditions and culture, especially in Honduras. The Honduran Tourism Institute, {{along with the}} United Nations Development Program, has developed a cultural heritage project dedicated to the Lenca and their culture, called La Ruta Lenca. This tourist route passes {{through a series of}} rural towns in southwestern Honduras within traditional Lenca territory. The route has designated stops in the departments of Inticuba, La Paz, Lempira, and adjacent valleys. Stops include La Campa, where traditional Lenca pottery is <b>handcrafted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> cooperative; the archaeological sites of Los Naranjos and Yarumela; the town of Gracias, and other towns with Lenca heritage. The development of La Ruta Lenca was designed to attract tourist money to Lenca communities and to encourage preservation of remaining indigenous cultural practices by increasing the economic return for artisans and providing new markets. The project has gained some successes.|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} (RL) depends critically on {{the choice}} of reward functions used to capture the de- sired behavior and constraints of a robot. Usually, these are <b>handcrafted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> expert designer and represent heuristics for relatively simple tasks. Real world applications typically involve more complex tasks with rich temporal and logical structure. In this paper we {{take advantage of the}} expressive power of temporal logic (TL) to specify complex rules the robot should follow, and incorporate domain knowledge into learning. We propose Truncated Linear Temporal Logic (TLTL) as specifications language, that is arguably well suited for the robotics applications, together with quantitative semantics, i. e., robustness degree. We propose a RL approach to learn tasks expressed as TLTL formulae that uses their associated robustness degree as reward functions, instead of the manually crafted heuristics trying to capture the same specifications. We show in simulated trials that learning is faster and policies obtained using the proposed approach outperform the ones learned using heuristic rewards in terms of the robustness degree, i. e., how well the tasks are satisfied. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed RL approach in a toast-placing task learned <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Baxter robot...|$|R

30|$|Summarizing {{opinions}} {{based on}} aspects {{is often the}} case that distinct aspect expressions refer to the same aspect category or class. Thus, the important task of aspect grouping has been addressed in the literature [10, 14, 15, 21]. In other approaches [15, 21], the authors proposed a constrained semi-supervised learning method to group aspect expressions into the user-specified aspect groups, where each group represents a specific aspect. The method starts from a small number of seed aspect expressions supplied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> user. It then assigns the remaining aspect expressions to suitable groups using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm based on labeled seeds and unlabeled examples. The method proposed by Carenini et al. [14] groups aspect expressions into nodes of a taxonomy, where each node represents a feature of products in some category. This taxonomy is supplied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> user. Except for this, the method is fully unsupervised since it relies on similarity functions to verify if aspect expression match features in the taxonomy. In this case, the aspect expression is mapped to the matching feature. The method described by Yu et al. [10] groups opinions according to their aspects according to a taxonomy. Unlike the work of Carenini et al. [14], this taxonomy is not related to a product category, rather to a specific product. It is initially built from information available in the product’s Web page, and it is then incrementally rebuilt and refined according to the specific aspects found in a set of reviews on the target product. The method relies on a semantic distance learning algorithm, to group opinions based on their semantic relations, requiring training data. Similar to these methods, our AspectLink method relies on a strategy that groups aspect expressions into aspect classes. In our case however, these aspect classes are provided by the structure of the product catalog, while in the work of Carenini et al. [14], the taxonomy must be <b>handcrafted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> user. AspectLink was designed to be unsupervised, and for this, we adapted and improved the similarity functions proposed by Carenini et al. [14]. This method is used as one of the baselines in our experiments.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{transformation}} of consumer graphics (CG) cards into powerful 3 D rendering processors {{is due in}} large measure {{to the success of}} game developers in delivering mass market entertainment software that feature highly immersive and captivating virtual environments. Despite this success, 3 D CG application development is becoming increasingly handicapped by the inability of traditional content creation methods {{to keep up with the}} demand for content. The term content is used here to refer to any data operated on by application code that is meant for viewing, including 3 D models, textures, animation sequences and maps or other data-intensive descriptions of virtual environments. Traditionally, content has been <b>handcrafted</b> <b>by</b> humans. <b>A</b> serious problem facing the interactive graphics software development community is how to increase the rate at which content can be produced to keep up with the increasingly rapid pace at which software for interactive applications can now be developed. Research addressing this problem centers around procedural content creation systems. By moving away from purely human content creation toward systems in which humans play a substantially less time-intensive but no less creative part in the process, procedural content creation opens new doors. From a qualitative standpoint, these types of systems will not rely less on human intervention but rather more since they will depend heavily on direction from a human in order to synthesize the desired content. This research draws heavily from the entertainment software domain but the research is broadly relevant to 3 D graphics applications in general...|$|R
