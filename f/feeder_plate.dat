40|$|The {{profitability}} of abalone farms is {{heavily influenced by}} their production per unit of grow-out space. With farms having physically expanded to the maximum, and with increasing production costs, {{one of the most}} realistic ways for farms to increase their production is through optimizing stocking densities. The effect of stocking density on Haliotis midae performance is undocumented and optimal stocking densities for this species have not been determined. Experiments were conducted under farm conditions to investigate the effects of four different stocking densities (16 %, 20 %, 22 % and 24 % of available surface area) on growth, production and health of three different size classes of abalone (15 - 35 g, 45 - 65 g, and 70 - 90 g start weight). Each treatment was replicated four times and trials ran over a period of eight months with measurements being made at four month intervals. Abalone behaviour was observed during the trials in the experimental tanks. Weight gain per abalone decreased with an increase in density for all tested size classes (5. 04 ± 0. 18 to 2. 38 ± 0. 17; 5. 35 ± 0. 21 to 4. 62 ± 0. 29; 7. 97 ± 0. 37 to 6. 53 ± 0. 28 g. abalone- 1. month- 1 for the 15 - 35, 45 - 65 and 70 - 90 g classes respectively, with an increased density of 16 to 24 %). Individual weight gain of 15 - 35 g abalone was similar at stocking densities of 16 % and 20 % while weight gain of 45 - 65 g and 70 - 90 g abalone decreased when density was increased above 16 %. Biomass gain (kg. basket- 1. month- 1) was not affected by stocking density in the 15 - 35 g and 45 - 65 g size classes (1. 29 ± 0. 02 and 0. 97 ± 0. 02 kg. basket- 1. month- 1 respectively). However, the biomass gained by baskets stocked with 70 - 90 g abalone increased with stocking density (1. 08 ± 0. 02 to 1. 33 ± 0. 02 kg. basket- 1. month- 1) with an increased density of 16 to 24 %) and did not appear to plateau within the tested density range (16 to 24 %). Food conversion ratio did not differ significantly between densities across all size classes. Stocking density did not {{have a significant effect on}} abalone condition factor or health indices. The proportion of abalone above the level of the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> increased with density (7. 26 ± 1. 33 to 16. 44 ± 1. 33 with an increased density of 16 to 24 %). As a proportion of abalone situated in the area of the basket, the same proportions were situated on the walls above the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> and on the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> itself irrespective of stocking density (p > 0. 05). Higher proportions of animals had restricted access to feed at higher stocking densities (p = 0. 03). The amount of formulated feed available on the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> did not differ between stocking densities throughout the night (p = 0. 19). Individual abalone spent more time above the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> at higher stocking densities (p 0. 05) but abalone stocked at 16 % spent a greater percentage of time above the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> on the feeding surface (83. 99 ± 6. 26 %) than on the basket walls (16. 01 ± 6. 26 %). Stocking density did not affect the positioning of abalone within a basket during the day or at night. Different size H. midae are affected differently by increases in stocking density in terms of growth performance. Findings from this research may be implemented into farm management strategies to best suit production goals, whether in terms of biomass production or individual weight gain. The fundamental mechanisms resulting in reduced growth at higher densities are not well understood, however results from behaviour observations suggest that competition for preferred attachment space and feed availability are contributing to decreased growth rates. With knowledge of abalone behaviour at different densities, innovative tank designs may be established in order to counter the reduction in growth at higher densities...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{three types}} of feeders for broilers: Fenix, Tube and Automatic feeders. Bird's feeding behavior and preference were considered in this the evaluation. Preference was assessed by examining birds' behavioral activities, such as eating, standing and lying around the equipments, and meal duration as function of the environmental variables. Data on the behavioral activities and meal size were collected in a broiler commercial farm using a portable video camera, and the direct footages were analyzed. The time spent in each activity, feeding bout duration and time spent near the trough were statistically analyzed using the test of means and medians. Pearson's correlation {{test was used to}} evaluate the relationship between ambient environmental data and the time of feeding. A prospective scenario was established and data were pair wised compared to it. There were interactions between environmental characteristics and feeding and lying down activities during the experiment. Eating behavior was more frequent in the area around the Tube feeder. The duration of feeding time was higher when the birds used the Tube feeder (214 +/- 28 s), followed by the use of the Fenix feeder (123 +/- 17 s) and the Automatic feeder (77 +/- 29 s). Birds preferred eating from the Tube feeder probably due to the absence of the partition grid above the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E

The plate assemblies were placed in steel cassettes resembling library card catalogue drawers, which were manually inserted into the machine. At the press of the foot pedal the plate assemblies were swapped in sequence in a similar fashion to a slide projector, placing an impression of the raised type onto the mail piece.|$|R
40|$|International audienceInsect kinins (leucokinins) are {{multifunctional}} peptides {{acting as}} neurohormones and neurotransmitters. In females of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti (L.), aedeskinins {{are known to}} stimulate fluid secretion from the renal organs (Malpighian tubules) and hindgut contractions by activating a G protein-coupled kinin receptor designated ``Aedae-KR. '' We used protease-resistant kinin analogs 1728, 1729, and 1460 to evaluate their effects on sucrose perception and feeding behavior. In no-choice feeding bioassays (capillary <b>feeder</b> and <b>plate</b> assays), the analog 1728, which contains alpha-amino isobutyric acid, inhibited females from feeding on sucrose. It further induced quick fly-away or walk-away behavior following contact with the tarsi and the mouthparts. Electrophysiological recordings from single long labellar sensilla of the proboscis demonstrated that mixing the analog 1728 at 1 mM with sucrose almost completely inhibited the detection of sucrose. Aedae-KR was immunolocalized in contact chemosensory neurons in prothoracic tarsi and in sensory neurons and accessory cells of long labellar sensilla in the distal labellum. Silencing Aedae-KR by RNAi significantly reduced gene expression and eliminated the feeding-aversion behavior resulting from contact with the analog 1728, thus directly implicating the Aedae-KR in the aversion response. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report that kinin analogs modulate sucrose perception in any insect. The aversion to feeding elicited by analog 1728 suggests that synthetic molecules targeting the mosquito Aedae-KR in the labellum and tarsi should be investigated for the potential to discover novel feeding deterrents of mosquito vectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of molecular species that stimulate growth of granulocyte or macrophage colonies (GM-CSF) by the fibroblastoid H- 1 cell line is unaffected by either native or iron-saturated lactoferrin, although some inhibition is detected with 10 microM prostaglandin E 1. The H- 1 GM-CSF {{is able to}} support the formation of macrophage, neutrophil, and mixed colonies. Feeder layers of H- 1 cells are also able to support the development of colony-forming units stimulated by GM-CSF (GM-CFUc) {{although the number of}} colonies produced when the optimal H- 1 cell concentration is plated (2. 5 x 10 (3) cells) is only 30 % of the number with conditioned medium alone. This inhibitory effect is observed irrespective of the presence of an additional agar layer between the <b>feeder</b> cells and <b>plated</b> bone marrow cells, implying that diffusable substances are involved. Addition of indomethacin (10 microM) to feeder layers derived from 2. 5 x 10 (3) H- 1 cells increases the number of GM-CFUc detected to 50 % of that seen with conditioned medium alone. This result suggests that released prostaglandin may be responsible for some, but not all, of the observed inhibition of colony formation. In the presence of the H- 1 feeder layers, only macrophage colonies are detected and hence it appears that the H- 1 cells produce, in addition to prostaglandin, a diffusible inhibitory substance that preferentially inhibits granulopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|Since the Conform {{process was}} {{patented}} 30 years ago, there {{have only been}} approximately 200 machines sold worldwide. Given that Conform competes economically with conventional extrusion and is also reported {{to be a more}} energy efficient process, it is surprising that the use of Conform is not more widespread in today's increasingly environmentally conscious and high-production focussed world. One explanation for this is likely to be {{due to the fact that}} there is still limited knowledge of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the workpiece during extrusion. Furthermore, for the aluminium industry, there are still issues remaining regarding the production of flash and the quality of the extrudate in terms of mechanical properties. This study provides the reader with the findings of the research and experimental work undertaken by the author, his co-workers and fellow specialists, in the field of aluminium extrusion including Conform. The experimental work includes both laboratory experiments performed with a direct extrusion press and an experimental machine set up to replicate the Conform process. The experimental work is also simulated using finite element modelling techniques. The results from these analyses are then validated by comparing industrial and experimental data. The finite element analyses are enhanced by using parallel processing technology and user sub-routines. The author proposes new models to allow for the study of the different sub-processes in Conform. These include the coining of the feedstock, formation of the upset zone, extrusion of the flash, the filling-up of the expansion chamber / <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> and the extrusion of the extrudate. The author also investigates methods which predict microstructure and surface cracks in the extrudate. The author suggests innovative techniques to improve the efficiency of finite element analysis in metal forming. Finally the author recommends procedures for the study of structural integrity and the optimisation of the tooling used in Conform. ...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE:Induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (iPSCs) promise to advance regenerative medicine in several distinct ways: as therapeutic agents themselves, {{as a source of}} differentiated cells, or, as in the current work, as a model system to develop therapy aimed at reprogramming abnormally functioning cells. In the current work we developed iPS-like cells from lung cells of COPD patients and controls. METHODS:Lentiviral particles for Oct 3 / 4, Sox 2, c-Myc and Klf 4 were utilized to generate iPS-like cells from lung fibroblasts of three COPD and three non-COPD subjects. Cells were infected with lentiviral particles at MOI of 5 and transferred to six well <b>plate</b> containing <b>feeder</b> layer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts 48 hours after transfection. To enhance the generation of iPS-like rock inhibitor Y 27632 was used after seven days of infection and 100 ng b-fgf was used in the media for the last seven days of the reprogramming protocol. After enriching for colonies, iPS-like cells were moved to <b>feeder</b> independent <b>plates</b> using mTESR 1 ® media and BD matrigel®. Alkaline phosphatase immunecytochemistry and real time PCR for undifferentiated markers Oct 3 / 4 and Sox 2 and were carried out to demonstrate the self-renewal and pluripotency capacity of the generated iPS-like cells. iPS-like cells were then used to prepare embryoid bodies (EBs) and the ability of these EBs to re-differentiate towards fibroblasts was assessed then iPS-like cells-derived fibroblasts from both groups were tested functionally by gel contraction and chemotaxis. RESULTS:iPS-like cells were successfully generated from both COPD and control adult lung fibroblasts. Morphology of iPS-like cells generated COPD and non-COPD lung fibroblasts was similar to the control iPSCs obtained from university of Wisconsin. Generated iPS-like cells expressed high levels of alkaline phosphatase and high levels of Oct 3 / 4 and Sox 2 were also detected by real time PCR. The iPS-like cells formed EBs in culture and differentiated into fibroblasts in three-dimension collagen gels. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that fibroblasts cultured from the lungs of patients with COPD and controls can be induced to form iPS-like cells. The resulting "stem cells" can be used to induce differentiation and a fibroblast-like phenotype can be restored. This system should be able to help elucidate whether epigenetic alterations accumulate in structural cells in COPD...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor {{growth at}} low seeding densities, keratinocytes {{isolated}} from human tissues like epidermis or hair follicles {{are dependent on}} mesenchyme-derived feeder cells such as the 3 T 3 -cell employed so far. As an alternative method, the present study describes the use of post-mitotic human dermal fibroblasts sublethally irradiated or mitomycin C-treated. Special emphasis was put on efficient growth of primary keratinocyte cultures plated at very low seeding densities. Thus, outer root sheath cells isolated from two anagen human hair follicles and plated in a 35 -mm culture dish (3 – 6 × 102 attached cells) grew to confluence within 3 weeks (6 – 8 × 105 cells). Similar results were obtained for interfollicular keratinocytes. A crucial point for the function of these fibroblast <b>feeder</b> cells is <b>plating</b> at appropriate densities, considering their tremendous increase in cell size at the post-mitotic state. Plating densities of 4 – 5 × 103 /cm 2 allow full spreading of the feeder cells and do not impede the settling and expansion of the keratinocytes. Major advantages of this system include easier handling and better reproducibility than using 3 T 3 -cells. Moreover, homologous fibroblast feeders mimic more closely the physiologic situation and therefore might provide a valuable tool for studying interactions between human mesenchymal and epithelial cells. Finally, potential hazards of using transformed feeder cells from a different species in keratinocyte cultures raised for wound covering in humans could be thus avoided...|$|R
40|$|Although epithelial-like {{somatic cells}} have been {{previously}} isolated from semen, cell prolif-eration rates were low. Culture of whole semen samples resulted in loss of potentially valu-able spermatozoa. The {{aims of the}} present study were to: (1) isolate somatic cells from semen, while preserving sperm viability, and (2) optimize in vitro culture conditions for semen-de-rived epithelial cells. Density gradient centrifugation of washed ejaculates of two rams (Ovis aries) (n 24) and one eland bull (Taurotragus oryx) (n 4) was performed using a three-layer discontinuous Percoll column consisting of 90 % (P- 90), 50 % (P- 50), and 20 % (P- 20) Per-coll. In vitro culture and Trypan Blue staining indicated that live somatic cells settled in the P- 20 layer. Nonmotile spermatozoa were recovered at the P- 50 and P- 90 interfaces, whereas motile spermatozoa were collected in the pellet from the P- 90 layer. Subsequently, somatic cells isolated from the P- 20 layer were plated either on inactivated 3 T 3 mouse embryonic fibroblast <b>feeder</b> layers, collagen-coated <b>plates</b> with 3 T 3 feeder cell inserts, or on collagen-coated plates. Initial somatic cell plating was similar among treatments, but proliferation significantly increased when cocultured with 3 T 3 cells (feeder or insert). Furthermore, two different types of epithelial cells were obtained. The exact origin of the cells in the male reproduction system is uncertain and probably variable. The present method of cell isolation and in vitro culture may be of value for preserving endangered species. Specifically, cells isolated and cultured from cryopreserved semen of nonliving males could be used for pro-ducing embryos by somatic cell nuclear transfer. 14...|$|R
40|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) have an unlimited capacity for self-renewal, {{and the ability to}} differentiate into cells derived from all three embryonic germ layers (1). Directed differentiation of hESCs into specific cell types has generated much interest in the field of regenerative medicine (e. g., (2 - 5)), and methods for determining the in vivo fate of selected or manipulated hESCs are essential to this endeavor. We have adapted a highly efficient teratoma formation assay for this purpose. A small number of specifically selected hESCs is mixed with undifferentiated wild type hESCs and Phaseolus vulgaris lectin to form a cell pellet. This is grafted beneath the kidney capsule in an immunodeficient mouse. As few as 2. 5 x 10 5 hESCs are needed to form a 16 cm 3 teratoma within 8 - 12 weeks. The fate of the originally selected hESCs can then be determined by immunohistochemistry. This method provides a valuable tool for characterizing tissue-specific reagents for cell-based therapy.
