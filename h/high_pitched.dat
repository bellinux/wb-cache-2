5|$|The pale crag martin's {{flight is}} slow, with rapid wing beats {{interspersed}} with flat-winged glides, {{and it is}} more acrobatic than the larger Eurasian crag martin. It is a quiet bird; the song is a muffled twitter, and other calls include a trrt resembling {{the call of the}} common house martin, a nasal vick, and a <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> twee contact call.|$|E
5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> and appear {{to be coming from}} one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Other vocalisations {{of wolves}} are usually {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has a {{fundamental}} frequency between 320–904Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to the {{way many}} other {{languages}} use <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> in Child directed speech (babytalk), K'iche' babytalk has been shown not to use <b>high</b> <b>pitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Acute, grave, and {{circumflex}} {{could be}} placed on two-mora vowels, whereas only acute and grave {{could be placed}} on one-mora vowels. The accent marks are placed on the second vowel letter of a diphthong.These accent marks corresponded to the variations of pitch listed above. On a one-mora vowel, acute indicates <b>high</b> <b>pitch.</b> On a two-mora vowel, the circumflex indicates <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on the first mora and the acute indicates <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on the second mora. On either one-mora or two-mora vowels, grave accent indicated normal pitch.|$|R
50|$|A final rule {{relates to}} the grave. An acute {{at the end of}} a word was {{replaced}} by a grave when another normally accented word followed. The acute accent represents <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on the last mora of a two-mora vowel or the only mora of a one-mora vowel, and the grave indicates normal pitch, so the grave accent rule means that <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on the last mora of a word was usually lost (changed to ordinary pitch). A final circumflex represents <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on the next-to-last mora, so it remains unchanged.|$|R
5|$|Following {{a largely}} organic and uncalculated impulse, {{many of these}} new bands infused classic heavy metal with the immediacy of pub rock and the {{intensity}} of punk rock, implementing to various degrees the crossover of genres started by Motörhead; in general they shunned ballads, de-emphasised harmonies and produced shorter songs with fast tempos and a very aggressive sound based on riffs and power chords, featuring vocals ranging from <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> wails to gruff and low growls. Iron Maiden, Angel Witch, Saxon, Holocaust, Tygers of Pan Tang, Girlschool, Tank and More are notable performers of this style, which bands such as Atomkraft, Jaguar, Raven and Venom stretched to produce even more extreme results. Critics consider this new approach to heavy metal the greatest musical accomplishment of the NWOBHM and an important evolutionary step for the genre.|$|E
5|$|Hermética was a thrash metal band, drawing {{influences}} from Motörhead, Megadeth, and Black Sabbath. Their {{music was}} composed primarily by bassist Ricardo Iorio with occasional input from guitarist Antonio Romano, who composed the guitar solos. The band used a counterpoint between the singing styles {{of their two}} vocalists; lead singer Claudio O'Connor's vocals were <b>high</b> <b>pitched,</b> while Iorio had a raucous style of singing. Iorio sang segments of some songs but rarely performed songs in their entirety. Iorio thought that his singing style in Hermética was inferior to his later work with Almafuerte because the songs had not been composed specifically for him. The success of Hermética's second studio album Ácido Argentino allowed the band to increase the budget {{for the production of}} its follow-up, Víctimas del Vaciamiento. Iorio proposed re-recording the band's first album with drummer Claudio Strunz and a higher budget, but the label refused his proposal.|$|E
5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E
50|$|Stress on {{penultimate}} syllables is characterised by a low pitch, {{which is}} followed by a <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on the (unstressed) word-final syllable. In words where stress is on the final syllable, that syllable also bears the <b>high</b> <b>pitch.</b> This <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> is a remnant of the high-pitched word-final stress of early Old Welsh (derived from original penultimate stress in Common Brittonic by the loss of final syllables); the stress shift from final to penultimate occurred in the Old Welsh period without affecting the overall pitch of the word.|$|R
25|$|In Guinea, {{a typical}} {{ensemble}} uses three djembes and three dunun, called sangban (medium pitch), dundunba (bass <b>pitch),</b> and kenkeni (<b>high</b> <b>pitch,</b> also called kensedeni). If an ensemble {{includes more than}} one djembe, the <b>highest</b> <b>pitched</b> (and therefore loudest) djembe plays solo phrases and the other djembes and dunun play accompaniment.|$|R
50|$|The vowel of the culminative {{syllable}} bears {{either an}} acute or grave accent, the latter indicating a <b>high</b> <b>pitch,</b> {{and the former}} a <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> which rapidly falls. The grave accent appears only when the culminative syllable is the final syllable of a breath group, which are groups of accent phrases.|$|R
5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E

50|$|Ancient Greek pitch accent {{is placed}} on only one mora in a word. An acute (έ, ή) {{represents}} <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on the only mora of a short vowel or the last mora of a long vowel (é, eé). A circumflex (ῆ) represents <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on the first mora of a long vowel (ée).|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} days of Death, Schuldiner used death growls when {{performing}} vocals. As his career progressed, his vocals went up in pitch. By Death's final album, The Sound of Perseverance, he employed <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> screeching more similar to conventional screaming techniques. His vocal style is an influence to many death metal bands.|$|E

50|$|There is a pitch accent system. The {{accentuation}} {{of specific}} words varies somewhat from dialect to dialect. Generally, words including affixes have a <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on the stem, {{or on the}} first syllable if it is closed or has a diphthong, while other words have the <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on the second syllable, although there are exceptions to this generalization.|$|R
25|$|Diddy Dick and Dom are {{miniature}} {{versions of}} Dick and Dom, {{who live in}} the eponymous duo's cupboard.

They were portrayed by Dick and Dom with their real heads on puppet bodies, speaking <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> voices.|$|E
25|$|Mizrahi music usually {{refers to}} {{the new wave of}} music in Israel which {{combines}} Israeli music with the flavor of Arabic and Mediterranean (especially Greek) music.

Mizrahi music is usually <b>high</b> <b>pitched.</b> In today's Israeli music scene, Mizrahi music is very popular.|$|E
25|$|The Hunter is an agile foe {{that can}} jump and pounce on a survivor, and then tear at his victim {{until he is}} knocked off, kills his prey or is killed. A hunter emits animal like screeches or light roars when close by, and a snarling growl can be heard when in close proximity. The Hunter is {{signaled}} by a startling <b>high</b> <b>pitched</b> piano cue.|$|E
5000|$|In non-tonal languages, like English, {{intonation}} encompasses lexical stress. A stressed syllable will typically be pronounced with a <b>higher</b> <b>pitch,</b> intensity, {{and length}} than unstressed syllables. For example, {{in the word}} intensity, the vowel represented by the letter [...] is stressed, so it is longer and pronounced with a <b>higher</b> <b>pitch</b> and intensity than the other vowels.|$|R
50|$|The song of {{the male}} Pel's fishing owl is a deep, sonorous, horn-like boom, first a single and then a <b>higher</b> <b>pitched</b> huhuhu. The male also utters a ringed hoot, much <b>higher</b> <b>pitched</b> than those of most eagle-owls, {{followed}} by a deep, soft grunt: whoommmm-wot or hooomm-hut. The calls of the male are repeated ever 10 to 20 seconds can be heard from up to 3 km away. While singing, the male's throat and breast are often highly inflated. The female's songs are similar but are <b>higher</b> <b>pitched</b> and even in a double-note, i.e. hoot-oot. Females and young at the nest wail a shrill wheeoouu while anticipating food.|$|R

25|$|Intertwined {{with the}} Neapolitan style is the Roman style mandolin, which has {{influenced}} it. The Roman mandolin had a fingerboard {{that was more}} curved and narrow.
