40|$|Detta examensarbete har utförts i samarbete med Asko Appliances AB i syfte att förbättraenergieffektiviteten hos företagets torktumlare. För att utröna hur parametrarna last, trummansvarvtal samt valkhöjd påverkar energiförbrukningen hos en frånluftstorktumlare har 22 försökuppdelade i 3 olika försöksserier utförts. Varvtalet har varierats mellan 45 till 60 rpm ochbomullslaster från 2 till 8 kg har granskats. Valkhöjder av 30 till 90 mm har använts. För attanalysera resultaten från den första försöksserien har en statistisk modell använts. Dennamodell beskriver hur de olika parametrarna påverkar energieffektiviteten. Det har visats attlastens storlek följt av varvtalet har störst inverkan på torkningens energieffektivitet. Valkarnas höjd påverkade inte resultaten. I försöksserie två utreds vilket trumvarvtal som gerlägst energiförbrukning hos torktumlaren vid lasten 2 kg. Resultaten visar att varvtalet 55 rpmgav högst energieffektivitet. Om Asko Appliances skulle höja trumvarvtalet hos sinatorktumlare från dagens 52 rpm till 55 rpm skulle energieffektiviteten för små laster öka medungefär 4 %. I försöksserie tre har höga valkar (90 mm) jämförts med låga valkar (30 mm) vidtorkning av lasten 8 kg. De lägre valkarna uppvisade en något högre energieffektivitet vilketsannolikt beror på den något större trumvolymen som användandet av låga valkar medför. This student thesis {{has been}} made in {{cooperation}} with Asko Appliances AB. The aim is toreduce the energy consumption of the tumble dryers produced by the company. A totalnumber of 22 tests, divided into three series, have been carried out in an open cycle tumbledryer. Results from these tests were used for determining how the parameters drum speed, thecloths weight and the height of the drum paddles affects the energy efficiency of an opencycle tumble <b>dryer.</b> <b>Drum</b> speed has been varied from 45 to 60 rpm and weight load from 2 to 8 kg. Paddle heights between 30 and 90 mm have been used. To analyze the results from thefirst series a statistical model have been applied. This model describes how the differentparameters affect the energy efficiency of the dryer. It has been proven that the weight loadfollowed by the drum speed has the most significant impact on the energy efficiency of thetumble dryer. The height of the paddles did not affect the results. In the second test series theenergy efficiency is studied when the drum speed is varied. The weight load used was 2 kg. The results showed that a drum speed of 55 rpm gave the highest energy efficiency. If thedrum speed of Asko Appliances tumble dryers was to be increased from 52 to 55 rpm theenergy efficiency for small weights could be improved by 4 %. In the last test series paddleswith the heights 90 mm have been compared to 30 mm paddles. The weight load was 8 kg. Thesmall paddles showed slightly higher energy efficiency. This probably depends on theincreased drum volume due to the smaller paddles...|$|E

40|$|SummarySince {{early twentieth}} century, <b>drum</b> <b>dryer</b> {{was used to}} dry clothes, and soon became a glowing industry. A <b>drum</b> <b>dryer</b> is a {{household}} appliance {{that is used to}} remove moisture from a load of clothing and other textiles, generally At the beginning a simple electrical <b>drum</b> <b>dryer</b> was used, then different development has been made for meeting different needs and changing industrial environment, such as spin dryer, condenser dryer, heat pump dryer etc. The working mechanism of a <b>drum</b> <b>dryer</b> is that clothes is dried by heated air in a rotating drum: the heated air absorbs water evaporated from the wet clothes, so that the clothes is dried. The rotating drum is due to maintaining air space both between the load and between the loads and the drum surface. The way of how the air is heated and how the water is condensed is of interest. A heat pump dryer has the potential for energy saving and is good for environment. ASKO has developed to types of heat pump using different refrigerant: R 134 a and R 744. This project will focus on the application of a CO 2 (R 744) heat pump. A prototype has already been built, an assumption was made from former project that more cooling after compression for the refrigerant will be beneficial for increasing the energy efficiency of the whole system. So new external gas coolers will be installed and some optimization and analysis will be made for this project. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{drying process}} of FPH is usually {{accomplished}} by {{a limited number}} of drying apparatus: they are typically spray dryers which provide convectional drying, and vacuum freeze <b>dryers</b> and roller <b>drum</b> <b>dryers</b> which utilize contact heat supply. From the experience, the authors suggest convection spray dryers as the most used drying systems at large scale in FPH production due to a satisfactory productivity, reasonable quality of the final FPH and a relative easiness of operation. The term “spray dryer” is used in this article to describe convectional spray dryers; the authors do not devote the work to spray drying using radiation or mixed heat transfer.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{problem of}} the {{research}} derives {{from a lack of}} study and understanding about the production of condiment Isan food and ingredients being introduced into commercial, even though Isan food is popular among consumers widespread {{both inside and outside the}} country. The government introduced a policy to expand trade to create an export value of Isan products. The purpose of the research is to study the local wisdom in the field of the application of the ingredients used in Isan food. In addition, the purpose is to study about the problems of applying local wisdom to produce Isan food for consumption into commercial. Approach: The fields of study are Kalasin, Khon kaen, Maha Sarakham and Roi-Et. These are the places of Isan food local culture and original application of Isan food that have been producing to the present and also popular among the consumers widespread. There are 5 types of food that are chosen to be the proposition; Kaeng Wai (Curry Wai), Kai Yang (Roasting chicken), Tom Kai Ban (Boiled chicken), Mok Lab Pla Thong (Grilled Lab Pla Thong) and Om Pla (Fish soup) from 9 restaurants. Using Qualitative Research for data gathering from the concerning document, the data will be collected from fieldwork, survey, observation, interviews and focus group discussion from a group of totally 71 informants, presenting the result by using analytical descriptive. Results: The local wisdom of application of Isan food ingredients is a herb that is easy to find in the local area. It is used for the deodorizing of meat and as a garnish to give taste and flavor to the consumer. Isan food is highlighted as spicy and salty. A Spicy taste is from hot chili and dried chili. A Salty taste can be regarded as an important deliciousness that is an identity of Isan food from pickled fish and salt. A Sour test derives from tamarinds. Ya Nang (Tiliacora triandra) is used in order to reduce uric acid of Wai (Calamus caesius Blume). Adding ginger, Kha (Languas galangal) and Lemon Grass to the main ingredients in order to be spicy and increase fragrance. Instant ingredients are used to highlight the taste and fragrance to enhance the flavor. Moreover, all herbs and vegetables that are used are good for our health. Following the local wisdom for the production of condiment Isan food ingredient is the production of day by day by estimating the quantity of using per day and using in a day in order to be fresh. The product is prepared by washing with water and cutting unnecessary parts away, using an easy kitchen application for production. The problem of using the application of local wisdom for production of condiment Isan food ingredient is the lack of available product and it is quite expensive in some seasons. Problems are encountered with low quality products, rear of labor and long period of times to produce and keep the product. Applying the application of local wisdom for production of condiment Isan food ingredient into commercial, fresh product is chosen and washed with water and unnecessary parts are cut away by using simple kitchen application in order to prepare the product. A drying technique is used by using a heated air <b>dryer,</b> <b>drum</b> dryer and freeze dryer. The research attempts to find out the result of the test by using the senses of evaluation, smell, color and taste of the food. The packaging and ticketing of the product is also important to show the ingredients, condiment, proportion and guidance of how to store the product. Conclusion/Recommendation: Applying the application of local wisdom for production of condiment Isan food ingredient into commercial is the way of using basic local wisdom in order to apply and develop the product by integrating between original production and modern technology. Both two ways can control the temperature and moisture in order to gain the most resemble of the original product. In addition, it is easy to keep in some difficult seasons, saves time and natural resources; it is easy to cook and has the prospect of being developed into industry to import and export. It is the way to bring income into the country, including enabling Isan food and culture to be recognized worldwide...|$|E

40|$|Closed-loop drying {{systems are}} an {{attractive}} alternative to conventional drying systems {{because they provide}} {{a wide range of}} potential advantages. Consequently, type of drying process is attracting increased interest. Rotary drying of wood particles can be assumed as an incorporated process involving fluid-solid interactions and simultaneous heat and mass transfer within and between the particles. Understanding these mechanisms during rotary drying processes may result in determination of the optimum drying parameters and improved dryer design. In this study, due to the complexity and nonlinearity of the momentum, heat, and mass transfer equations, a computerized mathematical model of a closed-loop triple-pass concurrent rotary dryer was developed to simulate the drying behavior of poplar wood particles within the <b>dryer</b> <b>drums.</b> Wood particle moisture content and temperature, drying air temperature, and drying air humidity ratio along the drums lengths can be simulated using this model. The model presented in this work has been shown to successfully predict the steady-state behavior of a concurrent rotary dryer and can be used to analyze the effects of various drying process parameters on the performance of the closed-loop triple-pass rotary dryer to determine the optimum drying parameters. The model was also used to simulate the performance of industrial closed-loop rotary dryers under various operating conditions...|$|R

Appropriate ranges of parameters such as steam jet temperature and velocity were examined experimentally to quantify the optimal operating conditions for the formation of black liquor film on the drum surface as well as the drying kinetics. To permit scale up of the laboratory scale data to industrial size a two-region mathematical model was developed to simulate the impinging jet flow and the drying of the black liquor film. Both polar and three dimensional cylindrical coordinate systems were employed for solving the governing transport equations. A modified low Reynolds number version of the $k sim varepsilon$ turbulence model was selected after a careful evaluation of the predictions of various $k sim varepsilon$ models for impingement flow and heat transfer. The computed heat transfer distribution on the film surface was applied as the boundary condition for the quasi unsteady one-dimensional diffusion model for the liquor film.
