5|$|The <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> the {{new line}} {{was not yet}} determined, {{although}} the estimates had been prepared {{on the basis that}} it would not exceed 6feet. Many of Grainger and Miller's lines had been to a <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> 4ft6in; the Dundee and Newtyle Railway (1831) had been at 4ft6½in (1,384mm) and the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, authorised in 1836, was to be 5ft6in (1,676mm). Connections to local railways were considered important in determining the gauge, but the engineer Joseph Locke urged that conformity to the <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> the English railways was important, and in the end this was adopted: standard gauge, 4ft8½in (1,435mm).|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the 1966 smog, air quality {{measurements}} were recorded from only a single station, the Harlem Courthouse building on East 121st Street, run by Braverman and his staff of 15. Taking measurements from a single station meant that the index reflected conditions in that small area, but served as a poor, unrepresentative <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> overall air quality across the entire city. The Interstate Sanitation Commission, a regional agency run by New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut and headquartered at Columbus Circle, also relied on the Harlem Courthouse laboratory. Formed in 1936, the advisory agency was authorized in 1962 by New York and New Jersey to oversee air pollution issues.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 1847 {{the company}} {{acquired}} {{control of the}} Paisley and Renfrew Railway under the Paisley & Renfrew Railway Sale and Improvement Act. ,. The purchase had earlier been agreed by the proposed Paisley, Barrhead and Hurlet Railway, supported by the GPK, for £34,000. It was horse-operated and had a track <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> 4ft4in (1,321mm). The line was loss-making and had no practical value other than the tactical one of securing territory against competing companies. The Paisley Barrhead and Hurlet Bill failed in the 1847 session of Parliament and was re-presented in 1848; the share capital proposed had risen to £230,000; during the Lords' hearings it became plain that running powers {{were likely to be}} granted to the Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, an offshoot of the Caledonian Railway. The GPK had subscribed to £150,000 in face value of the shares of this proposed line, with the sole intention of excluding the Caledonian Railway from the area. The GPK now petitioned against the Bill, but this was unsuccessful, and it received the Royal Assent, with the running powers clause, on 31 August 1848.|$|E

25|$|The SMJR built a {{line from}} Perth to Forfar; at Perth it used the Scottish Central Railway joint station. The main line ran through the fertile area of Strathmore and the SMJR adopted two {{existing}} short lines that were on a suitable alignment. They were the Newtyle and Coupar Angus Railway and the Newtyle and Glammiss Railway. (Glammiss is spelt Glamis nowadays.) Both were unsuccessful adjuncts to the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, built using stone block sleepers and a track <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> 4ft6.5in (1,384mm). The two short lines were modernised and altered to double track using standard gauge. At Forfar the SMJR joined the Arbroath and Forfar Railway, another earlier stone block railway, in this case using the track <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> 5ft6in (1,384mm). The SMJR opened in 1848.|$|E

25|$|The South Wales Railway {{had been}} {{constructed}} {{on the broad}} gauge, and it was assumed at first that the line from Monmouth would join it at Chepstow, and also be constructed on that gauge. The Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway {{was built on the}} narrow gauge (as standard gauge was then known), but interchange with that line was not considered important. Nevertheless, national government had taken an interest in the <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> new and existing railways, and a Gauge Commission had been appointed to recommend policy. This recommended that no new lines should be built on the broad gauge, except for certain designated extensions to the existing broad gauge network. This resulted in the Railway Regulation (Gauge) Act 1846, which mandated that recommendation. The intended <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> the Wye Valley Railway was changed to narrow gauge, no doubt recognising the reality that the South Wales Railway itself would eventually be converted.|$|E
