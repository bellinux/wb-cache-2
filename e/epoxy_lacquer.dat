Onto this a metallic conductive silver <b>epoxy</b> <b>lacquer</b> is applied. The graphite layer also prevents a direct contact between manganese dioxide and silver. Direct contact between these two materials forces a chemical reaction which oxidizes the silver and reduces manganese dioxide into high resistive manganese (III) oxide resulting in increasing ESR of the capacitor. This silver layer now can be contacted with the cathode terminal of the capacitor.|$|E

THE LACQUERING OF TINPLATE, THE CAN MANUFACTURING AND THE FOOD CANNING WERE MADE UNDER INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS. IN THE RESEARCH OF TINPLATE CORROSION FROM AGGRESSIVE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS TOMATO PASTE, THREE TYPES OF ORGANIC COATINGS WERE TRIED (AN EPOXYPHENOLIC, A POLYESTER AND A MODIFIED <b>EPOXY</b> <b>LACQUER).</b> FROM THE TESTS, FOR TOMATO PASTE AND CONDENSED MILK CANS, THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS WERE EXTRACTED: - CANS COATED WITH A SINGLE LAYER OF EPOXYPHENOLIC OR POLYESTER LACQUER ARE UNSUITABLE FOR THE PACKAGING OF VERY AGGRESSIVE PRODUCTS. - THE NEW MODIFIED <b>EPOXY</b> <b>LACQUER</b> GAVE THE BEST RESULTS FROM ALL THE LACQUERS THAT WERE TESTED (LONGER SHELF LIFE, BETTER APPEARANCE). FOR THE CONDENSED MILK CANS, THE PROBLEM OF SULPHIDE STAINING IS AN AESTHETIC THAN A HARMFUL HEALTH PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM OF SULPHIDE STAINING WAS SOLVED WITH USING LACQUERED CANS. ...|$|E

40|$|Resumo: Este estudo teve por objetivo avaliar diferentes especificações de envernizamento interno do corpo e da costura lateral de latas de folha-de-flandres de três peças, formadas por eletrossolda, no acondicionamento de suco de maracujá pronto para beber, por meio de teste de estocagem e avaliação do desempenho em relação à interação embalagem/alimento. Durante o estudo foram avaliados três sistemas de revestimento orgânico interno da embalagem, sendo o primeiro composto de verniz epóxi-fenólico líquido aplicado na folha plana e verniz epóxi-vinílico-acrilado líquido aplicado na região da solda; o segundo um verniz epóxi-fenólico líquido aplicado na folha plana, verniz epóxi-vinílico-acrilado líquido aplicado na solda e uma segunda camada de verniz epóxi modificado líquido, aplicado por spray após a formação da lata e o terceiro um verniz líquido epóxi-fenólico aplicado na folha plana e verniz poliéster em pó aplicado na solda, denominados latas Normal, Repair e Pó, respectivamente. As embalagens foram caracterizadas quanto ao tipo de {{material}} metálico (espessura, dureza e camadas de estanho e cromo), avaliação do fechamento (recravação), atendimento aos requisitos de embalagens para contato com alimentos previstos pela Legislação Brasileira e pelo MERCOSUL e caracterização dos revestimentos orgânicos do corpo, tampa, fundo e side stripe, em relação à camada seca, identificação, aderência, porosidade e grau de cura. O teste de estocagem foi realizado pelo período de 6 meses em duas condições de temperatura controlada, 25 oC ± 2 °C e 35 oC ± 3 oC, com avaliações periódicas a intervalos de 15 dias no primeiro mês, 30 dias no segundo mês e de 60 dias até completar 180 dias de estocagem. Os parâmetros de avaliação periódica foram aparência visual interna das latas, nível de vácuo, composição de gases (O 2, N 2, CO 2 e H 2) no espaço-livre da embalagem, avaliação sensorial, avaliação instrumental de cor, pH, acidez, estimativa dos sólidos solúveis (°Brix), concentração de ferro, estanho e cromo no suco de maracujá e conteúdo de vitamina C, sendo que este último foi determinado apenas ao zero dia, 15 e 180 dias de estocagem. Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate different specifications of welded three piece tinplate cans with respect to the internal body passion fruit juice. The evaluation was by a storage test, evaluating the performance relative to food/packaging interaction. Three systems of internal organic coatings of the cans were analyzed. The first was composed of a liquid epoxy-phenolic lacquer applied to the flat tinplate and liquid epoxyvinillic-acrylate lacquer applied to the side stripe. The second type was a liquid epoxyphenolic lacquer applied to the flat tinplate and a liquid epoxy-vinillic-acrylate lacquer applied to the side stripe and a second layer of liquid modified <b>epoxy</b> <b>lacquer,</b> applied by spraying after the formation of the can. The third type was a liquid epoxy-phenolic lacquer applied to the flat tinplate and a powdered polyester lacquer applied to the side stripe. The systems were denominated Normal, Repair and Pó, respectively. The cans were characterized according to the type of metallic material (thickness, hardness and tin and chromium layers), evaluation of the double seams, approval for contact with foodstuffs in accordance with the procedures and rules of the Brazilian and MERCOSUR Legislation and evaluation of the organic coatings of the body, bottom, end and side stripe, in relation to the internal lacquer weight, porosity, identification, adherence and curing degree. The storage test was conducted during a period of 6 months under two conditions of controlled temperature, 25 °C ± 2 °C and 35 °C ± 3 °C, with evaluations at intervals of 15 days during the first month, 30 days up to the second month and then every 60 days to complete 180 days of storage. The parameters included in the evaluations were visual internal appearance of the cans, vacuum level, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen composition of the cans headspace, sensorial analysis, instrumental evaluation of color, pH, total titratable acidity, soluble solids (°Brix), iron, tin and chromium concentration in the passion fruit juice and ascorbic acid content (vitamin C), which was only determined at zero day and after 15 and 180 days of storage. The results showed that all cans presented no restriction for use in contact with aqueous acid foodstuffs (pH < 5; 0) at processing temperatures of up to 100 ºC, followed by prolonged use at temperatures of up to 40 ºC. The results for vacuum level, pH, acidity and soluble solids in the juice remarried stable at the two temperatures throughout storage. In the same period at both temperatures, there was a decrease in vitamin content and a slight darkening of the juice. The alterations observed in the visual internal evaluation and the increase in hydrogen concentration in the can headspace and iron and tin concentrations in the juice, demonstrated the beginning of internal can corrosion. The sensorial evaluation demonstrated a loss of quality of the juice packed in the three cans, mainly in the cans stored at 35 °C, but all juices maintained acceptable quality up to the 180 th day of storage. The storage test showed that the three kinds of cans presented good performance for the packaging of passion fruit juice and that the sample with powdered lacquer on the side stripe presented a worse performance than the other two systems studied, due to the smaller protection offered by the lacquer applied to the body. The study allowed for the conclusion that the three packages studied could be used in the packaging of passion fruit juice with a shelf life of up to 6 months...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} impact of {{different}} semi-solid dosage form components on the leaching of Bisphenol A (BPA) and Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) from the <b>epoxy</b> resin-based inner <b>lacquer</b> of aluminium tubes, the tubes were filled with different matrix preparations and stored at an elevated temperature. Despite compliance with the European Standards EN 15348 and EN 15766 on porosity and polymerisation of internal coatings of aluminium tubes, the commercially available tubes {{used in the study}} contained an increased amount of polymerisation residues, such as unbound BPA, BADGE and BADGE derivatives in the lacquer, as determined by acetonitrile extraction. Storage of Macrogol ointments in these tubes resulted in an almost quantitative migration of the unbound polymerisation residues from the coating into the ointment. In addition, due to alterations observed in the RP-HPLC chromatograms of the matrix spiked with BADGE and BADGE derivatives it is supposed that the leachates can react with formulation components. The contamination of the medicinal product by BPA, BADGE and BADGE derivatives can be precluded by using aluminium tubes with an internal lacquer with a low degree of unbound polymerisation residues...|$|R
40|$|This {{project has}} in two stages {{explored}} the possibilities and potential {{for improving the}} mechanical properties of the laminated paper material created with Mcor Technologies 3 D printer IRIS. The first stage explored the effects of coating, soaking or vacuum infusing five hardening agents wood glue, diluted wood glue, urethane wood <b>lacquer,</b> <b>epoxy</b> wood finish, and lamination epoxy on specimens of the material, whose strong and weak axis were afterwards tested with three-point bending tests. Except for the lamination epoxy, none of the agents responded well to the infusion or improved the material s properties particularly {{with any of the}} treatments. The lamination epoxy however, did, and was therefore investigated further with a second series of eight 2 by 2 cm specimens that were longer than the first, to provide more reliable results from the bending test. The measurements were compared to theoretical specimens of pure epoxy and aluminium, whose corresponding bending stiffness and strength was calculated using classic beam theory. Infused and heat treated, the composite paper laminate was stiffer than the theoretical aluminium in both orientations, twice so if accounting for the difference in density, and over two thirds as strong compared to its weight.

40|$|National audienceThe 2, 2 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) propane or {{bisphenol}} A is a xenobiotic {{commonly used}} as a monomer {{in the manufacture of}} polycarbonate plastics (DVD, building materials) and <b>epoxy</b> resins (surface <b>lacquer</b> for cans and tin cans). Despite its endocrine disrupting potential, and its high media coverage because of baby bottles made with bisphenol A, few data are available on environmental matrices and more particularly in France. In this context, levels of bisphenol A found in urban and surface waters were assessed by the Leesu laboratory, {{as a part of the}} Piren-Seine and Opur research programs. The first results, on dissolved phases, reveal concentrations ranging from 562 to 2, 100 ng/L in wastewater (n = 5) and combined sewer overflows (n = 8) and from 19 to 157 ng/L in wastewater treatment plant effluents (n = 19). Furthermore, an increase of concentration was observed in the Seine River (n = 33) from upstream sites (18 ng/L) to downstream sites (40 and 62 ng/L). At last, an estimated annual mass balance of bisphenol A was established between loads annually discharged by the wastewater treatment plants and combined sewer overflows, on the one hand, and the annual exported load by the Seine River downstream of the Parisian conurbation, on the other hand. The first estimations highlight that urban sources linked to sanitation only account, at the annually scale, for 12 % of Seine River contamination...|$|R
