5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. <b>Garlic</b> <b>is</b> a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, and <b>garlic</b> <b>is</b> {{caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. <b>Garlic</b> <b>is</b> said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E

25|$|There are {{different}} varieties or subspecies of garlic, most notably hardneck garlic and softneck garlic. The latitude where the <b>garlic</b> <b>is</b> grown affects {{the choice of}} type, as garlic can be day-length sensitive. Hardneck <b>garlic</b> <b>is</b> generally grown in cooler climates and produces relatively large cloves, whereas softneck <b>garlic</b> <b>is</b> generally grown closer to the equator and produces small, tightly-packed cloves.|$|E

25|$|<b>Garlic</b> plants <b>are</b> usually {{hardy and}} not {{affected}} by many pests or diseases. <b>Garlic</b> plants <b>are</b> said to repel rabbits and moles. However, pathogens that affect <b>garlic</b> <b>are</b> nematodes and wood-decay fungus, which remain in the soil indefinitely after the ground has become infected. Garlic may also suffer from pink root, a typically non-fatal disease that stunts the roots and turns them pink or red, leek rot or downy mildew.|$|R
25|$|<b>Garlic</b> <b>was</b> rare in {{traditional}} English cuisine (though {{it is said}} to have been grown in England before 1548) and has been a much more common ingredient in Mediterranean Europe.

25|$|<b>Garlic</b> <b>is</b> easy to {{grow and}} can be grown year-round in mild climates. While sexual {{propagation}} of <b>garlic</b> <b>is</b> possible, {{nearly all of the}} garlic in cultivation is propagated asexually, by planting individual cloves in the ground. In colder climates, cloves are planted in the autumn, about six weeks before the soil freezes, and harvested in late spring or early summer. The cloves must be planted deep enough to prevent freeze/thaw, which causes mold or white rot.|$|E

40|$|The {{deodorizing}} {{activity of}} dokudami (Houttuyniacordata Thunb.) for masking {{the odor of}} fresh <b>garlic</b> <b>was</b> investigated, and the volatility of the deodorizing compounds was examined. Two grams of <b>garlic</b> <b>was</b> placed in a beaker and heated for 5 min at 40 °C. Next, aliquots of 0. 01 and 0. 05 g of powdered samples of seven plants (dokudami, thyme, rosemary, coriander, dandelion, spiny sow thistle and green tea) were mixed with 1 ml of volatile or non-volatile dokudami extract and added to the garlic sample. The <b>garlic</b> odor intensity <b>was</b> subsequently evaluated by sniffing by 10 trained individuals. The deodorizing activity test was carried out at 0, 3 and 6 h after adding the dokudami extract. The deodorizing effect of dokudami on masking <b>garlic</b> odor <b>was</b> the highest of any plant and became higher with increased dose. In addition, the deodorizing activity of dokudami increased with time and persisted. Moreover, whether the deodorizing compounds of dokudami were volatile or non-volatile was investigated. The deodorizing activity of a volatile solution of dokudami against <b>garlic</b> <b>was</b> extremely {{higher than that of}} dokudami dry powder. Our findings revealed that the deodorizing compound of dokudami is volatile. </p...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{its effects}} similar to nitric oxide (without its {{potential}} to form peroxides by interacting with superoxide), hydrogen sulfide is now recognized as potentially protecting against cardiovascular disease.

40|$|When <b>garlic</b> (Allium sativum) <b>was</b> {{administered}} to rat per os simultaneously with cadmium, methylmercury and phenylmercury {{to detect the}} protective effect against the heavy metal poisoning, accumulation of heavy metals in liver, kidneys, bone and testes were decreased, and histopathological damages and the inhibition of serum alkaline phosphatase activities by heavy metals were reduced. Such effect of <b>garlic</b> <b>was</b> not shown in the 1. 7 % garlic treated group and most remarkable in the 6. 7 % garlic treated group. The protective effect of <b>garlic</b> <b>was</b> superior to those of 2, 3 dimercapto- 1 -propanol (BAL) and D-penicillamine (PEN), and nearly {{similar to those of}} 2, 3 -dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (APEN), the current remedies, while <b>garlic</b> <b>was</b> not effective as a curative agent for heavy metal poisoning. The excretion of cadmium was enhanced, more through feces than urine by garlic but the effect to the urinary excretion of cadmium was not significant comparing with DMSA or APEN when cadmium was ip injected in the first 3 days during the 12 days of oral administration of DMSA, APEN or garlic...|$|R
25|$|<b>Garlic</b> <b>is</b> often kept in oil {{to produce}} flavored oil; however, the {{practice}} requires measures {{to be taken}} to prevent the garlic from spoiling which may include rancidity and growth of Clostridium botulinum. Acidification with a mild solution of vinegar minimizes bacterial growth. Refrigeration does not assure the safety of garlic kept in oil, requiring use within one month to avoid bacterial spoilage.|$|E
