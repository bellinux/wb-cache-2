5|$|While {{the striped}} honeyeater aggressively defends its nest by dive-bombing people and animals who come too close, {{and has been}} {{observed}} singing from display perches, {{it is not known}} to be territorial. <b>It</b> <b>often</b> feeds near other species of honeyeater and no inter-species aggression has been noted.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, small {{patches of}} pure water ice with an albedo {{as high as}} 80% are found {{on the surface of}} Callisto, surrounded by much darker material. High-resolution Galileo images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: crater rims, scarps, ridges and knobs. They are likely to be thin water frost deposits. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. <b>It</b> <b>often</b> forms patches up to 5km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.|$|E

5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues (or R) was a musical {{movement}} that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s. It overlapped with, but was distinct from, the broader British beat and more purist British blues scenes, attempting to emulate the music of African American blues and rock and roll pioneers, such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. <b>It</b> <b>often</b> placed greater emphasis on guitars and was often played with greater energy.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. <b>It</b> <b>often</b> {{is described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist. However, bupropion {{does not appear to have}} significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances. Chemically, bupropion belongs to the class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants such as cathinone and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.|$|E

5|$|Cerium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ce and atomic number 58. Cerium is a soft, ductile and silvery-white metal that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while <b>it</b> <b>often</b> shows the +3 oxidation state characteristic of the series, it also exceptionally has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also traditionally {{considered one of the}} rare-earth elements. Cerium has no biological role and is not very toxic.|$|E
5|$|Common {{and often}} basic {{ingredients}} in many modern European cuisines like potatoes, kidney beans, cacao, vanilla, tomatoes, chili peppers and maize {{were not available}} to Europeans until after 1492, after European contact with the Americas, and even then <b>it</b> <b>often</b> took considerable time, sometimes several centuries, for the new foodstuffs {{to be accepted by}} society at large.|$|E
5|$|Due to this <b>it</b> <b>often</b> suffices to find {{representations}} of the Lie algebra. Lie algebras are much simpler objects than Lie groups to work with. Due {{to the fact that}} the Lie algebra is a finite-dimensional vector space, in the case of the Lorentz Lie algebra the dimension is , one need only find a finite number of representative matrices of the Lie algebra, one for each element of a basis of the Lie algebra as a vector space. The rest follow from extension by linearity, and the representation of the group is obtained by exponentiation.|$|E

5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. <b>It</b> <b>often</b> occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E
5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (<b>it</b> <b>often</b> takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, <b>it</b> <b>often</b> leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E
