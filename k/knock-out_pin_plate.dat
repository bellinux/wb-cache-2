5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ejector <b>pin</b> <b>plate,</b> which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector <b>pin</b> <b>plate</b> also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|R

Effect of {{different}} gauge of <b>pin</b> carding <b>plate</b> and saw-tooth carding plate respectively installed under the licker-in of carding machine on polyester yarn hairiness was studied. The hairiness of polyester yarns {{produced in the}} condition of installing <b>pin</b> carding <b>plate</b> and saw-tooth carding plate under the licker-in at four different gauges were tested by YG 172 yarn hairiness tester.

When the <b>pin</b> carding <b>plate</b> gauge is 1. 0 mm and the saw-tooth carding plate gauge is 0. 3 mm, the number of polyester yarn hairiness is the most.

Analytical expressions for the photonic superprism parameters p, q and r, which are measures for dispersion inside the crystal, are also derived for the <b>pinned</b> <b>plate</b> problem here. We demonstrate the existence of negative refraction, beam splitting, Rayleigh anomalies, internal reflection, and near-trapping on the first band surface, giving examples for each of these behaviours...|$|R
