40|$|In the {{hypersonic}} regime scramjet engines offer a {{great potential}} for future propulsion systems of space transportation applications. The intake of a scramjet engine compresses the incoming air for an efficient combustion cycle while aiming to produce minimum drag and heat load. One feature of the scramjet intake’s flow field is the shock wave/boundary layer interaction (SWBLI) which causes high peak heat loads and affects the direction {{as well as the}} load of the aerodynamic force. The interaction occurs e. g. at compression corners and locations of shock wave impingement on boundary layers. The corresponding shock wave is generated due to flow deflection e. g. at the intake cowl. As space launcher propulsion device, the scramjet accelerates the launcher and with it increases its velocity and flight altitude. This affects the flow similarity parameters like Reynolds number, Mach number and total temperature all affecting the SWBLI so that the interaction changes during flight. The current understanding of SWBLIs allows the prediction of the aerodynamics and the heat load of a scramjet intake flow field with occurring SWBLI, if the size of the interaction is known. Since this size could so far not be estimated and varies during flight of a space launcher, the aim {{of this study was to}} provide a correlation for the separation size and to describe the variation of this size for the different flow similarity parameters. The approach of this study employed experimental testing as well as numerical simulations whereby the latter utilized the performed experiments during this study as well as experiments conducted by other investigators. Through such additional test cases, the number of covered similarity parameters could be increased so that the experiments and numerical simulations provided a good validation data base for the developed analytically based model of the SWBLI size. The hypersonic shock tunnel TH 2 produced the desired hypersonic free stream conditions at different total temperatures to test the employed models which were a double ramp configuration and a scramjet intake. Both permitted the investigation of different leading edge radii and of different wall temperatures which were provided by the installed electric heating. The double ramp configuration was a redesign of a previous model and addressed two-dimensional SWBLIs in the midspan of the model. To study three-dimensional effects on the SWBLIs and their influence on the scramjet intake’s flow field, at first the scramjet intake model had to be developed. This development included the improvement of the model heating technique which allowed wall pressure measurements during experiments with wall temperatures up to 1000 K. Regarding the model heating technique, two constraints had to be considered. First, for wall pressure measurements the employed transducers had to be placed as close as possible to the heated model surface. This placement ensured short transducer response times which were required because in the short measurement times of the shock tunnel. Second, because the transducers could not sustain the high experimental wall temperatures, the transducers had to be cooled. This cooling being concurrent with the wall heating restricted the maximum achievable wall temperature due to the short distance between the heated wall and the cooled transducers. Concluding, the maximum wall temperature was increased from 760 K for the double ramp experiments to 1000 K for the scramjet intake experiments. This was achieved due to increased heating power and an enhanced thermal insulation. The enhanced thermal insulation was the outcome of the developed sandwich construction resulting in maximum temperature gradients of 875 K/cm within the model. To observe the effect of the different flow similarity parameters on the flow field and with it on the aerodynamics and the heat load, different measurement techniques were employed: • wall pressure measurements,• heat flux measurements,• black-and-white schlieren images,• colour schlieren images and• infrared images. The potential of the black-and-white schlieren image technique for quantitative measurements was investigated and demonstrated its {{great potential for}} planar flows. The gained understanding permitted a more detailed interpretation of the schlieren image and thereby of the flow field. Moreover, this knowledge was used to increase the image quality by adaption of the optical setup and the <b>digital</b> <b>display</b> <b>range</b> thus making the invisible visible. The numerical simulations were conducted with the commercial code CFX which was validated for hypersonic flows by comparisons with analytical solutions and empirical correlations for various hypersonic flow phenomena. For this validation and the investigated SWBLI, grid convergence studies were performed to ensure grid independency. The SWBLI simulations were conducted with laminar, transitional and turbulent shear layer behaviour so that the experimental and numerical data set covered following influences on the SWBLI:• Reynolds number,• Mach number,• total temperature,• boundary layer state (laminar, transitional, turbulent),• wall temperature,• leading edge bluntness,• side flow and,• side wall installation. To describe the extent of the SWBLI, an analytically based model of the SWBLI was developed based on the momentum equation and employing several simplifications. The model explains the effects of the different flow similarity parameters on the SWBLI and was compared to the numerical simulations increasing the model’s accuracy. The pressure rise which is necessary to cause incipient separation, was considered in the model. This incipient separation pressure rise had already been correlated by different authors giving deviating results for a wide Mach number range and other flow similarity parameters so that a new correlation was developed. This correlation is the same as for the SWBLI model based on physical reasoning thus allows a more detailed understanding of the incipient separation process. The conducted experiments with the double ramp model and the employed experiments of other researchers addressed SWBLIs which were deemed to be two-dimensional in the midspan of the wind tunnel models. For laminar SWBLIs the increase of separation size with increasing Reynolds number, decreasing Mach number and decreasing total temperature were proven with the analytically based model. The influence of the shear layer state on the SWBLI is to decrease the separation size from laminar to turbulent shear layer behaviour whereby transitional interactions represent the separation sizes between the limiting laminar and turbulent cases. If the transition is completed more rapidly, the separation size is decreased due to the increased shear forces within a turbulent shear layer. Besides this effect on the separation size, the effects of elevated wall temperature increasing the separation size on the one hand and of increased leading edge radius on the other hand were investigated with the double ramp model. An increased leading edge radius enlarges the separation size for small leading edge radii and decreases the separation size for leading edge radii being larger than a critical radius. It was observed that this reversal trend of the separation size for increasing leading edge radius is the result of the entropy layer swallowing phenomenon. Since leading edge bluntness provokes the entropy layer, it also defines the position of entropy layer swallowing in downstream direction. Due to the fact that entropy layer swallowing at the separation of SWBLI causes the largest SWBLI, the corresponding leading edge radius is the critical one. All mentioned influences on the SWBLI were analysed based on physical reasoning with the developed analytically based model. The prediction of the separation length with the analytically based model showed good agreement with the experimental and numerical results whereby some limitations remain. The experiments conducted with the scramjet intake model focused mainly on the SWBLI at the kink of the compression ramps including three-dimensional effects. The flow field with omitted side walls showed clearly the effect of side flow leading to a smaller separation length of the SWBLI compared to the numerical simulation of the two-dimensional flow field. The observations concerning the side wall installation indicated a complex three-dimensional flow field with the separation and the reattachment line having a tongue shape compared to the almost straight line in the two-dimensional case. The corner flow between the side walls and the compression ramp geometry increased the heat load of the first ramp locally, but the heat load in the midspan part of the first compression ramp was decreased due to the prevented side flow. For the experiments with installed side walls the pressure level of the second ramp was increased significantly compared to the inviscid two-dimensional solution. This was due to the prevented spillage flow and the additional compression due to the corner flow and the boundary layers on the side walls. The SWBLI size for omitted and installed side walls increased for increasing wall temperature and for decreasing total temperature. The obtained results indicate clearly the importance to reproduce all flow similarity parameters of a scramjet intake flow field being Mach number, Reynolds number, total temperature, wall temperature and the boundary layer state. For future designs the decision to employ side walls for the outer compression will be a compromise between the spilled mass flow reducing the maximum thrust as well as the increased drag and heat load due to side wall installation. The side wall installation provokes additional shock waves and side wall boundary layers which causes drag and heat load increase. The investigation of the intake shoulder flow with omitted cowl by schlieren optical and numerical means indicated that the expansion at the shoulder reduced the turbulence significantly, which was generated by the SWBLI at the compression kink. Further downstream of the intake’s shoulder, boundary layer transition took place as observed by the schlieren images, thereby indicating a very fragile state of this new boundary layer developing from the shoulder. Since the boundary layer state has a large influence on the extent of the SWBLI, this observation represents a useful baseline information for the investigation of the interaction between this boundary layer and the impinging cowl shock. To round off this thesis with respect to the research training group supporting this research, the gained understanding of scramjet intake flows has been included in a new concept engine. Due to the stacking of several engine modules next to each other only the outer modules are affected by side flow, whereby the investigated scramjet intake represents the width of one module. To prevent this side flow, which reduces the captured mass flow and with it the thrust of the engine, the compression ramps’ width increases in upstream direction. This design feature avoids additional heat loads caused by corner flow and drag due to side wall installation so that such concept engine with enhancements of other engine parts has been determined to produce net thrust...|$|E
