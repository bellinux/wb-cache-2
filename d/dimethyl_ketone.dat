The Moller-Plesset method with 6 - 311 G(d,p) basis set {{has been used in}} the geometry optimization and the frequency calculation for all the species involved in the reactions, as well as the hindrance potential description for reactants and transition states. Intrinsic reaction co-ordinate calculations were carried out to validate all the connections between transition states and local minima. Energies are reported at the CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ//MP 2 / 6 - 311 G(d,p) level of theory. The CCSD(T) /cc-pVXZ method (X = D, T, Q) was used for the reaction mechanism of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ketone</b> + HO 2 radical in order to benchmark the computationally less expensive method of CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ//MP 2 / 6 - 311 G(d,p).

40|$|Vitamin K-dependent {{carboxylase}} from bovine liver is stimulated {{not only}} by reducing agents and bivalent metal ions (especially Mn 2 +), but also by several organic solvents (<b>dimethyl</b> sulphoxide, <b>ketones</b> and acetonitrile). The organic solvents stimulated both the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues {{and the formation of}} vitamin K epoxide. This stimulation by organic solvents was independent of the physical state of the phospholipid; it was highest at low temperatures and could only be demonstrated with vitamin K 1 and not with 3 -DTT-MK-O (the thioether adduct of menadione and dithiothreitol) or t-butyl hydroperoxide, which normally can substitute for vitamin K. We suggest that organic solvents exert their effect by changing the mobility of the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K 1 within the carboxylase complex...|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{is highly}} toxic but often {{neglected}} element that is readily emitted {{into the environment}} via a number of industrial processes. In Australia, coal-fired power plants and the alumina industry are the two largest emitters of mercury. In {{order to maintain the}} alumina industry’s commitment to reduce the environmental impact of its processes and remain economically sustainable, innovative technologies are required that can monitor mercury concentrations within its processes. The aim of this research project was to develop robust quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based sensors for measuring Hg vapour levels in challenging industrial environments, such as those found in the alumina industry (i. e. Hg concentrations of 1 - 40 mg/m 3 at 20 - 90 °C). In order to gain a deeper understanding of Hg vapour interactions with the surface of the QCM electrodes, parameters such as Hg sorption and desorption rates, sticking probability and Hg diffusion were studied in detail. When Hg diffusion in ultra-thin films of Au was studied, it was observed that Hg accumulation occurred at the interface between the Au sensitive and SiO 2 layers. These observations lead to the exploration of two different electrochemical methods for the direct formation of Hg selective and sensitive nanostructured Au films directly on QCM crystals. In the first case, galvanic replacement (GR) reactions were employed to form Ni-Au hybrid nanoclusters. This method resulted in Hg sensors with 93 - 100 % recovery, excellent selectivity towards Hg in the presence of ammonia and humidity and ~ 27 % higher sensitivity than the Au control QCM. The second case involved forming highly oriented and ornate Au nanostructures (nanospikes) with controlled crystallographic facets onto the QCM electrode by a single step electrodeposition method. These sensors were tested towards Hg vapour in the presence of ammonia and humidity at ~ 90 °C for a 50 day period in a specially designed and developed 8 -channel computer controlled gas calibration system. The testing sequences were made to simulate some of the conditions found in Hg-emitting industries. The nanospike QCM showed high selectivity, recovery and around 4. 7 times higher sensitivity than the Au control QCM, with low degradation in response magnitude over the long testing period. The high sensitivity of the nanospikes was found to be not only due to high surface area but also due to the increased number of surface defect sites created during the electrodeposition step. Due to its excellent performance, a nanospike QCM was then tested towards Hg in the presence of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that either had high affinity towards Au or was present in alumina effluent streams. The nanospikes based QCM was tested against VOCs such as acetone, <b>dimethyl</b> disulphide, methylethyl <b>ketone,</b> ethyl mercaptan, acetaldehyde as well as ammonia and humidity. The nanospike QCM was observed to maintain high selectivity and sensitivity towards Hg vapour when compared to Au control vi QCM. The success of the data presented in this thesis has resulted in a PCT patent of the developed nanospikes and is due to undergo preliminary testing at industry partners’ sites. If successful, the developed sensor will assist industries in complying with mercury emission targets and would be a significant technological breakthrough with potential for many other applications in pollution control...|$|R

In this research paper, different tests are conducted to answer this question and to evaluate the manufacturing process of FDM functional parts. Three performance experiments with the same centrifugal pump, using an open test rig, are carried out and compared, first using the original impeller provided by the manufacturer of the pump, second using an FDM replication of the original one without post-treatment, and third using a chemically <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ketone</b> post-treated FDM replication. The results obtained in the tests demonstrate the functional behavior of both additive FDM impellers in comparison with the one fabricated by means of conventional technology (subtractive manufacturing). Additionally, analogous head-flow curves (and also with an improved performance to the one of the original impeller) are obtained. This research paper introduces significant information concerning a low-cost and low-time manufacturing process of additive functional parts. Moreover, new results are presented regarding the performance of chemically post-treated FDM parts working in functional applications. FDM impellers of high complexity and quality, which meet performance criteria, can be achieved.

Intrinsic reaction co-ordinate calculations were carried out to validate all of the connections between transition states and local minima. The CCSD(T) /cc-pVXZ method (X = D, T, Q) and corresponding extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit was used in order to calculate the relative electronic energies of the reaction mechanisms of dimethyl ether, methanal, <b>dimethyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> methanoic acid and methyl ethanoate and are reported in kcal/mol. The relative energies calculated with the computationally less expensive methods of G 3 in esters + OH radicals and CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ in the remaining reaction mechanisms were benchmarked against the energies calculated with the CCSD(T) /CBS method and are within 1 kcal/mol. Rate constants have been calculated for all of the reaction channels by conventional transition state theory with asymmetric Eckart tunneling corrections and 1 -D hindered rotor approximations in the temperature range 500 - 2000 K. A branching ratio analysis has also been investigated for some of the reaction mechanisms studied in this work. The rate constant results have been compared to available experimental and theoretical data and they are generally in good agreement. A comparison of abstraction of a H-atom by OH and HO 2 radicals at the different positions relative to the functional group of the studied oxygenated species has been performed. For both OH and HO 2 radicals, abstraction of a H-atom at the alpha 2 ̆ 7 or alpha positions of alcohols and ethers is faster than for alkanes and generally slower for aldehydes, ketones, acids and esters throughout the temperature range studied...|$|E

The use of discriminant analysis with regression to latent structures allowed the identification of individual organic compounds in the equilibrium gas phases over the real models for forecasting of change of direction of meat products odor with partial replacement of meat raw materials with functional preparations of plant origin (buckwheat and millet cereals, pickles of soybean and rapeseed protein) and products of microbial synthesis (preparation of yeast and wheat bran).
