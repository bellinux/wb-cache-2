We find that having two <b>forward</b> <b>periods</b> yields competitive outcomes {{and that the}} results {{are very close to}} the predicted theoretical results for both quantity setting duopolies and quadropolies. Our experiments lend strong support to the hypothesis that forward markets are competition enhancing. We then test a new market that allows for endogenously determined indefinitely many <b>forward</b> <b>periods</b> that only close when sellers coordinate on selling a zero amount in a forward market. We find that the outcomes under an endogenous close rule are also very competitive. These results hold for both duopolies and quadropolies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{water balance}} is {{important}} for planning the agriculture crop production because it can assess the water shortage and the water excess or the water demand of each river basin area. This helps improve efficiency of the current and future watershed management. Soil and Water Assessment or SWAT is a mathematical model which is the method of the water balance assessment. It is reliable and internationally accepted water model. This article introduced the SWAT model to evaluate the water balance of the 25 watersheds in Thailand within one month ago and seven days and six hours in advance. It uses the real rainfall data from the rainfall gauging stations for the backward period and the forecast rainfall data from WRF weather model maps for the <b>forward</b> <b>period.</b> This system is the automatic process as scheduled. The outcomes of this system are the water balance data displayed as the text files and the water balance maps in order that this information are simple to apply for planning the water management.

40|$|We {{test the}} {{strategic}} motive {{to sell forward}} in experimental Cournot duopoly and quadropoly environments with either a finite (exogenous close) or an infinite (endogenous close) number of forward markets. In the exogenous close case experienced subjects do not avail themselves of the forward markets and production mostly occurs in the spot market phase. In a forward market duopoly experienced subjects achieve nearly the monopoly output level. For the quadropoly output levels are more competitive and are near the Cournot Nash equilibrium. In both cases output produced is {{much less than the}} Allaz-Vila (1993) prediction. The results with inexperienced subjects, however, are in line with theory and as reported in Le-Coq and Orzen (2006). We implement the case of infinitely many <b>forward</b> <b>periods</b> using the endogenous close rule. In this case the results both for a forward market duopoly and quadropoly are much more competitive both with inexperienced and experienced subjects. Unlike the exogenous stopping rule, under the endogenous rule subjects sell forward in the forward markets and find it hard to coordinate their actions. ...|$|R
40|$|We study several approximations for the LIBOR market models {{presented}} in [1, 2, 5]. Special attention is payed to log-normal approximations and their simulation by using direct simulation methods for log-normal random fields. In {{contrast to the}} conventional numerical solution of SDE's this approach simulates the solution directly at the desired point and is therefore much more efficient. We carry out a path-wise comparison of the approximations and give applications to the valuation of the swaption and the trigger swap. 1 Introduction By far the most important class of traded interest rate derivatives is constituted by derivatives which are specified in terms of LIBOR rates. The LIBOR 1 rate L is the annualized effective interest rate over a <b>forward</b> <b>period</b> [T 1; T 2] and can be {{expressed in terms of}} two zero-coupon bonds B 1 and B 2 with face value 1; maturing at T 1 and T 2; respectively, L(t; T 1; T 2) := B 1 (t) B 2 (t) Γ 1 T 2 Γ T 1; (1) where as usual T 2 is [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|During the 1961-65 {{readjustment}} {{and recovery}} period, economic stability was restored, and by 1966 production in both agriculture and industry surpassed the peak {{levels of the}} Great Leap <b>Forward</b> <b>period.</b> Between 1961 and 1966, agricultural output grew at an average rate of 9.6 percent a year. Industrial output was increased in the same years at an average annual rate of 10.6 percent, largely by reviving plants that had operated below capacity after the economic collapse in 1961. Another important source of growth in this period was the spread of rural, small-scale industries, particularly coal mines, hydroelectric plants, chemical fertilizer plants, and agricultural machinery plants. The economic model that emerged in this period combined elements of the highly centralized, industrially oriented, Soviet-style system of the First Five-Year Plan with aspects of the decentralization of ownership and decision making that characterized the Great Leap Forward and with the strong emphasis on agricultural development and balanced growth of the [...] "agriculture first" [...] policy. Important changes in economic policy occurred in later years, but the basic system of ownership, decision-making structure, and development strategy that was forged in the early 1960s was not significantly altered until the reform period of the 1980s.|$|R
