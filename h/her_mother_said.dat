Trouten's mother received several typed letters signed by her daughter and purportedly mailed while the couple was abroad, although the envelopes all bore Kansas City postmarks. The letters were, <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said,</b> uncharacteristically mistake-free. Later, Robinson told Trouten's mother that she had run off with an acquaintance after stealing money from him.|$|E
25|$|Those who {{believed}} Dean and Angeli were deeply in love claim {{a number of}} forces led them apart. Angeli's mother disapproved of Dean's casual dress and what were, for her at least, radical behavior traits: his T-shirt attire, late dates, fast cars, {{and the fact that}} he was not a Catholic. <b>Her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> that such behavior was not acceptable in Italy. In addition, Warner Bros., where he worked, tried to talk him out of marrying and he himself told Angeli that he didn't want to get married. Richard Davalos, Dean's East of Eden co-star, claimed that Dean wanted to marry Angeli and was willing to allow their children to be brought up Catholic.|$|E

As soon as she could walk, <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said,</b> she was following her about, book in hand, begging to be taught to read stories for herself. She read them soon to so much purpose that before she was five years old, she had finished the Bible, being rewarded by a polyglot Testament for the feat, and had also read Plutarch, which at every subsequent reading gave her an equal pleasure, and at seven, had mastered Racine in the original, upon which she began the study of Latin with her father.|$|E

25|$|Doctors and {{scientists}} {{who worked with}} Genie were uncertain about {{most of her life}} from birth to 20 months. By the age of 11 months she was falling behind in her physical development, which researchers believed was due to both malnutrition and some degree of neglect, although the few medical records from the first year of her life noted no physical or mental abnormalities. In conversations with members of the research team that studied Genie, <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> that as a baby Genie was not very cuddly and did not babble very much. At times she claimed that at an undetermined point Genie said some unspecified individual words, but on other occasions said that Genie never produced speech of any kind, preventing linguists from making any definitive determinations. When Genie was 20 months old, after a pickup truck struck and killed her paternal grandmother, Genie's father decided to increase the family's isolation as much as possible, and because he believed Genie was severely retarded he believed she required a higher degree of isolation {{than the rest of the}} family.|$|E
25|$|In {{her version}} of events, she had fled civil war in Somalia, was forced into an {{arranged}} marriage with a man whom she had never met, and was not present at her own wedding. Upon escaping she was forced into hiding in the Netherlands, for her ex-husband and father's brothers would have been by Somali custom, required to perform an honor killing. The accounts of various witnesses varied greatly from hers. According to them, she left Somalia prior to any mass violence, and led a comfortable, upper-middle class life in neighboring Kenya, where she attended a Muslim Girls' school and received a full western-style education with focus on the Humanities and Science, her brother attended a Christian school, she lied to the Dutch immigration service about coming from Somalia {{in order not to}} be sent back to Kenya, and they allege she met her husband a few days before her wedding. After several meetings with him, they allege she agreed to the marriage, even though <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> Ayaan should finish her education so she could afford to leave him if the marriage should have been unsuccessful. They also allege that Hirsi Ali was present at the wedding, something her brother later denied, and according to several witnesses appeared to be enjoying herself. Hirsi Ali denies all of this. On her way to Canada, she says she travelled to Holland by train during a stopover in Germany, and applied for political asylum. During her stay in Holland she regularly received letters from her father. The documentary also quoted several native Somalians as saying there is no tradition of honor killing in Somalia, something that is disputed.|$|E

500|$|The {{media were}} {{generally}} {{critical of the}} church, presenting it as a cult. The first negative local press articles appeared in 1988, mentioning miraculous healings, proselytism, Kennel's status, fundamentalist beliefs as controversial issues, and included critical reports by former members. Fath noted that the vocabulary and arguments used in the media were intentionally slanted and the repetition of those developed by the CCMM, and that the disproportionate {{media coverage of the}} church did not facilitate an objective investigation.

He said he found her diary, in which she spoke of her imminent death when she would reach heaven to meet her grandparents. The association for the defense of religious freedom and conscience, , criticized the talk show for its lack of alternative viewpoints.|$|E
