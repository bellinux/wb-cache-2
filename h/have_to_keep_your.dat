25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E

That was what all the boys said, and my boy {{believed}} it, though {{he had never heard}} of anybody that it happened to. He believed that if you gave a chicken-cock burnt brandy it could lay eggs, and that if you gave a boy burnt brandy it would stop his growing. That was the way the circus-men got their dwarfs, and the India-rubber man kept himself limber by rubbing his joints with rattlesnake oil.|$|R

Hamilton subsequently spoke {{about the relationship between}} the stressful circumstances of his personal life [...] - [...] in particular the mental illness of his wife [...] - [...] and the brevity of the poems. [...] "You <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> control however bad things were; you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be in charge.

5000|$|An Oregonian article {{profiling}} Hazelbaker and {{her campaign}} colleague Tucker Bounds describes how both are [...] "in McCains Arlington, Va., headquarters before the regular 7:15 a.m. strategy meeting held by top aides.

No, it would not do for you to move before we come up, for there is no saying what time a {{messenger}} will go along. They may not take the alarm until just as we are starting, or even until they see which road we are taking.

Of course, some of their prisons must be better than others and, if they will confine us in some place near the frontier, instead of marching us half through France, it will {{make it all the}} easier for us to get away. It is not the getting out of prison that is the difficulty, but the travelling through the country.

[...] "I was speaking of {{what you would have}} to go through if you aimed at becoming a real artist--if you took music and the drama as a higher vocation in which you would strive after excellence. On that head, what I have said stands fast. You would find--after your education in doing things slackly for one-and-twenty years--great difficulties in study; you would find mortifications in the treatment you would get when you presented yourself on the footing of skill. You would be subjected to tests; people would no longer feign not to see your blunders. You would at first only be accepted on trial. You would have to bear what I may call a glaring insignificance: any success must be won by the utmost patience. You would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> place in a crowd, and after all it is likely you would lose it and get out of sight.

A sailor who drinks too much and loses his boat is as like as not to be murdered by some of them before morning. I hate them chaps like poison. There are scores of small craft manned by them which prey upon the negroes, who are an honest, merry lot, and not bad sailors either in their way.

[...] Davis felt that the freemium model was aimed mainly at impatient gamers, as he had not spent any real-world money during his playtest, and noted that wait times became less odious once a player had several vehicles so they could race one while another was undergoing maintenance. He praised the integration of the freemium model, arguing that [...] "Freemium games <b>have</b> <b>to</b> implement their business model in a way that doesn't unbalance the gameplay, and they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gameplay high-quality enough to be worth everyone's time to begin with. Real Racing 3 succeeds brilliantly on both counts." [...] Edge scored the game 6 out of 10, and although they were critical of the waiting times, they also felt that the players' desires to avoid such waiting times added to the realism of the gameplay; [...] "Firemonkeys has done an admirable job of folding those paywalls into the gameplay. <b>Having</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> car serviced <b>to</b> maintain peak performance strengthens Real Racings sim aspirations, while the need to pay for repairs encourages more thoughtful driving and adds a real-world layer of peril to overtaking." ...|$|R
