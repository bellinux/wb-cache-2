40|$|SummaryIntroductionAccording to Starling's law, low serum colloid osmotic {{pressure}} related to <b>hypoproteinaemia</b> {{is likely to}} modulate the pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure threshold of pulmonary oedema formation. We therefore examined the clinical relevance of bedside tissue Doppler echocardiography in the emergency diagnosis of new-onset heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFnlEF) according to serum protein concentration. MethodsA total of 105 consecutive elderly patients presenting with acute severe dyspnoea were prospectively enrolled. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration and spectral tissue Doppler-derived septal E/E′ ratio were obtained at presentation. Serum protein concentration was measured immediately after clinical stabilization, with a value of less than 6 g/dL defining <b>hypoproteinaemia.</b> ResultsThe diagnostic performance of E/E′ was excellent in normoproteinaemic patients (n= 71; area under the receiver-operating characteristic [ROC] curve 0. 97; p 15, was present in 93 % of patients with HFnlEF and normoproteinaemia versus 55 % of patients with HFnlEF and <b>hypoproteinaemia</b> (p= 0. 0017). ConclusionSeptal E/E′> 15 is clinically relevant for the emergency diagnosis of new-onset HFnlEF among elderly patients with normal serum protein concentration. Lower abnormal values less than 15 should be considered predictive of this condition {{in the setting of}} <b>hypoproteinaemia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Scattered {{through the}} {{literature}} of the world are a few case reports of chronic generalized oedema with <b>hypoproteinaemia,</b> not associated with defective protein intake, or with an obviously increased loss of protein, such as occurs in albuminuria. Some of these have proved to be associated with changes in the liver, and therefore presumably with protein synthesis. Some of this group, in addition, had steatorrhoea. The causes of <b>hypoproteinaemia</b> were well reviewed by Melnick and Cowgill (1937). Thompson, McQuarrie and Bell (1936) described a 2 -year-old girl with oedema and <b>hypoproteinaemia,</b> which did not respond to a high-protein diet. The total serum proteins were 3 - 4 g. per 100 ml. (albumin I 9 g., globulin I 5 g.). The nitrogen balance was consistently positive. The fact that after transfusion the fall of the serum protein level was very gradual suggested that an abnormal destruction of protein was not the cause of the <b>hypoproteinaemia.</b> At necropsy she had widespread atrophy of hepatic cells, confined chiefly to the intermediate and peri-pheral areas of the liver lobules, the central zones being spared. They termed the condition 'primary atrophy of the liver of unknown aetiology'. This is apparently the same patient as that described i...|$|E

40|$|Lymphocytic {{gastritis}} (LG) is {{a disorder}} characterized by diffuse infiltration of the gastric epithelium by small lymphocytes.

We report here on three cases of LG whose presenting symptom was lower limb oedema secondary to <b>hypoproteinaemia.</b> The diagnosis was based on radiological, endoscopic and histopathological findings.

40|$|Forty two {{children}} were admitted to this hospital between 1975 and 1980 with severe {{iron deficiency anaemia}} and 8 of them also had oedema caused by a low concentration of serum proteins. These 8 patients, aged 8 - 24 months, and 13 age matched controls were investigated. The patients had excessive faecal loss of 59 FeCl or 51 Cr-albumin, or both; their jejunal biopsy specimens showed little decrease in the ratio of villous height to crypt depth; and they had fewer intraepithelial lymphocytes and cells containing IgA than controls. They were all treated with an oral ferrous iron preparation and the oedema, <b>hypoproteinaemia,</b> and low haemoglobin concentrations rapidly resolved.

40|$|Small-intestinal {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) loss rates were {{measured}} in six patients with Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfestation, in four patients with hookworm disease, and in eight normal controls. In the four patients with strongyloidiasis having weight loss, <b>hypoproteinaemia,</b> and oedema the mean DNA loss rates were 73 · 9, 51 · 6, 58 · 0, and 62 · 2 ng atoms DNA-P/min respectively, which {{was significantly higher}} than that of patients with hookworm disease (mean 17 · 3, S.

In two of three patients with strongyloidiasis the high DNA loss rates fell to normal after treatment, and in two others investigated only after treatment the rates were normal. It is suggested that the high epithelial cell turnover in these patients may result in excessive loss of endogenous substances and that this may be an important mechanism in causing malnutrition and <b>hypoproteinaemia</b> in patients with S. stercoralis hyperinfestation...|$|E
