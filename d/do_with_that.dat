5|$|Thus {{the natives}} gave overt clues {{that they were}} displeased with the {{settlement}} being formed there. The property had supposedly been secured by {{an agent of the}} Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the Siwanoy people in distant Norwalk, and the local natives likely had little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> transaction, if they even knew of it at all. Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.|$|E

25|$|It {{might seem}} unusual that Hesiod's father {{migrated}} from Asia Minor westwards to mainland Greece, {{the opposite direction}} to most colonial movements at the time, and Hesiod himself gives no explanation for it. However around 750 BC or a little later, there was a migration of seagoing merchants from his original home in Cyme in Asia Minor to Cumae in Campania (a colony they shared with the Euboeans), and possibly his move west had something to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> since Euboea is not far from Boeotia, where he eventually established himself and his family. The family association with Aeolian Cyme might explain his familiarity with eastern myths, evident in his poems, though the Greek world might have already developed its own versions of them.|$|E
500|$|Jamie Edwards, who {{had helped}} record and tour for Happiness... was heavily {{utilized}} during the recording process and was becoming {{a big part of}} the band, considered by some to be the unofficial fifth member of the band at that time. Taggart recounted in 2010, [...] "He’s an amazing guitar player, and he played on the record. People don’t know that he had a lot to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> stuff. He was very influential.

She had hoped her work on Selznick's prestige picture would lead to first-rate roles at Warner Bros., but instead she received third billing below the title as the queen's lady-in-waiting. In early September, she was lent out to Samuel Goldwyn Productions for Sam Wood's romantic caper film Raffles with David Niven, about a high-society cricketer and jewel thief. She later complained, [...] "I had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> style of film." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2016 it was {{revealed}} that Fichtner would not be reprising his role as Mahone in the upcoming fifth season.

He's a brilliant actor – but Paul honestly said to me, 'I don't know what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> character'. He didn't want to just bring everybody back, so that the audience go, 'Oh, look, it's Bill Fichtner again!' – he honestly thought, 'I'm not sure where to do that in the plot.' So if someday there's another chapter of this, maybe then Bill will be back. But I think the characters that are there, each of our moments that we have, are key to the storytelling, which is how it should be." ...|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Tanner Gill {{explained that}} the hotel in which the climactic fighting takes place was designed specifically with the fights in mind, saying [...] "The basic environment of the fight had to be constructed to be “stunt friendly.” The space was tailored. Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that?</b> Are we going to crash into some walls? Are we {{going to go into}} a kitchen? We see what we would get in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so we {{can do a lot of}} different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E

The claim on behalf of The Gap Band and Lonnie Simmons was entered into YouTube’s content management system preventing payments to the publisher. Later, on August 12, Serbian pop artist Viktorija has also argued that [...] "Uptown Funk" [...] infringed on her track [...] "Ulice mračne nisu za devojke". She stated that she had no hurry to sue them, since [...] "these processes take a long time, and my life and career does not depend on lawsuits."

500|$|Near the novel's conclusion, Judd {{refuses to}} honor his {{agreement}} with Marty {{because there was no}} witness. When Marty asks his mother what a witness is, she responds: [...] "Somebody who knows the Lord Jesus and don't mind tellin' about it." [...] Despite Judd's refusal to honor the agreement, Marty persistently maintains his part of it. He decides: [...] "I got no choice. All I can do is stick to my side of the deal and see what happens. All in the world I can do." [...] After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: [...] "What you going to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> dog once he's yours?" [...] Marty's simple reply is: [...] "Love him."

500|$|While in {{his first}} several Doctor Who appearances, Jack {{did not have a}} set costume, Torchwood {{established}} a continual look for Jack which recalled that of his first Doctor Who appearance. The design has been described as [...] "an iconic piece of sci-fi culture". A writer for Wired attributes much of Jack's appeal to the coat: [...] "I think it has lots to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> coat he always wears. Coats are cool, just like fezzes and bow ties and Stetsons. The only difference is that Captain Jack doesn't ever tell you his coat is cool. It just is." [...] In fact, in her essay [...] "Fashioning Masculinity and Desire", Sarah Gilligan attributes Torchwoods popularity—as well as that of the character—to the costume. She credits the greatcoat with helping to fashion the character's masculinity, and argues that Jack's costume creates its own discourse [...] "through which costume drama and Post Heritage cinema's escapism flows".|$|E

500|$|After the {{airing of}} the first season's finale, Faust {{announced}} that {{she had left the}} show, and would be credited in the future as Consulting Producer. Her involvement in the second season consists mainly of story conception and scripts, and the involvement ceased after the second season. Despite leaving, she still has high hopes for the staff members, stating that [...] "the gaps I have left are being filled by the same amazing artists, writers, and directors who brought you Season1. I'm certain the show will be as entertaining as ever". In an interview with New York Magazine, Faust stated her reasons for leaving were a combination of a hectic production schedules and a lack of creative control she had with the series. According to her husband McCracken, Faust's departure was {{due to the fact that}} as a toy company-driven show, [...] "there were things she wanted to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> series that she just wasn't able to do", and that there is [...] "still some frustration with" [...] not being able to bring some of her ideas to screen.|$|E
500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E

500|$|Harry Harrison {{had been}} {{involved}} in the negotiations between SFWA and Cohen, and when the agreement was reached in 1967 Cohen asked Harrison if he would take over as editor of both magazines. [...] Harrison was available because SF Impulse, which he had been editing, had ceased publication in early 1967. [...] Cohen agreed to phase out the reprints {{by the end of the}} year, and Harrison took the job. [...] Cohen added Harrison's name to the masthead of two issues of Great Science Fiction, although Harrison had had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> magazine, but the reprints in Fantastic and Amazing continued and Harrison decided to quit in February 1968. [...] He recommended Barry Malzberg as his replacement. Cohen had worked with Malzberg at the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and felt Malzberg would be more cooperative than Harrison. [...] Malzberg, however, turned out to be just as unwilling as Harrison to work with Cohen if the reprints continued, and soon regretted taking the job. [...] In October 1968 Cohen refused to pay for a cover that Malzberg had commissioned; Malzberg insisted, threatening to resign if Cohen did not agree. [...] Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. [...] Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. [...] Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White took over in October 1968, but because there was a backlog of stories Malzberg had acquired, the first issue on which he was credited as editor was the June 1969 issue.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN [...] "loved" [...] Tom's first {{appearance}} because [...] "It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp." [...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but I have a feeling that the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E
