40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the strength of annealed glass panels when subject to static point loading and is a pre-cursor to further investigations on the resistance to impact by tools or flying objects. The current probabilistic models that are implicit in contemporary codes of practices for the determination of the strength of plain annealed glass is first reviewed. The alternative approach based on fracture mechanics is then introduced. With the fracture mechanics approach, factors controlling the strength of glass are resolved into the fracture toughness, which characterizes the resilience of glass as a material, and the depth of the Griffith flaws which control the strength of the panel. In essence, the strength of a glazing panel can be related to the depth of the critical <b>Griffith</b> <b>flaw</b> assuming a constant fracture toughness. The probabilistic distribution of the critical <b>Griffith</b> <b>flaw</b> depth is modelled by the extreme value theory based on Gumbel. This study is distinguished from earlier studies in that what is being modelled is the probabilistic distribution of the depth of the critical flaw in a glass panel. Results of static tests undertaken by the authors have been demonstrated to match better with the proposed model than with the popularly used Weibull model. Importantly, the characteristic strength of the panel {{has been shown to be}} very sensitive to its dimension...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{tests have}} shown that glass {{exhibits}} very different strengths when tested under biaxial and uniaxial conditions. This paper presents {{a study on the}} effects of biaxial stresses on the notional ultimate strength of glass. The study involved applying the theory of elasticity and finite element analysis of the <b>Griffith</b> <b>flaw</b> in the micro scale. The strain intensity {{at the tip of the}} critical flaw is used as the main criterion for defining the limit state of fracture in glass. A simple and robust relationship between the maximum principal stress and the uniaxial stress to cause failure of the same glass specimen has been developed. The relationship has been used for evaluating the strength values of both new and old annealed glass panels. The characteristic strength values determined in accordance with the test results based on 5 % of exceedance are compared with provisions in the ASTM standard...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{significant}} advances {{have been made in}} the synthesis of new types of nonclay ceramic powders (e. g., oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides), which today have an unprecedented degree of control over particle size, shape, and chemistry [1]. A particular trend has been the increased production of smaller and smaller (typically submicron) powders in order to (i) reduce sintering temperatures, (ii) strengthen ceramics by decreasing the size of <b>Griffith’s</b> <b>flaws,</b> and (iii) allow the processing of composites with individual phases distributed at smaller and smaller scales of mixing...|$|R
40|$|Impact of {{electron}} beam bombardment {{on the surface}} of Nd 3 + doped P 2 O 5 –B 2 O 3 –Al 2 O 3 –BaO laser glass was investigated. Physical properties of the bombarded glass were measured by 3 D laser roughome-ter, microhardness tester, UV/VIS spectrometer, EDS and contact goniometer. Low beam energy had no significant impact on glass surface morphology and other properties. High beam energy increased glass surface roughness and decreased micro-hardness, UV/VIS transmittance and wetting angle. Thermal stress generated by high energy {{electron beam}} bombardment expanded the <b>Griffith</b> <b>flaws</b> and increased glass surface roughness.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to explain the}} observed relationships between particle size and fracture resistance in high-performance blends, which typically reach maximum toughness at particle diameters of 0. 2 – 0. 4 μm. To date {{there has been no}} satisfactory explanation for the ductile–brittle (DB) transition at large particle sizes. The model is based on a recently developed criterion for craze initiation, which treats large cavitated rubber particles as craze-initiating <b>Griffith</b> <b>flaws.</b> Using this criterion in conjunction with Westergaard's equations, it is possible to map the spread from the notch tip of three deformation mechanisms: rubber particle cavitation, multiple crazing and shear yielding. Comparison of zone sizes leads to the conclusion that maximum toughness is achieved when the particles are large enough to cavitate a long way ahead of a notch or crack tip, but not so large that they initiate unstable crazes and thus reduce fracture resistance...|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} of the Log-Normal form for {{predicting}} the cumulative probabilistic distribution of strength in annealed glass panels is presented in this paper. The proposed model, which is supported by experimental evidences, shares certain features that are common with predictions by the Weibull's model. However, as the dimension of the panel is above a certain limit, the strength of glass as predicted by the new model is much less sensitive to any further increase in the panel dimension than strength predicted by the Weibull's model. This has important implications to the engineering design and risk assessments of glass facades in the future. The proposed alternative model was derived from results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of non-interacting <b>Griffith</b> <b>flaws</b> based on principles of fracture mechanics. As interactions between flaws have been neglected in the analyses presented in the paper, the proposed model {{is intended to be}} applicable to glazing panels which contain widely spaced flaws. Results from physical experimentation in support of the simulation model have been presented in the paper...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to most other materials, the molecular structure of glass does not {{consist of a}} regular geometry of crystals, but of an irregular network of silicon and oxygen atoms with alkaline parts in between. In soda lime silica glass, which is generally referred to as glass, the alkaline parts consist of oxides of sodium and calcium. The forces of the inter-atomic bonds describe the theoretical strength of a material. In practice the tensile strength of annealed glass is much lower. Furthermore, the tensile strength is not a material constant, but depends upon many aspects such as {{the condition of the}} surface, the size of the glass pane, duration of load and environmental conditions (Overend et al. 2007). The experiment of Griffith on the glass forms the basis for modern fracture mechanics. Griffith stated that fracture always starts from the preexisting flaws that are termed as <b>Griffith’s</b> <b>Flaw</b> (<b>Griffith</b> 1920). Sir Nevill Mott explained the dynamic fracture mechanism that was an extension to the Griffith’s law (Mott 1946).|$|R
