500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{was written}} by the Scottish {{musician}} Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya. Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – and I always <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> when I go to Africa".|$|E
500|$|According to Ocean, {{the music}} video for [...] "Novacane" [...] {{was a simple}} process. Talking about {{the concept of the}} video, he stated [...] "I was just trying to connect or {{articulate}} visually the feeling of being numb. The feeling of wanting to feel something you can't <b>feel.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic {{and a little bit of}} special effects." [...] The video doesn't last the entirety of the song, which director Nabil Elderkin stated was for artistic reasons. In an interview with Pitchfork, he reasoned [...] "to me, videos don't always have to be the length of the song. I like the idea of people thinking, 'What was that?'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Novacane" [...] {{was officially}} {{released}} {{as the first}} single from Nostalgia, Ultra on May 31, 2011. [...] "Novacane" [...] first charted on the US Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs on May 11, 2011 at number 65. The subsequent week, it rose to number 58, and on its third week, the single rose to number 52. In its fourth week, it rose to number 17. The music video for [...] "Novacane" [...] was released on June 16, directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin. When discussing the video, Ocean commented [...] "I {{was just trying to}} connect or articulate visually the feeling of being [...] The feeling of wanting to feel something you can't <b>feel.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic {{and a little bit of}} special effects." [...] The song also charted on the Billboard Hot 100 at position 82 and at 6 on the Billboard Heatseekers Songs.|$|E

5000|$|The song {{is built}} around a {{pounding}} riff that Clark later admitted was based on [...] "Needles and Pins" [...] by Jack Nitzsche and Sonny Bono. The song's refrain of [...] "I'll probably <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> better when you're gone" [...] betrays Clark's uncertainty about ending the relationship and whether such an act would be the answer to his problems or not. Mark Deming {{has pointed out that}} {{the use of the word}} [...] "probably" [...] in this refrain is key and lends the track a depth of subtext that was unusual for a pop song in the mid-1960s. Jim Dickson, The Byrds' manager, has noted that this level of subtext was not unusual in Clark's songs of the period. Said Dickson, [...] "There was always something to unravel in those songs, the non-explanation of the complex feeling. For instance, if you remember I'll <b>Feel</b> <b>a</b> Whole <b>Lot</b> Better, it doesn't say: [...] "I'll <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> better", but [...] "I'll probably <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> better." [...] For me, that makes the song. There's a statement followed by a hesitation." [...] Dickson would later work as a producer on Clark's 1984 album Firebyrd, which featured a re-recorded version of [...] "I'll <b>Feel</b> <b>a</b> Whole <b>Lot</b> Better".|$|R
500|$|For The Last of Us, {{the team}} had to create new engines to satisfy their needs. The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level, {{as opposed to the}} action elements from their previous projects; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine. The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel, in order to avoid being conceived as a [...] "burden". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as AI, he tried to imagine her experiences throughout the game's events, in an attempt to achieve realism. The enemy AI, {{considered one of the most}} important features of the game, was developed to make random choices; they study their surroundings, finding tactics to attack the player. This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last of Us, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. [...] "You <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of pressure to add things to make it 'more fun' and it gets super difficult to keep those out sometimes," [...] Druckmann said. In The Last of Us, the weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs. In addition, the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation, to make players feel the same.|$|E
500|$|The caravan {{park was}} largely empty at the time, and closed for winter {{several days after}} filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it. It can make you feel your foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with my instincts and intuition." ...|$|E

The experience is terribly predictable, but {{you go through}} with it, because of the comfort it offers." ...|$|R
2500|$|Schein further {{added that}} the film seemed to give little {{prominence}} {{to the history of}} the Hmong, and that only two male Hmong, Thao and a gang member, were given depth in the story. Schein said [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the plot about the Eastwood character is driven {{by the fact that he}} is a veteran. Yet there is no possibility for representing the fact that the Hmong were veterans too." [...] An individual established a blog, eastwoodmovie-hmong.com, documenting what the author believed to be cultural inaccuracies of the film's depiction of the Hmong.|$|E
2500|$|It {{will be a}} great {{pleasure}} to all to hear that the HRH the Prince of Wales has expressed a wish to be given the fine old English title of Visitor of this school.

After seven matches for the club, Cole spent three months on loan at Burnley where he scored six goals for the Championship club, including a hat-trick against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Reflecting on his time at Turf Moor, Cole stated, [...] "I went to Burnley and spoke to Owen Coyle and got a great vibe. He brought the best out of me and made me <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> younger than my age." [...] Cole was released by Sunderland {{at the end of}} the 2007–08 season.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Da Capo II {{release was}} positively reviewed at visual-novels.net, commenting: [...] "I {{know a lot}} of gamers may not enjoy Da Capo, but whilst I think the story on some arcs was weaker than on others they were still amazing paths to play. On the stronger paths you really start to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of emotion for these girls, and because they're so closely tied together, someone always gets hurt. That for me bought some realism to the game." [...] In the October 2007 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, poll results for the fifty best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, Da Capo II ranked seventh with forty-seven votes. Da Capo II was the most widely sold game of 2006 on Getchu.com.
