25|$|Before Robin's funeral, Emma {{stands at}} Hook's grave and cries, {{trying to cope}} {{with the fact that he}} is truly gone now. Suddenly, a wave of magic flies through the air, causing her to stumble. She hears her name called <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> and turns around and is shocked to see Hook. She happily embraces Hook, who tells her Zeus sent him back as a reward for {{stopping}} Hades. After informing him that Robin is gone, Emma decides to break the news about Hook's return to Regina as delicately as possible. However, when an earthquake occurs, Hook rushes to see if Emma is okay. It turns out the earthquake was caused by Mr. Gold tethering magic to the Olympian Crystal fragment. Emma works with Regina to find it, only to later have Gold explain that Henry used his Author power to steal the crystal to destroy magic (again). Both follow Henry to New York, where it turns out Gold got the crystal back. At the same time, Hook, David, Snow and Zelena are accidentally sucked into another realm, which they could become trapped in without any magic in the Real World. Henry succeeds in destroying magic, only to be later convinced by the Dragon to get enough belief to recharge the crystal. It works and everyone is brought home. Once back in Storybrooke, Emma shares a passionate kiss with Hook.|$|E

Out of a hundred shots, she does not miss a single one.|$|E

They visit a nearby lake to reminisce, but she feels something is wrong. Dickerson apologises and leaves; however, Tina is soon attacked <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b> <b>Her</b> body is found with the words [...] "stop looking" [...] carved into her stomach, and Black believes there may be a message somewhere on the first victim's body. He asks fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to look for it; Watts is also able to find fingerprints on Tina's hair clip that identify Dickerson—a paroled convict. They track him down to the halfway home, although Connor secretly helps him to escape to a nearby scrapyard. In Dickerson's room, a hidden cache of souvenirs is found, along with a journal and a stack of letters marked [...] "return to sender".|$|E

500|$|Ellen's {{body was}} {{examined}} by five physicians: police surgeon Charles Templeman, his colleague Alexander Stalker, Edinburgh surgeon Henry Littlejohn and two local doctors, David Lennox and William Kinnear. They concluded that Ellen had been strangled <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b> <b>Her</b> right leg was broken {{in two places}} {{so it could be}} crammed into the crate. Incisions, made by the penknife, ran downwards along her abdomen and had been made [...] "within at most ten minutes of the time of death" [...] according to Templeman, Stalker and Littlejohn. Lennox disagreed and thought the wounds were made later on the basis that when he examined the body the wound was not everted, but Templeman and Stalker said the wound was everted when they examined the body. Littlejohn explained that as Lennox made his examination three days after the others, the shape of the wounds could have changed, to which Lennox agreed.|$|E
