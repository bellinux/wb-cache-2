5|$|Another {{increasing}} {{issue is}} the rise in conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America, such as the Oportunidades program in Mexico. Although this program is meant to provide poor families {{with an increase in}} income, the conditionalities has led to a time poverty for the <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> are in charge of fulfilling the conditions, most oftentimes the woman. This has increased the inequality of work burden within the family.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Greece {{almost all the}} Jews of Rhodes {{were sent to the}} Auschwitz concentration camp; as a result, most members of Etz Ahayem had close <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> were killed in the Holocaust. Before the occupation, however, members of the Kal Grande congregation in Rhodes had buried their Torah scrolls. After the war the scrolls were retrieved and sent to Israel, and a Dr. Nace Cohen was able to procure one of them for Etz Ahayem.|$|E

Van Rensselaer married twice and had at least eleven children. When he died sometime after 1642, two succeeded him as patroons of Rensselaerswyck.|$|E

50|$|Finally, the {{interest}} of one <b>family</b> <b>member</b> may not be aligned with another <b>family</b> <b>member.</b> For example, a <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>who</b> is an owner may want to sell the business to maximize their return, but a <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>who</b> is an owner and also a manager may {{want to keep the}} company because it represents their career and they want their children {{to have the opportunity to}} work in the company.|$|R

5|$|When parents die of HIV/AIDS, {{extended}} family members usually become the children's primary caregivers: in Malawi, 44% of double orphans are adopted by grandparents or other close relatives. Extended family members often provide crucial support to HIV/AIDS orphans; however, some sources indicate that {{extended family}} members mistreat orphans whose parents {{have died from}} HIV/AIDS. For example, <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> are unable to support adopted children often arrange early marriages for female orphans, who may then become {{victims of domestic violence}} and sexual abuse.|$|E

Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift.

40|$|A {{sample of}} {{three hundred and}} nine {{alcoholic}} and non-alcoholic women in South Carolina were asked three family of origin questions that were thought {{to relate to the}} development of alcoholism. Specifically the women were asked: "While you were growing up did anyone in your family (1) drink a lot, (2) use drugs, and (3) serve a jail sentence. " Results of multivariate odds ratio analyses indicate that alcoholic women were 7. 31 times more likely to report a <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>who</b> drank a lot, 3. 57 times more likely to report a <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>who</b> used drugs, and 5. 6 times more likely to report a <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>who</b> served a jail sentence in their families of origin.

He claimed that the agreement between his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, borough officials was made against the wishes of other <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> want him buried in Native American land.

5|$|Billy Bonds is {{the only}} manager to have managed both clubs. He {{was in charge of}} West Ham from February 1990 to August 1994, {{managing}} the club for 227 games as the team yo-yoed between the First and Second divisions. He guided them to two promotions and one relegation. He resigned in August 1994. He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis— an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance. Bonds, from south London, had several <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> were Millwall fans; a fact which meant some supporters felt he should be given a chance. After a good start, the team narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 18th in the Second Division. Bonds was sacked in May 1998, having been in charge of the side for only 53 games.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E

The answer is then revealed, and another of the <b>family</b> <b>members</b> suspended in mid-air gets to mime. The family with the most points wins the round.

5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E

5|$|Logan's retrial {{began in}} June 2007, with the {{prosecution}} unable to use Logan's confession to present its case for conviction, for the judiciary had ruled {{that it had been}} obtained with impropriety. In the retrial, the prosecution used the same argument it had used in the original trial back in 2003, arguing that Logan's insanity defense was illegitimate due to his usage of illegal controlled substances. The state's prosecution argued that Logan himself was solely responsible for any deficiencies in his mental health, saying that they were brought about through his consumption of illegal narcotics, such as cocaine and marijuana, two illegal controlled substances which he had used {{on the day of the}} murders. Ultimately, the first attempt at a retrial ended in June 2007 with a mistrial after jurors couldn't come to a verdict after ten hours of deliberations. On July 1, 2007, Logan's attorney died after being involved in an automobile collision on Route 10 in Glen Burnie, further complicating matters. However, a few months later, Logan was subsequently convicted again after pleading guilty and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment on October 24, 2007, with credit for the five years he had already served, much to the disappointment of the victims' surviving <b>family</b> <b>members,</b> <b>who</b> felt he deserved a lifelong imprisonment for his crime.|$|E
