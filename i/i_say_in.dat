5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

Warren [...] asked me to write some songs, one of them, the Hanky Panky song, was about that. <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', {{and in the middle}} I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.|$|E

I think it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see what <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the song is, 'I love you,' so many times, that I need him and the crazy things in my life. I hope he sees the positive side of the video rather than the negative. The video is kind of offensive, but it is very raw. He's my father. I need someone to walk me down the aisle when I get married." [...] The single's b-side, [...] "My Innocence", features a similar message to Lohan's father.|$|E

500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{working on}} his General Theory, Keynes wrote to George Bernard Shaw [...] "I believe myself to be {{writing a book on}} {{economic}} theory which will largely revolutionize, not I suppose at once but {{in the course of the}} next ten years – the way the world thinks about economic problems ... I don't merely hope what <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>in</b> my own mind I'm quite sure". Keynes's ideas quickly became established as the new foundations for mainstream economics, and also as a leading inspiration for industrial nations economic policy makers from about 1941 to the midseventies, especially in the English speaking countries. The 1950s and 1960s period, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, to many appeared in retrospect to have been a golden age.|$|E
