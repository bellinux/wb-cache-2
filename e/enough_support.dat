5|$|The {{possibility}} of installing a rail link {{from what was}} originally known as the Broadmeadows line (now the Craigieburn line) to the airport was debated in the 1960s under the Bolte State Government, but with not <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> shown in parliament, the rail project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Raw arrived in South Vietnam there were {{tensions}} between the Army and RAAF over the employment of No. 9 Squadron, with the Army perceiving that the unit was not providing <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> to 1 ATF.

5|$|Matilda {{remained}} in England until 1148. The disorders {{were at their}} peak between 1142 and 1148, but her cause could never secure <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> to enable her to be crowned. Nor could Stephen decisively defeat Matilda's forces, which meant that England remained divided in allegiance between the two rivals. But while Matilda was in England, her husband Geoffrey was conquering Normandy, which he finally overran in 1144.|$|E
5000|$|The {{corroboration}} test {{used here}} is like inferential statistics. The null {{hypothesis is that}} the historical event assumed by tradition alone didn't happen. The other hypothesis is that it did happen. If there's <b>enough</b> <b>supporting</b> evidence, we reject the null hypothesis and prove that it did happen. If we do not find <b>enough</b> <b>supporting</b> evidence we fail to reject-but can't prove-the null hypothesis. We conclude that there isn't enough evidence to believe the traditional account, but not that the event [...] "simply did not happen." [...] Between what certainly happened and what certainly didn't happen is a large uncertain area of history. History is mostly unknown {{and much of it}} will never be known. Yet {{there is no reason to}} believe in the uncertain or unknown.|$|R

5|$|Paul {{returned}} to the campaign trail and entered the General election stretch of the campaign a year ahead of the nominees for the two major parties. He traveled to Universities held press conferences and filmed an eight-minute television advertisement, to be shown in small states and on cable television, to help spread his message. He focused on gaining <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> to win {{a place in the}} League of Women Voters-sponsored presidential debates.|$|E
5|$|Rudd {{initially}} {{said that}} he would challenge Gillard, but it soon became apparent {{that he did not have}} <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> within the party to survive in his position. Hours before the vote on 24 June, he resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, leaving Gillard to assume the leadership unopposed. Treasurer Wayne Swan was at the same time elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Deputy Leader.|$|E
5|$|The new Contract Sejm, {{named for}} the {{agreement}} that had been reached by the communist party and the Solidarity movement during the Polish Round Table Talks, would be dominated by Solidarity. As agreed beforehand, Wojciech Jaruzelski was elected president. However, the communist candidate for Prime Minister, Czesław Kiszczak, who replaced Mieczysław Rakowski, failed to gain <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> to form a government.|$|E
50|$|With the {{pastoral}} industry growing, the setting up of a Wool Market was proposed. The Victoria West Wool Auctions began in 1884 and were well <b>enough</b> <b>supported</b> {{to justify their}} being held twice a month. As the market slumped, the activities came to an end.

5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that the state could do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{believed}} that he had <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be nominated as President Roosevelt's running mate for the upcoming presidential election. That support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation and Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to back his nomination. The convention nominated Harry S Truman as Roosevelt's running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him {{the chance to be}} president.|$|E
5|$|Failing {{to gather}} <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> for a floor vote {{in either the}} House or the Senate (although Democrats {{controlled}} both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994. Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44percent in April 1994 and 35percent by September 1994.|$|E

5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 6–10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was wavering {{and it looked}} doubtful {{that it would be}} carried out.

5|$|The {{idea of a}} local railway {{was still}} of {{interest}} to the people of Anglesey. A public meeting was held in Llangefni on 5 July 1858, to popularise the idea of building a railway leaving the main line at Gaerwen, running north to Amlwch, west to Cemaes Bay, then south through Llanrhyddlad to rejoin the main line at Valley. This ambitious scheme did not gain <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> to proceed, although some landowners offered to exchange land for shares.|$|E
5|$|With the 1979 {{municipal}} elections occurring only {{months after the}} riot, prominent gay leaders feared a backlash at the polls. The elections continued without incident, and the gay community fared better than expected, wielding unprecedented influence. Although the virtually unknown gay Mayoral candidate David Scott {{finished third in the}} election, his showing was strong enough to force Mayor Feinstein into a runoff election against conservative City Supervisor Quentin Kopp. Feinstein's promises to appoint more gay people to public office, and her heavy campaigning in the Castro, ensured that she won <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> from the gay community to give her a full term as Mayor.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, it was {{announced}} that long-time supporting actors Ken Kitson and Louis Emerick had returned to Holmfirth to reprise their roles as Police Constables Cooper and Walsh in the pilot for a new proposed spin-off, Cooper and Walsh. Alan J.W. Bell as well as crew from Last of the Summer Wine were involved in the creation of two short films while Kitson and Emerick appealed for funding through crowd-sourcing sites in the hopes of gaining <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> to produce a feature film featuring the duo or even a television series. Associate Producer Terry Bartlam believed there was enough of a cope with Cooper and Walsh that they could carry their own series and that this spin-off could be the answer to those who believed Last of the Summer Wine should have been given a proper ending.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 2012, Wilkie {{announced}} that he was withdrawing his support for the Gillard Government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Gillard to implement mandatory pre-commitment for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government's alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology be installed in all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of what he had been promised in return for supporting the government. In response, Gillard and Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin argued that there was not <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> in the House of Representatives for Wilkie's preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had been advised it was technically unfeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.|$|E
5|$|The company {{feared the}} unionization attempt and hired labor spies {{to follow the}} union leaders and {{determine}} their plans. The company leadership thought the AASEREA's demands were unreasonable, and believed it to be unfair for the employees' wages to exceed the income the business provided its shareholders. The union men discovered the spies and attacked and injured them. This began a rapid rise in tensions. Less {{than half of the}} company's employees had joined the AASEREA, denying Thorpe's committee <b>enough</b> <b>support</b> from the company's employees to enforce a strike. The AASEREA instead sought assistance from other Indianapolis unions. On October 30, a letter signed by Thorpe {{and other members of the}} committee was sent to Robert L. Todd, President of the Traction and Terminal Company. In the letter he made a series of demands, including wage increases, reduced work hours, and the reinstatement of men fired for joining the union. The committee informed the company that the demands had to be met if a strike was to be averted.|$|E
