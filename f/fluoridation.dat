5|$|A 2000 UK {{systematic}} review (York) found that water <b>fluoridation</b> {{was associated with}} a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25teeth). The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial <b>fluoridation</b> were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{have shown}} that water <b>fluoridation</b> reduces {{cavities}} in children. A conclusion for the efficacy in adults is less clear with some reviews finding benefit and others not. Studies in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s showed that water <b>fluoridation</b> reduced childhood cavities by fifty to sixty percent, while studies in 1989 and 1990 showed lower reductions (40% and 18% respectively), likely due to increasing use of fluoride from other sources, notably toothpaste, and also the 'halo effect' of food and drink that is made in fluoridated areas and consumed in unfluoridated ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{identity of the}} ions added is also important in many uses. For example, fluoride containing compounds are dissolved to supply fluoride ions for water <b>fluoridation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dental caries {{remains a}} major public health concern in most industrialized countries, {{affecting}} 60–90% of schoolchildren {{and the vast majority}} of adults. Water <b>fluoridation</b> reduces cavities in children, while efficacy in adults is less clear.|$|E
5|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that water <b>fluoridation</b> reduces tooth decay. Consistent evidence also suggests that it causes dental fluorosis, most of which is mild and not usually of aesthetic concern. No clear evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply <b>fluoridation</b> to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water <b>fluoridation</b> with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of <b>fluoridation</b> have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water <b>fluoridation</b> is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water <b>fluoridation</b> and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water <b>fluoridation</b> and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water <b>fluoridation</b> equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water <b>fluoridation.</b> Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|In the senate, Mount {{served on}} a variety of committees, chairing the Senate Committees on Coastal Restoration and Flood Control, Revenue and Fiscal Affairs, and also serving as Vice-Chair of the Senate Committee on Education. In 2008, she became {{chairwoman}} of the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare. Mount often sponsors legislation regarding health and public service. This includes bills intended to identify sex offenders and enact term limits for various boards and commissions. She was responsible for passing these term limits as an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution, as SB 232 on November 4, 2008. Mount also sponsored legislation to merge New Orleans criminal and civil district courts, create a childhood and family learning center, couple the opening of new hospice care providers with inspections of existing ones, allow police to suspend driver's licenses of teenagers with problems at school, and create a state-run internet database providing information on the quality of health care providers. Mount was responsible for legislation that made Louisiana water <b>fluoridation</b> mandatory, and, in her capacity as chair of the Senate Health committee, Mount in 2008 declared major Louisiana health care reform unlikely without prior federal reform.|$|E
5|$|Toothache {{may occur}} at any age, in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water <b>fluoridation).</b> In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluoridation</b> {{has little}} effect on risk of bone {{fracture}} (broken bones); it may result in slightly lower fracture risk than either excessively high levels of <b>fluoridation</b> or no <b>fluoridation.</b> There is no clear association between <b>fluoridation</b> and cancer or deaths due to cancer, both for cancer in general and also specifically for bone cancer and osteosarcoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{views on}} the most {{effective}} method for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed. The Australian government states that water <b>fluoridation</b> {{is the most effective}} means of achieving fluoride exposure that is community-wide. The World Health Organization states water <b>fluoridation,</b> when feasible and culturally acceptable, has substantial advantages, especially for subgroups at high risk, while the European Commission finds no advantage to water <b>fluoridation</b> compared with topical use.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has {{identified}} community water <b>fluoridation</b> {{as one of}} ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. The CDC recommends water <b>fluoridation</b> {{at a level of}} 0.7–1.2mg/L, depending on climate. The CDC also advises parents to monitor use of fluoride toothpaste, and use of water with fluoride concentrations above 2mg/L, in children up to age 8. There is a CDC database for researching the water <b>fluoridation</b> status of neighborhood water.|$|E
25|$|Early {{opposition}} to water <b>fluoridation</b> included chiropractors, {{some of whom}} continue to oppose it as being incompatible with chiropractic philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom. Other chiropractors have actively promoted <b>fluoridation,</b> and several chiropractic organizations have endorsed scientific principles of public health. In addition to traditional chiropractic {{opposition to}} water <b>fluoridation</b> and vaccination, chiropractors' attempts to establish a positive reputation for their public health role are also compromised by their reputation for recommending repetitive lifelong chiropractic treatment.|$|E
25|$|As {{with some}} other countries, water <b>fluoridation</b> in the United States is a {{contentious}} issue. As of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water <b>fluoridation.</b> On January 25, 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first community in the United States to fluoridate its drinking water to prevent tooth decay.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{contemporary}} debate on water <b>fluoridation</b> revolves around questions of how consumer demand for fluoride is determined and processed, which <b>fluoridation</b> costs and benefits are considered, how conflicts over its provision and production are addressed or resolved, and how the merits of relevant health policies can be equally recast {{in terms of their}} presumed demerits.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientists}} or {{doctors who}} oppose water <b>fluoridation</b> {{argue that it}} has no or little cariostatic benefits, may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to justify the costs, and is pharmacologically obsolete. Arvid Carlsson has argued that <b>fluoridation</b> violates modern pharmacological principles and doesn't take into account individual variations in response, which can be considerable even when the dosage is fixed.|$|E
25|$|In Israel, the Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians, the Israel Pediatric Association, and the Israel Dental Association, support <b>fluoridation.</b>|$|E
25|$|National and {{international}} health agencies and dental associations {{throughout the world}} have endorsed water <b>fluoridation</b> as safe and effective.|$|E
25|$|The cost {{of adding}} <b>fluoridation</b> {{to the water}} of 44 Florida {{communities}} has been researched by the State Health Office in Tallahassee. In communities {{with a population of}} over 50,000 people, <b>fluoridation</b> costs were estimated at 31 cents per person per year. The estimated cost rises to $2.12 per person in areas with a population below 10,000. Unintended consequences, such as equipment malfunction, can substantially raise the financial burden, as well as the health risks, to the consumer.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to <b>fluoridation</b> {{has existed}} since its {{initiation}} in the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, conspiracy theorists claimed that <b>fluoridation</b> was a communist plot to undermine American public health. In recent years water <b>fluoridation</b> {{has become a}} prevalent health and political issue in many countries, resulting in some countries and communities discontinuing its use while others have expanded it. The controversy is propelled by a significant public opposition supported by a minority of professionals, which include researchers, dental and medical professionals, alternative medical practitioners, health food enthusiasts, a few religious groups (mostly Christian Scientists in the U.S.), and occasionally consumer groups and environmentalists. Organized political opposition has come from libertarians, the John Birch Society, and from groups like the Green parties in the UK and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{and opponents}} have been both criticized for overstating the {{benefits}} or overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively. Systematic reviews have cited {{the lack of}} high quality research for the benefits and risks of water <b>fluoridation</b> and questions that are still unsettled. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the <b>fluoridation</b> scientific literature fuel the controversy.|$|E
25|$|Water <b>fluoridation</b> is a {{controversial}} practice {{has been carried}} out since the early 20th century for the claimed purpose of decreasing tooth decay.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 2011, The {{city council}} of College Station, Texas voted, 6–1, against fluoridating city water supplies. ending 22 years of <b>fluoridation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Those opposed {{argue that}} water <b>fluoridation</b> has no or little cariostatic benefits, may cause serious health problems, is not {{effective}} {{enough to justify}} the costs, and pharmacologically obsolete.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 2013, {{voters in}} Portland, Oregon decided 61–39% not to {{commence}} <b>fluoridation</b> of Portland's water, which is supplied to 900,000 people. It {{was the fourth}} defeat of <b>fluoridation</b> proposals in Portland, the first being in 1956. On September 12, 2012, the Portland City Council unanimously passed Ordinance No. 185612, authorizing and directing the Portland Water Bureau to begin fluoridating. Those opposing the ordinance immediately began a petition process to hold a referendum that could reverse the ordinance. In October, {{it was revealed that}} four city council members had had undisclosed meetings with pro-fluoridation lobbyists. Public calendars of those four did not mention the meetings, except that one meeting was mentioned with a vague title. This was in violation of a city ordinance requiring the disclosure of such meetings. Over 33,000 signatures were gathered for the petition, which led to the referendum that defeated <b>fluoridation.</b> In the campaign, the pro-fluoridation side out-raised opponents $850,000 to $270,000.|$|E
25|$|Public water <b>fluoridation</b> {{was first}} practiced in 1945, in the US. As of 2012, 25 {{countries}} have artificial water <b>fluoridation</b> to varying degrees, 11 {{of them have}} more than 50% of their population drinking fluoridated water. A further 28 countries have water that is naturally fluoridated, though in many of them the fluoride is above the recommended safe level. As of 2012 about 435million people worldwide (around 5.4% of the global population) received water fluoridated at the recommended level, nearly half of them living in the United States.|$|E
25|$|As of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water <b>fluoridation.</b> According to a 2002 study, 67% of U.S. {{residents}} {{were living in}} communities with fluoridated water at that time.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before his}} term as Dorval borough mayor {{came to an}} end, Yeomans was accused of not {{properly}} informing Dorval residents that the city's water had not received <b>fluoridation</b> for the previous two years.|$|E
25|$|Scheele's {{administrative}} skills helped PHS weather two public controversies {{that dominated}} 1950s America: <b>fluoridation</b> of public drinking water supplies and outbreaks of polio that followed a government-sanctioned vaccination campaign. These issues highlighted {{the importance of}} political consensus and public acceptance in evaluating {{the costs and benefits}} of public health interventions. Following decades of research and the success of a 1945 clinical trial involving Grand Rapids, Michigan school children, PHS gave formal support to <b>fluoridation</b> as of June 1950, and Scheele issued his public, unqualified recommendation on April 24, 1951, enhancing PHS's public credibility and further elevating the role of the Surgeon General as a spokesperson for health.|$|E
25|$|Water fluoridation: in {{many areas}} {{fluoride}} is added to water {{with the goal of}} preventing tooth decay. Fluoride is usually added after the disinfection process. In the U.S., <b>fluoridation</b> is usually accomplished by the addition of hexafluorosilicic acid, which decomposes in water, yielding fluoride ions.|$|E
25|$|Local {{government}} (regional councils, territorial {{councils and}} District Health Boards) may hold referendum on issues which they feel their citizens {{need to be}} consulted upon. Referendums have been held on water <b>fluoridation,</b> changing the electoral system to Single Transferable Vote and merging authorities together.|$|E
25|$|Although water <b>fluoridation</b> {{has been}} praised {{as one of}} the top medical {{achievements}} of the 20th century, fluoride-containing toothpaste can be acutely toxic if swallowed in large amounts. Approximately 15mg/kg body weight is the acute lethal dose, even though as small amount as 5mg/kg may be fatal to some children.|$|E
