5000|$|Bearer shares - Are a legal {{instrument}} denoting company ownership, {{and are usually}} {{in the form of}} share warrants. A share warrant is a document which states that the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares stated in it. If authorised by its articles, a company may convert any <b>fully</b> <b>paid</b> <b>shares</b> to [...] "share warrants". These warrants are easily transferable without any need for a transfer document; that is, they can simply be passed from hand to hand. When share warrants are issued, the company must strike out the name of the shareholder from its register of members and state the date of issue of the warrant and the number of shares to which it relates. Subject to the articles, a share warrant can be surrendered for cancellation. If so, the holder is entitled to be re-entered into the register of members. Vouchers are usually issued with the share warrants in order that any dividends may be claimed. (Bearer shares have been abolished in the UK by the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act 2015. Existing Bearer shares must be converted to registered shares by February 2016 or the company will be obliged to apply to the Court to cancel them.) ...|$|R
