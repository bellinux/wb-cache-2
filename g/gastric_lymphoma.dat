40|$|BACKGROUND: Over {{the last}} years, our {{knowledge}} on pathogenesis of <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphoma</b> has greatly improved, but its morphological diagnosis is still hampered by overlapping histological features with advanced chronic gastritis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression of 384 miRNAs using TaqMan microRNA assay in a training series of 10 <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphomas,</b> 3 chronic gastritis and 2 reactive lymph nodes. Then, significantly deregulated miRNAs were individually assessed by real-time PCR in a validation series of 16 <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphomas</b> and 12 chronic gastritis.

We utilized immunohistochemistry and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} to further evaluate a subset of the <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> Results Extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALTs) and diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) were the most common subtypes of GI <b>lymphomas.</b> Select <b>gastric</b> DLBCLs (N[*]=[*] 6) and MALTs (N[*]=[*] 13) were further examined for API 2 -MALT 1 and IGH translocations, and P 16 and P 53 protein expression. Gastric MALTs showed frequent API 2 -MALT 1 (38 %) but not IGH translocations (0 %), and the DLBCLs showed neither translocation.

A total of 32 cases of <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphomas</b> was classified into low-grade lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type (n= 16) and high-grade B-cell lymphomas (n= 16). In low-grade lymphomas, only one case showed p 53 positivity and all cases were p 21 -negative.

40|$|Publicación ISIBecause it is {{difficult}} to differentiate gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma from chronic gastritis in gastric lymphoid infiltrates, molecular detection of monoclonality through immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements is commonly performed. However, heterogeneity in the performance and results obtained from IgH gene rearrangements has been reported. To improve the accuracy in the diagnosis of gastric lymphoid infiltrates, we developed an analytical approach based on one-peak area analysis of the melting curve in the LightCycler System. Using a training-testing approach, the likelihood ratio method was selected to find a discriminative function of 4. 64 in the training set (10 <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphomas</b> and 10 chronic gastritis cases). This discriminative function was validated in the testing set (five <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphomas,</b> six abnormal lymphocytic infiltrates with subsequently demonstrated <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphomas,</b> and six cases of chronic gastritis). All but one case of <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphoma,</b> as well as abnormal lymphocytic infiltrates, clustered under 4. 64, and all chronic gastritis cases clustered above 4. 64.

The role of 18 F‑fluorodeoxyglucose {{positron}} emis-sion tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT) {{in numerous}} malignant tumors, including <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> is well‑established.

Prior to treat-ment, 18 F-FDG PET/CT was performed on 24 patients with <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and 43 patients with gastric cancer. The 18 F-FDG PET/CT pattern of gastric wall lesions was classi-fied as one of three types: Type, diffuse thickening of the gastric wall with increased FDG uptake infiltrating more than one‑third of the total stomach; type, segmental thickening of the gastric wall with elevated FDG uptake involving less than one‑third of the total stomach; and type, local thickening of the gastric wall with focal FDG uptake. The incidence of the involvement of more than one region of the stomach was higher in the patients with <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> than in those with gastric cancer. Gastric FDG uptake was demonstrated in 23 of the 24 patients (95. 8 %) with <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and in 40 of the 43 patients (93. 0 %) with gastric cancer. <b>Gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> predominantly presented with type and lesions, whereas gastric cancer mainly presented with type and lesions. The maximal thickness was larger and the maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) was higher in the patients with <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> compared with those with gastric cancer.

Results: H. pylori were detected in 34 of 140 patients (24. 3 %) with primary <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> while H. pylori weredetected in 62 of 115 patients (53. 9 %) with gastric cancer. The frequency of H. pylori positivity was higher in patientswith gastric cancer than in those with <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (p< 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND—Most {{low grade}} <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphomas</b> {{arising from the}} mucosa {{associated}} lymphoid tissue (MALT) are related to Helicobacter pylori colonisation. Cases with disease limited to the stomach can be cured after H pylori eradication and remain in remission for years. In contrast, high grade lymphomas of the stomach, although also related to H pylori, do not usually respond to eradication treatment.  CASE REPORT—A 36  year old patient was referred from another hospital with a diagnosis of a low grade <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphoma</b> associated with H pylori. The patient was in stage I and while waiting for the biopsies to be reviewed H pylori eradication therapy was given as the first step of treatment. Review of the biopsies showed a high grade immunoblastic lymphoma with areas of low grade <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphoma</b> (high grade <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphoma</b> or diffuse large B cell lymphoma with areas of MALT type lymphoma of the WHO classification). The patient received no further treatment but has been closely followed up for 32  months with sequential endoscopies to obtain biopsies for histological studies, H pylori cultures, and polymerase chain reaction analysis of the IgH gene.  RESULTS—After H pylori eradication the patient had a complete histological response that has been maintained for 32  months. Monoclonal IgH gene rearrangement persisted for 32  months.  CONCLUSION—The response of this patient indicates the possibility that some cases of high grade <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphoma</b> (possibly patients in stage I with a superficial or limited disease) may still be responsive to H pylori antigenic drive and may be cured with eradication therapy. Prospective studies should be performed to identify patients with high grade <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphomas</b> that may respond to eradication therapy and be spared of other more aggressive treatments.    Keywords: {{mucosa associated lymphoid tissue}}; lymphoma; gastric lymphoma; immunoblastic lymphoma; Helicobacter pylor...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the long-term survival of a homogenous group of patients with stage IE or IIE- 1 <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> after complete surgical resection. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The management of <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> remains controversial. Enthusiasm for multimodality approaches for <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> has lead to the current trend of using chemotherapy as primary treatment, thus avoiding gastric resection. Surgery, however, may result in improved long-term survival rates. METHODS: The records of all patients with the diagnosis of <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> from 1980 to 1991 were reviewed retrospectively. Of 106 patients examined, 34 underwent curative resection and regional lymphadenectomy for pathologically staged IE or IIE- 1 (pN 1) <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Fifteen patients underwent surgery alone, whereas 19 also received postoperative adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 74 months. The 10 -year actuarial disease-free survival was 91 % for stage IE disease (n = 23) and 82 % for stage IIE- 1 disease (n = 11). There were no operative deaths and a 26 % morbidity rate. No difference in survival was found for those treated with adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The results compare favorably to those reported with the use of primary chemotherapy and radiation therapy and suggest that surgery remains the best frontline therapy for early <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma...</b>|$|E
40|$|Goal: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} and endoscopic presentation of primary <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Background: Remission rate and long-term survival {{in patients with}} <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> mainly depend on disease stage at diagnosis. Series reporting clinical and endoscopic presentation of <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> are generally small and heterogeneous. Study: Systematic review with pooled-data analysis assessing clinical and endoscopic presentation of primary <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Results: Data regarding 2000 patients were collected. Overall, males were slightly more prevalent, alarm symptoms were absent in near half of the patients, lymphoma was diagnosed in a stage >I in one-third of the patients, and Helicobacter pylori infection was present in 88. 8 % of considered patients. At endoscopy, the ulcerative type was the most frequent presentation, although low-grade lymphoma was diagnosed on normal/hyperemic gastric mucosa in 9 % of cases. Patients with high-grade lymphoma presented alarm symptoms (anemia and/or melena and/or hemorrhage, persistent vomiting, weight loss), an exophytic or ulcerative lesion, a stage III-IV, and a H. pylori negative status more frequently than low-grade lymphoma cases. Conclusions: Our pooled-data analysis showed that <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphoma</b> is still disappointingly diagnosed in an advanced stage in {{a large number of}} patients.

40|$|A loss of FAS (CD 95) {{function}} {{has been}} proposed to constitute {{an important step in}} early mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma development and FAS mutations have been recognized in malignant lymphomas, in particular at extranodal sites. Since primary <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphomas</b> frequently exhibit resistance to FAS-mediated apoptosis, we investigated whether FAS is mutated in 18 <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphomas</b> and 28 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). We detected seven mutations in five lymphomas, one MALT lymphoma and four DLBCL; two DLBCL had two mutations. The MALT lymphoma exhibited a point mutation in the splice donor region of intron 3. Three DLBCL had missense mutations in exon 2, which encodes a signal peptide and a portion of the extracellular FAS ligand-binding domain. One DLBCL carried a point mutation in the splice donor region of intron 8, which would result in exon skipping. Two DLBCL harbored a missense mutation in exon 9, which encodes the intracellular death domain. The two death domain mutations inhibited FAS ligand-induced apoptosis in a dominant-negative mode, when transiently expressed in human T 47 D breast carcinoma and Jurkat T cells. A signal peptide and an extracellular domain mutation, however, failed to inhibit apoptosis in these transfection assays. They are likely to reduce apoptosis in lymphoma cells solely by a loss of function. In summary, our data show that FAS mutations are rare in primary <b>gastric</b> MALT <b>lymphomas</b> (5. 6 %) but occur in a subset of primary gastric DLBCL (14. 3 %) and suggest that these mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of <b>gastric</b> <b>lymphomas</b> by rendering lymphocytes resistant to apoptosis...|$|R
