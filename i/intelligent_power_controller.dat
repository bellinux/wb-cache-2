The IPC uses a neural network for online prediction of roadway types and traffic congestion levels. The IPC and the prediction model have been implemented in a conventional (non-hybrid) vehicle model for online vehicle power control in a simulation program. The benefits of the IPC combined with the predicted drive cycle are demonstrated through simulation. Experiment {{results show that the}} IPC gives close to optimal performances. I...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an <b>intelligent</b> <b>power</b> <b>controller</b> for a vehicle power system that employs {{multiple}} power sources. In particular {{we focus on}} a vehicle power system architecture that is used in vehicles such as Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle. These vehicles are designed to survive IED (Improvised Explosive Devices) attacks and ambushes. The power system has the following major components: a “clean ” bus, a “dirty” bus, an engine, a hydraulic system and a switch between the clean and the dirty bus. We developed algorithms for intelligent energy management {{for this type of}} vehicle power system including DP (Dynamic Programming) optimization, DP online control and a machine learning technique that combines neural networks with DP to train an <b>intelligent</b> <b>power</b> <b>controller.</b> We present experiments conducted through modeling and simulation using a generic commercial software tool and a lab hardware setup.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} effort has been {{the development of a}} software system which automates tasks related to monitoring and controlling electrical power distribution in spacecraft electrical power systems. The resulting software system is called the <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Controller</b> (IPC). The specific tasks performed by the IPC include continuous monitoring of the flow of power from a source to a set of loads, fast detection of anomalous behavior indicating a fault to one of the components of the distribution systems, generation of diagnosis (explanation) of anomalous behavior, isolation of faulty object from remainder of system, and maintenance of flow of power to critical loads and systems (e. g. life-support) despite fault conditions being present (recovery). The IPC system has evolved out of KATE (Knowledge-based Autonomous Test Engineer), developed at NASA-KSC.

40|$|An <b>intelligent</b> remote <b>power</b> <b>controller</b> (RPC) {{based on}} {{microcomputer}} technology can implement advanced functions for the accurate and secure detection {{of all types}} of faults on a spaceborne electrical distribution system. The intelligent RPC will implement conventional protection functions such as overcurrent, under-voltage, and ground fault protection. Advanced functions for the detection of soft faults, which cannot presently be detected, can also be implemented. Adaptive overcurrent protection changes overcurrent settings based on connected load. Incipient and high-impedance fault detection provides early detection of arcing conditions to prevent fires, and to clear and reconfigure circuits before soft faults progress to a hard-fault condition. Power electronics techniques can be used to implement fault current limiting to prevent voltage dips during hard faults. It is concluded that these techniques will enhance the overall safety and reliability of the distribution system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new power {{conditioner}} topology with an <b>intelligent</b> <b>power</b> management <b>controller</b> that integrates multiple {{renewable energy sources}} such as solar energy, wind energy, and fuel cell energy with battery and AC grid supply as backup {{to make the best}} use of their operating characteristics with better reliability than that could be obtained by single renewable energy source based power supply. The proposed embedded controller is programmed to perform MPPT for solar PV panel and WTG, SOC estimation and battery, maintaining a constant voltage at PCC and power flow control by regulating the reference currents of the controller in an instantaneous basis. The instantaneous variation in reference currents of the controller enhances the controller response as it accommodates the effect of continuously varying solar insolation and wind speed in the power management. It also prioritizes the sources for consumption to achieve maximum usage of green energy than grid energy. The simulation results of the proposed power management system with real-time solar radiation and wind velocity data collected from solar centre, KEC, and experimental results for a sporadically varying load demand are presented in this paper and the results are encouraging from reliability and stability perspectives...|$|R

Its <b>power</b> <b>controller</b> includes an active <b>power</b> <b>controller</b> and a reactive <b>power</b> <b>controller.</b> The active <b>power</b> <b>controller</b> includes active <b>power</b> control and DC voltage control and the reactive <b>power</b> <b>controller</b> includes reactive <b>power</b> control and AC voltage control. Generally speaking, the normal operation of two-terminal HVDC Flexible system needs one station to control the DC voltage and the other terminal to control the active power, while the two-station reactive adjustments are mutually independent and can freely choose to control the reactive power or the AC voltage. On the control strategy, no matter the two-level or MMC technique is used, the equivalent mathematical model on the AC side is similar. Therefore, the same station level control strategy can be used. In numerous station level control strategies, the DC vector control strategy has become the mainstream control technique of the VSC for its high current responding speed and accurate current control effect [17, 18, 19].|$|R
