5|$|In mid-2014, {{having just}} {{finished}} their previous collaboration, <b>Fatale,</b> Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips were deliberating whether their next project {{would be a}} noir period piece or a science fiction tale.

The pair announced The Fade Out and their new contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series {{because they were not}} sure how many issues were needed to tell the story. Since <b>Fatale</b> had taken twice as long as originally planned, {{they did not want to}} mislead fans or feel pressure to conclude before they were ready. They did know it would be a minimum of 12 issues.|$|E
