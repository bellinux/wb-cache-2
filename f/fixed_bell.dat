The masks could be classified into three types according to the characters they represented: the anthropomorphic, the zoomorphic (representing bear, cow, stag, goat, sheep, ox, wolf, stork, etc.), and the anthropo-zoomorphic. The main material from which they were produced was hide. The face, however, could be made separately out of a dried gourd shell or a piece of wood, and then sewn to hide so that the mask could cover all the head. The moustache, beard, and eyebrows were made with black wool, horsehair, or hemp fibers, and the teeth with beans. Zoomorphic and anthropo-zoomorphic masks might have white, black, or red painted horns attached to them. The costumes were prepared from ragged clothes, sheepskins with the wool turned outside, and calf hides. An ox tail with a <b>bell</b> <b>fixed</b> at its end was sometimes attached at the back of them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we try to}} present in a {{coherent}} fashion proofs of basic results developed so far by H. Bell for the plane fixed point problem. Some of these results have been announced much earlier but without accessible proofs. We define {{the concept of the}} variation of a map on a simple closed curve and relate it to the index of the map on that curve: Index = Variation + 1. We develop a prime end theory through geometric chords in maximal balls contained in the complement of a non-separating plane continuum. We define the concept of an outchannel for a fixed point free map which carries a non-separating plane continuum into itself and prove that such a map has a unique outchannel, and that outchannel must have variation = − 1. We also extend Bell’s linchpin Theorem for a foliation of a simply connected domain, by Euclidean convex subsets, to arbitrary domains in the sphere. Cartwright and Littlewood showed that each non-separating invariant continuum, under an orientation preserving homeomorphism of the plane, contains a <b>fixed</b> point. <b>Bell</b> announced in 1984 an extension of this result to holomorphic mappings of the plane. In this paper we introduce the class of oriented maps of the plane. We show that among perfect maps of the plane the oriented maps are exactly the compositions of open maps and monotone maps. It follows that all such compositions satisfy the Maximum Modulus Theorem. We also extend the above fixed point theorems to the class of positively-oriented perfect maps of the plane...|$|R

This tramway or railroad was narrow, not quite three feet in width; and small trucks were fitted to it, so that the heavy stones of the building might be easily run to the exact spot they were to occupy. From this circular rail several branch lines extended to the different creeks where the boats deposited the stones. These lines, although only a few yards in length, were dignified with names--as, Kennedy's Reach, Logan's Reach, Watt's Reach, and Slight's Reach. The ends of them, where they dipped into the sea, were named Hope's Wharf, Duff's Wharf, Rae's Wharf, etcetera; and these wharves had been fixed on different sides of the rock, so that, whatever wind should blow, there would always be one of them on the lee-side available for the carrying on of the work.|$|R

60|$|Archibald Macdonald, of {{the parish}} of St. Mary's, in the Isle of Skye, being reputed famous in his skill of foretelling things to come, by the second-sight, {{happening}} {{to be in the}} village Knockow one night, and before supper, told the family that he had just then seen the strangest thing he ever saw in his life, viz., a man with an ugly long cap, always shaking his head; but that the strangest of all was a little kind of a harp which he had, with four strings only, and that it had two hart's horns fixed in the front of it. All that heard this odd vision fell a laughing at Archibald, telling him that he was dreaming, or had not his wits about him, since he pretended to see a thing which had no being, and was not so much as heard of in any part of the world. All this could not alter Archibald's opinion, who told them that they must excuse him if he laughed at them after the accomplishment of the vision. Archibald returned to his own house, and within three or four days after, a man with a cap, harp, &c., came to the house, and the harp, strings, horns, and cap, answered the description of them at first view, and he shook his head when he played; for he had two <b>bells</b> <b>fixed</b> to his cap. This harper was a poor man, who made himself a buffoon for his bread, and was never seen before in those parts, and {{at the time of the}} prediction he was in the Isle of Barray, which is about twenty leagues distant from that part of Skye.

50|$|There are 22 temples in {{the same}} campus of {{different}} Gods and Goddesses among which Lord Shiva is empowered as being supreme. Modern concepts ascribe that the shrines are of both old and new styles. The temple of Shiva, Baidyanath faces the east, and is 72 feet tall, and it is lotus shaped. According to religious belief this temple has been built by Vishwakarma, the architect of gods. There are three parts of this temple; i.e., the main temple, the middle part of the main temple, and the entrance part of the main temple. The main temple is beyond historical dates. It has been visited {{since the age of}} Rama, the king of Ayodhya.The top contains three ascending shaped gold vessels that are compactly set, which were donated by Maharaja of Gidhaur, Raja Puran Singh. Besides these pitcher shaped vessels, there is a 'PUNCHSULA' (Five knives in Tridenta shape), which is rare. In the inner top there is an eight petaled lotus jewel (CHANDRAKANTA MANI). The main 'LINGAM' (Lord Shiva) is also very rare. To the east of the northern verandah of the temple there is a large vat into which flows the water and milk offered as ablution. The lingam is of a cylindrical form about 5 inches in diameter and projects about 4 inches from the center of a large slab of basalt. It is not possible to ascertain how much of the lingam is buried. The top is broken and has uneven surface. There are different porches in the temple. One porch leads to the cell where the lingam is fixed. The second porch is in front with a row of pillars spanned by blocks of basalt and on the right side there is a sandstone image of a bull. There are <b>bells</b> <b>fixed</b> in the ceiling and pilgrims are supposed to pull the bell-ropes to announce their approach to the divinity. The courtyard has eleven other temples, mainly of Maa Parvathi, Maa Kali, Maa Jagat Janani, Kal Bhairav and Lakshminarayan. Maa parvathi temple is tied up with the main temple, with huge red sacred threads which is unique and worthy of reverence, showing the unity of Shiva and Shakti.|$|R
5000|$|In 1751, Prince Narishkin, Master of the Hunt to Empress Elizabeth of Russia, had a set {{of sixteen}} {{carefully}} tuned metal horns made to ensure that his huntsmen would sound a harmonious D-major chord while signalling to each other. He then got the idea of enlisting a Bohemian horn-player, J. A. Mareš, who was in service with the Imperial court in St. Peterburg to organize these new horns into a band. Maresch had made {{a second set of}} thirty-two (or perhaps thirty-seven) horns, each capable of playing a different, single note—the second harmonic of the instrument—from a C-major scale covering several octaves. (Later the size of the band was increased to sixty horns encompassing five octaves.) The instruments were straight or slightly curved horns made of copper or brass, had a wide conical bore, and were played with a cupped trumpet-type mouthpiece. A metal cap <b>fixed</b> to the <b>bell</b> end was used to adjust the tuning. Each man in the band was trained to play his note in turn, similar {{to the way in which}} a group of handbell ringers perform melodies by each sounding their bells at a predetermined moment. This horn band, effectively a giant human music-box of the sort only feasible in a slave culture, played its first public concert in 1753 or 1755 and debuted officially at the Grand Hunt concert in 1757, creating a fashion that spread outside of Russia and continued for eighty years. With proper training, such a horn ensemble was capable of playing relatively complex music in full harmony. The Russian nobility developed a taste for horn bands, which were sometimes sold as a body—the performers along with horns—since most of the players were serfs. Some bands toured Europe and the British Isles, playing arrangements of standard concert repertory and Russian folk music, as well as original compositions. Although received with praise for their accomplishment, they were also criticized for [...] "reducing man to the level of a machine". In Eastern Germany, workmen's bands modified the technique of these horns by adding the upper octave to each instrument's note, and the use of hand-stopping for the smaller horns to add one or two lower semitones.|$|R
