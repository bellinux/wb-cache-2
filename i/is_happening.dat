5|$|Although nothing <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> in this image, we {{associate}} the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave {{her life for}} her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E

The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.|$|E

The crew of an alternative Enterprise realise what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and seek to return him to his own reality, but, after an attack by a Bajoran ship, a space-time fissure explodes, causing hundreds of thousands of alternative versions of the Enterprise to enter the same universe.

5|$|There {{are obvious}} {{connections}} {{in the design of}} the Slaying of Holofernes and the Slaying of Haman at the opposite end of the chapel.

There are actually three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, we see him at the table with Esther and the King and get a view of the King on his bed. Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E

5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E
