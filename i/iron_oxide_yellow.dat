An alternative and perhaps a more likely explanation for the co-location of both cobalt (Co) and tin (Sn) could be the use of cerulean blue, then mixed with yellows such as cobalt yellow or an <b>iron</b> (Fe) <b>oxide</b> <b>yellow,</b> and also with chromium (Cr) oxide to achieve a green/blueish colour.|$|R
50|$|Chumash {{rock art}} depicts images like humans, animals, {{celestial}} bodies, and other (at times ambiguous) shapes and patterns. These depictions vary considerably {{and appear to}} be in no particular order or arrangement. The colors of the paintings vary as well, from red or black monochromes (different shades of a single color) to elaborate polychromes (many various colors). The Chumash made paint from a mixture of mineralized soil, stone mortar, and some kind of liquid binder like blood or oil from animals or mashed seeds. The addition of an oil binder helped to make the paint permanent and waterproof. Orange and red paint contained hematite or <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> while <b>yellow</b> came from limonite, blue and green from copper or serpentine, white from kaolin clays or gypsum, and black from manganese or charcoal. Paint was applied with a person's finger or a brush. Grant organized the types of images depicted in the paintings into two categories: representational and abstract. Representational images include squares, circles and triangles, zigzags, crisscrosses, parallel lines, and pinwheels. Grant noted that in settled villages, abstract paintings were prominent, while the areas occupied by bands of hunting people reveal representational images.|$|R
30|$|The {{kaolinite}} clay was {{collected from the}} exposed faces at a deposit site situated in Ijero Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria. It is a soft, white clay mineral produced by the chemical weathering of aluminium silicate minerals like feldspar. Kaolinite clay is usually colored pink–orange–red by <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> giving it distinct rust hue. Lighter concentrations of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> yield white, <b>yellow</b> or light orange colors. The pure white color of clay may indicate little or no iron contamination which would have given it rusty color. All chemicals used in this work are reagents grade materials. The modifying materials are anatase TiO 2 nanoparticle and AgNO 3, which is the silver ion source. Sodium carbonate (99.0  %, Na 2 CO 3) was used to reduce the silver ions. The Ag-TiO 2 material expectedly served as a photocatalyst enhancing the remediation functionality of the main ceramic porous structure. Coir dust was the biomaterials incorporated into the ceramic adsorbent. Just like the geological minerals used, they are also abundant and low-cost organic material.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Kees van Dongen {{was one of the}} most famous {{painters}} of the twentieth century, only little information about his palette and his technique is available. To contribute to the characterization of van Dongen’s painting materials, La Violoniste, painted by the artist around 1922, has been analyzed by using three complementary techniques: macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF), Raman spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging. The elemental repartition given by MA-XRF and the results obtained thanks to Raman spectroscopy help us to complete the identification of pigments contained in La Violoniste (lead white, <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> cadmium <b>yellow,</b> vermilion, Prussian blue, titanium white, ultramarine, a red lake, a chromium pigment and carbon black) while the results obtained via hyperspectral imaging reveal a hidden woman portrait. Besides {{the fact that}} Kees van Dongen was particularly renowned for his female portraits, this hidden composition presents stylistic similarities with the well-known portraits produced by the artist from around 1920, when he was a famous worldly portraitist. Thanks to Raman spectroscopy, visual examination and MA-XRF, we show that the original background contains ultramarine, the hidden portrait’s clothes are maybe made of the same colour as the present violinist’s dress and her face contains zinc, contrary to the violinist’s flesh which is mainly made of lead white.|$|R

METHODS: The labeling of mesenchymal stem cells was performed using the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran complexed and not complexed to poly-L-lysine. Superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran was incubated with poly-L-lysine in an ultrasonic sonicator at 37 °C for 10 minutes for complex formation superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine by electrostatic interaction. Then, the mesenchymal stem cells were incubated overnight with the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran. After the incubation period the mesenchymal stem cells were evaluated by internalization of the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran by Prussian Blue stain. Cellular viability of labeled mesenchymal stem cells was evaluated by cellular proliferation assay using 5, 6 -carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl ester method and apoptosis detection by Annexin V- Propidium Iodide assay. RESULTS: mesenchymal stem cells labeled with superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran without poly-L-lysine not internalized efficiently the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles due to its low presence detected within cells. Mesenchymal stem cells labeled with the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine efficiently internalized the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles due to greater presence in the cells interior. The viability and apoptosis assays demonstrated that the mesenchymal stem cells labeled and not labeled respectively with the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine continue to proliferate over seven days and the percentage of cells in early or late apoptosis is low compared to the percentage of live cells over the three days. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the use of poly-L-lysine complexed with superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran provides better internalization of these superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles in mesenchymal stem cells Thus, we demonstrated that this type of labeling is not cytotoxic to the mesenchymal stem cells, since the viability and apoptosis assays showed that the cells remain alive and proliferating.
