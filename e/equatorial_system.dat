40|$|Theoretical {{investigation}} {{of the possibility of}} obtaining systematic corrections to star catalogs from observations of artificial satellites. A model is established to represent the system of equations formed when such corrections are determined simultaneously with corrections to the geocentric position of the observer. An analytical expression for the covariance matrix is set up for the two-dimensional (planar) case. The resulting correlations and weights are discussed. Since this method presents an independent way of obtaining the systematic errors in star catalogs, apart from the orientation to the <b>equatorial</b> <b>system,</b> it is related to the measurement of all quantities which depend on star positions. This institutes a completely new principle of obtaining systematic corrections to star catalogs.

30|$|As {{regards the}} <b>equatorial</b> <b>system,</b> for instance, {{positive}} flux patches traveled westward about 70 °– 90 ° {{in a period}} of 270 – 320  years, corresponding to a traveling speed of about 0.26 °– 0.27 °/year (16 – 17  km/year), while negative flux patches are characterized by displacements of 45 degrees over an interval of 200  years, meaning a moving speed of ~  0.23 °/year (~  14  km/year). The dominant traveling speed of ~  17  km/year is also observed at Northern Hemisphere mid latitudes (20 °– 40 °). The moving speeds are increasing at higher latitudes (40 °– 60 °N) ranging from about 20  km/year up to about 26  km/year. This is in line with the flow calculations of Gillet et al. (2015 a) that show a westward planetary gyre along the equator and midlatitude eddies with westward flow in the Atlantic hemisphere. A less clear picture characterizes the Southern Hemisphere, perhaps as a result of poorer input data coverage of the model. The Pacific hemisphere (between 90 °E and 90 °W) is characterized by seemingly standing patches, over periods of about 100  years, of weaker, time variable intensity, with a (quasi)period of ~  80  years.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we use multi-year time series to examine the dynamic {{characteristics}} of coupled physical-biogeochemical processes that modulate interannual coastal hypoxia in the Benguela upwelling system in the southeast Atlantic. The results confirmed earlier findings {{on the role of}} advection to explain much of the seasonal-decadal variability. These results challenge the predominantly biogeochemical basis, namely benthic-pelagic coupling, to understand the variability of hypoxia and its ecosystem implications. Unexpectedly, the results showed that the variability was insensitive to changes in the electron-donating capacity (carbon export fluxes) but strongly dependent on the advected oxygen fluxes. The dynamics of the interaction of equatorial and polar boundary conditions (ocean-shelf exchange) and seasonally phased shelf advection were the key forcing functions that explained hypoxia variability in seasonal-decadal time scales. The vulnerability of the system to climate change lies in the long-term response of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>system</b> that governs seasonal and interannual warming at the Angola-Benguela front as well as wind stress in the Luderitz southern boundary that governs ventilation. The proposed model was able to explain most of the decadal scale variability of two different ecosystem-state indicators.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} orbital {{perturbations}} of the cubesats that lie on LEO due to Earth albedo. The motivation for this paper {{originated in the}} investigation of the orbital perturbations for closed- Earth pico-satellites due to the sunlight reflected by the Earth (the albedo). Having assumed that the Sun lies on the equator, the albedo irradiance is calculated using a numerical model in which irradiance depends on the geographical latitude, longitude and altitude of the satellite. However, in the present work the longitude dependency is disregarded. Albedo force and acceleration components are formulated using a detailed model in a geocentric <b>equatorial</b> <b>system</b> in which the Earth is an oblate spheroid. Lagrange planetary equations in its Gaussian form are used to analyze the orbital changes when e≠ 0 and i≠ 0. Based on the Earth’s reflectivity data measured by NASA Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS project), the orbital perturbations are calculated for some cubesats. The outcome of the numerical test shows that the albedo force has a significant contribution on the orbital perturbations of the pico-satellite which can affect the satellite life time.
