40|$|Devising an {{evacuation}} support plan for handicapped {{people who are}} most vulnerable <b>in</b> <b>disasters</b> is a nationwide pressing need.

However, the problem is complicated in making a evacuation support plan for the handicapped <b>in</b> <b>disasters</b> so that the progress is not well going. In this study, firstly distribution of refuges for the handicapped in Nagasaki City is evaluated with GIS, and secondly problems about evacuation support planning for handicapped people <b>in</b> <b>disasters</b> are structured. Finally, a new role of welfare institutions for supporting the handicapped <b>in</b> <b>disasters</b> is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Common {{to many of}} the {{repeated}} issues surrounding animals <b>in</b> <b>disasters</b> <b>in</b> the U. S. is a pre-existing weak animal health infrastructure that is under constant pressure resulting from pet overpopulation. Unless this root cause is addressed, communities remain vulnerable to similar issues with animals they and others have faced <b>in</b> past <b>disasters.</b> <b>In</b> the US the plight of animals <b>in</b> <b>disasters</b> is frequently viewed primarily as a response issue and frequently handled by groups that are not integrated with the affected community’s emergency management. In contrast, animals, their owners, and communities would greatly benefit from integrating animal issues into an overall emergency management strategy for the community. There is no other factor contributing as much to human evacuation failure <b>in</b> <b>disasters</b> that is under the control of emergency management when a threat is imminent as pet ownership. Emergency managers {{can take advantage of the}} bond people have with their animals to instill appropriate behavior amongst pet owners <b>in</b> <b>disasters...</b>|$|R

5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense <b>in</b> <b>disaster</b> scenarios.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I want to {{consider}} not only ethical principles <b>in</b> <b>disasters,</b> but the relationships between ethics <b>in</b> <b>disasters</b> and ethics <b>in</b> normal situations. To begin with, I define the concept of 'disaster', and make definite the meaning of 'in disaster'. In this paper, I use the period of 'in disaster' as {{the period of the}} impact of the disaster and of emergency phase. Ethical principles in that period are different from those of normal situations; however, as far as I know, I can find only a few papers that deal with the nature of ethical principles <b>in</b> <b>disasters</b> directly. Fortunately, there are a lot of literatures dealing with 'triage' from an ethical viewpoint. Therefore, I will take the approach of, first, examining the ethical principles in triage, and then, on the basis of it, considering the nature of ethical principles <b>in</b> <b>disasters.</b> Here, I stated several ethically important points; such as triage in medical settings is utilitarian but doesn't presuppose the good of the community; ethical principles <b>in</b> <b>disasters</b> are based on the primitive response to the requirement of self-preservation; <b>in</b> a <b>disaster</b> we are permitted to give priority to saving our life; at the base of ordinary ethics there is the factor of self-preservation; even <b>in</b> a <b>disaster,</b> ordinary ethical principles work secondarily; the situation of <b>disaster</b> is, <b>in</b> some aspects, similar to the state of nature or state of war in social contract theory...|$|R

5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. Central America, ended <b>in</b> <b>disaster</b> as the ship sank in a hurricane {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.|$|E

After she began working as a nurse, she went abroad with the Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires, a forerunner of the French Red Cross, to work in North Africa.
