5|$|After the Croatian Democratic Union won 1990 {{parliamentary}} {{elections in the}} Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs within the Republic worsened. The ethnic groups are also divided along religious lines as the Croats are Catholics while the Serbs are Orthodox Christians. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) forces to minimize resistance. On 17 August, tensions escalated <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, {{and parts of the}} Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. This revolt was followed in January 1991, by two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces.|$|E
5|$|Harith {{was from}} the Tamim tribe {{belonging}} to the north Arab (Mudari) tribal supergroup, and hailed from Basra, where his father, Surayj, lived. He is first mentioned in 729, when he distinguished himself for his bravery and self-sacrifice against the Turgesh, saving the Arab army from annihilation at Baykand near Bukhara. Harith is next mentioned in 733, when he led a protest in Lower Tokharistan against the commandeering of supplies from the province, already plagued by drought and famine, to feed the capital of Khurasan at Marw, by the governor Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri. Junayd had Harith flogged, but after Junayd died in early 734, the discontent erupted <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> rebellion, with Harith at its head.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the remnant}} low {{associated}} with Josephine {{began to show}} signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September7. Convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September8, wind shear took over the system again. Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> wave. However, on September10, the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September14, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fay was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October11. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear {{for most of its}} duration, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October12. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> trough early on October13.|$|E

Milan Babić, a dentist from the southern town of Knin, was elected president. Knin's police chief, Milan Martić, established paramilitary militias. The two men eventually became the political and military leaders of the SAO Krajina, a self-declared state incorporating the Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia.|$|E

5|$|On 17 February 1997, the W3C {{approved}} Yggdrasil {{to coordinate}} future development of Arena.

Yggdrasil licensed an X emulator from Pearl Software to port Arena to Windows, although these builds were never released. Yggdrasil didn't provide any official binaries at this time, because they didn't want to expand the community with alpha-quality software. Although users would be able to run Arena by compiling it from the published source code, volunteers created unofficial finished binaries. Yggdrasil had planned to implement browsing features that were already standard in competitive web browsers, which resulted in the new bookmarks feature in version 0.3.18 on 7 April 1997.|$|E
5|$|On May31, Tropical Depression One {{developed}} in the western Caribbean Sea, a day {{before the start of}} the Atlantic hurricane season. The depression moved northeastward, passing just northwest of Isla de la Juventud before striking the Cuban mainland south of Havana. As it crossed the country, its strongest rainfall was east of the center, and the depression failed to intensify beyond winds of 30mph (45km/h). The National Hurricane Center never expected it to strengthen further, due to unfavorable wind shear. After a hurricane hunters flight could not detect a circulation, The depression degenerated <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> trough east of Florida on June2.|$|E

5|$|The Corsica and Elba mines {{remained}} the chief {{source of employment}} until 1926, when the underground Elba mine closed. It had been mined out. A few years later, the Corsica mine was converted <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> pit, {{and the future of}} the town once again seemed secure. Then the Great Depression hit. In the fall of 1929, Corsica closed and stayed closed for many years, with only a few salaried people retained. The mine remained idle until 1940, ironically receiving an honorable mention in the National Safety Competition from the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1934. Once World War II began, the mining business boomed again.|$|E
5|$|The Presidio {{was built}} to {{standard}} plans for a Spanish colonial military headquarters, using locally available materials, so the buildings forming the outer square were constructed with thick, solid adobe outer walls. The main gate opened <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> parade ground/plaza {{in the center of}} the square. The chapel stood at the center of the back of the square, facing the gate across the plaza. While it was never attacked by a strong military force during its sixty years of operation, the Presidio was subject to the assaults of nature. Several devastating earthquakes in the early 19th century destroyed much of the structure.|$|E
5|$|The major {{hurricane}} intensified {{up until}} making landfall near Houma, Louisiana at 2300UTC late on August25, with winds estimated at 115mph (185km/h) {{and an estimated}} minimum barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.20inHg), based on a pressure report of 959mbar (hPa; 28.32inHg) in Houma. Maximum sustained winds extended 23mi (37km) from the hurricane's center. Once over land, however, the hurricane rapidly weakened. By 1200UTC on August26, the system had already degenerated to a tropical storm, while still located over Louisiana near Baton Rouge. The next day, the storm weakened further to tropical depression strength as it moved towards the west, before degenerating <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> trough of low pressure near Hillsboro, Texas by 1800UTC on August27.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression One was the wettest {{tropical}} cyclone in Cuba since Hurricane Flora of 1963. The first {{tropical cyclone}} of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, the system developed on May30 {{from an area}} of disturbed weather in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The tropical depression headed northeastward, making landfall in La Habana Province, Cuba without intensifying. Crossing Cuba, the depression became very disorganized as it emerged into the Straits of Florida and degenerated <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> trough on June2. Although only a tropical depression, the system flooded central and western Cuba with over 40inches (1000mm) of rain, causing 37fatalities, damage to over 1,000 houses, and the evacuation of about 65,000residents.|$|E
5|$|A Company moved south, shaking out <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> {{formation}} {{across a}} frontage of , with 2 Platoon {{on the right}} and 3 Platoon on the left, while 1 Platoon was in depth. Already in the dense vegetation, 2 Platoon—under Second Lieutenant Graham Ackland—had only advanced 150metres when a sniper was spotted in a tree and was subsequently shot by the platoon sergeant. Almost simultaneously, 3 Platoon was engaged with small arms fire, while behind them the company headquarters was engaged by more snipers. 2 Platoon assaulted straight into the main Viet Cong position with grenades and machine-guns. Breaking-in they moved forward, killing a number of Viet Cong in their weapon pits but suffering six casualties in less than a minute, with a third of the lead platoon falling wounded in the initial volleys. Pinned down and in trouble, Ackland realised that he was facing a sizable and well dug-in force and he attempted to move his sections into an all-round defensive perimeter in order to defend against any counter-attack; the Viet Cong did not attack however and instead remained in their pits. In an attempt to relieve 2 Platoon, O'Brien manoeuvred 1 and 3 Platoons, while requesting B Company support his right flank as soon as they arrived at the landing zone.|$|E
