50|$|The {{workpiece}} {{is held in}} the <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> in {{the same}} manner as a metalworking lathe. This is most commonly a chuck but can include a collet fitted directly into the spindle on the <b>indexing</b> <b>head,</b> faceplate, or between centers. If the part is long then it may be supported with the help of an accompanying tailstock.|$|E
50|$|Spur may be cut {{or ground}} on {{a milling machine}} or jig grinder {{utilizing}} a numbered gear cutter, and any <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> or rotary table. The number of the gear cutter {{is determined by the}} tooth count of the gear to be cut.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} product came in 1874 with William's {{invention of}} the first bevel gear planer, a planer with integral <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> designed to specialize in planing bevel gears. Planers and indexing heads had been combined before, but never in the winning form factor that William created specifically for gears.|$|E
50|$|CNC {{indexing}} heads may {{be controlled}} {{in two different}} modes. The most basic method of operation uses simple control functions built into the dividing head. It {{does not require a}} CNC machine. The operator enters the desired angle into a control box attached to the <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> and it automatically rotates to the desired position and locks into place for machining. Changing angles is as simple as typing a new angle value onto the control pad. This is simpler than setting up a manual <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> because {{there is no need to}} interchange indexing plates or to calculate which hole positions to use. It is also faster for repetitive operations because the work can be indexed by simply pressing a button, eliminating the need to count rotations of the hand crank or specific hole positions on the indexing plate. A CNC dividing head may be used in this manner on either manual or CNC machinery.|$|E
50|$|A {{rotary table}} is a {{precision}} work positioning device used in metalworking. It enables the operator to drill or cut work at exact intervals around a fixed (usually horizontal or vertical) axis. Some rotary tables allow the use of index plates for indexing operations, and some can also be fitted with dividing plates that enable regular work positioning at divisions for which indexing plates are not available. A rotary fixture used in this fashion is more appropriately called a dividing head (<b>indexing</b> <b>head).</b>|$|E
50|$|Non-IT-assisted {{physical}} guidance was {{the first}} means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the Industrial Revolution to progress into the Machine Age. It is achieved by jigs, fixtures, and machine tool parts and accessories, which control toolpath by {{the very nature of}} their shape, physically limiting the path for motion. Some archetypal examples, developed to perfection before the advent of the IT era, are , the turrets on manual turret lathes, <b>indexing</b> <b>heads</b> for manual milling machines, rotary tables, and various indexing fixtures and blocks that are simpler and less expensive than <b>indexing</b> <b>heads,</b> and serve quite well for most indexing needs in small shops. Although <b>indexing</b> <b>heads</b> of the pre-CNC era are now mostly obsolete in commercial manufacturing, the principle of purely mechanical indexing is still a vital part of current technology, in concert with IT, even as it has been extended to newer uses, such as the indexing of CNC milling machine toolholders or of indexable cutter inserts, whose precisely controlled size and shape allows them to be rotated or replaced quickly and easily without changing overall tool geometry.|$|R

Mike Harris, <b>Index’s</b> <b>Head</b> of Advocacy {{explains}} the reports findings on media concentration and argues that action is urgently needed to protect pluralism in Europe...|$|R
50|$|CNC <b>{{indexing}}</b> <b>heads</b> {{are similar}} in design to the manual variety except {{that they have a}} servo motor coupled to the spindle instead of a hand crank and indexing plates. The servo motor is electronically controlled to index the work to the required position. The control can either be a simple keypad for the operator or it may be fully CNC controlled.|$|R
50|$|Most CNC {{dividing}} {{heads are}} {{also able to}} function as a full CNC axis and may be wired into the control of a CNC machine. This enables the machine's main CNC controller to control the <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> just like it would control the other axes of the machine. This can be used to machine complex 3D shapes, helices with a non-constant pitch, and similar exotic parts. This mode of operation cannot be used on a manual machine tool because it requires a full CNC controller to operate.|$|E
50|$|Indexing is an {{operation}} of dividing a periphery of a cylindrical workpiece into {{equal number of}} divisions by the help of index crank and index plate.A manual <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> includes a hand crank. Rotating the hand crank in turn rotates the spindle and therefore the workpiece. The hand crank uses a worm gear drive to provide precise control of {{the rotation of the}} work. The work may be rotated and then locked into place before the cutter is applied, or it may be rotated during cutting {{depending on the type of}} machining being done.|$|E
50|$|An <b>indexing</b> <b>head,</b> {{also known}} as a {{dividing}} head or spiral head, is a specialized tool that allows a workpiece to be circularly indexed; that is, easily and precisely rotated to preset angles or circular divisions. Indexing heads are usually used on the tables of milling machines, but may be used on many other machine tools including drill presses, grinders, and boring machines. Common jobs for a dividing head include machining the flutes of a milling cutter, cutting the teeth of a gear, milling curved slots, or drilling a bolt hole circle around the circumference of a part.|$|E
50|$|Other {{applications}} of the Geneva drive include the pen change mechanism in plotters, automated sampling devices, banknote counting machines, and many forms of indexable equipment used in manufacturing (such as the tool changers in CNC machines; the turrets of turret lathes, screw machines, and turret drills; some kinds of <b>indexing</b> <b>heads</b> and rotary tables; and so on). The Iron Ring Clock uses a Geneva mechanism to provide intermittent motion to one of its rings.|$|R

However, the variables have failed in describing the local deformations and morphological changes, which are proposed to more likely induce neurological disorders...|$|R
5000|$|Brown and Sharpe <b>{{indexing}}</b> <b>heads</b> {{include a}} set of 3 indexing plates. The plates are marked #1, #2 and #3, or [...] "A", [...] "B" [...] and [...] "C".

50|$|In these decades, Brown & Sharpe and the Cincinnati Milling Machine Company {{dominated}} the milling machine field. However, {{hundreds of other}} firms also built milling machines at the time, and many were significant in various ways. Besides {{a wide variety of}} specialized production machines, the archetypal multipurpose milling machine of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was a heavy knee-and-column horizontal-spindle design with power table feeds, <b>indexing</b> <b>head,</b> and a stout overarm to support the arbor. The evolution of machine design was driven not only by inventive spirit but also by the constant evolution of milling cutters that saw milestone after milestone from 1860 through World War I.|$|E
5000|$|In 1861, Frederick W. Howe, {{while working}} for the Providence Tool Company, asked Joseph R. Brown of Brown & Sharpe for a {{solution}} to the problem of milling spirals, such as the flutes of twist drills. These were usually filed by hand at the time. (Helical planing existed but was by no means common.) Brown designed a [...] "universal milling machine" [...] that, starting from its first sale in March 1862, was wildly successful. It solved the problem of 3-axis travel (i.e., the axes that we now call XYZ) much more elegantly than had been done in the past, and it allowed for the milling of spirals using an <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> fed in coordination with the table feed. The term [...] "universal" [...] was applied to it because it was ready for any kind of work, including toolroom work, and was not as limited in application as previous designs. (Howe had designed a [...] "universal miller" [...] in 1852, but Brown's of 1861 is the one considered a groundbreaking success.) ...|$|E

40|$|Main memory {{index is}} built with the {{assumption}} that the RAM is suﬃciently large to hold data. Due to the volatility and high unit price of main memory, indices under secondary memory such as SSD and HDD are widely used. However, the I/O operation with main memory is still the bottleneck for query eﬃciency. In this paper, we propose a self-tuning indexing scheme called Tide-tree for RAM/Disk-based hybrid storage system. Tide-tree aims to overcome the obstacles main memory and disk-based indices face, and per- forms like the tide to achieve a double-win in space and performance, which is self-adaptive with respect to the running environment. Particularly, Tide- tree delaminates the tree structure adaptively with high eﬃciency based on storage sense, and applies an eﬀective self-tuning algorithm to dynamically load various nodes into main memory. We employ memory mapping technol- ogy to solve the persistent problem of main memory index, and improves the eﬃciency of data synchronism and pointer translation. To further enhance the independence of Tide-tree, we employ the <b>index</b> <b>head</b> and the level address ta- ble to manage the whole index. With the <b>index</b> <b>head,</b> three eﬃcient operations are proposed, namely index rebuild, index load and range search. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare the Tide-tree with several state- of-the-art indices, and the results have validated the high eﬃciency, reusability and stability of Tide-tree...|$|R
