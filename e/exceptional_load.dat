40|$|In view {{of recent}} {{disasters}} and their immense economical and human consequences {{more and more}} focus is given {{not only on the}} safety of structures - to reduce the risk for the life of people by collapse even under <b>exceptional</b> <b>loading</b> – but on minimizing the disastrous results and to enable a quick rebuilding and reuse. One crucial mean to achieve this aim is the design of redundant robust structures. Robustness prevents the collapse of the total structure when only parts of the structure are damaged or destroyed. To avoid progressive failure, redundant structures with inherent sufficient ductile behaviour allowing deformations when a local failure occurs, have to be built. Redundancy can be achieved by allowing force redistribution within a structural system. Therefore the single sections and joints have to be especially designed and optimized, not necessarily requiring additional fabrication costs. But until now no specific rules for robustness by ductile joints exist. The aim of the present project is to define general requirements for ductile joints as part of a structural system subjected to <b>exceptional</b> unforeseen <b>loading...</b>|$|R

The traffic management in the underground, e. g. railway tunnels, roads and subways, or providing other services, e. g. pipes for water supply or hydropower and sanitation, represents a growing need for civilized countries. The paper presents some new design aspects aimed at the construction of prefabricated lining segments for urban tunnels in soft ground, able to ensure adequate structural performance under <b>exceptional</b> <b>loads,</b> such as fire and explosion within the structure. The design problems and the advantages resulting from the adoption of high performance fiber reinforced materials, like High Performance Fibers Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC) and Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) and Textiles (TRC) are described, pointing out the critical issue {{in the design of}} a new prototype characterized by a layered structure.

40|$|Road {{networks}} in mountainous areas {{are particularly vulnerable}} following natural and man-made incidents since they are sparse and have {{a limited number of}} links and nodes. This weakness, or vulnerability, complicates the management of traffic flows in the event of emergencies, thus leading to problems of congestion and accessibility. The case of the international corridors along Alpine Valleys is significant since they serve both tourist and commercial routes, and have a typical tree-like structure that accommodates few roads dedicated to long-distance mobility and to local access. To manage emergencies and support the decision making process, local administrations and Civil Protection Agencies should use tools able to evaluate the effects of localized or widespread network failures or incidents in real-time, and limit the effects of reduced accessibility and/or differentiated traffic demand. The authors have developed a dedicated tool, called PoliNET that implements the Network Analyst® extension of ArcGIS® to solve specific vehicle routing problems for mountainous road network. Essentially, PoliNET identifies the best (shortest and fastest) routes for different vehicle categories (cars and motorcycles, vans and small trucks, articulated lorry and tractor-trailers, <b>exceptional</b> <b>load</b> vehicles) when the network operates under specific constraints (road clearances) and/or experiencing failures (interruption).

40|$|Higher {{resolution}} and reliability are the desiderata for Computational Fluid Dynamics and main drivers for the development, implementation and validation of highorder accurate methods. Complex fluid dynamic phenomena such as shock-wave boundary-layer interactions, turbulent separated flows and fluid problems involving multiple scales are adequately resolved with high-order schemes. The spatial {{representation of the}} flow field by an unstructured mesh provides flexibility, automation, fast and effortless grid generation and <b>exceptional</b> <b>load</b> balance on multiple processor computers. This plethora of advantages is mirrored by the unprecedented popularity of unstructured-based schemes. The objective of this PhD project is the implementation of two high-order schemes for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations {{in the context of}} the finite volume “kexact” framework: the MUSCL-TVD and WENO. The schemes are formulated in two and three space dimensions for mixed-element unstructured meshes; in addition, the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is implemented into the developed numerical framework. A wide range of applications are considered spanning from low-speed flows (M = 0. 08) to supersonic conditions (M = 5. 0); inviscid and viscous simulations in a broad spectrum of Reynolds numbers ranging from Re = 500 up to Re = 37 × 106. The applications include: the Taylor-Green vortex, the ONERA-M 6 wing, flat plate, the NACA- 0012 and the MD 30 P- 30 N aerofoils, and a shock-wave boundary-layer interaction. For the examined cases, WENO schemes demonstrate superior accuracy, numerical dissipation and non-oscillatory behaviour over the MUSCL-TVD. High-order schemes inherit low numerical dissipation properties while turbulence models induce dissipation, this disequilibrium has adverse effects on the stability, convergence and accuracy of the simulation; therefore, turbulence model re-calibration would be required in order to accommodate high-order discretisation methods...|$|E
30|$|Unexpected heavy loads, such as big {{earthquake}} and strong typhoon, may {{be handled by}} a para-stressing system that exerts required counterforce as required (Montes 1996). The para-stressing system activates control devices including actuators to offset stresses induced by the strain or deformation of the bridge to restore the bridge to the original condition. The para-stressing system is composed of detection and sensing, decision-making and instruction, and control functions. The detection and sensing function involves the sensing of loading and the identification of conditions of structures (Yan et al. 20102011). The decision-making and instruction function helps determine whether control measures are required or not and send instructions to the control function whenever necessary. The control function is aimed at operating actuators or other devices to apply required forces to the structure. In the papers of Magaña et al. (1998) and Casas (2000), the active control of cable-stayed bridges subject to accidental loads due to earthquake is presented. There, only a theoretical approach was made, using a finite element model of a cable-stayed bridge as the prototype where the control algorithms were applied. The research wanted to demonstrate the feasibility and workability of using the control algorithms in the controllability of such a para-stressing system. The {{results showed that the}} control algorithms were very effective in reducing the magnitude of the deflections of the deck caused by the vertical component of an earthquake. In the present paper, the control is applied to a physical and not only mathematical model, and the <b>exceptional</b> <b>load</b> is due to the traffic load instead of earthquake. The experience is a new step forward to the implementation in full-scale structures. In this study, an Internet monitoring system (IMS) via communication networks was built for a cable-stayed bridge model and then a para-stressing system was developed using the IMS.|$|E

40|$|Water {{turbines}} are {{since some}} years widely used for grid stabilization purposes {{according to their}} <b>exceptional</b> <b>load</b> variation capability which gives them the ability to compensate grid fluctuations initiated by the customer’s consumption or intermittent electricity production systems such as wind and solar power. Different renewable power generation technologies can be combined in mini-grids to electrify isolated villages and extend existing grid networks. In these occasions, small hydro units are also a good option to reduce the overall variability of supply to low levels and provide low‑cost, local electrification solutions. Hence, initially designed hydropower turbines for steady operation at on-design operating condition experience many off-design, start/stop and load variations during their life time according to the nowadays on-demand energy market and introduction of intermittent power generation systems to the electricity market. Start/stop and load variations can be harsh for the turbines due to the time dependent forces exerted on {{different parts of the}} turbines, especially rotating parts. Off-design performance of hydropower systems may also result in unfavorable and harmful periodic forces on the rotating parts. Therefore, investigations are required to study these working conditions and consider them in design of new hydropower plants and refurbished turbines. This was the motivation for the experimental investigation of a Kaplan turbine during on-design, off-design and transient operations with focus on the turbine’s rotor. The test case was a 1 : 3. 1 scaled model of Porjus U 9; a Kaplan turbine. The first paper deals with pressure measurements on the runner blades of the model under steady state operating conditions to find and quantify the sources of pressure fluctuations exerted on the runner at different operating points. The goal was to investigate the turbine’s performance at the best efficiency point with concentration on the performance of the water supply system and compare it to operations at high load and part load for a constant blades angle. The model results are compared with prototype measurements to corroborate the findings. The second paper presents the model investigations during load acceptance and load rejection. The model was investigated with pressure measurement on the stationary and rotating parts of the turbine under different load variations between part load, high load and best efficiency point. The third paper focuses on velocity measurements in the runner blade channels and at the runner outlet under on-design and off-design operating conditions. The velocity measurements are performed with a laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) system. The results of the model investigations along two propeller curves are presented to investigate the runner blade angle effects on the turbine’s performance.
