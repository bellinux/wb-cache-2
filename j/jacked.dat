5|$|A Titan's {{durability}} {{depends on}} its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously <b>jacked</b> and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Many {{superficial}} inspections {{were performed}} on the locomotive in 1980 and it {{was found to be}} in relatively sound mechanical condition. There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections, and when the wheels were <b>jacked</b> off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable. One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods {{for the first time since}} its last semi-operation. After the compressed air blew some dirt and debris out of the locomotive's exhaust stack, it was soon running smoothly.|$|E
5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in a shower of sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be <b>jacked</b> up to remove the bomb.|$|E

25|$|It took {{eight to}} twenty hours in soft soil or gravel to {{excavate}} the large firing pit required {{to hold the}} halves of the base box. Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was <b>jacked</b> up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was <b>jacked</b> down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails and then they were bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was <b>jacked</b> down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to guide the carriage wagon into position and the carriage was <b>jacked</b> up while the wagon was removed and it was then <b>jacked</b> down and bolted to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the barrel clamp. The crew pulled on the ropes and slid the barrel into the cradle.

25|$|The old {{cantilever}} bridge {{was connected to}} the Yerba Buena tunnel with a double-deck truss causeway that included a curved section. As this structure occupied an area that must be clear for the new bridge approach, it was necessary to construct an entirely new, temporary approach to the old bridge. This was required to swing to the south to clear the area for new construction, and then back to the north with a more severe curve to connect to the cantilever. As there would only be a few days available during which the bridge could be shut to traffic, the curved portion was built adjacent to its final position on a trestle that extended beneath and beyond the old curved connector. During replacement, the old section was <b>jacked</b> out of the way (to the north), and the new section <b>jacked</b> into place.|$|E

25|$|During the 19th century {{it became}} {{uneconomical}} to mine for the salt. Instead hot water was pumped through the mines, which dissolved the salt. The resultant brine was pumped {{out and the}} salt extracted from the brine. This technique weakened the mines and led to land subsidence as they collapsed. Subsidence affected {{the town and the}} surrounding landscape. For example, collapses in 1880 formed Witton Flash as the River Weaver flowed into a huge hole caused by subsidence. Subsidence also allegedly accounts for many old timber-framed houses in the town centre, which were better able to withstand the movement of the ground. Some houses were built on a base of steel girders that could be <b>jacked</b> up to level the house with each change in the underlying ground. The town's historical link with the salt industry is celebrated in its museum, which is today located in the old workhouse.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} their {{apparent}} rivalry, Brunel and Stephenson were great personal friends, {{to the extent that}} they supported each other professionally. When Stephenson was under pressure during the enquiry following the collapse of his cast-iron girder bridge over the River Dee killing several people, Brunel did not desert him. In spite of his extreme distrust of the use of cast-iron girders for such purposes, Brunel refused to condemn them when cross-examined as an expert witness. He was also present to provide Stephenson moral support, when the great Britannia box-girders were floated across the river prior to being <b>jacked</b> up to their final positions. So when it came to the revolutionary design at Chepstow, The Times of 24 February 1852, reported that “Mr Stephenson, the eminent engineer, has examined the (great railway) bridge (at Chepstow) and concurred in the plan adopted by Mr Brunel...”.|$|E
500|$|With no working prototypes, Green {{set about}} {{building}} seven lifts. The principle was simple. Two caissons were suspended from three carrying wheels of [...] diameter, by wrought iron chains. The caisson {{at the bottom}} was <b>jacked</b> against the front wall of the lift to seal it, and a door or gate was opened to allow the boat to float in. The caisson at the top was <b>jacked</b> {{against the back wall}} in a similar manner. When both boats were in, the doors on the caissons and lift were closed, and the jacks released. Because a boat displaces its own weight in water, the system should be balanced, and a small amount of energy is required to start the boats moving. When the top caisson reaches the bottom, the jacks are applied, the doors are opened, and the boats can continue.|$|E

When Dot lets <b>Jack</b> know of Charlie's plan to return to Ireland with Matthew, <b>Jack</b> is infuriated. He declares that Charlie will never get custody of Matthew as this would mean breaking his promise to Ronnie. When Charlie says that Ronnie got what she deserved, <b>Jack</b> punches Charlie, only to be stopped by Max who tells <b>Jack</b> he may have lost his chances of keeping Matthew.
