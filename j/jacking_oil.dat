40|$|The resolve of {{journal bearing}} field {{problems}} and the full vibrational assessment of an industrial gas turbine, simple cycle rotor train, ABB’s GTllN 2 is presented. Three units experienced several times damage of the journal bearings on the compressor end. The analysis of the damage, including tests, indicated that insufficient <b>jacking</b> <b>oil</b> flow was the cause. The jacking concept was corrected and starting history has proven reliable operation, resulting in not one additional failure...|$|E
40|$|Figures {{presented}} periodically by {{classification societies}} show, {{a major cause}} of ship casualty to be stem bearing failure. This is particularly the case for large fall bodied bulk carriers and tankers. Non-uniform wake distribution around the stem of vessels causes uneven and constantly varying loads upon the bearing. These loads are examined and it is concluded that they may cause lubricant film breakdown and seal failures. Examination of stem bearing failures generally confirms this view and several bearing case histories are presented Present designs of stem bearings are appraised with the conclusion that all recent advances in stem bearing design have been for the purpose of improving maintainability rather than reliability. Examination of the loading pattern and the basic design requirements of stem gear indicate that the provision of <b>jacking</b> <b>oil</b> would considerably improve stem gear reliability. This is particularly aimed at reducing the frequency of failure caused by turning gear operation. Experimental work in which oil film thickness measurements were taken on the aftermost bearing of a container ship is presented. This clearly demonstrates the problem of turning gear damage. Furthermore the shaft movements recorded at this plummer bearing show that considerable tallshaft lift (the full stem bearing clearance is taken up) occurs and that the tailskaft probably executes a closed loop under the action of the propeller. Design curves are given to show the lubricating oil pressures and quantities required. It is further postulated that, within the framework of existing classification society rules full hydrostatic lubrication would have even greater advantages. Design curves to a basis of shaft diameter are presented to enable clearance, pressure, lubricant flow, stiffness and basic dimensions to be derived by simple calculation. Experimental data on suitable materials are given and an overall material specification produced. Designs are given for three typical ship types and based upon these, cost comparisons made. Costs are such that an economic as well as technical case can be advanced for the use of hydrostatic stern bearings...|$|E
40|$|Lakvijaya Power {{station with}} a {{capacity}} of 300 MW is designed to deliver generated power to national grid initially over Veyangoda transmission lines. But {{there is no other}} auxiliary power supply from the grid. In addition to above lines, there is no other auxiliary power supply from the grid. Since commissioning of the plant, two incidents have taken place showing the inadequacy of the existing arrangement. At 12. 15 hours on 7 th June 2011, the Plant had been in operation at 260 MW & 181 MVar and Veyangoda line 1 and 2 tripped from Veyangoda end which resulted in an Island wide blackout. Lakvijaya machine tripped without stabilizing at the house load. Consequently the plant was without an electricity supply. At the same time Standby diesel generator of 800 kVA failed to start. Further, Plant DC supply failed causing an unsafe shutdown resulting damages and lifetime reductions to the plant and its subsystems such as rupturing of the diaphragm in LP turbine, drop in drum water level below tripping limit, rising condenser hot well level closer to the tripping limit, rising condenser vacuum pressure up to tripping limit, rising condenser steam temperature to a level which effect to condenser tubes and damaging of bearing due to pressure dropped in <b>jacking</b> <b>oil</b> pressure etc. A similar failure took place on 08 th August 2012. This study is carried out to investigate the different options available to improve power supply situation eliminating such incidents in future. Initially all subsystems of the plant had been thoroughly analyzed and identified all possible bad consequences on the subsystems due to improper shutdown. A time analysis was done to find out the time taken by each subsystem to reach its tripping limits or withstanding time of subsystem before component failure during such an improper shutdown process. After collecting data from the site, detailed power system analysis including load flow studies were conducted using the ‘Power World Simulator’ software package considering possible unit auxiliary standby power supply options available during blackout condition. In that analysis below mentioned seven possible options were identified and studied. i) from Kothmale power plant, ii) from Kelanitissa Fiat gas turbine power plant, iii) from Kelanitissa combine cycle power plant, iv) from Kerawalapitiya combine cycle power plant, v) from Heladanavi diesel plant at Puttalam through 220 kV line, vi) from Heladanavi diesel plant at Puttalam through 33 kV line, vii) from 6 × 2. 5 MW diesel plants at Lakvijaya power station. Finally it was identified and concluded that 6 of 2. 5 MW standby synchronized diesel generators with 15 sec restoration time should be installed...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} programme consisted in validating a design method for {{the prediction of}} stress redistribution due to concrete creep within the cross-section of an innovative prebent steel VHPC beam.

The recorded strain signals are in good agreement with the computed values. The accuracy of the stress variation measurements is about 0. 2 MPa. During the 4 months of data recording in the instrumented prebent steel VHPC beam, the difference between the absolute stress value measured by the two active stressmeters and the computed stress has kept lower than 1 MPa...|$|R
30|$|In this study, outriggers, {{which are}} {{horizontal}} structures connecting a building core to distant columns {{to increase the}} lateral stiffness of a tall building, are proposed to reduce DAS. Conventionally, the permanent connection of outriggers to perimeter columns is delayed until {{the completion of the}} structure to avoid the development of shear forces that could be caused by DAS because the outriggers have been conventionally designed to reduce the lateral displacement caused by wind or earthquake loads. Special construction methods, such as delayed joints and adjustment joints with shim plates or <b>oil</b> <b>jacks,</b> have been proposed or used to minimize the impact of DAS during construction (Choi and Joseph 2012; Park et al. 2010). Although the main purpose of the outriggers is to limit the lateral drift of a tall building within an acceptable level (Wu and Li 2003; Hoenderkamp 2008; Lee and Tovar 2014), it is proposed that outriggers can also function as a measure to reduce DAS between core walls and perimeter columns. If the outriggers are designed to reduce DAS and lateral displacement, the additional stresses caused by DAS should be evaluated and considered during the design phase of a tall building.|$|R
