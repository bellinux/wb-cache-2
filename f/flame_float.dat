60|$|But {{she turned}} away, {{and set off}} towards the lake. Below, on the water, {{lanterns}} were coming alight, faint ghosts of warm <b>flame</b> <b>floating</b> in the pallor of the first twilight. The earth was spread with darkness, like lacquer, overhead was a pale sky, all primrose, and the lake was pale as milk in one part. Away at the landing stage, tiniest points of coloured rays were stringing themselves in the dusk. The launch was being illuminated. All round, shadow was gathering from the trees.|$|R
60|$|For there, in {{the midst}} between the fountains, was a long low table spread with flowers and strange fruits and nuts, and lit with clear, pear-shaped <b>flames</b> <b>floating</b> {{in the air like}} that of the Wonderstone, but of the colours of ivory and emerald and amethyst; with {{nineteen}} platters of silver and nineteen goblets of gold. And presently they heard in the distance the grasshopper voices of the Hill-mulgars, as they came stubbling along with Thimble's litter in their midst, carrying their heavy faggots and bottles and bundles, their pink eyes blinking, their knees trembling, not knowing whether to be joyful or afraid.|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, {{on board}} Mississippi, Captain Melancton Smith saw Richmond coming {{downstream}} but, {{because of the}} heavy smoke of the battle, was unable to sight Monongahela. Thinking that she had steamed ahead {{to close the gap}} caused by Richmonds leaving the formation, he ordered his ship [...] "go ahead fast". In attempting to do so, Mississippi ran aground and, despite every effort, could not be brought off. After being set afire in four places, she was abandoned. At 3:00 a.m., Mississippi was seen in <b>flames</b> <b>floating</b> slowly down river; and, two and one-half hours later, she blew up. Thus ended one of the wars fiercest engagements. Only Hartford and Albatross had succeeded in running the gauntlet.|$|R
5|$|Local {{shipping}} {{accidents are}} among {{the responsibilities of the}} Phoenix. In September 1965, the Norwegian freighter MS Berganger collided with the tanker Independent, resulting in fires aboard the ships. Phoenix responded along with U.S. Coast Guard fireboats to quickly put out the freighter's blaze, but the tanker took longer to extinguish. A year later, a gasoline barge collided with rocks near the shore. While Phoenix and the Coast Guard were investigating, the barge exploded killing two Coast Guardsmen and one nearby workman. Phoenix rescued a third Coast Guardsman with severe injuries, and fought to snuff the blaze. <b>Flaming,</b> <b>floating</b> gasoline proved difficult to subdue. In December 2011, a tourist DUKW boat suffered an engine fire while in McCovey Cove, and Phoenix doused the flames while the Coast Guard rescued the passengers and crew.|$|R
50|$|The navigator/bomb-aimer {{would perform}} {{the latter of}} these roles in a prone {{position}} within the aircraft's nose. For bomb-aiming, a drift fight, camera, and steering control over the auto-pilot were provided; directly above this position was the front turret position of the bomber. Just aft of the wireless operator's position, the centre section of the wing cut across the fuselage; the space above this was used for storing oxygen tanks while the space below {{was used as a}} rest bunk. Behind the rest area, the uninterrupted deck ran across the full length of the bomb cells to the location in which the retractable ventral turret was installed upon early production aircraft; the internal area aft of this position were used to store <b>flame</b> <b>floats</b> and reconnaissance flares, as well as an escape hatch, lavatory, rear turret position, and the crew entry door on the port side.|$|R
5000|$|Hitodama: Yūrei are {{frequently}} depicted as being {{accompanied by a}} pair of <b>floating</b> <b>flames</b> or will o' the wisps (hitodama in Japanese) in eerie colors such as blue, green, or purple. These ghostly flames are separate parts of the ghost rather than independent spirits.|$|R
5000|$|The S.26 was {{designed}} as an enlarged Short C-Class Empire flying boat, also incorporating features from the Short Sunderland. Greater use of extrusions in the structure, rather than bent sheet sections, compared to the C-Class aircraft, helped to keep the weight down.It was powered by four 1,400 hp (1,044 kW) Bristol Hercules sleeve valve radial engines, and it {{was designed}} with the capability of crossing the Atlantic without refuelling, and was intended to form the backbone of Imperial Airways' Empire services. The plan was for the first aircraft to make long range runs, the second would operate medium length (2,000 miles) flights with a dozen passengers, and the third would make short range (1,000 miles) trips with 24 passengers. It could fly 6,000 miles unburdened, or 150 passengers for a [...] "short hop". The S.26/M version had defensive armament of 12 0.303 inch machine guns in two dorsal, and one tail, Boulton Paul BPA Mk II four-gun turrets. Offensive armament was eight 500 lb (227 kg) bombs under the wings. There was internal stowage for 20 reconnaissance flares, 28 <b>flame</b> <b>floats</b> and 8 smoke floats. Air to Surface Vessel (ASV) radar was fitted, plus armour plating for the internal fuel tanks and the crew stations.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lords, ladies, and gentlemen," [...] {{he began}} in a choking voice, and then broke down completely. It was a very painful and pathetic spectacle. A feeling of intense {{discomfort}} afflicted the minds of all who looked upon that trembling relic of a man, as he stood there weeping and stammering. It was as though a breath of the wind of death had blown suddenly through the room, lifting the vapours of wine and tobacco-smoke, quenching the laughter and the candle <b>flames.</b> Eyes <b>floated</b> uneasily, not knowing where to look. Lord Badgery, with great presence of mind, offered the old man a glass of wine. Mr. Tillotson began to recover. The guests heard him murmur a few disconnected words.|$|R
50|$|Eastern Orthodox Christians {{still use}} oil lamps in their churches, home prayer corners {{and in the}} cemeteries. A vigil lamp {{consists}} of a votive glass containing a half-inch of water and filled the rest with olive oil. The glass has a metal holder that hangs from a bracket on the wall or sits on a table. A cork float with a lit wick floats on the oil. To douse the <b>flame,</b> the <b>float</b> is carefully pressed down into the oil. Makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a ball of cotton in olive oil and forming it into a peak. The peak is lit and then burns until all the oil is consumed, whereupon {{the rest of the}} cotton burns out. Olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries.|$|R
50|$|That night, Sarah and Marco are {{visited in}} their beds by <b>floating</b> <b>flames</b> which they suspect {{represent}} their dead parents. The following morning, Guido is about accept a generous check from Carlo for renovation of the house when a violent flashback, {{brought on by the}} supernatural forces within the house, shocks him into screaming his guilt for all to hear. He runs off and accidentally gets run over and killed by an oncoming truck on the road.|$|R
50|$|Defense units {{serve to}} defend the base. There are units against Land (defensive cannon M779, large long range {{artillery}} Bertha, land mine IMS), Air (floating missile launcher GAAM, turret AP250, floating turret Phalanx, anti-air S.A.M. launcher M300, <b>floating</b> <b>flame</b> launcher Kallini), Sea and Sub units (torpedo launcher Mavic, sea mine Zork). There are also two large defense installations (on land Merlon and in the sea Zenith) and an anti-I.C.B.M. Laser defense (Illuminati). Some of these weapons require advanced levels in the tech tree.|$|R
60|$|All were {{lighting}} up. Here and there, close {{against the}} faint water, {{and at the}} far end of the lake, where the water lay milky in the last whiteness of the sky, and there was no shadow, solitary, frail <b>flames</b> of lanterns <b>floated</b> from the unseen boats. There was a sound of oars, and a boat passed from the pallor into the darkness under the wood, where her lanterns seemed to kindle into fire, hanging in ruddy lovely globes. And again, in the lake, shadowy red gleams hovered in reflection about the boat. Everywhere were these noiseless ruddy creatures of fire drifting near the surface of the water, caught at by the rarest, scarce visible reflections.|$|R
6000|$|... {{he heard}} above the flames a multitudinous howling and squealing, {{and he looked}} over his shoulder, and saw {{hundreds}} upon hundreds of faces in the forest staring out between the branches at the fire. By the time that Thimble and Thumb in their red jackets were scampering on all fours, helter-skelter, downhill out of the forest, a numberless horde of the Forest-mulgars were frisking and howling round the blaze, and the <b>flames</b> were <b>floating</b> half as high as Glint's great Ukka-tree. They squealed, [...] "Walla, walla!" [...] (water), grinning and gibbering one to another as they came tumbling along; but they {{might just as well}} have called [...] "Moonshine!" [...] for every drop was frozen. Nor would twenty flowing springs and all Assasimmon's slaves have quenched that fire now. And when the Forest-mulgars saw that the Mulla-mulgars had given up hope of putting the fire out, they pelted it with snowballs, and scampered about, gathering up every stick and straw and shred they could find, and did their utmost to keep it in. For at last, in their joy that the little Portingal's bones were in the burning, and in their envy of the Mulla-mulgars, their fear of fire was gone.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique for}} using microwave power {{to increase the}} flame speed of laminar premixed flames is discussed. The microwave energy is applied {{by means of a}} rectangular resonant cavity. A laminar flame burner is used to produce a free <b>floating</b> <b>flame</b> sheet {{within the confines of the}} rectangular cavity. Upon application of microwave power, the flame sheet is observed to move toward the burner indicating an increase in laminar flame speed. The resulting data has been analyzed and estimates of the flame speed increase have been calculated. A possible physical mechanism of microwave-induced flame speed enhancement is also presented, and the estimates give the flame speed increase consistent with the observations. I.
