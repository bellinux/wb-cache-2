500|$|Hawthorne Villa is a Gothic-revival two-storey red-brick {{building}} at 1 Church Street. It {{was built by}} Thomas Monds in 1875 and is surrounded by English-style gardens that contain two large Californian Redwoods. The Villa {{was built on the}} site of Carrick's first hotel—an Adobe Inn built in the 1830s by John Archer—using some brickwork from the former building. This former building had been vacant since 1867 and was in a poor state.

500|$|In 2008, Square Enix {{expressed}} {{willingness to}} make worldwide [...] "simultaneous releases the norm". Concerning Final Fantasy XI, {{at the time of}} the original English-only European release in 2004, producer Hiromichi Tanaka had stated that while Japanese/North American/Australian simultaneous releases are possible due to translating only Japanese to English, it was not possible for European countries due to the difficulty of finding good Japanese-to-European-languages translators, and the fact that second-hand translations from the English would be akin to [...] "Chinese whispers". However, the team later integrated full-fledged French and German localization teams, achieving simultaneous release from the Japanese for three different languages from 2007 on. Another example of synchronized localization is Final Fantasy XIII: the company started the localization process in several languages alongside the game's development to lessen the delay between the local and international releases. <b>For</b> <b>self-contained</b> series or games linked by story events or similar elements, Square Enix makes an effort to use the same localization teams, as in the case of Ivalice titles or Kingdom Hearts.|$|E

And, besides, an example like this is more awful to oppressors when the perpetrator vanishes without a trace. They sit in their offices and palaces and quake. All I want you to do is to help me to vanish. No great matter that. Only to go by and by and see Ziemianitch for me at that place where I went this morning. Just tell him, 'He whom you know wants a well-horsed sledge to pull up half an hour after midnight at the seventh lamp-post on the left counting from the upper end of Karabelnaya.

50|$|First {{used as a}} priming {{composition}} in small copper caps beginning in the 1820s, mercury fulminate quickly replaced flints {{as a means to}} ignite black powder charges in muzzle-loading firearms. Later, during the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, mercury fulminate or potassium chlorate became widely used in primers <b>for</b> <b>self-contained</b> rifle and pistol ammunition. Mercury fulminate has the distinct advantage over potassium chlorate of being non-corrosive, but it is known to weaken with time, by decomposing into its constituent elements. The reduced mercury which results forms amalgams with cartridge brass, weakening it, as well. Today, mercury fulminate has been replaced in primers by more efficient chemical substances. These are non-corrosive, less toxic and more stable over time; they include lead azide, lead styphnate and tetrazene derivatives. In addition, none of these compounds require mercury for manufacture, supplies of which can be unreliable in wartime.|$|E

There was also new material, in which the quartet appeared as the 'Love In Organisation', wearing cream outfits and beatific expressions. According to Dominic Maxwell in The Times, 'There's some nice new material here, with their New Age talk, coy high fives - 'mid-fives', if you will - {{and the sort of}} audience participation that loosens you up rather than freezes you up. Mostly though it's a framing device <b>for</b> <b>self-contained</b> bits of business.

The show was directed by Christopher Green, with original material by Cal McCrystal.|$|E
