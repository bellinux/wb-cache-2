Donald Cameron, father of James, {{also was a}} U.S. Senator. Both men amassed {{fortunes}} through business interests in banking, steel mills, printing and railroading, among others. James McCormick Cameron carried forward with the business tradition but shunned politics. He was educated at Harrisburg Academy, Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University. A <b>hearing</b> <b>problem</b> accounted for his shy and soft-spoken nature. He did not marry until 1927 when he was 62 years old. He had no children. He divided his time among residences in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Donegal in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and Kings Gap. Eventually purchasing 2,700 acres, Mr. Cameron instituted stewardship practices that helped to protect the land.|$|E

Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a <b>hearing</b> <b>problem.</b> Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the prevalence and {{to analyze the}} factors associated with <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> in an agricultural company. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, and the participants consisted entirely of employees of an agricultural company in southern Brazil. The workforce of the company was composed of several different occupations. The research instrument was a semi-structured questionnaire administered by interview. RESULTS: Of the 326 workers of the company, there were 273 (83. 8 %) respondents, and the prevalence of <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> was n = 42 (15. 4 %) among the participants of the study. The <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> were associated with lower schooling, with the operating occupational group, the technical assistance group and the general services group. The self-reported health conditions associated with <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> were depression and nervousness or irritation. The occupational exposures associated with <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> were noise, dust, vibration, oils and solvents, and toxic gases. CONCLUSION: There was an intermediate prevalence of <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> {{in relation to other}} studies. It was possible to observe the need to implement strategies aiming at the prevention of <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> that primarily contemplate modifiable aspects, {{such as the use of}} personal protective equipment, as well as improvements in the conditions, organization and work environment. </sec...|$|R

2500|$|Mark Dunn, a {{spokesman}} for Dion, accused the Tories of making fun of the Liberal leader's hearing issues. Dion responded to Harper's comments, saying Harper had [...] "no class", saying [...] "I {{did not understand the}} question", and [...] "Maybe it's because I have a <b>hearing</b> <b>problem,</b> maybe because [...] my second language, but I did not understand the question". Both the Conservatives and the CTV have come under criticism for their handling of the footage, but they have stated they stand by their actions. Duceppe has called Harper's comments a [...] "double standard", saying that many English-speaking politicians have little or no ability to speak French, yet francophones are somehow always expected to be perfect, and that the attack was an attempted [...] "low blow". [...] But Duceppe also took the opportunity to criticise Dion, suggesting he understood the question. [...] "The real question is that I think Dion understood the question. [...] The real problem wasn't the language, it was the substance," [...] Duceppe said, [...] "He had nothing to say". Layton also defended Dion, saying he has [...] "struggled with questions, too".|$|E
2500|$|From early childhood, Franklin showed {{exceptional}} scholastic abilities. At age six, {{she joined}} her brother Roland at Norland Place School, a private day school in West London. At that time, her aunt Mamie (Helen Bentwich), described {{her to her}} husband: [...] "Rosalind is alarmingly clever – she spends all her time doing arithmetic for pleasure, and invariably gets her sums right." [...] She also developed an early interest in cricket and hockey. At age nine, she entered a boarding school, Lindores School for Young Ladies in Sussex. The school was near the seaside, and the family wanted a good environment for her delicate health. She was eleven {{when she went to}} St Paul's Girls' School, West London, one of the few girls' schools in London that taught physics and chemistry. At St Paul's she excelled in science, Latin, and sports. She also learned German, and became fluent in French, a language she would later find useful. She topped her classes, and won annual awards. Her only educational weakness was in music, for which the school music director, the composer Gustav Holst, once called upon her mother to inquire whether she might have suffered from <b>hearing</b> <b>problem</b> or tonsillitis. With six distinctions, she passed her matriculation in 1938, winning a scholarship for university, the School Leaving Exhibition of £30 a year for three years, and £5 from her grandfather. Her father asked her to give the scholarship to a deserving refugee student.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{human and}} {{experimental}} studies are indicating {{an association between}} stress and hearing problems; however potential risk factors have not been established. <b>Hearing</b> <b>problems</b> are projected to become among the top ten disabilities according to the WHO in the near future. Therefore {{a better understanding of}} the relationships between stress and hearing is warranted. Here we describe the prevalence of two common <b>hearing</b> <b>problems,</b> i. e. <b>hearing</b> complaints and tinnitus, in relation to different work-and health-related stressors. Methods A total of 18, 734 individuals were invited to participate in the study, out of which 9, 756 (52 %) enrolled. Results The results demonstrate a clear and mostly linear relationship between higher prevalence of <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> (tinnitus or <b>hearing</b> loss or both) and different stressors, e. g. occupational, poorer self-rated health, long-term illness, poorer sleep quality, and higher burnout scores. Conclusions The present study unambiguously demonstrates associations between <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> and various stressors that have not been previously described for the auditory system. These findings will open new avenues for future investigations. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In the {{practice}} of dentistry, dentists and dental auxiliaries are exposed to noise of different sound levels. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> among dental personnel from Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Two hundred and four dental personnel (91 dentists, 72 dental assistants, 29 dental technicians and 12 dental hygienists) completed a questionnaire, were interviewed and observed during practice. The response rate was 82 %. RESULTS: The data obtained showed that 34 candidates (16. 67 %) had tinnitus, 30 (14. 71 %) had difficulty in speech discrimination and 63 (30. 88 %) had difficulty in speech discrimination in a background noise. Dental technicians were the most affected groups. The incidence of these symptoms was more in personnel exposed in dental field noise for more than 4 hours daily. None of the candidates with complaint had sought medical advice. CONCLUSION: <b>Hearing</b> <b>problems</b> among dental personnel are not of a severe nature. However, the <b>hearing</b> <b>problems</b> can happen due to dental field noise. Dental technicians are more prone to <b>hearing</b> <b>problems.</b> It is recommended that the dental field team should wear ear protector to reduce the hazards of dental field noise.
