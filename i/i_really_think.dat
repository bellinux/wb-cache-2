500|$|Shortly after Mangini joined Dream Theater, Portnoy e-mailed {{the band}} asking to rejoin, but his attempt was rebuffed. Reflecting on his arrival to the band, Mangini told Noisecreep, [...] "As I see it, as I look back, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> what {{happened}} was that this band kind of started over. They were in a new place as they looked for a drummer, and I when got the news, after the shock wore off, I knew what I wanted to do – which was just basically come in and try to support where they wanted to go. They had a vision, they had great ideas, and I just wanted to help them achieve those things." ...|$|E
500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I think if I did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E
500|$|Before {{embarking on}} the storyline, the show's {{producers}} consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation {{to ensure they}} maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything, either, and write from {{a place where they}} didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too.

500|$|Cyrus became {{involved}} with Bolt once she was cast as Penny, Bolt's owner. Filmmakers asked Cyrus to write a song for herself and John Travolta, who stars as Bolt. She co-wrote the song {{with the aid of}} Jeffrey Steele, who also produced the track, {{in a short period of}} time as they had a due date. The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. [...] "She's really gifted at writing, and she really wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> they pulled it off", Travolta told MTV News.|$|E
500|$|According to Lamonica, the 1965 {{team had}} a new emphasis: [...] "In '64 we had {{depended}} a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us...But that all changed in '65. [...] The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So {{we went to a}} pass-oriented game more that season than we ever had before. [...] We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. And <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> it brought out the best in Jack that year." [...] In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.|$|E

Franchitti was disappointed not to finish: [...] "It's such a shame because <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> we had {{a shot at the}} million dollars. We weren't really stretching the engine, either. We were just cruising along. We didn't want to lead the thing because of fuel consumption. We were running in the draft, looking real good." [...] Despite his crash on lap 196, Fernández was pleased with his car as he felt comfortable driving along the race track: [...] "We were having a great race. This {{was one of the best}} cars I have had at a superspeedway." [...] Bräck stated his car experienced oversteer while driving alongside other competitors but felt his car ran efficiently. Tracy said his engine failure was a [...] "disappointment" [...] for his team and felt he had a car that could win the race. He said the event summed up a [...] "season of frustration" [...] but affirmed that his team would refocus and prepare for 2002. Autosport described it as similar to [...] "a NASCAR restrictor plate race" [...] because the cars often drove two or three abreast while racing in packs.|$|E

Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one of my colleagues told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} September 1994 {{floppy disk}} release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much {{it might as well have}} been a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people's minds by the floppy version (the silent movie version!). <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that cost us sales..." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning praised 30 Rock {{for putting}} {{it all together}} [...] "so seamlessly" [...] and [...] "so brilliantly balanced" [...] in [...] "Señor Macho Solo". Canning enjoyed Tracy's story, observing {{that it was a}} [...] "fantastic Tracy Jordan moment." [...] He complimented Sherri Shepherd's guest spot, writing that it was a great way to bring her back [...] "into the mix". He also liked that this episode [...] "delivered some great work" [...] from Alec Baldwin. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.3 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger appreciated Jenna's subplot as it was [...] "the first really work-centric one in a while." [...] He complimented Peter Dinklage's appearance, but was less enthusiastic about Salma Hayek being a love interest for Baldwin's Jack, citing that he did not buy her in the Elisa role. Kona Gallagher of AOL's TV Squad said that Dinklage, Hayek, and Shepherd [...] "fit into the episode, instead of feeling like the episode was written around them." [...] Gallagher noted that Dinklage was [...] "pretty awesome" [...] as Tina Fey's love interest, [...] "and I would have loved to see more of them together. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> they could have done more with this storyline." [...] According to Gallagher, the only part of [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] that she was not [...] "crazy about" [...] was Jenna playing Janis Joplin.|$|E

The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill.

Williams of After Ellen noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television.
