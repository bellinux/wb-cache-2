50|$|Grinding is {{abrasion}} of {{the surface}} of interest by abrasive particles, usually diamond, that are bonded to paper or a metal disc. Grinding erases saw marks, coarsely smooths the surface, and removes stock to a desired depth. A typical grinding sequence for ceramics is one minute on a 240-grit metal-bonded <b>diamond</b> <b>wheel</b> rotating at 240 rpm and lubricated by flowing water, followed by a similar treatment on a 400-grit wheel.

40|$|AbstractElectrochemical {{grinding}} (ECG) is {{a variation}} of electrochemical machining (ECM), in which material {{is removed from the}} workpiece by simultaneous electrochemical reaction and mechanically abrasive action. It offers a number of advantages over conventional grinding, such as low induced stress, large depths of cut, and increased wheel life. It has been reported that ECG was employed in machining stainless steel 304, metal-ceramic hard alloy of WC-Co groups, and Tungsten carbide. Inconel 718 is used extensively in aerospace because of their excellent combination of high specific strength (strength-to-weight ratio) which is maintained their fracture resistant characteristics, and their exceptional resistance to corrosion at elevated temperature. The machinability of Inconel 718 is generally considered to be poor owing to several inherent properties of the materials. Poor thermal conductivity, chemically reactivity and low elastic modulus are the common problems. In this paper, ECG is employed to process Inconel 718. To prolong the wheel life, the brazed <b>diamond</b> <b>wheel</b> is introduced to be a tool instead of the electrodeposited <b>diamond</b> <b>wheel.</b> Experiments illustrated that the tool durability has been improved from 15 hours to 50 hours when a brazed <b>diamond</b> <b>wheel</b> was employed to replace an electrodeposited <b>diamond</b> <b>wheel.</b> In addition, a proper high applied voltage and electrolyte temperature was verified to be conductive to improve the maximum electrode feed rate and material removal rate.
