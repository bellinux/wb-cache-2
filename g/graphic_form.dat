25|$|Transcription, in {{the context}} of cuneiform, is the process in which an epigraphist makes a line art drawing to show the signs on a clay tablet or stone {{inscription}} in a <b>graphic</b> <b>form</b> suitable for modern publication. Not all epigraphists are equally reliable, and before a scholar publishes an important treatment of a text, the scholar will often arrange to collate the published transcription against the actual tablet, to see if any signs, especially broken or damaged signs, should be represented differently.|$|E
25|$|The diagram to {{the right}} shows how this works in <b>graphic</b> <b>form.</b> Depicted {{on the left is}} the {{absorption}} of colors of the spectrum according to their wavelength as they pass through the silicon wafer. On the right, a Foveon X3 layered sensor stack in the silicon wafer for each output pixel is shown depicting the colors it detects at each absorption level. The color purity and intensity of blue, green and red depicted for the sensors are for ease of illustration. In fact, the attributes of each output pixel that are reported by a camera using this sensor result from the camera's image processing algorithms that employ a matrix process to construct the single RGB color from the data sensed by the photodiode stack.|$|E

25|$|The vowels {{fall into}} two sets, the back vowels -a and -o, and the front vowels -e and -i. Each set {{consists}} of a lower vowel, -a or -e, and a higher vowel, -o or -i. In all cases, back-vowel syllables are related through left-right reflection: that is, they are mirror images of each other. How they relate to front-vowel syllables depends on the <b>graphic</b> <b>form</b> of the consonants. These follow two patterns. Symmetrical, vowel, p-, t-, sp-, are rotated 90 degrees (a quarter turn) counter-clockwise, while those that are asymmetrical top-to-bottom, c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y-, are rotated 180 degrees (a half turn). The lower front-vowel (-e) syllables are derived this way from the low back-vowel (a) syllables, and the high front-vowel (-i) syllables are derived this way from the higher back-vowel (-o) syllables.|$|E
25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Brahmi was likely derived from or {{influenced by a}} Semitic script model, with Aramaic being a leading candidate. However, {{the issue is not}} settled {{due to the lack of}} direct evidence and unexplained differences between Aramaic, Kharoṣṭhī, and Brahmi. Virtually all authors accept that regardless of the origins, the degree of Indian development of the Brahmi script in both the <b>graphic</b> <b>form</b> and the structure has been extensive. It is also widely accepted that theories about the grammar of the Vedic language probably had a strong influence on this development. Some authors – both Western and Indian – suggest that Brahmi was borrowed or inspired by a Semitic script, invented in a short few years during the reign of Ashoka and then used widely for Ashokan inscriptions. In contrast, some authors reject the idea of foreign influence.|$|E
500|$|The Hugo Awards {{are given}} every {{year by the}} World Science Fiction Society for the best science fiction or fantasy works and {{achievements}} of the previous year.

It has been described as [...] "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" [...] and [...] "the best known literary award for science fiction writing". The Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story is given each year for science fiction or fantasy stories told in <b>graphic</b> <b>form</b> and published in English or translated into English during the previous calendar year. The Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story has been awarded annually since 2009. It was started then with the requirement that it would only continue as an official award if approved again by the World Science Fiction Society after that year. It was, and was again awarded in 2010; it was ratified as a permanent category after the 2012 awards.|$|E

6000|$|Just {{what this}} {{handicap}} amounts to, {{so far as}} it works out in physical consequences, is to be gauged by certain almost classical figures, which I have here ventured to present again in <b>graphic</b> <b>form.</b> These figures do not present our total failure, they merely show how far the less fortunate section of the community falls short of the more fortunate. They are taken from Clifford Allbutt's System of Medicine (art. [...] "Hygiene of Youth," [...] Dr. Clement Dukes). 15,564 boys and young men were measured and weighed to get these figures. The black columns indicate the weight (+9 lbs. of clothes) and height respectively of youths of the town artisan population, for the various ages from ten to twenty-five indicated at the heads of the columns. The white additions to these columns indicate the additional weight and height of the more favoured classes at the same ages. Public school- boys, naval and military cadets, medical and university students, were taken to represent the more favoured classes. It will be noted that while the growth in height of the lower class boy falls short from the very earliest years, the strain of the adolescent period tells upon his weight, and no doubt upon his general stamina, most conspicuously. These figures, it must be borne in mind, deal with the living members of each class at the ages given. The mortality, however, in the black or lower class is probably far higher than in the upper class year by year, and if this could be allowed for it would greatly increase the apparent failure of the lower class. And these matters of height and weight are only coarse material deficiencies. They serve to suggest, but they do not serve to gauge, the far graver and sadder loss, the invisible and immeasurable loss through mental and moral qualities undeveloped, through activities warped and crippled and vitality and courage lowered.|$|E

For this purpose, comparing and matching two kinds of <b>graphic</b> <b>forms</b> are required. One is a graph generated from an origami illustration image by applying image processing techniques to it. The other is that obtained from an internal model which is produced and updated dynamically according to the results of understanding of the folding process stepwise. In order to comparing and matching these graphics, we propose a method for extracting USGs from origami illustration images. This method is based on Hough transform and takes into account the characteristics of origami illustration images. We also propose a method for matching two kinds of <b>graphic</b> <b>forms</b> based on a genetic algorithm. Experiments show that our methods are effective in recognizing illustration images including a lot of noise. ...|$|R
