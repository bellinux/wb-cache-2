In order to determine if close relatives of familial CMM patients show both a comparable spontaneous chromosomal instability and enhanced UV-sensitivity, cultured fibroblasts of 24 healthy, first-degree relatives of patients with <b>familial</b> malignant <b>melanoma</b> were investigated. The cytokinesis-block micronucleous technique was used to detect enhanced chromosomal instability.

40|$|Loss of {{the short}} arm of {{chromosome}} 1 is frequently observed in many tumor types, including melanoma. We recently localized a third melanoma susceptibility locus to chromosome band 1 p 22. Critical recombinants in linked families localized the gene to a 15 -Mb region between D 1 S 430 and D 1 S 2664. To map the locus more finely we have performed studies to assess allelic loss across the region in a panel of melanomas from 1 p 22 -linked families, sporadic melanomas, and melanoma cell lines. Eighty percent of <b>familial</b> <b>melanomas</b> exhibited loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within the region, with a smallest region of overlapping deletions (SRO) of 9 Mb between D 1 S 207 and D 1 S 435. This high frequency of LOH makes it very likely that the susceptibility locus is a tumor suppressor. In sporadic tumors, four SROs were defined. SRO 1 and SRO 2 map within the critical recombinant and familial tumor region, indicating that {{one or the other}} is likely to harbor the susceptibility gene. However, SRO 3 may also be significant because it overlaps with the markers with the highest 2 -point LOD score (D 1 S 2776), part of the linkage recombinant region, and the critical region defined in mesothelioma. The candidate genes PRKCL 2 and GTF 2 B, within SRO 2, and TGFBR 3, CDC 7, and EVI 5, in a broad region encompassing SRO 3, were screened in 1 p 22 -linked melanoma kindreds, but no coding mutations were detected.

50|$|Mutations in CDKN2A {{have been}} {{associated}} with the occurrence of <b>familial</b> <b>melanoma</b> in humans.

50|$|CDKN2A, {{also known}} as cyclin-dependent kinase Inhibitor 2A, is a gene which in humans is located at {{chromosome}} 9, band p21.3. It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. The gene codes for two proteins, including the INK4 family member p16 (or p16INK4a) and p14arf. Both act as tumor suppressors by regulating the cell cycle. p16 inhibits cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6) and thereby activates the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of proteins, which block traversal from G1 to S-phase. p14ARF (known as p19ARF in the mouse) activates the p53 tumor suppressor. Somatic mutations of CDKN2A are common {{in the majority of}} human cancers, with estimates that CDKN2A is the second most commonly inactivated gene in cancer after p53. Germline mutations of CDKN2A are associated with <b>familial</b> <b>melanoma,</b> glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer.

40|$|CDKN 2 A and CDK 4 are {{the only}} known high-penetrant genes conferring proneness to {{cutaneous}} melanoma. The CDKN 2 A locus consists of four exons and encodes several alternate transcripts, {{two of which are}} p 16 (INK 4 a) and p 14 (ARF), and originate from different open reading frames. Exon 1 alpha is specific for p 16 (INK 4 a), while exon 1 beta characterizes p 14 (ARF). Most CDKN 2 A mutations are located in exons 1 alpha and 2, while exon 1 beta variations have been identified in rare melanoma-prone pedigrees. In a previous study, we investigated 155 Italian melanoma cases, including 94 <b>familial</b> <b>melanomas</b> (FAMs) and 61 sporadic multiple primary melanomas (MPMs), for p 16 (INK 4 a) /CDK 4 germline alterations and identified 15 p 16 (INK 4 a) and 1 CDK 4 point mutations. In the present work, we extended our search to p 14 (ARF) mutations and CDKN 2 A deletions in the remaining samples. We identified the recurrent g. 193 + 1 G>A mutation in two FAM cases, while an additional pedigree displayed the previously undescribed variant g. 161 G>A. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) screening for copy variations resulted negative in all cases. In Italy, the overall frequency of p 14 (ARF) mutations is 3. 2 % in FAM and 0 % in sporadic MPM. Re-evaluation of our patients' cohort emphasizes that the chance of identifying CDKN 2 A/CDK 4 mutations in FAM is mainly influenced by the number of affected family members and the presence of one or more MPM cases. Accordingly, mutation rate rises to 61 % in selected cases. Further studies are expected in order to investigate CDKN 2 A rarer mutations, including atypical deletions and inherited epimutations...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{cells have}} {{abnormal}} cell cycle regulation which favors accelerated proliferation, chromosomal instability, {{and resistance to}} the senescence response. Although the p 16 INK 4 a locus is the most prominent susceptibility locus for <b>familial</b> <b>melanomas,</b> the low frequency of p 16 mutations in sporadic melanomas suggests additional alterations in other cell cycle regulatory genes. Here we used primary melanoma tumors to reveal early cell cycle alterations that could be masked in advanced metastatic lesions due to their inherently high genetic instability. Unexpectedly, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p 27 KIP 1 and/or p 21 Waf- 1 /SDI- 1 {{were found to be}} expressed in 13 of 18 (72 %) of the primary melanomas with a Breslow thickness greater than 0. 076 mm. In general, p 27 and/or p 21 staining in the primary tumors correlated with low Ki- 67 index. Importantly, most of the p 21 - and p 27 -positive tumors expressed high levels of cyclin D 1 and cyclin E. In proliferating cells p 27 is predominantly associated with cyclin D-CDK 4 complexes, but does not inhibit the kinase activity, whereas in quiescent cells p 27 is found associated with inactive CDK 2 complexes. p 27 was also expressed at high levels in proliferating primary melanomas in culture, and found to be associated with active cyclin E–CDK 2 complexes containing high levels of cyclin E. It is thus likely that accumulation of cyclin E overcomes the potent inhibitory activity of p 27 and p 21 in CDK 2 complexes. Of the primary melanomas with no indication of invasiveness, only three of 15 (20 %) were positive for p 27 and/or p 21. We propose that high levels of p 27 and p 21 may confer upon melanoma tumors their characteristic resistance to conventional therapies. In turn, high levels of cyclins E and D 1 may contribute to unlimited proliferation in primary melanomas that express the tumor suppressor p 16 INK 4. J Invest Dermatol 113 : 1039 – 1046 199...|$|R

People living in the US {{are expected to have}} a 1 in 71 lifetime risk of developing the disease. Activating mutations in BRAF occur in approximately 60 % of melanomas and in 80 % of benign melanocytic nevi. PTEN is a tumor suppressor that {{has been shown to be}} deleted or epigenetically silenced in approximately 30 % of melanomas. Cdkn 2 a is a locus encoding 2 tumor suppressors in alternate reading frames that has been found to be mutated in up to 40 % of <b>familial</b> <b>melanomas</b> and is near universally lost in human melanoma cell lines. We used these data to generate novel mouse models of metastatic melanoma involving an inducible Cre transgenic mouse (Tyr::CreER-T 2). We demonstrate that Pten loss, Cdkn 2 a loss or Braf activation in isolation does not induce melanoma. In contrast, when Braf activation is combined with Pten loss, mice develop aggressive pigmented melanomas with 100 % penetrance and a mean tumor free survival of 19. 5 days. Melanocytic proliferation occurs immediately following induction with virtually no latency. Expansile metastases are observed in lymph nodes and isolated tumor cells are present in the lungs and brain. Both incipient and established melanomas are sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, mTORC 1 signaling is prevented upon rapamycin treatment, but mTORC 2, MAPK, and Akt signaling appear to be unaffected. Additionally, when Cdkn 2 a loss is combined with Braf activation, the mice develop a nevic phenotype with complete penetrance and stochastic progression to melanoma. Median melanoma free survival is 85. 5 days and tumors are metastatic to lymph nodes in 100 % of mice. These novel mouse models of melanoma will likely be useful in the study of the biology of metastasis, in tumor immunology, and in new models of preclinical testing...|$|R

Limited data are available on <b>familial</b> mortality in <b>melanoma.</b> If fatal forms of melanoma were associated with fatal forms of melanoma or of some other cancers, only studies on familial mortality rather than on familial incidence might be able to detect them. Furthermore, estimates on familial aggregation based on mortality are free from bias of overdiagnosis.

Melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer accounting for almost 4 % of cancers among men and women, and ~ 80 % of skin cancer-related deaths in the US. In the present study we analyzed plasma-derived exosomal miRNAs from clinically affected and unaffected <b>familial</b> <b>melanoma</b> patients (CDKN 2 A/p 16 gene carriers) and compared them with affected (nonfamilial melanoma) and unaffected control subjects {{in order to identify}} novel risk biomarkers for melanoma. Intact miRNAs can be isolated from the circulation because of their presence in exosomes. A number of differentially regulated miRNAs identified by NanoString human V 2 miRNA array were validated by quantitative PCR. Significantly, miR- 17, miR- 19 a, miR- 21, miR- 126, and miR- 149 were expressed at higher levels in patients with metastatic sporadic melanoma as compared with <b>familial</b> <b>melanoma</b> patients or unaffected control subjects. Surprisingly, no substantial differences in miRNA expression were detected between <b>familial</b> <b>melanoma</b> patients (all inclusive) and unaffected control subjects. The miRNAs differentially expressed in the different patient cohorts, especially in patients with metastatic melanoma, may play important roles in tumor progression and metastasis, and may be used as predictive biomarkers to monitor remission as well as relapse following therapeutic intervention...|$|E

40|$|Germline {{mutations}} in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 a (CDKN 2 a) gene, which maps to the 9 p 21 chromosomal region and encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 16 (INK 4 a), {{have been detected}} in a proportion of <b>familial</b> <b>melanoma</b> kindreds, suggesting {{that it is the}} putative 9 p 21 -linked melanoma susceptibility gene. The p 19 (ARF) transcript, an alternative spliced form of the CDKN 2 a gene, has recently been shown to inhibit, like the p 16 (INK 4 a) protein, cell cycle progression, raising the possibility that it might constitute an additional melanoma tumor suppressor gene at the 9 p 21 locus. To determine the contribution of these candidate genes to <b>familial</b> <b>melanoma</b> genetic predisposition, we screened 10 such kindreds for germline {{mutations in}} the p 16 (INK 4 a) and p 19 (ARF) genes. Four independent germline missense mutations, mapping in exon 1 alpha (Gly 23 Asp; Arg 24 Pro) and exon 2 (Asn 71 Ileu; Pro 114 Leu) of the CDKN 2 a gene, were identified. Two previously described polymorphisms were also detected, Ala 148 Thr in exon 2 and a base change in the 32 ̆ 7 untranslated region of exon 3, No disease-associated mutations in exon 1 beta of the p 19 (ARF) gene were found. Our data support the hypothesis that the CDKN 2 a is a melanoma susceptibility gene in <b>familial</b> <b>melanoma,</b> whereas the p 19 (ARF) gene does not seem to play a significant role...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous {{melanoma}} is {{a disease}} which results from a complex mixture of various extrinsic and intrinsic factors, with some major players still unknown. Although primary tumors are highly curable with surgical excision, particularly those which are non-ulcerated and have a thickness of less than 1 mm, poor survival rates are observed in advanced disease. This has been associated both with the biological nature of melanoma, {{as well as with}} the limited efficacy of current treatments of metastases. With this work, we wanted to obtain further insights into the biological background of skin melanoma in different stages of progression. We focused on commonly altered pathways and genes, NRAS, BRAF and CDKN 2 A, and their effects on activation and expression of downstream genes in different stages of melanoma development. For the first two studies, we used primary melanoma tumors that had either sporadic or hereditary origin, respectively. Samples used in the analyses were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. For the other two studies we focused on melanoma metastases originating from sporadic melanoma cases. Fresh frozen tumor specimens were used in these two analyses. Results obtained showed that NRAS and BRAF mutations in sporadic primary melanomas were observed at 26 % and 39 %, respectively. Approximately a two-fold increase in mutation frequencies were observed, for both genes, in the group of patients that had shorter overall survival. The presence of ulceration and lack of cytoplasmic activation of ERK were independent prognostic markers. BRAF mutations were markers of worse survival in the presence of ulceration. In <b>familial</b> primary <b>melanomas,</b> NRAS and BRAF mutations were found in 3 samples (16 %) and 7 samples (37 %), respectively. Three samples harbored coexisting alterations in both genes on the background of a germline CDKN 2 A L 32 P mutation. Metastatic melanoma samples with BRAF mutations had higher expression of genes when compared to tumors with NRAS alterations. The majority of observed genes were found to be located on chromosome 7. Additionally, this overexpression pattern was accompanied with copy number increase of chromosome 7 in BRAF-mutated tumors. Results obtained through the last study showed that the majority of differentially genes show significantly decreased expression which paralleled CDNK 2 A allelic loss. These differences were more evident in samples with bi-allelic loss, when compared to those with intact CDKN 2 A. Finally, pathways analysis showed that differentially regulated genes, that showed lower expression in respect to CDKN 2 A gene dosage, were linked to immune response in metastatic melanoma samples. In conclusions, NRAS and BRAF mutations are observed at similar frequencies in sporadic and <b>familial</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Although both N-Ras and B-Raf convey signals along the same pathway, signatures in our analysis showed differences between these two effectors. In metastatic melanomas with BRAF mutation the great majority of observed changes included overexpression and amplification of genes located on chromosome 7, in samples with BRAF mutation. The differences in gene expression between BRAF and NRAS mutated tumors may be caused both by direct effects on cell signaling by activated BRAF as well as effects related to overexpression and gene copy number gains on chromosome 7, where the BRAF gene is located. Finally, in the last study, loss of the CDNK 2 A gene correlated mainly with lower expression of genes in metastatic melanomas with a majority of these linked to immune respon...|$|R
40|$|The {{gene for}} <b>familial</b> {{malignant}} <b>melanoma</b> and its precursor lesion, the dysplastic nevus, {{has been assigned}} to a region of the distal short arm of chromosome 1, which is frequently involved in karyotypic abnormalities in melanoma cells. We have examined loci on chromosome 1 p for loss-of-constitutional heterozygosity in 35 melanomas and 21 melanoma cell lines to analyze the role of these abnormalities in melanocyte transformation. Loss-of-heterozygosity at loci on chromosome 1 p was identified in 15 / 35 (43 %) melanomas and 11 / 21 (52 %) melanoma cell lines. Analysis of multiple metastases derived from the same patient and of melanoma and lymphoblastoid samples from a family with hereditary melanoma showed that the loss-of-heterozygosity at loci on distal 1 p is a late event in tumor progression, rather than the second mutation that would occur if melanoma were due to a cellular recessive mechanism. Comparisons with neuroblastoma and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN 2) suggest that the frequent 1 p loss-of-heterozygosity in these malignancies is a common late event of neuroectodermal tumor progression...|$|R
40|$|Segregation of <b>familial</b> {{cutaneous}} <b>melanoma</b> {{has been}} shown to be compatible with autosomal dominant transmission with incomplete penetrance. However, the combined phenotype of melanoma and a known melanoma-precursor lesion, the dysplastic nevus (DN), has not previously been found to fit a Mendelian model of inheritance using complex segregation analysis. Employing a life-table and disease-free survival analysis approach, we estimated the lifetime incidence of melanoma in the sibs and offspring of DN-affected individuals to be 46 %, consistent with a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. To further elucidate the relationship between the two traits, we conducted a linkage analysis between the melanoma locus and a hypothetical DN locus, and obtained a maximum lod score of 3. 857 at theta =. 08. Furthermore, all families giving evidence for linkage were in the coupling phase and the maximum likelihood estimate of theta was not significantly different from 0 (P =. 1). This provides evidence that the DN and melanoma traits may represent pleiotropic effects of a single, highly penetrant gene behaving in an autosomal dominant manner...|$|R
