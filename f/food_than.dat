5|$|Poor white {{farmers and}} black slaves ate much more humble fare and were quicker to {{incorporate}} American and African foodstuffs and flavorings. The food of poor {{whites in the}} 17th century was similar to soul food of the 20th century. Overall, both rich and poor southerners ate spicier and more pungent <b>food</b> <b>than</b> elsewhere in the early colonies, and feasting was {{an important part of}} life for all social classes.|$|E
5|$|Trained {{cockatoos}} {{are sometimes}} seen in bird shows in zoos. They are generally less motivated by <b>food</b> <b>than</b> other birds; some may more respond to petting or praise than food. Cockatoos {{can often be}} taught to wear a parrot harness, enabling their owners to take them outdoors. Cockatoos {{have been used in}} animal-assisted therapy, generally in nursing homes.|$|E
5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for shade and move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing its <b>food</b> <b>than</b> other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E
30|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the status of}} market integration in the selected study areas where traditional foods are available but not traded enough. The hypothesis according to which rural markets are more integrated for introduced <b>foods</b> <b>than</b> traditional <b>foods</b> is accepted. On the contrary, the hypothesis which asserts that consumption of traditional foods decreases with increasing market integration for introduced foods is rejected. Although rural markets are more integrated for introduced/imported <b>foods</b> <b>than</b> local/traditional <b>foods,</b> the diets in rural areas of Benin are still dominated by locally produced foods. But the time dimension of that hypothesis could not be considered due to the non-availability of multiyear survey data for comparing diet dynamics with market integration overtime.|$|R

Jasminum kerstingii {{is part of the}} hartebeest's diet {{at the start of the}} rainy season. Between seasons, they mainly feed on the culms of grasses. A study found that the hartebeest is able to digest a higher proportion of <b>food</b> <b>than</b> the topi and the wildebeest. In areas with scarce water, it can survive on melons, roots, and tubers.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop a loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more <b>food</b> <b>than</b> most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E
5|$|Refined cuisine {{could be}} moralized {{as a sign}} of either civilized {{progress}} or decadent decline. The early Imperial historian Tacitus contrasted the indulgent luxuries of the Roman table in his day with the simplicity of the Germanic diet of fresh wild meat, foraged fruit, and cheese, unadulterated by imported seasonings and elaborate sauces. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—was considered a more civilized form of <b>food</b> <b>than</b> meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism, as it might be the product of animal sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Western jackdaws {{practice}} active food sharing– {{where the}} initiative {{for the transfer}} lies with the donor– {{with a number of}} individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred <b>food</b> <b>than</b> a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it {{has been found to be}} detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.|$|E
5|$|When hatched, {{the chicks}} are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, the chicks {{begin to move}} around and explore their {{surroundings}} within one to three days after hatching. Usually they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males bring more <b>food</b> <b>than</b> females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter {{with the help of}} their parents.|$|E
5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food {{was available in}} the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back {{to live with the}} older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more <b>food</b> <b>than</b> what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E

5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less <b>food</b> <b>than</b> many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E
5|$|In Paynes Prairie, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in rate of infection between males and females, but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal <b>food</b> <b>than</b> any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence the habits of the rice rat in some way. One possibility is that the intermediate host is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E
5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be more {{important}} to the pelagic ray in finding <b>food</b> <b>than</b> in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm at a distance of up to , and may be able to pick up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.|$|E

40|$|A {{traditional}} Hawaiian meal, {{as well as}} {{a typical}} Japanese meal, consists of the staple food and the <b>food</b> other <b>than</b> the staple <b>food.</b> Both Hawaiian and Japanese distinguish them lexically. Many other languages, such as English, do not have a clear lexical distinction between the staple food and the <b>food</b> other <b>than</b> the staple <b>food.</b> The word for the staple food is gohan in Japanese and ‘ai in Hawaiian, respectively. Those two words are similar in that they can also mean the whole meal including the staple food and the <b>food</b> other <b>than</b> the staple <b>food.</b> The word for the <b>food</b> other <b>than</b> the staple <b>food</b> is okazu in Japanese and i‘a in Hawaiian, respectively. Both in Japan and in Hawaii, many kinds of food, such as fish, meat, and vegetables, are eaten together with the staple food. Both okazu and i‘a denote any food eaten together with the staple food, whether it is fish, meat or a vegetable...|$|R

5|$|Juveniles {{have lower}} {{foraging}} efficiency compared to adults {{and in most}} feeding flocks, the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults. They usually tend {{to stay close to}} one another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group. During the breeding season, adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony. The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim—either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young—and extract the ball of food. This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend long periods of time away from the nest, and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis, which would reduce its own reproductive success. Females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males, but instead try to avoid or move away from them. This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate. The explanation of the species' sexual dimorphism of body size is unclear, because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and, as males are larger, they need more <b>food</b> <b>than</b> females.|$|E
