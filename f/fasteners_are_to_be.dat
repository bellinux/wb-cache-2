40|$|Prior {{research}} has demonstrated that a disassembly based end-of-life (EoL) treatment for electronic products is characterized by the highest recovery rates for precious metals (PMs) and non-commodity plastics, such as flame retardant plastics. Nonetheless, EoL electronic products are nowadays also commonly recycled without disassembly in different types of size-reduction based treatments or in an integrated PM smelter-refinery. This disparity of recycling processes adopted worldwide resulted in a high uncertainty on the EoL treatment processes that will be adopted for discarded electronic products. As a result, governments, original equipment manufacturers and recycling companies struggle to determine the economic and environmental value of design for disassembly. For this reason, a methodology <b>is</b> presented <b>to</b> calculate the Composite Rate of Return (CRR) on investing in design for disassembly and the resulting environmental impacts. This methodology <b>is</b> applied <b>to</b> evaluate the economic and environmental benefits of implementing three types of active fasteners for eleven electronic products which are available in both a product service system (PSS) and a traditional sales oriented business model. The performed analyses demonstrate that the preferred EoL treatment, as well as the economic and environmental benefits of implementing design for active disassembly, strongly depends on several product properties and boundary conditions. Based on the performed sensitivity analysis, the application of active pressure and temperature sensitive <b>fasteners</b> <b>is</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> only economically viable for products placed on the market in a PSS context, in which they will be separately collected with a high collection rate. Furthermore, impulse sensitive elastomer based <b>fasteners</b> <b>are</b> characterized with the highest rate of return and considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suited for both products sold in a traditional sales oriented business model and for products used in a PSS. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical <b>fasteners</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} used in today’s composite aircraft adhesive joints. The primary purpose for using mechanical <b>fasteners</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> provide redundancy to the adhesive joints because of the uncertainties associated with an adhesive only joint. Therefore, {{the use of a}} fastener in a conventional composite hybrid joint was mainly a part of a fail-safe design. Acting as a safety backup, the fastener did not contribute tensile strength to the joint until the adhesive joint failed. When only being used for redundancy purposes in case of an adhesive joint failure, the existing fastener became simply an added weight to the aircraft structure. In this research, a proposed new design was incorporated into the composite hybrid joint where two different types of attachments <b>were</b> used in order <b>to</b> provide alternate load paths to redirect load to the fastener and utilize the fastener to provide strength to the joint once the joint was loaded. Two types of attachments were used: a stepped attachment and a curved attachment. The attachments would reduce the amount of load induced in the adhesive joint and increase the overall strength of the hybrid joint. Experiments were conducted with both the conventional hybrid joint and the new hybrid joint design with two different attachments to assess effectiveness of the new design, the more efficient attachment type, and whether the added weight of the attachments could be justified by the improvements in the overall strength of the joint. Each type of hybrid joints consisted of 15 specimens. A total of 45 specimens were prepared for this study. The specimens were tested with a MTS Systems Corporation testing apparatus with a 22 kip (± 100 kN) load cell. The ultimate tensile load data gathered <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> compare the strength of the different hybrid joints. From the tensile testing data collected of the three different types of specimens, the hybrid joints with attachments showed a significant improvement in ultimate tensile strength compared to the conventional hybrid joints. Conventional hybrid joints had an average ultimate tensile strength of 5859. 99 lbf. Hybrid joints with curved attachments had an average ultimate tensile strength of 10617. 62 lbf, which was 81. 19 % higher than the conventional hybrid joints.
