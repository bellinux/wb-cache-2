25|$|In England, {{farmers have}} been lauded by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds because {{the five most}} {{threatened}} bumblebees have made a comeback to the English nature due to the agri-environmental schemes. In Germany, support for <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> and biotope management helps maintain habitat for rare species such as orchids and butterflies. In Hungary, a special scheme was launched to protect the great bustard, maybe the world's heaviest flying bird, which needs areas with minimal disturbance and an abundant supply of insects to breed. In Cyprus, agri-environment schemes support the maintenance of traditional trees and bushes that are a natural habitat for the island's and likely to be of benefit to farmland birds in Cyprus.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{that feed}} on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops. Producing 1kg of meat {{requires}} up to 15,000 liters of water. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires {{nearly half of}} the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems. In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits.|$|E

500|$|The Large Black, {{occasionally}} {{called the}} Devon, Cornwall Black or Boggu, is a breed of domestic pig native to Great Britain, particularly Devon, Cornwall and Essex. The Large Black is accurately named, {{as it is}} a large swine breed and is the only British pig that is entirely black.

500|$|The Large Black is a long, deep-bodied pig, {{well known}} for its {{hardiness}} and suitability for <b>extensive</b> <b>farming.</b> Large Blacks are best suited for pasture-based farming due to their strong foraging and grazing ability, which efficiently converts poor quality feed into meat. It is the only pig breed in Britain to be all black, and this helps protect the pig from sunburn in sunny climates. Temperamentally, the Large Black is a very [...] breed which is easily contained by fencing. This is partly because its large, drooping ears obscure its vision, although they also help to protect the face and eyes while the animal is foraging, especially when [...] in dirt.|$|E

2500|$|To {{the north}} of the Sambre and Meuse valley lies the Central Belgian plateau, which is {{characterized}} by intensive agriculture. The Walloon part of this plateau is traditionally divided into several regions: Walloon Brabant around Nivelles, [...] Western Hainaut ( [...] , around Tournai), and Hesbaye around Waremme. [...] South of the sillon industriel, the land is more rugged and is characterized by more <b>extensive</b> <b>farming.</b> It is traditionally divided into the regions of Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse, Condroz, Fagne-Famenne, the Ardennes and Land of Herve, as well as the Belgian Lorraine around Arlon and Virton. Dividing it into Condroz, Famenne, Calestienne, Ardennes (including Thiérache), and Belgian Lorraine (which includes the Gaume) is more reflective of the physical geography. [...] The larger region, the Ardennes, is a thickly forested plateau with caves and small gorges. [...] It is host to much of Belgium's wildlife but little agricultural capacity. This area extends westward into France and eastward to the Eifel in Germany via the High Fens plateau, on which the Signal de Botrange forms the highest point in Belgium at 694 metres (2,277ft).|$|E
40|$|Grassland {{birds are}} facing {{increasing}} threats {{due to the}} intensification of agricultural practices. Grazing or mowing can have negative and positive effects on wader dynamics at field scale and land use distribution influences these dynamics at landscape scale. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the ecological and economic performances of several agricultural landscapes composed by different farm types. Based on a database from the Marais Poitevin (France), farm types were characterised using several indicators of management intensity and were used to generate several hypothetical landscapes which were compared to the current landscape according to their ecological and economic performances. A stage structured stochastic model was developed to asses the long term effects of grazing and mowing practices on ground nesting birds on contrasted landscapes. A simplified version of the meta-population model made it possible to asses the importance of the mowing/grazing ratio on bird dynamics in a grassland landscape. Stocking rate per hectare of main fodder area proved itself to be a good indicator of farm management intensity and four farm types were identified. Landscapes comprising either large or small <b>extensive</b> <b>farms</b> were the most efficient on an ecological viewpoint but small <b>extensive</b> <b>farms</b> had on average the poorest economic performances. From these results it was inferred that landscapes made off large <b>extensive</b> <b>farms</b> were more likely to reconcile economic and ecological priorities. However, accounting for the social aspects of farming calls attention to the potential role of small <b>extensive</b> <b>farms</b> in sustainable management of grassland landscapes...|$|R

For meat, deer, bear, elk, duck, swan, and small rodents such as squirrel. With ocean food it was mussels, sea eggs, cockles, clams, seaweed, herring, trout, crab, urchin, sea lion, seal, {{all kinds of}} salmon. [...] For berries and plants, it was different kinds of wild blueberry, blackberry, salmon berry, salal berry, five different kinds of grass and the roots of different plants. Ooligans were once in their river system and Ooligan grease was once made from it. [...] Sea food, particularly salmon was their main staple. [...] It was this abundance of sea food and salmon that their diet was considerably heavy on natural fats and oils. This left relatively small amounts of carbohydrates in the diet. [...] To ensure that essentials vitamins are acquired, they eat almost all parts of animals which they harvest. [...] Bones used for soup stock provide leached calcium, as do ground calcined shells. Vitamin A is obtained from liver. Vitamin C is primarily found in berries and some other plants, such as skunk cabbage leaves. Intestines and stomachs can be eaten to provide vitamin E and the vitamin B complexes. [...] Within the decade following the establishment of Fort Langley in 1827 the Squamish had begun <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> of potatoes.
