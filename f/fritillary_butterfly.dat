500|$|... present include adder (Vipera berus), {{grass snake}} (Natrix natrix), slowworm (Angula fragilis) and common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). Many bird species breed on the Quantocks, {{including}} the grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), raven (Corvus corax) and the European pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). The Quantocks are {{also an important}} site for red deer (Cervus elaphus). Invertebrates of note include the silver-washed <b>fritillary</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Argynnis paphia), and three nationally rare dead-wood beetles: Thymalus limbatus, Orchesia undulata and Rhinosimus ruficollis.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the Exmoor Coastal Heaths Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), two other areas are specifically designated. North Exmoor covers [...] and includes the Dunkery Beacon and the Holnicote and Horner Water Nature Conservation Review sites, and the Chains Geological Conservation Review site. The Chains site is nationally important for its south-western lowland heath communities and for transitions from Ancient woodland through upland heath to blanket mire. The site is also of importance for its breeding bird communities, its large population of the nationally rare heath <b>fritillary</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Mellicta athalia), an exceptional woodland lichen flora and its palynological interest of deep peat on the Chains.|$|E

50|$|The diverse {{range of}} flowers and grasses is ideal for many downland insects and the reserve has {{particular}} good butterfly and bug populations. Recorded are small blue, chalkhill blue and dark green <b>fritillary</b> <b>butterflies</b> and the cynid-shield bug, Sehirus dubius, feeds on the bastard-toadflax. The heath snail, recorded for the site, is an indicator of ancient grassland.|$|R

There are occasional sightings of wild deer, and there is a colony of wild goats on Ventnor's downs. Protected species such as the dormouse and rare bats can be found.

2500|$|Coppice {{management}} favours a {{range of}} wildlife, often of species adapted to open woodland. After cutting, the increased light allows existing woodland-floor vegetation such as bluebell, anemone and primrose to grow vigorously. Often brambles grow around the stools, encouraging insects, or various small mammals that can use the brambles as protection from larger predators. Woodpiles (if left in the coppice) encourage insects such as beetles to come into an area. The open area is then colonised by many animals such as nightingale, European nightjar and <b>fritillary</b> <b>butterflies.</b> [...] As the coup grows, the canopy closes and it becomes unsuitable for these animals again—but in an actively managed coppice there is always another recently cut coup nearby, and the populations therefore move around, following the coppice management.|$|R
