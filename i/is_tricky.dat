25|$|The {{evolution}} {{of different types}} of sleep patterns is influenced by a number of selective pressures, including body size, relative metabolic rate, predation, type and location of food sources, and immune function. Sleep (especially deep SWS and REM) <b>is</b> <b>tricky</b> behavior because it steeply increases predation risk. This means that, for sleep to have evolved, the functions of sleep should have provided a substantial advantage over the risk it entails. In fact, studying sleep in different organisms shows how they have balanced this risk by evolving partial sleep mechanisms or by having protective habitats. Thus, studying the {{evolution of}} sleep might give a clue not only to the developmental aspects and mechanisms, but also to an adaptive justification for sleep.|$|E

500|$|On Stranger Tides {{employed}} 1,112 {{shots of}} computer-generated imagery, which were done by ten visual effects companies. Cinesite visual effects supervisor Simon Stanley-Clamp {{claimed that the}} most difficult part was doing the effects in 3D: [...] "Rotoscoping <b>is</b> <b>tricky.</b> Cleaning up plates is double the work, and tracking has to be spot on." [...] The lead companies, with over 300 effects each, were Industrial Light & Magic—responsible for, among others, the mermaids and most water effects—and Moving Picture Company, who created digital ships and environment extensions, such as changing weather and designing cliffs and waterfalls. Filming the mermaids involved eight model-actresses, who portrayed them outside the water, as well as 22 synchronized swimming athletes and a group of stuntwomen, both of whom wore motion capture suits to be later replaced by digital mermaids. Mermaid corpses were depicted by plaster models. The design tried to avoid the traditional representations of mermaids in paintings and literature, instead going for a scaly body with a translucent membrane inspired by both jellyfish and the fabric employed in ballet tutus. To make the mermaids more menacing underwater, the faces of the actresses had some digital touch-ups on the underwater scenes, adding sharper teeth and a shimmery fish scale quality on the skin. ILM also handled Blackbeard's death, where Ian McShane's actual performance was covered by digital doubles which turned him into a [...] "boiling mass of blood and clothing", and a hurricane-like formation that represented [...] "the waters of the Fountain taking his life". Cinesite handled the recreation of London and Barbossa's peg leg, CIS Hollywood did 3D corrections and minor shots, and Method Studios created matte paintings.|$|E
500|$|On {{including}} the Punisher {{specifically in the}} season, where he is introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Goddard felt television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are [...] "able to do things {{on the small screen}} that fit that character better than if we had to water him down for the movies." [...] Goddard stated that the season's approach to the characters and their actions would be to do what makes sense for the characters rather than [...] "pushing the boundary" [...] or looking to shock the audience, though he noted that this could still go in a more [...] "adult...darker, dirtier" [...] way due to the freedom of Netflix and the presence of characters such as the Punisher. Petrie stated that the writers hoped to [...] "stir the pot" [...] and [...] "get people to think" [...] with the inclusion of the Punisher and his lethal methods, adding, [...] "Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 <b>is</b> <b>tricky</b> shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings." [...] Ramirez added that Castle was not referred to as [...] "Punisher" [...] in the writer's room, similarly to Wilson Fisk not being called [...] "Kingpin" [...] for season one, as it allowed the writers to think [...] "about [...] as a man with a vendetta, who made an oath to his dead family. The more specific it got, the less it became about issues outside of Hell’s Kitchen or other things." [...] In the series, the moniker of [...] "The Punisher" [...] is given to Castle by the media due to his aggressive actions.|$|E
500|$|Peter Westen and H. L. A. Hart {{argue that}} throffers {{are not always}} coercive, and, when they are, it is {{specifically}} the threat that makes them so. For a throffer to be coercive, they claim, the threat must meet three further conditions; firstly, the person making the throffer [...] "must be intentionally bringing the threat to bear on X in order that X do something, Z1", secondly, the person making the throffer must know that [...] "X would not otherwise do or wish to be constrained to do" [...] Z1, and, thirdly, the threat part of the throffer must render [...] "X's option of doing Z1 more eligible in X's eyes than it would otherwise be". As such, for the authors, {{there is the possibility}} of non-coercive throffers. The pair present three possible examples. Firstly, when the threat aspect of the throffer is a joke; secondly, when the offer aspect is already so desirable to the subject that the threat does not affect their decision-making; or, thirdly, when the subject mistakenly believes the threat immaterial because of the attractiveness of the offer. Rhodes similarly concludes that if a throffer is coercive, it is because of the threatening aspect. For him, the question is [...] "whether one regards the threat component of a throffer as both a necessary and sufficient condition of the performance of a behaviour". He argues that if the offer without the threat would have been enough for the agent subject to the proposal to act, then the proposal is not coercive. However, if both offer and threat aspects of the throffer are motivating factors, then it <b>is</b> <b>tricky</b> to determine whether the agent subject to the proposal was coerced. He suggests that differentiating between [...] "pure coercion" [...] and [...] "partial coercion" [...] may help solve this problem, and that the question of coercion in these cases is one of degree.|$|E

2500|$|Garbage was {{acclaimed}} {{by contemporary}} critics. In Entertainment Weekly, Steven Mirkin said the band's songwriting {{was just as}} exceptional as Vig's guitar and drum sounds, highlighting the [...] "menacing sexuality, sonic playfulness, inventive guitar treatments, and cool vocals by Shirley Manson". Gil Kaufman from Addicted to Noise found the record's sound [...] "akin to a Jackson Pollock painting, thick layers upon layers of sound that have been stripped down, torn apart, pasted together and then stripped again, until {{the result is a}} dizzying soundscape that reveals fresh nuances upon repeated listening". He added that the music's mix of ambience, rhythms, and noise [...] "gels and rises above the din thanks to catchy hooks and killer song construction." [...] Melody Maker hailed it as the closest to [...] "perfection as a pop/rock record" [...] as can be, while NME called it [...] "a reminder of how sweet angst can {{be in the hands of}} talented players". Garbage was voted the 19th best album of 1995 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by The Village Voice. The newspaper's Robert Christgau was somewhat less impressed by the album. He named [...] "Queer" [...] and [...] "Supervixen" [...] as its highlights while jokingly writing [...] "if Whale <b>is</b> <b>Tricky</b> without a dark side, Garbage is Whale without Tricky and depressed about it". Keith Harris wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide that the record's electronic guitar hooks and Manson's [...] "pop-star-as-one-night-stand" [...] persona were seductive but had a [...] "tawdry disposability".|$|E

60|$|Just as {{the compass}} <b>is</b> <b>tricky</b> and strives {{to fool the}} mariner by {{pointing}} in all directions except north, so does that guide post of the sky, the sun, persist in not being where {{it ought to be}} at a given time. This carelessness of the sun is the cause of more trouble--at least it caused trouble for me. To find out where one is on the earth's surface, he must know, at precisely the same time, where the sun is in the heavens. That is to say, the sun, which is the timekeeper for men, doesn't run on time. When I discovered this, I fell into deep gloom and all the Cosmos was filled with doubt. Immutable laws, such as gravitation and the conservation of energy, became wobbly, and I was prepared to witness their violation at any moment and to remain unastonished. For see, if the compass lied and the sun did not keep its engagements, why should not objects lose their mutual attraction and why should not a few bushel baskets of force be annihilated? Even perpetual motion became possible, and I was in a frame of mind prone to purchase Keeley- Motor stock from the first enterprising agent that landed on the Snark's deck. And when I discovered that the earth really rotated on its axis 366 times a year, while there were only 365 sunrises and sunsets, I was ready to doubt my own identity.|$|E

6000|$|There is {{at least}} one {{outstanding}} fact about the man we are studying; Bernard Shaw is never frivolous. He never gives his opinions a holiday; he is never irresponsible even for an instant. He has no nonsensical second self which he can get into as one gets into a dressing-gown; that ridiculous disguise which is yet more real than the real person. That collapse and humorous confession of futility was much of the force in Charles Lamb and in Stevenson. There is nothing of this in Shaw; his wit is never a weakness; therefore it is never a sense of humour. For wit is always connected with the idea that truth is close and clear. Humour, on the other hand, is always connected with the idea that truth <b>is</b> <b>tricky</b> and mystical and easily mistaken. What Charles Lamb said of the Scotchman is far truer of this type of Puritan Irishman; he does not see things suddenly in a new light; all his brilliancy is a blindingly rapid calculation and deduction. Bernard Shaw never said an indefensible thing; that is, he never said a thing that he was not prepared brilliantly to defend. He never breaks out into that cry beyond reason and conviction, that cry of Lamb when he cried, [...] "We would indict our dreams!" [...] or of Stevenson, [...] "Shall we never shed blood?" [...] In short he is not a humorist, but a great wit, almost as great as Voltaire. Humour is akin to agnosticism, which is only the negative side of mysticism. But pure wit is akin to Puritanism; to the perfect and painful consciousness of the final fact in the universe. Very briefly, the man who sees the consistency in things is a wit--and a Calvinist. The man who sees the inconsistency in things is a humorist--and a Catholic. However this may be, Bernard Shaw exhibits all that is purest in the Puritan; the desire to see truth face to face even if it slay us, the high impatience with irrelevant sentiment or obstructive symbol; the constant effort to keep the soul at its highest pressure and speed. His instincts upon all social customs and questions are Puritan. His favourite author is Bunyan.|$|E
