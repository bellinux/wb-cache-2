2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 2007, after finishing with his rehabilitation, Morgan explained how the song had [...] "haunted" [...] him around and badly affected his reputation. He stated {{that it was not}} pleasant to hear a song describing him as a [...] "bad guy" [...] which [...] "millions of people have heard". He elaborated, [...] "I was bummed out. I was really upset that she would say and <b>do</b> <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> In any relationship, I don't think it's right to say and <b>do</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> when people break up, and she obviously felt the need {{to go out there and}} make me sound like a complete a--hole ... I just refuse to lower myself to that level. But it was a painful thing and it got me down." [...] At the time of the interview, Seether's album Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; [...] "Breakdown" [...] was initially pinpointed as a possible answer. In response to that, Morgan elaborated that the particular song was not an [...] "angry backlash" [...] and it was [...] "more universal" [...] as he was trying to be [...] "more vague and respectful". Talking about Lee's song, he mentioned how [...] "there are always two sides to every story", yet, he opted not to tell his side as [...] "hat's what the bloodthirsty want, and I don't care what the bloodthirsty want" [...] emphasizing that he [...] "didn't feel the need to write back and be mean". He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people will be looking for that Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, she wanted to keep it.|$|E

Flea said, that he just felt {{like he wanted to}} take two years away just to really look and see if the band was [...] "something we should still be doing". [...] "Things had gotten dysfunctional and not fun, even though I thought we were making great records, doing great shows and were a really powerful, mighty thing as a band. I was proud of what we did." [...] "For me, the biggest thing during the time off, and what really made me want to continue doing the band, specifically after decided he didn't want to continue in the band anymore, [...] I just realized, Anthony, man, he's my brother, I love him so much, and we started this band when we were kids. I wanted to keep that going, I never want to let that go. Playing with him is something, even though I can do other things that are exciting and beautiful and I always will <b>do</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> and I'll always want to grow and do music outside of the band, the thing that we have is special to us and something that is blood." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to <b>do</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off.
