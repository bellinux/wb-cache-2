50|$|Public health {{indicators}} show a dramatic corresponding decline. Although all post-Soviet countries experiences an immediate <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>birth-rates</b> due to economic turmoil {{this may have}} been particularly acute in Russia. In 1999, total population fell by about three-quarters of a million people. Meanwhile, life expectancy dropped for men from 64 years in 1990 to 57 years by 1994, while women's dropped from 74 to about 71. Both health factors and a sharp increase in deaths of the youth demographic from unnatural causes (such as murders, suicides and accidents) have significantly contributed to this trend. Closely related to the declining life expectancy, alcohol-related deaths skyrocketed 60% in the 1990s and deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases shot up 100%, mainly because medicines were no longer affordable to the poor. As of 2009, life expectancy is higher than at the nadir of the crisis in 1994, yet it still remains below the 1990 level, with men living to 59, and with women's life expectancy decreasing to 70.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that, in estimating secular trends ofcancer mortality, {{the changing}} age-structure {{of the population}} {{must be taken into}} account.

This increase is attri-butable to two causes: first, the falling mortality in lower age groups consequent upon improvements in public health and the treatment of infectious diseases; secondly, the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the <b>birth-rate</b> which took place between 1901 and 1931.

40|$|This dissertation, {{the first}} book-length {{investigation}} {{of the works of}} Julia Franck, investigates representations of the mother-daughter relationship in Franck 2 ̆ 7 s five major texts: Der neue Koch (1997), Liebediener (1999),Bauchlandung: Geschichten zum Anfassen (2000), Lagerfeuer (2003), and Die Mittagsfrau (2007). Specifically, it examines the roles of 2 ̆ 2 daughter 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 mother 2 ̆ 2 as social constructs, which are open to resignification and reinvestigation. In the introduction, I outline the trajectory of Franck 2 ̆ 7 s career, focusing particularly on her relationship with feminist scholarship and her persona as a representative of feminism in the German media. In chapter 1, I begin with Judith Butler 2 ̆ 7 s theory of gender performativity and look for examples of performative identity in Franck 2 ̆ 7 s works of fiction. I further destabilize identity in chapter 2 by demonstrating how identity is contingent on space, drawing on Marc Augé 2 ̆ 7 s theory of 2 ̆ 2 places 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 non-places. 2 ̆ 2 In chapter 3, I demonstrate how psychoanalysis, as the primary theoretical lens through which the mother-daughter relationship has been viewed, conflicts with destabilized gender binaries, as laid out in chapter 1. Consequently, I argue, the psychoanalytic models of attachment and identity are not relevant to an {{investigation of the}} mothers and daughters in Franck 2 ̆ 7 s works. I explain my theory of 2 ̆ 2 maternal drag 2 ̆ 2 in chapter 4. I argue that the mother figures in Franck 2 ̆ 7 s novels exhibit a performative maternal identity, specifically one that so conflicts with expectations of the maternal that it calls into question those very expectations. Finally, in the conclusion, I consider the wider implications of my theory, particularly in light of the media discussions in Germany surrounding feminism, motherhood, and the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>birth-rate...</b>|$|R
6000|$|A {{portion of}} infant and child {{mortality}} represents {{no doubt the}} lingering and wasteful removal from this world of beings with inherent defects, beings who, for the most part, ought never to have been born, and need not have been born under conditions of greater foresight. These, however, are the merest small fraction of our infant mortality. It leaves untouched {{the fact that a}} vast multitude of children of untainted blood and good mental and moral possibilities, as many, perhaps, as 100 in each 1,000 born, die yearly through insufficient food, insufficient good air, and insufficient attention. The plain and simple truth is that they are born needlessly. There are still too many births for our civilisation to look after, we are still unfit to be trusted with a rising birth-rate. [Footnote: It is a digression from the argument of this Paper, but I would like to point out here a very popular misconception about the birth-rate which needs exposure. It is known that the <b>birth-rate</b> is falling <b>in</b> all European countries--a fall which has a very direct relation to a rise in the mean standard of comfort and the average age at marriage--and alarmists foretell a time when nations will be extinguished through this decline. They ascribe it to a certain decay in religious faith, to the advance of science and scepticism, and so forth; it is a part, they say, of a general demoralization. The thing is a popular cant and quite unsupported by facts. The <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the <b>birth-rate</b> is--so far as England and Wales goes--partly a real decline due to a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> gross immorality, partly to a real decline due to the later age at which women marry, and partly a statistical decline due to an increased proportion of people too old or too young for child-bearing. Wherever the infant mortality is falling there is an apparent misleading fall <b>in</b> the <b>birth-rate</b> due to the [...] "loading" [...] of the population with children. Here are the sort of figures that are generally given. They are the figures for England and Wales for two typical periods.|$|R

This {{article examines}} why these attitudes and ideas persist and how the Japanese media, specifically Japanese parenting magazines, may contribute to perpetuating traditional attitudes towards parenting roles. The article explores how parenting is represented in text and visual elements of contemporary popular parenting magazines, with comparisons made between the distinct approaches of selected Japanese and English-language parenting magazines. The findings indicate that narrow and stereotypical representations of mothers and fathers remain common in the Japanese parenting magazines. The findings also highlight the lack of visibility of the social context within which parenting occurs, with parenting represented as a largely individual-level experience. In contrast, the English-language parenting magazines depict a more diverse range of social issues of relevance to parenting, a more diverse range of family structures, and greater involvement of fathers in parenting compared to Japanese parenting magazines...|$|R

30|$|Given the {{inability}} to explain the <b>decline</b> by shifts <b>in</b> the composition of individual and business characteristics, we explored a few additional methods of explaining the decline.

This tells us that the explanation for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> hires and separations will be different than the explanation for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> job creation and job destruction.

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{and influential}} literature finds {{a large and}} significant <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> macroeconomic volatility {{since the middle of}} the 1980 's. In this paper, I examine {{the extent to which the}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> annual and quarterly real output volatility since the onset of this period of Great Moderation can be attributed to changes in macroeconomic uncertainty and macroeconomic predictability. I use point forecasts of future real output growth from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) between 1969 and 2003 as a proxy for the predictable component of real output growth. The results indicate that declining predictability has played a significant role in the Great Moderation. Prior to the Great Moderation, professional forecasts explained roughly 30 percent of the variance in output growth. Post-moderation, the predictive ability of professional forecasts quickly vanished. This <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> predictability implies that interpreting the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the volatility of output shocks identified from a fixed parameter autoregressive model overstates the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> macroeconomic uncertainty by between 20 - 40 percent. I also examine forecasts of the probability of a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> real output from the SPF. Consistent with the findings from the point forecast data, these probability forecasts indicate that the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> macroeconomic uncertainty as measured from an autoregressive model is overstated. While both the average probability of a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> output and the uncertainty surrounding future <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> output computed from an autoregressive model decrease sharply after the mid- 1980 's, the SPF probability forecasts exhibit no such decrease. I assess the economic significance of the overstatement <b>in</b> the <b>decline</b> of macroeconomic uncertainty in terms of its effects on forecasts of the future equity premium.
