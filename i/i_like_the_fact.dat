50|$|Look {{away from}} the {{sometimes}} aggressively showy filmmaking and an ill-advised stab at screwball comedy {{in the second half}} (involving a Sivaji Ganesan fan), and you have some solid writing. I'm not usually a fan of narratives that stop periodically to reveal that what you thought you just saw wasn't really what happened but the reveals here are cleverly done and they come together convincingly. The return of an actor-aspirant from the early parts of the film is an especially nice touch.What Naalu Peruku lacks is that certain something that sets a Soodhu Kavvum apart. But <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> moralising is kept to a minimum, and there's no lecturing. When a desperate Prabhu tries to rob a restaurant owner, he discovers that his father works as a security guard there. In a lesser movie, he'd slap his head and transform into a good man.

40|$|DNR personnel, {{along with}} {{staff at the}} West Virginia GIS Technical Center, have worked {{diligently}} this year to provide outdoor recreationists with a virtual tool. Whether you hunt, trap, fish, hike, canoe or go on birdwatching outings, you’ll find a new mapping tool on our website to be very helpful. The mapping tool {{can be found at}} www. wvdnr. gov under either the Hunting or Fishing headings, or by clicking on the black bear icon {{at the top of the}} home page. While similar to the interactive trout stream map which has been on the DNR website for five years, this also includes information on warmwater fishing and hunting. You can find instructions for using the map on the landing page, choose whether you want to explore information related to hunting or fishing, and then click the appropriate box. Once on the appropriate map of West Virginia, you’ll find a variety of tools at your disposal. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that you can view the maps as either topo maps or as satellite images. On the hunting map, hunters and trappers can find the location of license agents, check stations, public shooting ranges, wildlife management areas, Class Q hunter access roads, and hiking trails throughout the state. A search option allows you to focus on a specific county, WMA or state forest. If you want to check on fishing information while on the hunting page, a simple click reveals fishing and boating access sites, trout stocked streams, public fishing lakes, and float trips. A tool allows you to measure the length of a stream section you wish to float. As with the hunting site, an option allows you to search for a specific body of water or county. While the tool works best with a high-speed Internet connection, those with dial-up can still access the maps, albeit at a slower pace. I welcome you to visit our website and explore your favorite haunts with this new mapping tool. After planning your adventure online, then go out and experience the best that West Virginia has to offer...|$|E
