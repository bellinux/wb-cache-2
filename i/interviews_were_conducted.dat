If one discounts the corrupt criminality and its political fallout, the Phoenix partisans were perhaps better able tactically to confront the elusive Viet Cong support networks, i.e., the sea in which the fish swam, than the regular units of the ARVN and the U.

2500|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{psychologists and}} psychiatrists met with Chapman {{in the six months}} prior to trial—three for the prosecution, six for the defense, and several more on behalf of the court.

[...] The three prosecution experts declared that his delusions fell short of psychosis, and instead diagnosed various personality disorders. [...] The court-appointed experts concurred with the prosecution's examiners that he was delusional, yet competent to stand trial. In the examinations, Chapman was more cooperative with the prosecution's mental health experts than with those for the defense, possibly (according to one psychiatrist) because he did not wish to be considered [...] "crazy", and persuaded himself that the defense experts only declared him insane because they were hired to do so.|$|E
