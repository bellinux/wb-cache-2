500|$|California Chrome's {{connections}} drew post position {{five for}} the Derby. He was the morning line favorite at odds of 5–2. The press {{suggested that the}} number five spot, relatively close to the <b>inside</b> <b>rail,</b> {{could be a problem}} owing to the [...] "speed horses" [...] that would go to the front early in the race, surrounding him on both sides, especially if the colt was slow out of the gate. [...] Espinoza countered by pointing out that he won the 2002 Kentucky Derby on War Emblem from the same post position.|$|E
500|$|Secretariat next went to Saratoga, popularly nicknamed [...] "the {{graveyard}} of champions", {{in preparation}} for the Whitney Stakes on August 4, where he would face older horses the first time. On July 27, he put in a stunning workout of 1:34 for a mile on a sloppy track, a time that would have broken Saratoga's track record. On race day though, he was beaten by the Allen Jerkens-trained Onion, a four-year-old gelding who had set a track record at [...] furlongs in his previous start. The track condition for the Whitney was labelled fast but was running slow, especially along the <b>inside</b> <b>rail.</b> Secretariat broke poorly and Onion led from the start, setting a slow pace running well off the rail. Down the backstretch, Turcotte chose to make his move along the rail rather than sweeping wide. Secretariat responded more sluggishly than usual and Turcotte went to the whip. Secretariat closed to within a head on the final turn before Onion pulled ahead in the straight to win by a length. A record crowd of more than 30,000 witnessed what was described as an [...] "astonishing" [...] upset.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 October, Winx started {{favourite}} for Australia's {{most prestigious}} weight-for-age race, the Cox Plate over 2040 metres at Moonee Valley Racecourse. The field included an international element with Highland Reel (Secretariat Stakes) from Ireland, Arod (Diomed Stakes, Summer Mile Stakes) from England and Gailo Chop (Prix Guillaume d'Ornano) from France. The filly raced on the <b>inside</b> <b>rail,</b> broke {{clear of the}} field entering the straight and won by four and three quarter lengths from Criterion in a race record time of 2:02.98. After the race, her jockey Hugh Bowman said [...] "She's a group 1 mare, she's a serious racehorse. From the 800, I was very confident". Waller commented [...] "She is just such an athlete. I never thought {{when she was a}} young horse this was where she would get to".|$|E

2500|$|On 20 April Neo Universe {{was made}} 13/5 {{favourite}} for the ten furlong Satsuki Shō (Japanese 2000 Guineas), {{the first leg}} of the Japanese Triple Crown. Ridden again by Demuro he was trapped behind other horses and appeared to be in a hopeless position, but accelerated through a narrow gap defeated Sakura President by a head after a [...] "fierce struggle", with the previous season's champion two-year-old Eishin Champ in third place. The winner's next race was the Tokyo Yūshun over one and a half miles at Tokyo Racecourse on 1 June. The race attracted a crowd of 134,000 and Neo Universe was made clear favourite in a field of eighteen. The track was unusually wet and muddy, leading many jockeys to take their horses to the outside in search of better racing ground but Demuro kept the favourite towards the <b>inside</b> <b>rail</b> and won comfortably, beating Zenno Rob Roy by half a length with That's The Plenty three quarters of a length back in third. Demuro, who became the first foreign jockey to win the race, never had to use his whip and described Neo Universe as [...] "unbelievable. If he did any more he'd be flying". Four weeks later, Neo Universe was matched against older horses for the first time when he was one of seventeen runners invited to contest the Takarazuka Kinen at Hanshin Racecourse. He finished fourth behind Hishi Miracle, one place ahead of the Japanese Horse of the Year Symboli Kris S.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{took place}} on 27 June 1931, with 70,000 spectators {{attending}} to see Mick the Miller take on [...] "The Black Express" [...] Ryland R. The two dogs were both matched as joint favourites for the final at odds of 13–8. The other four dogs in the race were Golden Hammer, Mick's Fancy, Seldom Lad and Brunswick Bill. Just after 9pm, Ryland {{is out of the}} traps ahead of the others once again, with Mick in last position as they go around the first bend. Ryland led all the way until the final turn where Seldom Lad closed on him. The two dogs made contact and swung wide, the race steward spotted that Ryland had turned to snap at Seldom Lad and set off the no–race klaxon. The noise is drowned out by the crowd as Mick the Miller is suddenly coming through the pack. Despite being bumped earlier in the race, he found the <b>inside</b> <b>rail</b> and moved up past the others, beating Golden Hammer by a head at the line. The announcer repeats that it is a no race to the disappointment of the crowd. Ryland R was disqualified for [...] "nosing and impeding" [...] another dog. Phiddy Kempton, Mick's owner at the time, broke down into tears, [...] "Mick has won! My darling Mick has won!" [...] he cried. A re–run was ordered for 9:55pm, while the crowd began to get unruly. Kempton was refusing to allow Mick to compete in the re–run, adamant he had already run the Derby. The directors of the Greyhound Racing Association were in attendance, and knowing the effect that both the two favourites not running in the final of the Derby would mean for the sport, convinced Kempton to run Mick.|$|E

Also overviewed types of stresses and most dangerous defects which they cause. As well as has been analyzed equipment {{that is being used}} to measure stresses in rails at the moment with their advantages and disadvantages. In the second section, four curves and two types of the vehicles were chosen, and according to their technical characteristics digital analysis were done. Also, in this chapter were formed principal scheme, according to which forces were calculated for outside and <b>inside</b> <b>rails</b> of the curves. After calculating the forces, in Comsol Multiphysics environment 3 D models were made according to chosen curves radiuses and rail types, rail materials were selected as well. Regarding to the results of digital analysis, parametrical analysis were done, where maximum speeds were calculated for explorative curves. In the final chapter, results from digital analysis were analyzed. Siemens locomotive’s results compared with rail car’s PESA, outside rail’s results compared with <b>inside</b> <b>rail’s,</b> conclusions were made about how size of stresses changes while changing radius of curved track, the speed of train or outside rail’s cant. Also results of parametrical analysis are being analyzed, which shows how axle load affects traveling speed of trains in curved track and how much this traveling speed could be raised in these curves for these types of trains...|$|R

50|$|When {{the outside}} rail is at higher {{elevation}} than the <b>inside</b> <b>rail,</b> {{it is called}} positive cant. This is normally the desired layout for curved track. Most counties achieve the desired level of positive cant by raising the outside rail to that level which is called superelevation. For Swiss railroad, the cant is done by rotating at the track axis (center of the two rails) to have outside rail super elevated (raised) at the half rate of the desired cant and the <b>inside</b> <b>rail</b> under elevated (lowered) at the same half rate of the desired cant.|$|E

50|$|At Epsom, on 29 May Plenipotentiary started 9/4 {{favourite}} for the Derby in a {{field of}} twenty-two runners, with Shilelagh, ridden by Sam Chifney being his main rival in the betting at 3/1. The race was the most anticipated for several years and attracted a crowd which was described as being unusually large and fashionable. After five false starts the race got under way, and although he broke quickly, Plenipotentiary was restrained by Patrick Conolly and settled just behind the leading group. After moving through a gap along the <b>inside</b> <b>rails,</b> Plenipotentiary moved up to challenge Glencoe for the lead early in the straight.
