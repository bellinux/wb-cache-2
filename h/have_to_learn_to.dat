Morse can be sent by persons with severe motion disabilities, {{as long as they have}} some minimal motor control. An original solution to the problem that caretakers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> decode has been an electronic typewriter with the codes written on the keys.

We detail how Bert and Dawn Dennis and their four adult offspring decided to amalgamate their associated businesses with the parent company and take on the challenge of professionalizing this new entity. We highlight that, although the four siblings had learnt business, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> now <b>learn</b> their family business. In addition, the CEO, Grant Dennis, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> lead the business. As well, the Dennis family <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> give up some control to professional management.

40|$|The {{development}} of postmortem imaging and its introduction into forensic medicine, especially modern cross-sectional imaging techniques, <b>have</b> led <b>to</b> {{the emergence of}} new specialties and subspecialties. As with other transdisciplinary projects, the need to become familiar with some characteristics of the respective other disciplines is both a challenge and an opportunity. The forensic pathologist <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> deal with the possibility of investigating the inside of a body without opening it, the radiologist <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> manage forensic questions and postmortem artifacts, and the radiographer <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> cope with dead bodies instead of living patients and adapt examination protocols. This chapter will give the reader the perspective of each of these three practitioners...|$|R
25|$|On 10 April, {{the cavalry}} moved {{up behind the}} {{advancing}} British infantry near Telegraph Hill and were kept in an exposed position overnight. The next morning, the British cavalry came under heavy German artillery and machine gun fire before they were withdrawn; McCreery was shot in his right thigh, severing his femoral artery. In an effort to stem the blood loss from his wound, the circulation in his leg had been restricted sufficiently to cause gangrene in his foot; McCreery refused to have his leg amputated but lost two toes {{and parts of the}} others. He would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> walk and ride again, and was affected by a pronounced limp {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E
500|$|Often {{credited}} with using fighting and intimidation as a tactic, Shero never coached players to fight. He valued team toughness {{and insisted that}} players take the body and follow through with their checks. When it came to fighting Shero {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I swear I have never told a player to attack another player. In fact, I have told my players if they ever hear me saying something like this, they can break a stick over my skull. I ask only that they play aggressively." [...] In an interview in the HBO documentary Broad Street Bullies Shero states that he had a team that liked fighting so he let them fight. Demonstrating his personal coaching philosophy that [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> win with what you got or you don't win at all." ...|$|E

500|$|One account {{published}} by the Church of Scientology says that Hubbard theorized that [...] "the world of subatomic particles might possibly provide {{a clue to the}} human thought process" [...] and he was [...] "concerned {{for the safety of the}} world, recognising that if man were to handle the atom sanely for the greatest benefit, he would first <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> handle himself." [...] He enrolled on a nuclear physics course [...] "to synthesise and test all knowledge for what was observable, workable and could truly help solve man's problems." [...] Another profile calls him [...] "a product of the atomic age" [...] and describes how his classmates dreamed of unlocking the energy of the atom, while Hubbard himself sought to [...] "discover the basic equations of life force, simply, to him, another kind of energy." [...] Hubbard stated that he [...] "set out to find out from nuclear physics a knowledge of the physical universe, something entirely lacking in Asian philosophy." ...|$|E
500|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), {{recovering}} from his Borg assimilation, visits his family's vineyard in La Barre, France, which {{is run by}} his elder brother Robert (Jeremy Kemp) {{along with his wife}} Marie (Samantha Eggar) and son René (David Birkin). Jean-Luc is considering a position on earth with an underwater research project called Atlantis. Robert has always been jealous of his brother's success and is concerned that Jean-Luc's presence will drive René to also join Starfleet. The two have a bitter argument and end up wrestling each other in a mud puddle, eventually culminating in an emotional reunion, with Jean-Luc admitting his sense of powerlessness and guilt at the things he did while {{under the influence of the}} Borg. Robert states that Jean-Luc will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> live with what he did, regardless of where he goes. [...] Jean-Luc decides to go back to the Enterprise. The two spend the night getting drunk as they resolve their differences. After Jean-Luc leaves, Robert decides to let René follow his dream to join Starfleet as René sits under a tree and looks up at space.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{discussed}} the idea {{with other members}} of the writing staff; they focused on the incident which caused Picard to require an artificial heart. It had previously been mentioned in the episodes [...] "Samaritan Snare" [...] and [...] "Final Mission". They compared Picard to Captain James T. Kirk, describing them as opposites in terms of development. They saw Picard being a wildchild during his time at Starfleet Academy, only to become more serious later. The reverse for true for Kirk, with the staff describing him as a [...] "bookworm" [...] while at the Academy and only becoming [...] "crazy" [...] once posted to a starship. Together, they sought for a way to support Picard's claim in [...] "Samaritan Snare" [...] that he laughed when he was stabbed. Story editor René Echevarria said that [...] "It made us all think we had really come up with the right story for the premise and tying that together, I think it's one of the finest efforts ever." [...] While Moore called the episode [...] "A Q Carol" [...] based on the original premise, but Piller was the one to suggest [...] "Tapestry" [...] as he said [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> set your part of the tapestry of your life".|$|E

500|$|In September 1978, Joy Division {{made their}} {{television}} debut performing [...] "Shadowplay" [...] on So It Goes, with an introduction by Wilson {{in which he}} misidentified Sumner, and not Hook, as being from Salford. In October, Joy Division contributed two tracks recorded with producer Martin Hannett to the compilation double-7" [...] EP A Factory Sample, the first release by Tony Wilson's record label, Factory Records. In the NME review of the EP, Paul Morley hailed the band as [...] "the missing link between Elvis Presley and [...] the Banshees". Joy Division joined Factory's roster, after buying themselves {{out of the deal}} with RCA. Rob Gretton was made a partner of the label so as to represent the interests of the band. On 27 December, Ian Curtis had his first recognisable epileptic episode. During the ride home after a show at the Hope and Anchor pub in London, Curtis experienced an epileptic seizure and was taken to a hospital. In spite of his illness, Joy Division's career progressed. He appeared on the cover of 13 January 1979 issue of the NME following the persistence of music journalist Paul Morley. That month the band recorded their first session for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. According to Deborah Curtis, [...] "Sandwiched in between these two important landmarks was the realization that Ian's illness was something we would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> accommodate".|$|E

Märta Birgit Svensson combined her middle name with Nilsson to form her new stage name. Her teachers at the Academy were Joseph Hislop and Arne Sunnegårdh. However, she considered herself self-taught: [...] "The best teacher is the stage", she told an interviewer in 1981. [...] "You walk out onto it, and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> project." [...] She deplored her early instruction and attributed her success to native talent.

2500|$|Sound {{is at the}} {{beginning}} of language learning. Children <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> distinguish different sounds and to segment the speech stream they are exposed to into units – eventually meaningful units – in order to acquire words and sentences. Here is one reason that speech segmentation is challenging: When you read, there are spaces between the words. No such spaces occur between spoken words. So, if an infant hears the sound sequence “thisisacup,” it has to learn to segment this stream into the distinct units “this”, “is”, “a”, and “cup.” Once the child is able to extract the sequence “cup” from the speech stream it has to assign a meaning to this word. Furthermore, the child {{has to be able to}} distinguish the sequence “cup” from “cub” in order to learn that these are two distinct words with different meanings. Finally, the child has to learn to produce these words.|$|E
2500|$|Wright's {{particular}} emphasis {{has been on}} what he asserts is a core feature of communication, that, in order for an updating {{to be set up}} and made possible, both speaker and hearer have to behave as if they have identified [...] "the same singular thing", which, he notes, partakes of the structure of a joke or a story. Wright says that this systematic ambiguity seems to opponents of qualia to be a sign of fallacy in the argument (as ambiguity is in pure logic) whereas, on the contrary, it is sign—in talk about [...] "what" [...] is perceived—of something those speaking to each other <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of. In extending this analysis, he has been led to argue for an important feature of human communication being the degree and character of the faith maintained by the participants in the dialogue, a faith that has priority over what has before been taken to be the key virtues of language, such as [...] "sincerity", [...] "truth", and [...] "objectivity". Indeed, he considers that to prioritize them over faith is to move into superstition.|$|E
2500|$|The Bengali {{consonant}} clusters ( [...] juktôbênjôn) {{are usually}} realized as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first {{is put on}} top of or {{to the left of}} the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist a few visual formulas to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more [...] "transparent" [...] graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> recognize both the new [...] "transparent" [...] and the old [...] "opaque" [...] forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have {{to make it clear that}} from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
