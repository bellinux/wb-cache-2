5|$|Kenyatta {{had made}} clear {{his belief that}} Kenya should become a one-party state, {{regarding}} this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system. In the <b>first</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of independence, he consolidated his control of the central government, seeking to prevent the entrenchment of tribal power bases by removing {{the autonomy of the}} country's provinces. He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist more rapid economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations. In 1969, it passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which stopped grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leonardo's early life. He spent his <b>first</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> in the hamlet of Anchiano {{in the home of}} his mother, and from 1457 lived in the {{household}} of his father, grandparents and uncle {{in the small town of}} Vinci. His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera Amadori, who loved Leonardo but died young in 1465 without children. When Leonardo was sixteen (1468), his father married again to twenty-year-old Francesca Lanfredini, who also died without children. Piero's legitimate heirs were born from his third wife Margherita di Guglielmo (who gave birth to six children: Antonio, Giulian, Maddalena, Lorenzo, Violante and Domenico) and his fourth and final wife, Lucrezia Cortigiani (who bore him another six children: Margherita, Benedetto, Pandolfo, Guglielmo, Bartolomeo and Giovanni).|$|E
5000|$|The 1930s saw {{major changes}} in the supply and {{distribution}} of consumer goods in the Soviet Union. The <b>First</b> <b>Five</b> <b>Year</b> Plan focused on the industrialization of the country and the production of industrial goods. After the successful industrialization drive in the <b>First</b> <b>Five</b> <b>Year</b> Plan the government turned its focus to improving the lives of its citizens. The introduction of the Second <b>Five</b> <b>Year</b> Plan in 1933 attempted to accomplish this by shifting the focus of production exclusively from industrial goods to include the production of some consumer goods. The Party Congress of February 1934 bolstered the calls for improvement of both quantity and quality in food products and other consumer goods. These changes led Stalin to declare in 1935 that [...] "Life has become more joyous".|$|R

5|$|On January 16, 1995, Paramount {{launched}} a new broadcast television network, the United Paramount Network (UPN), in a programming partnership with Chris-Craft Industries; Viacom (which acquired Paramount Pictures and its related holdings in 1994) would acquire 50% interest in the network in 1996 and acquire Chris-Craft's remaining stake in 2000. During its 11-year existence, UPN never made a profit; The New Yorker reported that the network had lost $800 million during its <b>first</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of operation. UPN ceased operations in September 2006, when it merged with the WB Television Network to form The CW Television Network.

5|$|Smith {{reported}} in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, {{that he had}} had to ditch into a pasture, landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were part of the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In the <b>first</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of US Post Office air mail service the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E

5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the <b>first</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Adams {{created the}} concept of the shortstop position, {{according}} to Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the <b>first</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight. Adams' shortstop position, at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved toward the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased. Prior to the invention of the shortstop, large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields; defensive players tended to stand by bases, leaving empty space in between them for batters. The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.|$|E
