2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century {{a young woman}} named Lorna Mitchell decided to enter a Highland dance competition. As this was not {{expressly}} forbidden, she was allowed to enter. Since then the number of females participating in the sport has increased until today in excess of 95% of all dancers are female. There have been several female World Champions crowned at the Cowal Gathering since they began organising the competition in 1948. The first American to win the Adult World Championship was Hugh Bigney, who won the title in 1973. [...] Indeed the first three Adult World Championships were won by ladies: Nancy Cotter of New Zealand (1948), Margaret Samson (1949 and 1950). This <b>feminisation</b> of folk arts is a common pattern {{in the process of}} their [...] "gentrification", especially after they no longer serve a functional role in a male-centred, warrior culture.|$|E

"From {{the most}} damnable <b>feminisation!</b> I am {{so far from}} thinking, as you set forth the other night, {{that there is not}} enough women in our general life, that it has long been pressed home to me that {{there is a great deal}} too much. The whole {{generation}} is womanised; the masculine tone is passing out of the world; it's a feminine, a nervous, hysterical, chattering, canting age, an age of hollow phrases and false delicacy and exaggerated solicitudes and coddled sensibilities, which, if we don't soon look out, will usher in the reign of mediocrity, of the feeblest and flattest and the most pretentious that has ever been. The masculine character, the ability to dare and endure, to know and yet not fear reality, to look the world in the face and take it for what it is--a very queer and partly very base mixture--that is what I want to preserve, or rather, as I may say, to recover; and I must tell you that I don't in the least care what becomes of you ladies while I make the attempt!" ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Feminisation</b> of {{the work}} {{industry}} is the pressure created from the cultural turn where the issues of fairness, opportunity and redistribution in society overcome economic inequalities and find more balance to combat income inequality, social exclusion and cultural imperialism. The issues of sexual differences, gender roles and employment and services inequalities are questioned, abandoned and demolished. <b>Feminisation</b> {{of the work}}place links to the Marxist approach where everyone {{has the ability to}} sell their labour power to own the means of production. Women were able to work in ‘spatial reach’ jobs with flexible and family-friendly working hours because of their childcare responsibilities.|$|E

Disgusted by what he called [...] "a lynching", Soral gave up cinema altogether and returned to writing. He published Jusqu'où va-t-on descendre? - Abécédaire de la bêtise ambiante ("How far down are we going? - ABC's of ambient stupidity"), followed by Socrate à Saint-Tropez (2003) and Misères du désir (2004).|$|E

50|$|The <b>feminisation</b> of the {{workplace}} is the trend towards greater employment of women, and of men {{willing and able to}} operate with these more 'feminine' modes of interaction.

50|$|CriticismsFrom the mid-2000s, the {{approach}} of smart economics and its chief proponent -World Bank- met {{a wide range of}} criticisms and denouncements.

50|$|In January 1972, in {{his first}} show after his return from exile in London, Caetano Veloso {{appeared}} on stage dressed and dancing like Carmen Miranda.

50|$|For Soral « <b>feminisation</b> » {{is not so}} much a {{movement}} as an evolution supportive of the liberal capitalist economy. He points out that the appearance in the labour market of huge numbers of additional women contributes to salary stagnation. The fact that so many women earn salaries makes them often less critical and more committed as consumers than the men. Soral concludes that feminism is therefore a mask to conceal and sustain economic liberalism.|$|E
50|$|In this book, {{the author}} {{analyses}} {{what he considers}} to be the <b>feminisation</b> of society, or rather its devirilisation. Based on several examples from different fields, the writer denounces the passage from a patriarchal and traditional society to a modern and feminised one. The writer also examines all economic and social consequences of this movement. The analysis also allows the writer to explains {{the foundation of the}} behaviour of the last newly immigrated.|$|E
50|$|In men {{testicular}} swelling is {{the most}} common presenting feature. Other symptoms depend on their age and the type of tumour. If it is secreting androgens the tumour is usually asymptomatic, but can cause precocious puberty in pre-pubertal boys. If the tumour secretes oestrogens it can cause <b>feminisation</b> in young boys. In adults, this causes a number of problems including gynaecomastia, erectile dysfunction, infertility, feminine hair distribution, gonadogenital atrophy, and a loss of libido.|$|E

5000|$|Critics {{argue that}} much of science fiction fetishizes masculinity, and that {{incorporation}} of technology into science fiction provides a metaphor for imagined futuristic masculinity. Examples are the use of [...] "hypermasculine cyborgs and console-cowboys". Such technologies are desirable as they reaffirm the readers' masculinity and protect against <b>feminisation.</b> This fetishisation of masculinity via technology in science fiction differs from typical fetishisation in other genres, in which the fetishised object is always feminine.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed {{to the growth of}} the sex trade in nineteenth century Poland, {{including}} increasing urbanisation, with growing cities and a population shift from the land to the towns and cities. The increasing <b>feminisation</b> of poverty was also a contributing factor. So prevalent was paid sex amongst domestic servants, that a 1913 regulation required them to register for medical exams as well. A second class was waitresses, and after 1906, they too were registered.|$|E
50|$|He {{moved to}} Ghent in May 2010 where he {{continued}} to grow his FFS practice. In April 2015 he took over an aesthetic medical centre in Antwerp called the Piccard clinic, together with Dr. Ellen Defrancq. They renamed it into the o2 clinic. Owing this 1100m2 building enabled them to start 2pass Clinic which {{claims to be the}} world's first <b>feminisation</b> centre aiming {{to improve the lives of}} transwomen through surgery, hair removal treatment, voice training, psychological counseling, lessons to improve posture and body movements as well as style advice.|$|E
5000|$|This new, {{relative}} <b>feminisation</b> {{of power}} was partly explained by Giscard's government's fears of being confronted with another May 1968 {{and the influence}} of the MLF: [...] "We can therefore explain the birth of state feminism under the pressure of contest feminism féminisme de contestation", wrote Christine Bard. Although the far-left remained indifferent to the <b>feminisation</b> of power, in 1974, Arlette Laguiller became the first woman to present herself at a presidential election (for the Trotskyist party Workers' Struggle, LO), and integrated feminist propositions in her party. Giscard's achievements concerning the inclusion of women in government has been qualified by Françoise Giroud as his most important feat, while others, such as Evelyne Surrot, Benoîte Groult or the minister Monique Pelletier, denounced electoral [...] "alibis". The sociologist Mariette Sineau underlined that Giscard included women only in the low-levels of the governmental hierarchy (state secretaries) and kept them in socio-educative affairs. Seven women in eighteen (from 1936 to 1981) had offices related to youth and education, and four (including two ministers) had offices related to health, reflecting a traditional gender division. The important Ministry of Finances, Defence, Foreign Affairs and Interior remained out of reach for women. Only six women in eighteen had been elected through universal suffrage. The rest were nominated by the Prime Minister. Hélène Missoffe was the only deputy to be named by Giscard.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s, {{a number}} of bandurists also either died or {{disappeared}} under strange and unexplained circumstances. Some had accidents (Singalevych, Kukhta, Konyk). A significant number, approximately 30-50 bandurists, were also deported to Siberia from Western Ukraine. By the 1960s, total Communist Party control of the bandura art was achieved. A period of <b>feminisation</b> of the bandura took place where males were not accepted into conservatory courses to study the bandura. The repertoire of those that played the bandura underwent a major change from history songs and epics to romantic love and lyric works and transcriptions of classical piano works.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his book}} Vers la <b>féminisation?</b> Démontage d'un complot antidémocratique, Alain Soral argues {{that women have}} always worked (in trade or agriculture, for example). To him, {{feminism}} was invented by women tiring of their role as mothers. Soral distinguishes two types of feminism: that of the [...] "flippées" [...] ("freaked-outs") such as Simone de Beauvoir, {{and that of the}} [...] "pétasses" [...] ("bitches") like Élisabeth Badinter. Soral claims that the most problematic inequality is not between men and women, but between rich and poor, and that feminists, who generally come from the upper classes of society, attempt to distract attention from this struggle.|$|E
50|$|Bond had, however, {{already moved}} on by then. He had two novels {{published}} by Methuen but success really {{came when he}} began being published by Scholastic. His first book for the publishers was The Dragon Who Couldn't Help Breathing Fire (1990) and, by 1994, he was having books for teenagers published as well. These included three books for Scholastic's Point Romance series under the pseudonym Denise Colby, a clear reference to the US TV series Dynasty, {{as well as a}} <b>feminisation</b> of his own name, No 1, an in-depth look at {{the dark side of the}} pop music scene, and Avenue, about a soap opera.|$|E

She has held council with the Diamond King of Trolls and is untroubled by (and indeed seems quite interested in) the new trends in <b>feminisation.</b> Her tolerance was somewhat tested by Adora Belle Dearheart having removed four thousand priceless golems from territory that, by rights, belonged to her, but little seems to have come of it.
