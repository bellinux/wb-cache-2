5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> to {{the state}} {{legislature}} in January 1898, Bradley advocated {{the repeal of the}} state's Separate Coach Law, which provided separate streetcars for whites and blacks. He appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond the janitorial jobs they usually received. He named Edward E. Underwood as the first black person on the board of trustees for Kentucky State College (later the University of Kentucky). Because of his devotion to black advancement, Bradley was the only white person included in William Decker Johnson's 1897 compilation Biographical Sketches of Prominent Negro Men and Women of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Nixon, as he related <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>address,</b> {{came from}} a family of modest means, and had spent much of his time after law school either in the military, campaigning for office, or serving in Congress. After his {{successful}} 1950 Senate campaign, Nixon's backers continued to raise money to finance his political activities. These contributions went to reimburse him for travel costs, postage for political mailings which he did not have franked, and similar expenses. Such a fund was not illegal at the time, but, because Nixon had made a point of attacking government corruption, it exposed him to charges he might be giving special favors to the contributors.|$|E
5|$|The Continuum hypothesis, {{introduced}} by Cantor, was presented by David Hilbert {{as the first}} of his twenty-three open problems <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. Cantor's work also attracted favorable notice beyond Hilbert's celebrated encomium. The US philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce praised Cantor's set theory, and, following public lectures delivered by Cantor at the first International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Zurich in 1897, Hurwitz and Hadamard also both expressed their admiration. At that Congress, Cantor renewed his friendship and correspondence with Dedekind. From 1905, Cantor corresponded with his British admirer and translator Philip Jourdain on the history of set theory and on Cantor's religious ideas. This was later published, as were several of his expository works.|$|E

25|$|In such circumstances, {{efforts were}} mainly {{directed}} towards the old programme of 'rehabilitating Palestine'. Goldmann {{called for an}} extraordinary Zionist conference in 1942 to form a cohesive strategy to attenuate the devastating effects of Nazi policies on European Jews, and the outcome was the Biltmore Program, which called for, among other things, unrestricted Jewish immigration to Palestine. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> to the conference, Goldmann warned that Nazi rhetoric was to be taken seriously, {{and that there were}} foreseeable genocidal consequences for European Jews, were the Nazis to press on with their policies. At the May 1943 American Emergency Committee meeting, Goldmann, along with Abba Hillel Silver, was an advocate of the rationale that the struggle against the MacDonald White Paper was a step in the establishment of the Jewish commonwealth.|$|E

However, the bank was more vulnerable to a credit crunch as its 'high risk' business model depended on funding from the wholesale credit markets, 75% of its funds coming from this source. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> to the Treasury Select Committee, Bank of England governor Mervyn King had stated emergency funds would be made available to any British bank that needed it, but at a penalty rate, to ensure that lenders who had made bad lending decisions would suffer relative to lenders who had made sensible lending decisions.|$|E

25|$|Adding to {{the growing}} {{tensions}} between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted {{to give them an}} ultimatum—support our bill for suffrage or we will make sure you don’t get reelected. Burns stated “Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility.” She was no longer going to stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> to Congress. When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill. A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.|$|E
25|$|Although {{some members}} of the Liberty Party {{supported}} woman's rights, including women's suffrage, Garrison's Liberator continued to be the leading advocate of woman's rights throughout the 1840s, publishing editorials, speeches, legislative reports and other developments concerning the subject. In February 1849, Garrison's name headed the women's suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature, the first such petition sent to any American legislature, and he supported the subsequent annual suffrage petition campaigns organized by Lucy Stone and Wendell Phillips. Garrison took {{a leading role in the}} May 30, 1850, meeting that called the first National Woman's Rights Convention, saying <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> to that meeting that the new movement should make securing the ballot to women its primary goal. At the national convention held in Worcester the following October, Garrison was appointed to the National Woman's Rights Central Committee, which served as the movement's executive committee, charged with carrying out programs adopted by the conventions, raising funds, printing proceedings and tracts, and organizing annual conventions.|$|E
25|$|His guiding {{principle}} was “service to society, support for industry, and prosperity to enhance international trade” {{and he made}} sure that his staff must be very polite and patient with their clients, small depositors. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> to his staff in Qingdao branch, he emphasized that they must appreciate their customers business—whether for one or 100 Chinese dollars—must {{do their best to}} give their customers convenience, and must be friendly to businessmen. He said “the customer’s psychology always favors a busy place,” because the sight of a busy firm will make people trust it and claimed that the aim of The Shanghai Bank was to serve society and not just make a profit. So, even though some services would not be profitable, they still had to be offered.

25|$|The {{initiative}} {{was named after}} United States Secretary of State George Marshall, {{who served as the}} United States Army Chief of Staff during WWII. The plan had bipartisan support in Washington, where the Republicans controlled Congress and the Democrats controlled the White House with Harry S. Truman as president. The Plan was largely the creation of State Department officials, especially William L. Clayton and George F. Kennan, with help from the Brookings Institution, as requested by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Marshall spoke of an urgent need to help the European recovery <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> at Harvard University in June 1947. The purpose of the Marshall Plan was to aid in the economic recovery of nations after WWII and to reduce the influence of communist parties within them. In order to combat the effects of the Marshall Plan, the USSR developed its own economic plan, known as the Molotov Plan. It was not as effective as the Marshall Plan, and in some ways contradictory to Eastern Bloc countries that served alongside the Axis powers in WWII.|$|E
25|$|President K. R. Narayanan's {{address to}} the nation on the golden jubilee of the Indian Republic (26 January 2000) is {{considered}} a landmark: {{it was the first time}} a President attempted to analyse, with due concern for growing disparities, the several ways in which the country had failed to provide economic justice to the Indian people, particularly the rural and agrarian population; he also stated that discontent was breeding and frustrations erupting in violence among the deprived sections of society. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> to Parliament later that day, he praised the work of B. R. Ambedkar on the Indian constitution and cautioned against attempts to change its basic structure, concurring with Ambedkar's preference for accountability and responsibility over the stability of the government. He reiterated this in stronger terms in his next Republic day address (2001); on this occasion, he took exception to certain proposals seeking to abridge the franchise, and pointed out the wisdom of reposing faith in the common men and women of India as a whole, rather than in some elite section of society.|$|E
25|$|Cory and {{his family}} were devoutly Protestant and hostile to the Roman Catholic religion. Cory was noted for his {{interest}} in temperance and Low Church evangelism. He was a particular friend of Capel Zion at Ponthir in Monmouthshire. He was also a vice-president of the council of the Christian Service Union, an organisation with the aim of providing work and training for unemployed and vagrant boys and youths. In 1898, Cory {{was the head of the}} Welsh Protestant League, which had a reputation for being rabidly anti-Catholic. This background undoubtedly influenced his strong support for the Protestant, Unionist, opponents of the traditional Liberal policy of Irish Home Rule. He voted against the government in 1911 supporting an amendment which would have excluded any Home Rule Bill from the operation of the Parliament Bill. In April 1912, Cory was the only Liberal MP to vote against the government in the first reading of the Home Rule Bill. He voted against the Bill again on second reading repeated his rebellion on the third reading of the Bill on 7 July 1913. On 14 May 1914, Cory presided at an anti-Home Rule meeting at Caxton Hall, Westminster. He said he was in a unique position in that he was the only Liberal member returned as a declared opponent of Home Rule. At each of the last three elections he had distinctly put <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>address</b> that he would oppose Home Rule.|$|E
