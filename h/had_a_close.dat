40|$|AbstractLet G=⊕α<τGα be {{the direct}} sum of (discrete) groups endowed with the linear group {{topology}} whose base at the identity {{consists of the}} subgroups Uα=⊕α⩽β<τGβ, α<τ. We show that every subgroup H of G <b>has</b> <b>a</b> generating suitable set. In addition, if H is not closed in G, then H <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> generating suitable set. The case of topologically orderable topological groups is considered. It is proved that if a topologically orderable group G <b>has</b> <b>a</b> (<b>closed)</b> suitable set, then every dense subgroup of G also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> (<b>closed)</b> suitable set...|$|R

Magda <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> {{relationship}} with Hitler, and {{became a member of}} his small coterie of female friends. She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the blue}} and black {{wildebeest}} are currently classified in the same genus, the former was previously placed in a separate genus, Gorgon.

Following this exhibition Watts continued to work on the painting for a further five years.|$|E

She <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> {{relationship}} with her sister Annette Constantine and her father, Joseph Constantine, who was successful in the property and shipping sectors, was an Old Etonian pupil and served in the Coldstream Guards. When she was young, Constantine would rely on her father for fashion advice and has commented that any style that she has, she learned from him. He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions, although he was too modest to accept. His death came suddenly and was a milestone for Constantine.|$|E

5|$|During {{the filming}} of Victory of Faith, Hitler had stood {{side by side with}} the leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA) Ernst Röhm, a man with whom he clearly <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> working relationship. Rohm was ruthlessly murdered on Hitler's orders a short time later during the purge of the SA {{referred}} to as the Night of the Long Knives. It has gone on record that, immediately following the killings, Hitler subsequently ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed, although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{wanted to}} power the Q-12 with a ramjet engine built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc {{long-range}} surface-to-air missile. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn {{as long as the}} missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12's engine needed to operate at high temperatures {{for at least an hour}} and a half at high altitudes. The modified engine was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{lived with}} his parents into his thirties. His father died in the late 1880s and his mother died in 1894, leaving him with the family estate and business.

Despite their nineteen-year age difference, the couple fell in love and married on October 2. The Marshalls <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> {{marriage}} and were nearly inseparable, and spent only two nights apart during their nearly thirty-year marriage.|$|E

5|$|Nicolas Giraud {{was born}} in Greece to French parents; the name by which he is most {{commonly}} known, Nicolo, was {{given to him by}} Byron. Giraud may have been the brother-in-law of Giovanni Battista Lusieri, a Roman painter and broker for Lord Elgin. Demetrius Zograffo, Byron's guide in Greece, informed Byron that the 60-year-old Lusieri was unmarried, and was courting two women, each of whom believed that Lusieri was to marry her. Lusieri certainly <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> relationship with Giraud, so {{it is possible that the}} two were related in another way, perhaps as father and son. Byron met Giraud in Athens in January 1809, and the two were companions until Byron resumed his travels in March.|$|E
5|$|Since Ramanujan's {{father was}} at work most of the day, his mother {{took care of the}} boy as a child. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> {{relationship}} with her. From her, he learned about tradition and puranas. He learned to sing religious songs, to attend pujas at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits – all of which are part of Brahmin culture. At the Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Sir Francis and {{his wife}} were Protestants. In 1556 they went to Frankfurt in Germany to escape {{religious}} persecution under Queen Mary I, taking five of their children with them. It is unknown whether Lettice was among them, and she may have passed the next few years in the household of Princess Elizabeth with whom the family <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> relationship since the mid-1540s. They returned to England in January 1559, two months after Elizabeth I's succession. Francis Knollys was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household; Lady Knollys became a senior Lady of the Bedchamber, and her daughter Lettice a Maid of the Privy Chamber.|$|E
