50|$|In {{the matters}} {{concerning}} Cook Chemical, Scoggin, a corporate officer at Cook, had originally based his design on Calmar’s previous unpatented design, but later {{claimed that the}} integration of the sprayer and container solved the problem of <b>external</b> <b>leakage</b> during assembly and shipping of insecticide products. The district court held that Scoggin’s sprayer was not obvious because even though its individual elements were not novel, nothing in the prior art would have suggested the combination of elements. After the initial rejection of his patent, Scoggin drafted claims more carefully to distinguish the prior art, limiting new claims to the use of a rib seal, rather than a washer or gasket, to maintain a seal, as well as the existence of a small space between the overcap and the sprayer. Clark held that because Scoggin narrowed his claims to meet the limitations requested by the patent examiner, Cook Chemical could not now claim broader subject matter (see Prosecution history estoppel). Clark further held that the differences between Scoggin’s design and the prior art were simply too minor and non-technical to maintain the validity of Cook’s patent.|$|E
5000|$|On November 5, 1974, Kerr-McGee {{worker and}} labor union activist Karen Silkwood found herself exposed to {{plutonium}}-239 after working to grind and polish plutonium pellets {{by way of}} a glovebox to be used in nuclear fuel rods at the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site in Oklahoma. Inspection of the gloves would yield no evidence of <b>external</b> <b>leakage</b> of radioactive contaminant from the glovebox, despite the fact that plutonium had been found on those surfaces of the gloves that had contact with Silkwood's hands, and no other source for a plutonium leak could be ascertained despite thorough inspections of the air vents and surrounding surfaces. However, on November 6, despite Silkwood's prior decontamination and self-inspection, a detection on her part the next day yielded more signs of alpha activity on her hands, while health physics staff at the plant subsequently detected further alpha activity on her right forearm, neck and face. On November 7, Silkwood tested positive for very significant levels of alpha activity, and an inspection of her apartment showed high levels of radioactive contamination. Thereafter, Silkwood and two other co-workers personally associated with her (roommate Sherri Ellis and boyfriend Drew Stephens) would be tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory; while the latter two only tested positive for insignificant amounts of plutonium exposure, Silkwood was found to have [...] of plutonium-239 in her lungs, though researcher Dr. George Voelz insisted that this amount was still negligible and non-harmful. Later posthumous measurements taken after Silkwood's death under separate but likewise controversial circumstances were shown to be roughly consistent with the initial findings described by Dr. Voelz, but also indicated that she had somehow ingested plutonium prior to her demise. It would also be found that Karen Silkwood would not have had access to plutonium-239 for months after her transfer from metallography to rod assembly.|$|E

40|$|Wind-driven air {{infiltration}} {{has been recognized}} among the major reasons for energy loss in buildings, and the impact to energy efficiency under steady conditions has been reported and issued as part of many building codes. The nearly zero-energy building demand makes uncontrolled leakage paths even more undesired and creates {{the need for further}} investigation of their behavior under unsteady wind conditions. The present numerical study examines the role of wind gustiness on instantaneous infiltration rates of a low-rise building. For this purpose, two levels of gust frequency Ω have been simulated, expressed as a sinusoidal factor in the wind profile formula. In parallel, a ratio α is employed to represent seven different cases of <b>external</b> <b>leakages</b> distribution, while five scenarios of compartmentalization and internal leakages shows the impact of the latter on the dynamics of building air exchange rates. The results indicate that higher wind gustiness results in higher ACH, marking out gusts as a potential critical factor under unsteady climate conditions. The infiltration rates shown in relation to the leakage distribution ratio α provide arguments for the importance of the detailed detection of <b>external</b> <b>leakages</b> while the comparison of the different internal-volume-scenario highlights the key-role of internal leakages control towards a drastic reduction of infiltration rates...|$|R

Sample discs were tested in a flow rig designed to measure the pressure drop across the discs. Using filtered, degassed water at a flow rate of 1. 4  µl/min repeated flow measurements were taken (n= 6) for each disc. After flow testing, all discs were imaged using a scanning electron microscope and the dimensions of each hole were derived using image analysis software. In the <b>external</b> <b>leakage</b> study, corneoscleral buttons (n= 13) were prepared from cadaver pig eyes and mounted on an artificial anterior chamber infused with Tyrode solution. After the pressure had stabilised, standard occluded silicone tube implants were inserted through 23  gauge needle stab incisions at the limbus. These were compared against prototype PMMA implants with a novel shape profile inserted through 1. 15  mm width microvitreoretinal (MVR) stab incisions at the limbus. The infusion rate was maintained and a second pressure measurement was taken when the pressure had stabilised. The difference {{between the first and}} second pressure measurement was then compared, as an index of <b>external</b> <b>leakage.</b>  RESULTS—Ablated tubes were found to have a near perfect circular outline on both the entry and exit side. The observed pressure drops across the ablated sample discs at each target diameter were as follows: 10  µm, mean 25. 66  (SD 4. 9) mm Hg; 15  µm, 6. 7  (1. 15); 20  µm, 1. 66  (1. 07); and 25  µm, 0. 1).  CONCLUSIONS—It was shown that it is possible, in principle, to control the dimensions of a manufactured tubular lumen in a glaucoma drainage device accurately enough to provide consistent protection from hypotony in the early period after glaucoma filtration surgery.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{computational}} model of industrial-purpose hydraulic drive with two hydraulic volume adjustable working chamber machines (pump and motor). Adjustable pump {{equipped with the}} pressure control unit can be run together with several adjustable hydraulic motors {{on the principle of}} three-phase hydraulic socket-outlet with high-pressure lines, drain, and drainage system. The paper considers the pressure-controlled hydrostatic transmission with hydraulic motor as an output link. It shows a possibility to create a saving hydraulic drive using a functional tie between the adjusting parameters of the pump and hydraulic motor through the pressure difference, torque, and angular rate of the hydraulic motor shaft rotation. The programmable logic controller can implement such tie. The Coulomb and viscous frictions are taken into consideration when developing a computational model of the hydraulic volume displacement drive. Discharge balance considers <b>external</b> and internal <b>leakages</b> in equivalent clearances of hydraulic machines, as well as compression loss volume caused by hydraulic fluid compressibility and deformation of pipe walls. To correct dynamic properties of hydraulic drive, the paper offers that in discharge balance are included the additional regulated <b>external</b> <b>leakages</b> in the open circuit of hydraulic drive and regulated internal leakages in the closed-loop circuit. Generalized differential equations having functional multipliers and multilinked nature have been obtained to describe the operation of hydraulic positioning and speed drive with two hydraulic volume adjustable working chamber machines.

40|$|Tourism in {{the rural}} areas of {{developing}} countries is expanding at a rapid pace and is often a primary means of income in these areas. While the WTO (World Tourism Organization) and local developers encourage the expansion of this industry, others criticize tourism?s use as a tool for development in poor regions. Critics frequently use the core-periphery framework to examine how external control and high <b>external</b> <b>leakages</b> often result in the destination area remaining underdeveloped despite the large expenditures by tourists. Several studies have used the dependency framework to examine the core-periphery relationship on the international scale, but due to dependency?s traditional confinement to the international scale, the dependency framework has not been employed on smaller spatial scales. This study will examine the utility of the dependency framework on a regional scale in a rural area of a developing country by examining the distribution of income between the core and periphery. Additionally, while this economic problem of leakage, a major symptom of dependency, is well documented, there is a paucity of research on the methods to reduce leakage out of peripheral areas. Strategies that can be employed on the village level may be especially useful, as they do not require the cooperation of outside stakeholders who may profit from the leakages. By conducting informal interviews with key stakeholders, consulting informants, and surveying tourism businesses, this study seeks to understand the issue of dependency in Northern Thailand's rural tourism industry as well as to identify and evaluate the strategies currently employed in these villages to reduce leakages. The four case studies of rural villages determined that in all cases, the urban areas profited more from rural tourism than the villages; however, the amount of leakage out of the villages was highly varied. This variation appears to be largely due to the different strategies that each village employed. The villages, which employed a proactive economic strategy, had more success in reducing leakages than other villages. These findings support the unorthodox dependency framework...|$|R

40|$|A {{control valve}} that can {{throttle}} high-pressure cryogenic fluid embodies several design features that distinguish it over conventional valves designed for similar applications. Field and design engineers {{worked together to}} create a valve that would simplify installation, trim changes, and maintenance, thus reducing overall cost. The seals and plug stem packing were designed to perform optimally in cryogenic temperature ranges. Unlike conventional high-pressure cryogenic valves, the trim size can be changed independent of the body. The design feature that provides flexibility for changing the trim is a split body. The body is divided into an upper and a lower section with the seat ring sandwiched in between. In order to maintain the plug stem packing at an acceptable sealing temperature during cryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins were added to the upper body section. The body is made of stainless steel. The seat ring is made of a nickel-based alloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of the valve is cooled cryogenically, the body surrounding the seat ring contracts more than the seat ring. This feature prevents <b>external</b> <b>leakage</b> at the body-seat joint. The seat ring has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing surfaces {{on both sides of the}} seal groove. These sealing surfaces concentrate the body bolt load over a small area, thereby preventing <b>external</b> <b>leakage.</b> The design of the body bolt circle is different from that of conventional highpressure control valves. Half of the bolts clamp the split body together from the top, and half from the bottom side. This bolt-circle design allows a short, clean flow path, which minimizes frictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten the face-toface length of the valve, which is 25. 5 in. (65 cm).

40|$|International audienceGiven that {{airtightness}} {{is recognized}} as an essential issue for low-energy dwellings, today it is often included in energy performance (EP) calculations, frequently through single-zone models with uniform air leakage. Because more consideration is often given to EP than to indoor air quality issues, air leakage through internal partitions is often disregarded. Therefore, additional {{studies are needed to}} check these assumptions. In the present study air leakage through the building envelope and through internal partitions is investigated. This paper presents the methodology used in an experimental study, conducted to measure multizone air leakages, using the guarded zone pressurization technique. We developed a detailed innovative database with 456 exterior and internal partition wall air leakage measurements, taken in 23 detached houses. For each wall, the database includes general information on the building, special requirements, the building's main characteristics, measurement protocol, type of wall, measurement input data and measurement results (CL, n, q 50 and the reliability index developed). Then an analysis of this database is provided. The analysis reveals most important relationships. For instance, internal partition wall air leakage is not related to the envelope's airtightness level; instead, the type of building structure has greater influence. Through this study, we underline the impact on building airflows of more detailed modelling of internal and <b>external</b> air <b>leakage</b> in multizone approaches, with consequences on indoor air quality (IAQ) bedrooms where people spend most of their time.

40|$|The {{full scope}} of this program was to have {{included}} development tests, design and production of custom test equipment and acceptance and qualification testing of prototype and protoflight coupling hardware. This program was performed by Ball Aerospace Systems Division, Boulder, Colorado until its premature termination in May 1991. Development tests were performed on cryogenic face seals and flow control devices at superfluid helium (He II) conditions. Special equipment was developed to allow quantified leak detection at large leak rates up to 8. 4 x 10 (exp - 4) SCCS. Two major fixtures were developed and characterized: The Cryogenic Test Fixture (CTF) and the Thermal Mismatch Fixture (Glovebox). The CTF allows the coupling hardware {{to be filled with}} liquid nitrogen (LN 2), liquid helium (LHe) or sub-cooled liquid helium when hardware flow control valves are either open or closed. Heat leak measurements, internal and <b>external</b> helium <b>leakage</b> measurements, cryogenic proof pressure tests and external load applications are performed in this fixture. Special reusable MLI closures were developed to provide repeatable installations in the CTF. The Thermal Mismatch Fixture allows all design configurations of coupling hardware to be engaged and disengaged while measuring applied forces and torques. Any two hardware components may be individually thermally preconditioned within the range of 117 deg K to 350 deg K prior to engage/disengage cycling. This verifies dimensional compatibility and operation when thermally mismatched. A clean, dry GN 2 atmosphere is maintained in the fixture at all times. The first shipset of hardware was received, inspected and cycled at room temperature just prior to program termination...|$|R
40|$|The heat {{transferred}} to the turbine blade is substantially increased as the turbine inlet temperature is increased. Improved cooling methods are therefore needed for the turbine blades to ensure a long durability and safe operation. The blade tip region is exposed to very hot gas flow, and suffers high local thermal loads due to the <b>external</b> tip <b>leakage</b> flow. A common way to cool the tip is to design serpentine passages with 180 turn under the blade tip-cap {{taking advantage of the}} three-dimensional turning effect and impingement. Increased internal convective cooling is therefore required to increase the blade tip lifetime. In this paper, augmented heat transfer of a blade tip with internal hemispherical dimples has been investigated numerically. The computational models consist of two-pass channels with 180 turn and arrays of dimples depressed on the internal tip-cap. Turbulent convective heat transfer between the fluid and dimples, and heat conduction within dimples and tip are simultaneously computed. The inlet Reynolds number is ranging from 100, 000 to 600, 000. Details of the 3 D fluid flow and heat transfer over the tip-walls are presented. Comparisons of the overall performance of the models are presented. It is found that due to the combination of turning impingement and dimple-induced advection flow, the heat transfer coefficient of the dimpled tip is up to two times higher than that of a smooth tip with less than 5 % pressure drop penalty. It is suggested that the use of dimples is suitable for augmenting blade tip cooling to achieve an optimal balance between thermal and mechanical design requirements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
