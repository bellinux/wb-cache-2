40|$|The {{shelf life}} of <b>Graviera</b> <b>cheese,</b> a full fat cheese {{produced}} in Heraklion (Crete Greece), was investigated. <b>Graviera</b> <b>cheese</b> was stored at 4 degrees C {{for up to}} 90 days in polyamide packages under three different modified atmosphere compositions. Control cheeses were packaged in air whereas MAP mixtures were MAP(1) : 40 % CO 2 / 55 % N- 2 / 5 % O- 2, MAP(2) : 60 % CO 2 / 40 % N- 2 and MAP(3) : 50 % CO 2 / 50 % N- 2. Sampling of product was carried out every 10 days to investigate its sensory quality and microbiological characteristics. Ten trained panelists participated in the sensory panel to evaluate the cheeses for external appearance (color, texture), taste, and flavor in a scale from 1 to 10 (1 very poor, 10 very good). The microbiological analysis revealed {{that there were no}} colonies of Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes whereas both Escherichia coli and Total Viable Counts (TVC) increased strongly in control samples but were inhibited under all MAP compositions.

40|$|Growth {{probability}} and kinetic {{models for}} Listeria monocytogenes {{in response to}} multiple hurdles occurring during cheese anufacturing are mainly focused on suspended L. monocytogenes cells. This study aimed to compared: (i) the growth/no growth interface of L. monocytogenes cells attached on stainless steel (SS) surfaces, or in suspension, within adjusted media and (ii) the behavior of planktonic and detached Listeria cells during manufacturing and ripening of two popular Greek cheeses: Feta and Graviera. A multi-strains composite of L. monocytogenes isolates from cheese, factory and farm in Greece and Ireland, were grown in TSBYE, MRD, Milk, Feta and <b>Graviera</b> <b>cheese</b> {{in the presence of}} SS coupons (2 x 5 cm) for 3 d at 20 °C, to obtain the following inocula: planktonic cells (P), and cells detached from the SS coupons (D). Detachment took place by the bead vortexing method. For growth/no growth evaluation P and D cells were inoculated in TSBYE, adjusted to 5 pH (6. 8 - 4. 8) by lactic acid and at 4 aw (0. 945 - 0. 995) by NaCl. For evaluation of L. monocytogenes kinetics in cheese, P and D cells were inoculated at three simulated stages of Feta and Graviera manufacture: in pasteurized milk, after cutting the curd and after the first ripening. The growth of D cells slightly delayed compared to P cells while it was more affected by aw than pH. On cheese, L. monocytogenes survived throughout the ripening at low levels. The differences in probability of growth of single cells for both inocula (P and D) were assessed by stochastic approaches. Furthermore, PFGE analysis resulted that 91 % of the cells of any tested condition belonged to the cheese factory isolate. The re- sults may address safety implications relevant to the potential of attached cells to proliferate, whereas data may contribute to filling data gaps on risk assessment of L. monocytogenes isolates from the dairy industry...|$|E
50|$|The cooler {{climate and}} fertile soil {{lends itself to}} growing {{vegetables}} and fruit such as potatoes and apples, together with cereals. Small round stone houses (mitata) are used for making local <b>cheese</b> (<b>graviera).</b> In the warmer seasons shepherds bring their flocks onto pastures (madares, μαδάρες) {{on the slopes of}} the Lefka Ori.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{changes in}} the fatty acid profile {{including}} conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) of grated <b>Graviera</b> Agraphon <b>cheese</b> packaged in modified atmosphere under retail display lighting for up to 60 days at 4 degrees C, were determined. Saturated fatty acids increased, while monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids including CLA decreased by day 30 of storage and remained stable thereafter. In the aerobically packaged and light-exposed samples, lipid hydroperoxides increased by day 30 of storage and declined thereafter while malondialdehyde was increasing continuously during storage. Unlike the light-exposed modified atmosphere samples, these samples showed much lower hydroperoxide and malondialdehyde concentrations throughout storage...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the best}} known and most treasured cheeses unique to Zakynthos is Ladotyri which {{literally}} means [...] "oil cheese". Although, it shares the same name with Ladotyri from Lesvos it differs in texture, flavour and colour. Zakynthian Ladotyri is similar to feta but which is first steeped in brine to ripen for about three to four weeks before being drained, dried and submerged in Zakynthian olive oil. It {{is one of the more}} pungent and peppery cheeses made in Greece. Ladograviera is another Zakynthian cheese made using a similar method as Ladotyri but is based on a harder <b>graviera</b> style <b>cheese.</b>|$|R
