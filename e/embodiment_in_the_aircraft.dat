40|$|Book synopsis: Sight and <b>Embodiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages {{traces the}} intersections between vision, {{knowledge}} and <b>embodiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period around 1200 in Western Europe. Accounts of Western ocularcentrism have stressed the distancing and objectifying features of modern ways of seeing and knowing; this book charts {{the terrain of}} a more intimate and complex visual history. Biernoff brings postmodern writings on vision and embodiment into dialogue with medieval texts and images. By highlighting the foreignness of medieval ways of seeing – for example the idea that sight involved a physical encounter comparable to touch – modern theories of vision and the gaze lose their claim to universality...|$|R

40|$|Patent No: US 8, 878, 742 B 1 <b>Embodiments</b> <b>in</b> {{accordance}} with <b>the</b> invention include a linearly polarized dipole antenna with an unbalanced microstrip feed line. More specifically, <b>embodiments</b> <b>in</b> {{accordance with}} <b>the</b> invention utilize a fed dipole {{connected to a}} microstrip feed line, and separated a gap distance from a parasitic dipole not connected to the microstrip feed line. When an electrical signal is input to the microstrip feed line, the microstrip feed line creates a current flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fed dipole which induces a nearly equal current on the parasitic dipole {{that is out of}} phase. The result is a current flow, I, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction <b>in</b> both fed and parasitic dipoles allowing for efficient radiation of the linearly polarized dipole antenna. <b>Embodiments</b> <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the</b> invention eliminate the need for a balun circuit thereby reducing the size, complexity and feed loss of <b>the</b> feed circuit. <b>Embodiments</b> <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the</b> invention are effective for dipoles with relatively small ground planes...|$|R

50|$|August Engelhardt is {{the author}} of an 1898 {{pamphlet}} entitled A Carefree Future, where he describes a utopian society founded on nudism and a diet of coconuts, so-called cocovorism. An ardent vegetarian, Engelhardt argues that just as man is God's <b>embodiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> animal kingdom, so too is <b>the</b> coconut God's <b>embodiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plant kingdom; cocovorism, he concludes, is therefore the path to divinity. Fleeing the persecution he endured for his peculiarities, Engelhardt travels from Germany to <b>the</b> Bismarck Archipelago <b>in</b> German New Guinea to realize his ideas on a coconut plantation. During a stop in Ceylon, however, he meets a Tamil named Govindarajan, who also claims to be a fruitarian, in order to gain Engelhardt's trust, before robbing him of his savings. Engelhardt arrives destitute at Herbertshöhe, where he meets Emma Forsayth, known as Queen Emma, from whom he acquires the island Kabakon on credit. He also meets a sailor named Christian Slütter who studies to become a captain. Engelhardt establishes his order and hires natives as laborers for the coconut plantation, financing everything through loans and credit. He practices nudism, eats nothing but coconuts and begins advertising his new paradise abroad.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} CO₂ {{emissions}} 'embodied' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> characteristic China-Australia bilateral trade, which {{refer to the}} CO₂ emissions due {{to the production of}} goods traded between the two countries. We perform an assessment of <b>the</b> CO₂ <b>embodiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trade during the period between 2002 and 2010. We find that the scale effect has been a dominant effect contributing to an increase of CO₂ emissions embodied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bilateral trade through the years; while the composition effect seems to be a major driver for reducing CO₂ <b>embodiment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exports of Australia to China. Based on an analysis of the difference between the amounts of actual CO₂ <b>embodiment</b> and those <b>in</b> a hypothetical 'no-trade' scenario, we estimate that the 'net' CO₂ emissions due to the bilateral trade declined from around 10 Mt of CO emissions in 2002 to - 10 Mt in 2010; that is, the bilateral trade contributed to a reduction of the global carbon emissions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recent years. This finding suggests that the rapid growth of exports of carbon-intensive goods from Australia to China has helped in reducing carbon emissions globally because carbon intensity factors of those goods are much lower in Australia than those in China...|$|R
