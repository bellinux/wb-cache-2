The campus was orientated on a north–south axis across rolling hills and the eight buildings were arranged to suit the typography and harmonise with the landscape. <b>In-situ</b> <b>concrete</b> is used throughout the scheme and each building has its own concrete form, some with pilotis, others with shells.|$|E
25|$|Peter Womersley (24 June 1923–1993) was a British architect, {{best known}} for his work in the modernist style. He lived in the Scottish Borders, where a number of his {{buildings}} are located, although he worked on projects throughout the UK. Influenced principally by the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, and by the American Case Study Houses, Womersley's buildings employ such typical modernist elements as <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete</b> and strong geometric forms, although he introduced a wider palette of materials than was typically used by Le Corbusier and his followers.|$|E
25|$|The {{parabolic}} arch {{has been associated}} with church architecture since at least the 1880s. German architect Dominikus Bohm (1880-1955) exploited the possibilities of the {{parabolic arch}} in several 1920s church designs, demonstrating that the kind of atmosphere commonly associated with Gothic architecture could be obtained with a minimum of historical allusion. Though it remained an uncommon architectural form in the early 20th century, it featured in several Modernist churches, most notably the Church of St Francis of Assisi (completed 1943) in Pampulha, Brazil, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012). Constructed from cast <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete,</b> the nave of the church was a free-standing parabolic vault. Highly controversial at the time, Niemeyer's bold design was extremely influential among architects around the world (including Australia), with photographs and plans of the church published in architectural journals.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shells of}} the {{competition}} entry were originally of undefined geometry, but, early in the design process, the [...] "shells" [...] were perceived {{as a series of}} parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs. However, engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The formwork for using <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete</b> would have been prohibitively expensive, and, because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms, the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive.|$|E

40|$|The {{erection}} {{process of}} <b>in-situ</b> cast <b>concrete</b> frameworks in multi-storey housing involves {{a wide range}} of non-value adding activities, resulting in poor process efficiency. This paper describes the process and presents a model for discrete-event simulation of activities and resource use involved in the construction of <b>in-situ</b> cast <b>concrete</b> frameworks. The model simulates the work flow which is subjected to multiple work locations and resource availability constraints. The model functionality and simulation approach together with validation and verification of the model are described. It is shown that the model can reproduce the dynamic behaviour in a work flow constrained by resource availability. The model enables exploration of new ways to improve the construction process efficiency by reducing waste and better use of resources...|$|R

The centre span of the bridge was demolished and replaced by a narrower foot bridge, of steel girders with an <b>in-situ</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> deck slab, in 1980.

50|$|Resistance {{to use of}} an {{orthotropic}} deck relates {{mainly to}} its cost of fabrication, due {{to the amount of}} welding involved. In addition, it must be prefabricated rather than assembled on site, which offers less flexibility than <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete</b> decks. Orthotropic decks have been prone to fatigue problems and to delamination of the wearing surface, which, like the deck, is also often of a very thin material to reduce weight.|$|E

40|$|The {{pull-out}} test {{has been applied}} {{so far in the}} <b>in-situ</b> evaluation of <b>concrete</b> compression strength. In the present paper it is proposed, with the convenient procedure modifications, for the <b>in-situ</b> evaluation of <b>concrete</b> fracture energy G-F. The area enclosed between force versus displacement curve and displacement axis is approximately equal to the product of Mode I fracture energy G-F times the total cone-shaped fracture area, only when the contrast ring diameter is larger than a threshold value. In this case the failure process is dominated by tensile cracking, whereas, for smaller diameters, the failure mechanism is complex, as mortar against aggregate interlock prevails with an energy dissipation considerably higher than that strictly necessary for Mode I separatio...|$|R
