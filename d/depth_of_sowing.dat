40|$|Um dos fatores da baixa produtividade está na dificuldade de se estabelecer a população ideal de plantas por ocasião da semeadura, pelos vários fatores que impedem a germinação normal de parte das sementes. Dentre os fatores primordiais para a germinação estão a umidade, a temperatura e a aeração do solo. É importante citar que estes fatores são diretamente influenciados pelo estado de compactação do solo ao redor da semente. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo estudar os efeitos da combinação entre profundidades desemeadura e cargas aplicadas pela roda compactadora da semeadora-adubadora sobre a emergência e o desenvolvimento da cultura do feijão, em sistema de plantio direto.

The morphology, growth, performance, and flowering characteristics of the accessions were studied. Canonical variate {{analysis was used to}} characterize the germ plasm collection on morphological and agronomic attributes. Seedling emergence of the Russell lupin accession (Connie), which has considerable agronomic potential for sheep grazing in the hill and high country of New Zealand, was evaluated for response to scarification method, <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sowing,</b> and temperature in a series of laboratory and glasshouse experiments. The scatterplot of the canonical variate means of accessions facilitated the identification of four distinct groups of accessions in the germ plasm collection. Characterization of the genotypes using univariate statistics, or by simple visual observation was extremely difficult. The groups and their main characteristics are described and discussed. In terms of overall relationships, the Russell lupin should be regarded as a plant which is highly variable in its morphology, growth, performance, and flowering characteristics. A latitude of origin pattern of variation was represented along the first canonical axis, which accounted for 35. 2 % of the between-accession variation. Along this axis, all, but one, accessions from New Zealand and the accession from Portugal were grouped together as opposed to the group of accessions from northern Europe. Flowering before exposure to cold and/or short days, days to first flower, dry matter yield in autumn and leaflet dimension appear to be the most discriminatory attributes in separating accessions along the first canonical axis. Along the second canonical axis, which accounted for a further 16. 4 % of the between-accession variation, there was wide variation in plant size and spring dry matter yield. Two New Zealand accessions (HN & ON), with a higher dry matter yield than the mean of the 18 accessions were identified, although these accessions show different flowering responses, perhaps, to cool conditions along the first canonical axis. Conversely, all accessions from the USSR were vernalization requiring, high latitude types, and had a low dry matter yield in both autumn and spring. Connie lupin (CN), used as the control, was an early flowering, non-vernalization requiring low latitude type, and was of medium plant height and had an intermediate dry matter yield. The wide diversity within and among the groups should provide good opportunity for future breeding and agronomic work on Russell lupin in New Zealand. A high proportion of freshly harvested Russell lupin seed is hard. Laboratory and glasshouse studies showed that the germination and emergence of freshly harvested Russell lupin seed can be improved by scarification using chipping or concentrated sulphuric acid (36 N). However, a large proportion of abnormal seedlings (36 % of the seeds sown) was produced by chipping. Acid scarification for 30 or 45 minutes produced more than 75 % normal seedlings. In a glasshouse study, <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> affected both emergence and seedling vigour of Russell lupin. Emergence was best (92 %) when the seed was sown at 1 cm below the soil surface. The best seedling growth (seedling height, root length, oven dry weight of tops and roots) was also obtained by sowing at 1 cm. However, sowing at 2 cm gave results which were not statistically different (p< 0. 05) from the 1 cm sowing. In a controlled temperature study where <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sowing</b> was constant, final emergence of Russell lupin was reduced considerably at 25 °C. Emergence was best (92 %) at 20 °C, however, temperature between 10 - 20 °C did not limit the final emergence of Russell lupin.

30|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} related to deforestation and meet the ever increasing demands of the growing population, which will require sustainable use of forest products on sustainable manner, conserving and wise utilization of the remaining forests and supporting it with additional tree planting are crucial. However, several factors are known to have effects on the production of quality seedlings with required numbers. These factors include the availability of essential nutrients, proper soil mixture, <b>sowing</b> <b>depth,</b> viability <b>of</b> seeds, <b>sowing</b> date, and timing and frequency of watering. These determine the germination power of the seeds, the number of seedlings to be emerged, and their quality. Several studies have been carried out on the impacts of these factors and how they are affecting the raising of a required number of seedlings of required quality. For example, sowing depth can influence germination rate and amount and, thus, final number of seedlings in the seed beds (Duryea and Landis 1984). The nature of the seed itself is a key element in plant production and can influence the success and failures of both natural and artificial regeneration (Bichi 2012).|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} two sowing {{machines for}} interval sowing, differing {{in the mode}} of operation. The pneumatic vacuum sowing machine OLT and the pneumatic pressure sowing machine Aeromat - Becker for sowing sugar beet are compared. We were interested in adequacy of sowing at different working speeds. The purpose of the paper is to find out the optimum working speed for the individual sowing machine. Design/methodology/approach: The measurements were performed with two sowing machines which are most widely used in Slovenia; the sowing machines were tested in completely identical conditions at different speeds of sowing. Findings: The parameters such as working efficiency, <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sowing,</b> inter - row distance and distance between seeds in the sowing row were measured and calculated. Research limitations/implications: Cultivation of sugar beet depends primarily on expert and technically correct sowing. Distance between seeds in the sowing row must enable the plants to have optimum conditions for their growth and development. For successful sowing it is necessary to know adequacy of the soil for sowing, technical properties of the sowing machine and biotechnical characteristics of the seed. Practical implications: Sowing machines and expertly performed sowing are of great importance for cultivation of sugar beet. The principal aim of the paper is to establish whether the higher working speed influences the quality of sowing. The tests were aimed at defining the most suitable sowing speed for both sowing machines on the basis of measured data. Cultivation of sugar beet requires much money invested and work performed per unit of area. It is very important for the producers to be well familiarized with all agro - technical measures.

40|$|Out of {{approximately}} 100 seed traits, 20 {{are of the}} marketing importance, and 10 - 15, including the 1000 -seed weight (TSW) have been studied. There are many articles partially dealing with TSW in our literature related to the seed industry, {{but none of them}} is all-inclusive. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to determine: (1) a role, (2) factors of formation and (3) obtaining desirable TWS (DTWS). Germination, yield and trade depend on TWS, while TWS is interrelated with a dozen of other parameters, selection of sowing plates, determination of the amounts of seeds necessary for sowing (sowing rate) and the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sowing,</b> and can be an indicator of some other seed or crop traits. TSW depends on inheritance and conditions and is interrelated with sowing, drying and processing. Individual factors of TSW are numerous and classified into two groups each with two subgroups: a) agro ecological (abiotic and biotic) and b) agro technological (cropping practices and processing). The species and variety, crop density and uniformity, irrigation regime and fertilization have the greatest impact on TSW, while the effects of soil tillage and weather conditions, except during pollination and maturing, are of less importance. Seed fractioning is crucial, but it is less performed in our country than world-wide. The desirable TSW (DTWS) is a term designating higher-quality, more homogenous and greater yield of seed units in the whole process of the seed production. It is necessary to analyze DTWS for all varieties in order to determine DTWS that will provide the highest yield of viable and uniform seeds per hectare. Labor rationalization and productivity require obtaining DTWS as high as possible in the filed and maintaining it in processing. ...|$|E
