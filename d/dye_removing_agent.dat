30|$|The data {{indicate}} that percentage of <b>dye</b> <b>removed</b> decreases with increase in the initial concentration of dye. As at lower concentration, maximum dye particles in solution occupy available binding sites on adsorbent, which results in better adsorption [38]. But at higher concentration, the available sites on the adsorbent become limited {{and there is no}} further adsorption. In case of adsorption capacity, the adsorption capacity increases with increase in initial dye concentration because the increase in initial dye concentration enhances the interaction between dye and adsorbent [35, 37, 39].|$|R

40|$|The {{removal and}} {{destruction}} of a tri-phenyl methane dye, Acid Violet 17 (AV 17), from aqueous solution by adsorption and electrochemical regeneration was studied using a graphite intercalation compound (GIC) adsorbent. It was demonstrated that the adsorbent could be regenerated by anodic oxidation of the adsorbed dye in a simple electrochemical cell. The GIC adsorbent recovered its initial adsorption capacity after 40 to 60 min of treatment at a current density of 10 mA cm- 2, corresponding to a charge of 12 to 18 C g- 1 of adsorbent. The charge passed is consistent with that expected for mineralisation of the dye, suggesting that the <b>dye</b> was <b>removed</b> and destroyed with high charge efficiency. The energy cost of the regeneration {{was found to be}} around 120 J per g of adsorbent regenerated or 115 J per mg of the AV 17 <b>dye</b> <b>removed</b> and destroyed. A model describing the process of wastewater treatment by multiple cycles of adsorption and electrochemical regeneration, based on adsorption isotherm data, has been deve-loped and validated.

30|$|Interestingly, {{the trend}} shown by sulphur dyed denim fabric is {{different}} from indigo dyed denim. This {{may be due to}} the reason that the <b>dye</b> <b>removed</b> from denim material after the treatment with cellulase cause back staining or re-deposition and re‑coloration of black threads and black coloration of white threads, resulting in less contrast between black and white threads. Moreover, higher amount of dye is present on the surface of the fabric and hence more dye is released in the bath, thus resulting in heavy back staining. Cellusoft Conc. L being an acid enzyme shows higher level of back-staining as compared to neutral enzyme and results in less contrast or higher K/S value. Also sulphur dye particles have less affinity towards neutral cellulase as compared to acid cellulase. Thus, chances of back-staining are less and better contrast and higher reduction in K/S value is achieved with Neutracell CLD.|$|R
40|$|Adsorptions of Rhodamine B (RhB) and Basic Blue 9 (BB 9, {{also known}} as {{methylene}} blue) by sugarcane bagasse of different surface areas were compared in this study.

BB 9 adsorption was less sensitive to surface area change than RhB adsorption. Adsorption capacity of 250 mg/L RhB on 1 g/L bagasse was 65. 5 mg/g compared to a value of 30. 7 mg/g obtained with BB 9 under the same conditions. Increasing adsorption temperature (from 30 °C to 50 °C) while having no effect on RhB adsorption, slightly decreased BB 9 adsorption by ~ 4 %.

40|$|This {{project was}} to design and operate an {{infrared}} scanning densitometer to monitor {{the growth of the}} characteristic curve of a film during development.

The response of the tube was displayed an oscilloscope and this was photographed.

30|$|The {{amount of}} MB removed by organic–kaolin {{composite}} increased, reaching a maximum value with increase in contact time and almost became constant, after 360  min when equilibrium was attained.

The removal of MB dye increased with increasing composite dosage. Increasing the adsorbent dosage at constant MB concentration provided more available adsorption sites for the dye and thus increased the extent of dye removal (Banat et al. 2003; Urses et al. 2006).
