5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding {{switched}} from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version {{was completed by}} March 1975. Gates and Allen had {{been in contact with}} Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed more time to get a computer with 7k bytes of memory working, and they needed more time to get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E
5|$|The guest cast {{required}} {{a variety of}} levels of make-up to portray their alien characters. Combs' make-up took around {{three and a half}} hours each day, as did the Tellarite prosthetics. The Andorian female cast members took around four and a half hour each <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into make-up and costume, but on the first day Brink required further make-up time as that day's shoot required her to appear in-character in her underwear. This meant that after the normal make-up schedule, she was sprayed blue from head to toe. At the end of that day's filming, the shower facilities at the studio's executive gym was used to remove the paint. Meanwhile, the Romulan make-up took three hours to apply, with all the relevant scenes completed in a single day.|$|E

25|$|With Darcey Bussell she has {{appeared}} in a stage song-and-dance production, entitled Viva la Diva, paying tribute to stars including Madonna and the late Judy Garland (who died in 1969). The show opened in Manchester in November 2007. Jenkins learned to tap dance, spending eight hours a week learning the choreography and running three miles a <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fit. She performed the Welsh aational Anthem on 17 May 2008 at the 2008 FA Cup Final between Cardiff City and Portsmouth, becoming {{the first person to}} do this at an FA Cup Final.|$|E
25|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} festivity in the Swedish calendar, or perhaps for many the most important, is Midsummer, midsommar. Midsummer's Eve is celebrated {{on the eve of}} the Friday between the 20 and 26 June. Most Swedes try upon this <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to a place in the countryside where they can eat pickled herring, boiled potatoes and sour cream as well as strawberries and brännvin. A maypole is often erected around which, at least if there are children present at the celebration, dancing is performed. Houses are often decorated in birch twigs.|$|E

25|$|On day 3, England's bowlers {{carried on}} {{from where the}} batsmen left off. Graeme Smith was caught off a rising Anderson {{delivery}} early in the <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> things going, and all the bowlers contributed from there. Neil McKenzie produced a gritty 40 before being bowled round his legs by Monty Panesar. AB de Villiers scored freely before being very well caught by James Anderson off the bowling of Monty Panesar, and Ashwell Prince compiled a determined century to give the South African innings some resemblance of respectability.|$|E
25|$|In November 2008 {{he scored}} 11–4, sending him to komusubi {{for the fifth}} time in the January 2009 tournament. He scored eight wins there, and Aminishiki's losing record meant Kisenosato finally made his long-awaited sekiwake debut in March 2009, in his tenth tournament at a san'yaku rank. He {{produced}} a somewhat disappointing 5–10 record and was demoted to maegashira 4 in May. However, he proved this rank was too low for him by producing a 13–2 record, his best ever top division score, and won his third Fighting Spirit prize. This performance returned him immediately to sekiwake for the July 2009 tournament. He came though with a good 9–6 score there, defeating Asashōryū (for the fourth time) and three ōzeki. In September he failed on the final <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> kachi-koshi but remained in the san'yaku ranks at komusubi for the November 2009 tournament. However, a 6–9 in Kyushu saw him drop back to the maegashira ranks.|$|E
25|$|The England openers were {{in stark}} {{contrast}} to one another as the innings began; as Cook reached his 30th Test half-century off just 63 balls, Compton was stranded on 7 runs for 22 balls before getting out off a bat-pad to part-time spinner Kane Williamson. After two centuries in a row in New Zealand, it was Compton's sixth consecutive Test innings in which he had failed to reach 20 runs. Cook (88*) and Trott (11*) then batted {{out the rest of the}} <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> England to 116/1 at the close. The pair continued on the morning of the fourth day, reaching a total of 134 for the second wicket (the biggest partnership of the series) before Cook was out caught to Williamson for 130 – his 25th Test hundred. Trott himself reached 76 before edging a wide ball from Wagner to a diving McCullum, and Root and Bairstow each added quarter-centuries en route to a declaration at 287/5.|$|E

500|$|Those who {{landed at}} Dyea, Skagway's {{neighbour}} [...] town, travelled [...] the Chilkoot Trail and crossed its pass to reach Lake Lindeman, which fed into Lake Bennett {{at the head}} of the Yukon River. The Chilkoot Pass was higher than the White Pass, but more used it: around 22,000 during the gold rush. The trail passed up through camps until it reached a flat ledge, just before the main ascent, which was too steep for animals. This location was known as the Scales, and was where goods were weighed before travellers officially entered Canada. The cold, the steepness and the weight of equipment made the climb extremely arduous and it could take a <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the top of the [...] high slope.|$|E
500|$|One {{morning in}} 1914, Hogg {{was awakened by}} a burglar in her bedroom. She confronted the man, who was {{attempting}} to steal her jewelry, and not only convinced him to return the jewelry, but [...] "wrote down a name and address, {{handed it to him}} and told him to go there that very <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a job". When asked why she did that, Hogg responded, [...] "He didn't look like a bad man." [...] Later that year, she sailed to Germany, alone. While she was en route, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, Britain declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{started on}} August 13, 1963, with an {{elaborate}} ceremony hosted by Mayor Drapeau on barges {{anchored in the}} St. Lawrence River. Ceremonially, construction began when Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson pulled a lever that signalled a front-end loader to dump the first batch of fill to enlarge Saint Helen's Island, and Quebec premier Jean Lesage spread the fill with a bulldozer. Of the 25 million tons of fill needed to construct the islands, 10-12% {{was coming from the}} Montreal Metro's excavations, a public works project that was already under construction before Expo was awarded to Montreal. The remainder of the fill came from quarries on Montreal and the South Shore, however even with that it was insufficient and so bodies of water on both islands were added (lakes and canals) {{to reduce the amount of}} fill required. Expo's initial construction period mainly centered on enlarging Saint Helen's Island, creating the artificial island of Notre Dame Island and lengthening and enlarging the Mackay Pier which became the Cité du Havre. While construction continued, the land rising out of Montreal harbour was not owned by the Expo Corporation yet. After the final mounds of earth completed the islands, the grounds that would hold the fair were officially transferred from the City of Montreal to the corporation on June 20, 1964. This gave Colonel Churchill only 1042 days to have everything built and functioning for opening <b>day.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> Expo built in time, Churchill used the then new project management tool known as the critical path method (CPM). [...] On April 28, 1967, opening day, everything was ready, with one exception: Habitat 67, which was then displayed as a work in progress.|$|E

60|$|The other <b>day</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> quickly <b>to</b> Reval in Esthonia from England {{and back}} again. The {{distance}} {{is about the}} same as from Boston to Minneapolis, and it could be done comfortably in 10 or 12 hours' flying. I proposed to the Handley Page Company that they should arrange this for me. They explained that they had no power to fly beyond Amsterdam in Holland; thence it might be possible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a German plane to Hamburg, and thence again a Danish plane to Copenhagen--leaving about 500 miles which were too complicated politically to fly. Each stoppage would involve passport and other difficulties. In the end it took me five <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Reval and seven <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back. In Europe, with its present frontiers, flying is not worth having. It can never be worth having--it can never be worked successfully--until it is worked as at least a pan-European affair.|$|R

2500|$|Pulque has a {{place in}} some Aztec legends. As one myth goes, the god Quetzalcoatl was tricked into getting {{intoxicated}} by drinking pulque and had sexual relations with a celibate priestess (in other tellings, it was his sister, the goddess Quetzalpetlatl). Embarrassed, Quetzalcoatl banished himself to the sea, saying he would return one <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his revenge. The year he was said to return coincided with the year Hernán Cortés landed {{on the shores of}} Mexico in 1519. The Mural of the Drinkers found in the Great Pyramid of Cholula also depicts pulque drinking {{during the time of the}} Aztecs. The mural [...] "portrays a feasting scene with figures wearing elaborate turbans and masks, drinking pulque and performing other ritual activities. It has been suggested that the scene portrays pulque deities." ...|$|E
2500|$|After all {{the water}} had been thrown, the {{screaming}} girls would often be dragged to a nearby river or pond for another drenching. Sometimes a girl would be carried out, still in her bed, before both bed and girl were thrown into the water together. Particularly attractive girls could expect to be soaked repeatedly during the day. The use of water is said to evoke the spring rains needed {{to ensure a successful}} harvest later in the year. Girls could save themselves from a soaking by giving boys [...] "ransoms" [...] of painted eggs (pisanki), regarded as magical charms that would bring good harvests, successful relationships and healthy childbirths. Although in theory the girls are supposed to wait until the following <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their revenge by soaking the boys, in practice both sexes throw water over each other on the same day.|$|E
2500|$|After awakening, {{the crew}} of Endeavour got to work {{preparing}} for reentry. While working through the deorbit timeline, Entry Flight Director Bryan Lunney, after reviewing the weather, waved off the first KSC landing opportunity due to excessive crosswinds on the runway. After evaluating the weather, the second KSC landing opportunity was also waved off, as the weather was [...] "no go" [...] and forecasted [...] "no go" [...] per the landing weather requirements. Lunney continued to watch the weather for possible changes in Monday's weather forecast prior to making the decision whether to land at Edwards, or wait one <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a Kennedy landing, but following further analysis of the projected weather in Florida for Monday, Lunney {{decided to take the}} first Edwards Air Force Base landing opportunity. The deorbit burn was initiated at 20:19 UTC (12:19 PST), and the orbiter landed at Edwards Air Force Base at 21:25 UTC (13:25 PST).|$|E
