40|$|<b>Fiscal</b> {{responsibility}} <b>laws</b> are {{institutions with}} which multiple {{governments in the}} same economy [...] national and subnational [...] can commit to help avoid irresponsible fiscal behavior that could have short-term advantages {{to one of them}} but that would be collectively damaging. Coordination failures with subnational governments in the 1990 s contributed to macroeconomic instability and led several countries to adopt <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> as part of the remedy. The paper analyzes the characteristics and effects of <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> in seven countries [...] Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, and Peru. <b>Fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> are designed to address the short time horizons of policymakers, free riders among government units, and principal agent problems between the national and subnational governments. The paper describes how the laws differ in the specificity of quantitative targets, the strength of sanctions, the methods for increasing transparency, and the level of government passing the law. Evidence shows that <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> can help coordinate and sustain commitments to fiscal prudence, but they are not a substitute for commitment and should not be viewed as ends in themselves. They can make a positive contribution by adding to the collection of other measures to shore up a coalition of states with the central government in support of fiscal prudence. Policymakers contemplating <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> may benefit from the systematic review of international practice. One common trait of successful <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> for subnational governments is the commitment of the central government to its own fiscal prudence, which is usually reinforced by the application of the law at the national as well as the subnational level.

40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} the {{adoption}} of <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> (FRLs) has improved fiscal performance in nine emerging market economies, as measured by developments in their key fiscal balances.

However, emerging market economies that did not adopt FLRs also experienced improvements in their fiscal performance around the same time.

40|$|In recent years, many {{countries}} have adopted <b>Fiscal</b> Responsibility <b>Laws</b> to strengthen <b>fiscal</b> institutions and promote fiscal discipline in a credible, predictable and transparent manner. Still, {{results on the}} effectiveness of these laws remain tentative. In this paper, we test empirically whether fiscal performance, measured as the level of primary fiscal balances and their volatility, indeed improved after the implementation of <b>Fiscal</b> Responsibility <b>Laws</b> in a sample of Latin American and advanced economies. We show that traditional econometric approaches, which rely on the use of dummies in time series or panel regressions, yield biased estimates. In contrast, our empirical strategy recognizes that, a priori, the timing of the effect of these <b>laws</b> on <b>fiscal</b> performance is unknown, while controlling for the impact of the business and commodity cycles on fiscal outcomes. Overall, we find limited empirical evidence in support of the view that <b>Fiscal</b> Responsibility <b>Laws</b> have had a distinguishable effect on fiscal performance. However, <b>Fiscal</b> Responsibility <b>Laws</b> could still have other positive effects on the conduct of fiscal policy not analyzed here, for instance, through enhanced transparency and guidance in the budget process and lower risk premia.
