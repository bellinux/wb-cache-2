25|$|Gay Mullins, a Seattle retiree {{looking to}} start a public {{relations}} firm with $120,000 of borrowed money, formed the organization Old Cola Drinkers of America on May 28 to lobby Coca-Cola to either reintroduce the old formula or sell <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> His organization eventually received over 60,000 phone calls. He also filed a class action lawsuit against the company (which was quickly dismissed by a judge who said he preferred the taste of Pepsi), while nevertheless expressing interest in landing The Coca-Cola Company as a client of his new firm should it reintroduce the old formula. In two informal blind taste tests, Mullins either failed to distinguish New Coke from old or expressed a preference for New Coke.|$|E

Saavedra stayed silent for the most part, awaiting his turn to speak. The most important speakers were Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, Juan José Castelli, Ruiz Huidobro, Manuel Genaro Villota, Juan José Paso and Juan Nepomuceno de Sola, among others. Saavedra {{was the last one}} to speak, and suggested that the political control should be delegated to the Cabildo until the formation of a governing Junta, in the manner and form that the Cabildo deemed appropriate. In his speech, he pointed out the phrase: [...] "(...) [...] "And there be no doubt that it is the people that confers the authority or command."

500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] is an uptempo electropop song. According to BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine, it is {{reminiscent}} of Rihanna's 2007 single [...] "Don't Stop the Music". McAlpine {{also noted that the}} song has a [...] "frosty-rave" [...] chorus accompanied with Rihanna's [...] "icy" [...] vocals. It was written by Brian Kennedy Seals, Chris Brown, Robert Allen and Andre Merritt for the re-release of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, Brown took preference to another track, [...] "Forever", which would later be released as the first single from the re-release. He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and gave it to Rihanna. Kennedy produced [...] "Disturbia", while Makeba Riddick produced Rihanna's vocals. The song was recorded by Andrew Vastola at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. It was mixed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. Additional engineering was provided by Josh Houghkirk, with assistance from Carlos Oyanedel. Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings about giving [...] "Disturbia" [...] to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have".|$|E
500|$|The trio {{became so}} excited {{with the concept}} they came up with, they decided to do initial {{development}} on their own instead of pitching <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> The Wachowskis wrote three hour-long spec scripts, and together with Straczynski attempted to shop them around, such as at Warner Bros. and HBO, but when they saw that nobody could understand the concept they decided to shelve it. A few years later, when they felt that the landscape of television had become friendlier towards more experimental concepts, they decided to pitch it a second time. On October 2, 2012, Variety first reported {{the existence of the}} show, by writing that the Wachowskis, with the help of Straczynski's Studio JMS and Georgeville Television, would be shopping Sense8 around Los Angeles the week to follow. If the series was picked up, the sisters and Straczynski would be sharing showrunner duties. Additionally, the Wachowskis were planning to direct a few episodes of the show if their schedule permitted it. According to Straczynski, the first meeting with potential buyers was with Netflix. The Wachowskis and Straczynski talked to them about subjects such as gender, identity, secrecy and privacy. According to Lana they pitched shooting on location all over the globe to which Netflix responded favorably, which was in contrast to the [...] "clearly impossible" [...] response they had received by other outlets during their earlier abortive attempt. They also told Netflix they were only interested if they had the freedom to [...] "do anything", like [...] "crazy psychic orgies with all sorts of different bodies" [...] and [...] "live births even" [...] to which Netflix also responded positively. After the end of the meeting, despite it having seemingly gone well, they worried they had made a mistake because they had not pitched any action or otherwise commercial aspects. By noon, and before they had the chance to pitch it to other outlets, such as HBO, Netflix called them to preemptively offer to buy and produce the first season. Netflix announced that they had ordered a 10-episode first season for the series on March 27, 2013. Later, during filming, because of the density of the scripts and the extended length of the first cut of the first episode, the showrunners and Netflix came to an agreement to extend the season to 12 episodes. The Wachowskis and Straczynski's production company that was set up to run the show was named Unpronounceable Productions. The name was suggested by Straczynski, as a joke that references the difficulty of pronouncing the showrunners' long last names.|$|E

At the outbreak of the English Civil War he sided with the parliament, and thus lost both his place and the prospects of succeeding to his Welsh Royalist uncle's fortune. For a while he lived in Charterhouse Yard, troubled by religious questions. [...] His doubts were removed by a sermon preached by a stranger in the church of St Mary Aldermanbury where he had gone intending to hear Edmund Calamy the Elder.
