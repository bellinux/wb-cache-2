We discuss the negative consequences of this situation on research on treatment effectiveness and the outcomes of congenital toxoplasmosis. The responsible public health institutions should assume responsibility for appropriate surveillance of the screening programme and take measures to improve screening adherence during pregnancy. Screening should start as early as possible in pregnancy and the latest test should be done at delivery.

Also, cases reported in some special conditions, viz., pregnancy, <b>foetal</b> <b>infections,</b> and co-infections with one or more other infectious agents are highlighted. Due to similar clinical presentations of malaria and dengue, these co-infections may give rise to an incorrect diagnosis.

Hence, a delay in implementing the appropriate treatment regimen for these concurrent infections due to poor diagnosis can be fatal. The present review is intended to increase awareness about the clinical significance and the importance of these co-infections among clinicians, public health workers and health authorities in the Asian region.

METHODS: Detailed indications for TOPFA were extracted from medical charts. RESULTS: Of 2465 completed records, indications were: chromosomal anomalies n = 963 (39. 1 %), malformations {{of a single}} organ without chromosomal or genetic aetiologies n = 898 (36. 4 %), multiple malformations without chromosomal or genetic aetiologies n = 238 (9. 7 %), obstetrical complications n = 161 (6. 5 %), non-chromosomal genetic diseases n = 158 (6. 4 %), <b>foetal</b> <b>infections</b> n = 21 (0. 9 %), unexplained severe oligohydramnios n = 20 (0. 8 %), foetal exposure to teratogenic agents n = 6. Overall, 33. 3 % of anomalies were lethal (e. g. anencephaly), 25. 2 % were expected to result in isolated mental retardation (e. g.

40|$|Bluetongue virus (BTV) is {{an insect}} vector {{transmitted}} virus which causes an economically important disease in ruminants. BTV infection during pregnancy {{can result in}} infection of the foetus, which {{may lead to the}} birth of persistently infected or immunotolerant offspring. Since persistently infected animals continuously produce large amounts of virus they could be a source of infection for the insect vector. This could significantly influence the epidemiology of the virus and hence might require additional measures to control a BTV outbreak. Therefore, we investigated the potential of BTV- 8 to induce persistent infection or immunotolerance in lambs in an experimental setting. Infection of eighteen 70 - 75 days pregnant ewes with wild type BTV- 8 led to the birth of 25 out of 44 BTV RNA positive lambs (foetal infected, FI). All 23 FI lambs born alive also had anti BTV antibodies at birth; infectious virus could be recovered from 5 out of 25 FI lambs. Viral RNA loads decreased rapidly after birth; 19 out of 20 FI lambs that remained in the experiment until week 14 after birth, were RNA negative at that time. Since persistence of BTV- 8 infection could not be demonstrated, we investigated whether <b>foetal</b> <b>infection</b> had an effect on protection against a field virus infection and on efficacy of vaccination. To this end, 5 FI lambs and 5 foetal non-infected (FNI) lambs were vaccinated with the inactivated Bovilis(®) BTV- 8 vaccine, five months after birth. Three weeks after the vaccination, all lambs were infected with wild type BTV- 8. The <b>foetal</b> <b>infection</b> did not interfere with vaccination efficacy.

30|$|Infection {{in humans}} can happen by three means: fecal-oral {{transmission}} through the ingestion of an infected cat’s faeces (usually through contaminated fruits and vegetables), foodborne through the ingestion of toxoplasma cysts in poorly cooked meat (mainly pork, lamb, or venison), or vertical transmission {{from the mother}} to the foetus. Toxoplasma cysts are mostly found in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, and they can remain latent or course subclinically in healthy adults [8, 23]. <b>Foetal</b> <b>infection</b> can cause congenital toxoplasmosis coursing with {{a wide spectrum of}} manifestations, from mild symptoms that can remain unapparent until late in infancy, to more fatal and severe forms in newborns that are now rare thanks to preventive and protective measures during pregnancy.

40|$|Pregnant {{women are}} {{considered}} a special risk population group for food-borne illnesses, due to their specific susceptibility to certain infectious diseases and {{the severity of the}} complications that may appear. In Spain, official incidence of food-borne disease outbreaks in this population group is low. However, due to their special vulnerability and the strict sanitary control associated to pregnancy, they constitute a group in which prevention measures based on risk communication can be very effective. Listeriosis {{is one of the more}} relevant food-borne diseases during pregnancy since, although rare, it affects seriously the foetus, causing abortion or premature birth, stillbirth, meningitis or sepsis. Toxoplasma gondii can also cause <b>foetal</b> serious <b>infection,</b> resulting in miscarriages, perinatal mortality or congenital lesions in the brain, eyes and other organs. Other pathogens transmitted by food which, although infrequently, may seriously affect pregnant women or foetus are Brucella spp., Hepatitis E virus, verotoxigenic E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. Health education, together with prevention measures taken during production, processing and distribution, is the main factor to reduce microbiological hazards derived from food consumption. Therefore, in order to establish the basis for performing management and risk communication activities, the Scientific Committee has studied the main food-borne pathogens of special risk during pregnancy, analysing the factors affecting their survival and growth, as well as the foods most frequently involved in their transmission.

40|$|In Europe, {{congenital}} cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{infection is}} the leading cause of neurological disabilities in children, causing severe sequelae such as sensorineural hearing loss, neurodevelopmental delay or blindness. The infection causes high disease burden and costs. Nevertheless, there is little awareness of CMV among medical officials and the general public. Although the individual risk of congenital CMV infection is greatest from a primary infection of the mother during pregnancy, maternal non-primary infections also account for a substantial disease burden associated with congenital CMV. Screening programmes for pregnant women and newborns are widely discussed, but have not been implemented by any public health authority in Europe so far. This article gives an overview about a variety of European and other relevant studies regarding CMV seroprevalence, congenital CMV infection and disease as well as screening strategies and preventive approaches. Multiple studies have determined the rate of vertical transmission in primary and non-primary maternal CMV infection and the development of subsequent CMV disease of the child [9, 14 - 16]. The results of the studies are hampered by difficulties to distinguish between primary and non-primary maternal CMV infection.

40|$|ABORTION {{associated}} with mycotic placentitis {{is well known}} in cattle and causes considerable economic loss in Britain (Austwick and Venn, 1961; Hugh-Jones and Austwick, 1967). Occasionally <b>foetal</b> <b>infection</b> occurs but the dam usually shows no ill effects, spontaneously recovers after aborting, and may subsequently conceive normally (Ainsworth and Austwick, 1959). Al-though numerous fungi have been implicated in the disease (Ainsworth and Austwick, 1959; Campbell, 1969) Aspergillus fumigatus is the major causal organism, accounting for over 60 % of cases in Britain and the USA (Austwick and Venn, 1961; Hillman, 1969). Intravenous inoculation of the conidia of A. fumigatus into sheep and cattle led to abortion with striking localisation of hyphal growth in the placentae (Cysewski and Pier, 1968; Hillman and McEntee, 1969).

40|$|The human vaginal {{microbiota}} {{plays an}} important role in the maintenance of a woman’s health, as well as of her partner’s and newborns’. When this predominantly Lactobacillus community is disrupted, decreased in abundance and replaced by different anaerobes, bacterial vaginosis (BV) may occur. BV is associated with ascending infections and obstetrical complications, such as chorioamnionitis and preterm delivery, as well as with urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted infections. In BV the overgrowth of anaerobes produces noxious substances like polyamines and other compounds that trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β and IL- 8. BV can profoundly affect, with different mechanisms, all the phases of a woman’s life in relation to reproduction, before pregnancy, during fertilization, through and at the end of pregnancy. BV can directly affect fertility, since an ascending dissemination of the involved species may lead to tubal factor infertility. Moreover the increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases contributes to damage to reproductive health. Exogenous strains of lactobacilli have been suggested as a means of re-establishing a normal healthy vaginal flora. Carefully selected probiotic strains can eliminate BV and also exert an antiviral effect, thus reducing viral load and preventing <b>foetal</b> and neonatal <b>infection.</b> The administration of beneficial microorganisms (probiotics) can aid recovery from infection and restore and maintain a healthy vaginal ecosystem, thus improving female health also in relation to reproductive health...|$|R
40|$|Neospora caninum is {{considered}} one of the main causes of abortion in cattle, yet recent studies have also emphasised its relevance as an abortifacient in small ruminants. In order to gain deeper insight into the pathogenesis of ovine neosporosis, pregnant ewes were intravenously inoculated with 10 (6) tachyzoites of the Nc-Spain 7 isolate at days 40, 90 or 120 of gestation. Infection during the first term resulted in the death of all foetuses between days 19 and 21 post-infection, showing mainly necrotic lesions in foetal liver and the highest parasite DNA detection and burden in both placenta and <b>foetal</b> viscera. After <b>infection</b> at day 90, foetal death was also detected in all ewes, although later (34 - 48 days post-infection). In this group, lesions were mainly inflammatory. Foetal livers showed the lowest frequency of lesions, as well as the lowest parasite detection and burden. All ewes infected at day 120 delivered viable lambs, although 3 out of 9 showed weakness and recumbency. Neospora DNA was detected in all lambs but one, and parasite burden was similar to that observed in day 90 group. Lesions in this group showed more conspicuous infiltration of inflammatory cells and higher frequency in foetal brain and muscle when compared to both previous groups.

The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the ability of this isolate to induce foetal death in a pregnant bovine model. For this purpose, 13 naïve pregnant heifers were divided into three groups and were experimentally challenged with either 107 tachyzoites of Nc- 1 (group 1, n =  5), Nc-Spain 1 H (group 2, n =  5) isolates or phosphate-buffered saline (group 3, n =  3) intravenously at 70 days of gestation. After inoculation, pregnancy was monitored and dams were sacrificed when foetal death was detected. The remaining animals were slaughtered at 45 days post-infection. Maternal and foetal samples were collected for examination by histology and parasite DNA detection. Parasitaemia, specific anti-N. caninum IgG and interferon γ responses were also studied. At 3 – 4 weeks after <b>infection,</b> <b>foetal</b> death was detected in 3 out of 5 Nc- 1 -infected dams. However, no evidence of foetal death was observed in either Nc-Spain 1 H-infected or control groups during the period studied. The most severe histopathological lesions were observed in the placenta and foetal organs from Nc- 1 -infected cattle that exhibited foetal death. It was in these animals that N. caninum DNA was more frequently detected. Parasitaemia was observed in all Nc- 1 -infected dams and in only 3 out of 5 Nc-Spain 1 H-infected animals. The magnitude of the immune response was significantly higher in the Nc- 1 -inoculated group than in the group inoculated with the Nc-Spain 1 H isolate. These data reveal the reduced virulence of the Nc-Spain 1 H isolate in cattle...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasmosis is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} zoonotic human infection caused by the Apicomplexa protozoon Toxoplasma gondii. The acute disease is usually mild or asymptomatic, except for <b>foetal</b> <b>infection</b> transmitted by acutely infected pregnant women, which courses as a devastating disease. In order to determine possible regional variations in risk factors, we studied the frequency of seronegativity {{in areas of the}} São Paulo Metropolitan Region, comparing liters and age groups. The prevalence of seronegativity was determined retrospectively in 1286 pregnant women receiving prenatal care at public health services in four selected areas of the São Paulo Metropolitan Region of similar socioeconomic background. The São Paulo City area had the higher frequency of seronegativity (41. 1 %), followed by the Northwest (31. 5 %) and Southwest (29. 9 %) areas, with similar intermediate levels, and by the Northeast (22. 5 %) area with the lowest frequency (p< 0. 001). A rough estimate disclosed about 280 infected infants/year in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region. Serological titers analyzed by age group suggested a decline in antibody levels with age, as shown by a lower frequency of higher titers in older groups. Our study emphasizes the importance of determining the regional prevalence of toxoplasmosis for proper planning of public health prenatal care...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Since 1999, field {{evidence}} of transplacental infection by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) and reproductive failure {{has been reported}} in pigs. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the clinical and pathological consequences of PCV 2 infection in conventional PCV 2 -seropositive gilts by insemination with PCV 2 b-spiked semen. Results Six PCV 2 seropositive gilts were inseminated with PCV 2 b-supplemented semen (infected) and three animals with semen and cell culture medium (controls). Only three out of the six infected animals were pregnant by ultrasonography on day 29 after insemination, while two out of the three controls were pregnant. One control gilt aborted on day 23 after insemination but not due to PVC 2. Viraemia was demonstrated in four out of six infected and in one control gilt that became infected with PCV 2 a. Anti-PCV 2 antibody titres showed dynamic variations in the infected group throughout the study. Among infected gilts, the animal with the lowest anti-PCV 2 titre (1 / 100) at the beginning of the experiment and another that reached a similar low value during the experiment showed evident seroconversion over time and had also PCV 2 positive foetuses. One placenta displayed mild focal necrosis of the chorionic epithelium positively stained by immunohistochemistry for PCV 2 antigen. Conclusions PCV 2 -seropositive gilts can be infected with PCV 2 after intrauterine exposure and low maternal antibody titre may increase the probability of a <b>foetal</b> <b>infection.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|The Bluetongue virus {{serotype}} 8 (BTV- 8) strain, {{which emerged}} in Europe in 2006, had {{an unusually high}} ability to cause <b>foetal</b> <b>infection</b> in pregnant ruminants. Other serotypes of BTV had already been present in Europe {{for more than a}} decade, but transplacental transmission of these strains had never been demonstrated. To determine whether transplacental transmission is a unique feature of BTV- 8 we compared the incidence and pathological consequences of transplacental transmission of BTV- 8 to that of BTV- 1. Nine pregnant ewes were infected with either BTV- 8 or BTV- 1. The BTV strains used for the infection were field strains isolated on embryonated chicken eggs and passaged twice on mammalian cells. Blood samples were taken to monitor the viraemia in the ewes. Four weeks after the infection, the foetuses were examined for pathological changes and for the presence of BTV. BTV- 8 could be demonstrated in 12 foetuses (43 %) from 5 ewes (56 %). %). BTV- 1 was detected in 14 foetuses (82 %) from 6 ewes (67 %). Pathological changes were mainly found in the central nervous system. In the BTV- 8 group, lympho-histiocytic infiltrates, gliosis and slight vacuolation of the neuropil were found. BTV- 1 infection induced a severe necrotizing encephalopathy and severe meningitis, with macroscopic hydranencephaly or porencephaly in 8 foetuses. In our experimental setting, using low passaged virus strains, BTV- 1 was able to induce transplacental transmission to a higher incidence compared to BTV- 8, causing more severe pathology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Plasmodium falciparum can be {{detected}} by microscopy, histidine-rich-protein- 2 (HRP 2) capture test or PCR but the respective clinical relevance of the thereby diagnosed infections in pregnant women is not well established. Methods In a cross-sectional, year-round study among 839 delivering women in Agogo, Ghana, P. falciparum was screened for in both, peripheral and placental blood samples, and associations with maternal anaemia, low birth weight (LBW) and preterm delivery (PD) were analysed. Results In peripheral blood, P. falciparum was observed in 19 %, 34 %, and 53 % by microscopy, HRP 2 test, and PCR, respectively. For placental samples, these figures were 35 %, 41 %, and 59 %. Irrespective of diagnostic tool, P. falciparum infection increased the risk of anaemia. Positive peripheral blood results of microscopy and PCR were not associated with LBW or PD. In contrast, the HRP 2 test performed well in identifying women at increased risk of poor pregnancy outcome, particularly {{in case of a}} negative peripheral blood film. Adjusting for age, parity, and antenatal visits, placental HRP 2 was the only marker of infection associated with LBW (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1. 5 (95 %CI, 1. 0 – 2. 2)) and, at borderline statistical significance, PD (aOR, 1. 4 (1. 0 – 2. 1)) in addition to anaemia (aOR, 2. 3 (1. 7 – 3. 2)). Likewise, HRP 2 in peripheral blood of seemingly aparasitaemic women was associated with PD (aOR, 1. 7 (1. 0 – 2. 7)) and anaemia (aOR, 2. 1 (1. 4 – 3. 2)). Conclusion Peripheral blood film microscopy not only underestimates placental malaria. In this highly endemic setting, it also fails to identify malaria as a cause of <b>foetal</b> impairment. Sub-microscopic <b>infections</b> detected by a HRP 2 test in seemingly aparasitaemic women increase the risks of anaemia and PD. These findings indicate that the burden of malaria in pregnancy may be even larger than thought and accentuate the need for effective anti-malarial interventions in pregnancy. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Preterm {{birth is}} {{a major cause of}} {{neonatal}} mortality, especially in low and middle income countries. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for foetal maturation could have a significant impact and therefore {{is often referred to as}} an important strategy to reduce neonatal mortality. A recently conducted large multinational trial showed that antenatal corticosteroids can have adverse effects in low income countries, but this is likely to depend on the specific setting. In our hospital preterm birth is only recognized in patients with severe maternal disease, due to physician-initiated delivery. Spontaneous preterm births are rarely seen in the hospital and often take place in the community or while on the road to a health facility. Objective: To investigate the effects of antenatal corticosteroid therapy in a rural hospital in Tanzania. Methods: A secondary analysis of a retrospective medical records study of women with severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia performed in Ndala Hospital between July 2011 and December 2012. We used data on gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, time between admission and birth, use of corticosteroids and maternal and foetal survival. Ethical clearance was obtained from the directorate of research and publications of the University of Dodoma (ref. UDOM/DRP/ 346). Results: Thirty-six women with forty live foetuses were analysed. Twelve women (13 neonates) were given corticosteroids and could be compared to 24 women (27 neonates) who did not get corticosteroids. The incidence of fresh stillbirths (antenatal death) was 20 %. The 13 neonates who received corticosteroids had significantly smaller birth weight, longer interval between admission and delivery and poorer outcomes (stillbirth and neonatal death). An analysis of 24 neonates with a birth weight between 1. 5 and 2. 5 kg showed a trend toward better outcome in neonates who did not receive antenatal corticosteroid therapy. Conclusion: Small retrospective studies as these have a low level of evidence, but this study helped to gain more knowledge of local conditions affecting the effectiveness of antenatal corticosteroid therapy in our setting of a small rural hospital. Reliability of estimating gestational age, epidemiology of preterm birth, exposure to <b>infections,</b> <b>foetal</b> monitoring and quality of neonatal care are likely to influence the effect of antenatal corticosteroid therapy. Further larger prospective studies should be conducted to determine the exact preconditions of antenatal corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries. Until that time, the WHO precautions seem reasonable and audits and small observational studies like ours can help in assessing whether a specific hospital is suited for antenatal corticosteroid therapy...|$|R
