However, if the person already had coronary heart disease the reduction was 25%. The results <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> importance of early identification of FH and treatment with statins.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> play of emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E
5|$|Copán was {{occupied}} {{for more than}} two thousand years, from the Early Preclassic period to the Postclassic. The city developed a distinctive sculptural style within the tradition of the lowland Maya, perhaps to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> Maya ethnicity of the city's rulers.|$|E

500|$|The {{historian}} of early science and medicine Paula Findlen, {{writing in the}} Cambridge History of Science, calls De Materia Medica [...] "one {{of the most successful}} and enduring herbals of antiquity, [...] <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> importance of understanding the natural world in light of its medicinal efficiency", in contrast to Pliny's Natural History (which <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> wonders of nature) or the natural history studies of Aristotle and Theophrastus (which <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> causes of natural phenomena).|$|R
5|$|Kohlberg {{suggested}} {{that there may be}} a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning. Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage, however, led him to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> speculative nature of his seventh stage.|$|E
5|$|Some {{groups in}} Japan, {{particularly}} those active in Tokyo, also <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> {{importance of the}} lively and spirited iki aesthetic. In taiko, it refers to very specific kinds of movement while performing that evoke the sophistication stemming from the mercantile and artisan classes active during the Edo period (1603–1868).|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Emphasizing</b> <b>the</b> Positive - Erickson {{claimed that}} his sensory [...] "disabilities" [...] (dyslexia, colour blindness, being tone-deaf) {{helped him to}} focus on aspects of {{communication}} and behavior which most other people overlooked.

5000|$|In most cases, it is {{equivalent}} to alpha-glucosidase, but the term [...] "maltase" [...] <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> disaccharide nature of the substrate from which glucose is cleaved, and [...] "alpha-glucosidase" [...] <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> bond, whether the substrate is a disaccharide or polysaccharide [...]|$|R
5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title {{as a metaphor for the}} viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} practices <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> use of safe {{body piercing}} materials, frequently utilizing specialized tools {{developed for the}} purpose. Body piercing is an invasive procedure with some risks, including allergic reaction, infection, excessive scarring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as sanitary piercing procedures and careful aftercare are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body piercing may vary widely according to placement, from {{as little as a}} month for some genital piercings to as much as two full years for the navel.|$|E
5000|$|Just as in Romans 10:9-13 Paul <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> salvific {{value of}} [...] "professing by mouth" [...] that Jesus is Lord (Kyrion Iesoun), Augustine <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> value of [...] "professing that Jesus is the Son of God" [...] as {{a path to}} salvation.|$|R
50|$|Lunges {{are a good}} {{exercise}} for strengthening, sculpting and building several muscles/muscle groups, including the quadriceps (or thighs), the gluteus maximus (or buttocks) {{as well as the}} hamstrings. A long lunge <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> use of the gluteals whereas a short lunge <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> quadriceps. The lunge is a basic movement that is fairly simple to do for beginner athletes.|$|R

5|$|Glatter has praised MacLachlan's {{involvement}} in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored {{the character of}} Cooper; she noted that he was as devoted to the character's comedic elements as to his dramatic side and that the crew had difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without laughing at his comic delivery. She has also noted that although the writers and directors on the series tended to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> rapport between Cooper and Fenn's character Audrey Horne, {{there was never any}} intention to bring the characters together as a couple.|$|E
5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the Dip the Dips Scenic Railway {{roller coaster}} opened but was soon overshadowed in 1912 {{by the larger}} Leap the Dips ride. In 1917, Dip the Dips was razed and {{replaced}} by the Leap Frog Scenic Railway. With three roller coasters and a growing variety of other rides, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park, though that was not Boeckling's priority. He marketed the peninsula primarily as a bathing resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures, {{and other forms of}} entertainment, but did not <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> park's rides.|$|E
50|$|String players {{control their}} tone quality by {{touching}} the {{bow to the}} strings at varying distances from <b>the</b> bridge, <b>emphasizing</b> <b>the</b> higher harmonics by playing sul ponticello ("on the bridge"), or reducing them, and <b>emphasizing</b> <b>the</b> fundamental frequency by playing sul tasto ("on the fingerboard").|$|R
50|$|In English, {{contrasts}} {{are made}} by reducing vowels, changing {{the volume of the}} word, or changing the intonation of the phrase. For example, this is her car <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> owner of the car. If the stress is changed to say this is her car, the emphasis is on showing what object belongs to a specific person. In Spanish, the stress is almost always changed by reordering the words. Using the same example este coche es suyo <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> owner and éste es su coche <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> object.|$|R

5|$|In {{comparison}} to the flowing main theme, Khan's leitmotif {{was designed as a}} percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity. The seven-note brass theme was echoplexed to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until Reliants attack on the Enterprise. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from Wolfen, in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for Alien). Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Large {{pieces of}} glass screens and metal {{shoulder}} eaves extend horizontally; {{the station is}} lit and transparent. The specially designed lighting, the clear tempered glass, the insulating glass, and the truss system <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> functions of the space and bring a bright look to the building. The 6-meter tall lobby {{on the ground floor}} is connected by the escalators coming up from the entrance hall and the platforms built underground.|$|E
5|$|Recently, postmodernism {{has come}} to convey more {{completely}} prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> role of the reader of a text (Hermeneutics), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read. Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that were once sensible within a tradition such as the Western canon.|$|E

5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> essential {{equality of}} human beings, and {{the abolition of}} prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity. The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.|$|E
5|$|The National Museum of Beirut {{currently}} exhibits 1300 {{artifacts from}} its collection of approximately 100,000 objects. The museum displays follow a chronological circuit beginning in Prehistory and ending in the Ottoman era. The circuit begins {{on the ground}} floor where 83 large objects are displayed, these include sarcophagi, mosaics statues and reliefs. The upper floor displays 1243 small and medium-sized artifacts arranged by chronological order and by theme in modern showcases with soft lighting and magnifying glasses that <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> aesthetic aspect of the artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{music in}} The Wind Waker was {{composed}} by Kenta Nagata, Hajime Wakai, Toru Minegishi, and Koji Kondo. The sound team was significantly larger than for other contemporary projects to accommodate Nintendo's {{desire for a}} high caliber {{of work in the}} rushed development schedule. Koji Kondo, the primary composer for The Legend of Zelda series, contributed to the score but did not serve as sound director. However, the score incorporated some of his pieces from older Zelda games, modifying them to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> time passed between the stories.|$|E
50|$|Like Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholics, and Anglo-Catholics, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church recognizes seven sacraments.
