This is a decline from previous years (in 2007 the average on SR-103 was 22,525; in 2006, the average was 22,215; in 2005, 21,275). Four percent of this traffic was composed of trucks.

5|$|Japan {{is one of}} the top-performing OECD {{countries}} in reading literacy, maths and sciences with the average student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. The Japanese populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's competitive high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy. Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.7%. In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>institution.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Institutions</b> play an {{important}} role in the promotion of sustainability and an increasing number of stakeholders expect them to be sustainable organizations. However, this can only be achieved when barriers are faced and challenges overcome. This exploratory study aims to investigate how the main stakeholders (leaders, faculty, staff, students, and external stakeholders) of Portuguese Public <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Institutions</b> perceive: the concepts of sustainability and sustainable <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions,</b> the role of <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> for sustainable development, and the barriers, challenges and obstacles to implementing sustainable initiatives in Portuguese Public <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Institutions.</b> Through a qualitative approach, using semi-structured interviews and content analysis procedures, this article explore the perspectives of twenty stakeholders from four Portuguese Public <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Institutions.</b> The results suggest that, although aware of the concept of sustainability, the different stakeholders are not familiar with the concept of sustainable <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions.</b> The lack of financial resources due to the decline in funding for <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> and falling numbers of Portuguese university students is perceived as the main barrier to sustainable development in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> (i. e. practices are still associated with spending financial resources). This research highlights the importance of a conceptual and organizational change in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions,</b> notably through identifying new sources of financing, more flexible organizational forms, more comprehensive mission statements, more tailored educational offers, life-long learning and commitment to internationalization, and more strategic human resource management.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2007. The {{changing}} <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> {{environment has}} created {{a sense of urgency}} within private <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> to change or else to perish. The latest legislation by the government compelling private <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> to register with the Department of Education, coupled with the creation of mega-public <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> by mergers, has made it imperative for private institutions to re-examine their financial management systems, cost management systems and decision-making systems. Private <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> do not receive any funding from government, unlike their public counter-parts. They depend totally on private funds from student fees, investors and donors. In order to compete with the State subsidized public institutions, private institutions must minimize costs and maximize profits. This means that the cost of their courses must be comparable to those of public institutions, {{while at the same time}} offering quality teaching and learning. This study examines the cost management system, the financial management system and the decision-making system of private <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions.</b> The research is supported by a detailed literary study of these issues within the <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> sector, as well as an empirical study of cost management in private <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>institutions</b> in South Africa.
