60|$|At length, in the afternoon, we {{neared the}} last point, and turning inside an {{isolated}} and crumbling hummock, the Dutchman's Cap, saw before us, {{at the head}} of a little narrow harbour, the scarlet and purple roofs of St. Thomas's, piled up among orange-trees, at the foot of a green corrie, or rather couple of corries, some eight hundred feet high. There it was, as veritable a Dutch-oven for cooking fever in, with as veritable a dripping-pan for the poison when concocted in the tideless basin below the town, as man ever invented. And we were not sorry when the superintendent, coming on board, bade us steam back again out of the port, and round a certain Water-island, at the back of which is a second and healthier harbour, the <b>Gri-gri</b> channel. In the port close to the town we could discern another token of the late famous hurricane, the funnels and masts of the hapless Columbia, which lies still on the top of the sunken floating clock, immovable, as yet, by the art of man.|$|E

50|$|Le <b>gri-gri</b> du Niokolo-Koba, {{written and}} drawn by Fournier, is the twentyfifth {{album of the}} Spirou et Fantasio series, and the author's fifth, {{following}} the Spirou retirement of André Franquin. The story was initially serialised in Spirou magazine before it was released as a hardcover album in 1974.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the clergy}} {{and the civil}} {{authorities}} disapprove, many Seychellois see little inconsistency between their orthodox religious observance and belief in magic, witchcraft, and sorcery. It {{is not uncommon to}} consult a local seer--known as a bonom di bwa --for fortune-telling or to obtain protective amulets or charms, called <b>gri-gri,</b> to bring harm to enemies.|$|E
50|$|If {{the leader}} falls, the belayer must arrest the rope {{to stop the}} fall. To achieve this the rope is run through a belay device {{attached}} to the belayer's harness. The belay device runs the rope {{through a series of}} sharp curves that, when operated properly, greatly increases friction and stops the rope from running. Some of the more popular types of belay devices are the ATC Belay Device, the Figure 8 and various auto-locking belay devices such as the Petzl <b>Gri-Gri.</b>|$|E
50|$|A Grigri (or GriGri, <b>Gri-gri</b> or Gris-gris) is an {{assisted}} braking belay device {{manufactured by}} Petzl {{designed to help}} secure rock-climbing, rappelling, and rope-acrobatic activities. Its main characteristic is a clutch that assists in braking under a shock load. The success of this device has led to grigri becoming a common name for devices of this type. In 2011 a new version, the GriGri 2 was released to replace the original {{which has been in}} production since 1991. Competitors include the Faders Sum, Trango Cinch and Edelrid Eddy.|$|E
50|$|In The <b>Gri-Gri</b> of Niokolo-Koba, {{a native}} of Senegal throws himself in the taxi of Spirou and Fantasio in their asking to carry the {{contents}} of a bag that it leaves them in Mansa Moussa, in Niokolo-Koba, before disappearing in a dazzling flash. The two heroes leave then for Africa, and are joined by strong Sété Bagaré, which binds friendship with them. Once in Senegal, they learn that Mansa Moussa also disappeared, and that what they transport in the bag is not other than the grigri of the individual.Arrived at the park, they are informed of the disappearance of most of the animals of the reserve. Ororéa, which inquired in the reserve, occurs then with the photographic proof that the animals disappeared under the effect of diamond of Koli, also responsible for the evaporation of the individual met in Europe, which is not other than the nephew of Mansa Moussa. After some adventures, they end up finding the gangsters. The diamond of Koli is replaced in its sheath and all those that disappeared return, just like the animals. Mansa Moussa privately explains to Spirou that the grigri contained the plans of a diamantiferous vein under the park that the gangsters coveted. Those having disappeared following an imprudence with diamonds of Koli, alone Mansa Foamed and Spirou know the truth from now on.|$|E
