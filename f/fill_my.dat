500|$|Heylin {{has noted}} that, {{as is the}} case with a number of other of Basement Tape tracks, Dylan's copyrighted, {{published}} [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] lyrics differ from what can be heard on the song. Heylin speculates that the [...] "dramatic reworking" [...] in the later version arose from Dylan's [...] "1973 musing in Malibu", where Dylan had moved to, and that new lines like [...] "build a geodesic dome and sail away" [...] and [...] "My shrimp boat's in the bay" [...] sound like the work of [...] "someone sitting on the dock of the bay, not up on Meads Mountain [...] ". Heylin also notes that the website maintained by Olof Björner, Words <b>Fill</b> <b>My</b> Head, contains a transcription of the song as Dylan performed it. The 1973 copyrighted lyrics are printed on Bobdylan.com.|$|E
500|$|On {{the topic}} of his earnings, PewDiePie stated that he is [...] "extremely tired of talking about how much I make. In the very few {{interviews}} I've made, it doesn't matter how long we've talked to each other, the headline is still just about my paycheck." [...] After extensive media coverage of his earnings, PewDiePie posted a video, expressing his frustration at the extensive media coverage over his income. In the video he claimed, [...] "We did raise a million dollars for charity, and very few articles picked up on that, but here it is everywhere how much money I make", adding, [...] "It seems like the whole world cares more {{about how much money}} I make than I do myself." [...] Relating to his source of his income, PewDiePie stated: [...] "I think that's what's cool about YouTube: That anyone could technically do it, right? Surely if I didn't exist, there would be someone to <b>fill</b> <b>my</b> place." ...|$|E
500|$|In the book, {{the narrator}} is not only self-aware, but also alert to every detail around her. Pilgrims second chapter defines two types of seeing: as [...] "verbalization" [...] (active) and as [...] "a letting go" [...] (passive). [...] The narrator refers to the {{difference}} between the two methods as [...] "the difference between walking with and without a camera." [...] Whereas the former requires the need to [...] "analyze and pry", the latter only requires rapt attention. [...] The act of seeing is exhaustive and exhausting, as one of the chapters relates: [...] "I look at the water: minnows and shiners. [...] If I am thinking minnows, a carp will <b>fill</b> <b>my</b> brain till I scream. [...] I look at the water's surface: skaters, bubbles, and leaves sliding down. Suddenly my own face, reflected, startles me witless. [...] Those snails have been tracking my face! Finally, with a shuddering wrench of the will, I see clouds, cirrus clouds. [...] I'm dizzy. I fall in. This looking business is risky." [...] Sandra Johnson refers to the structure of the book itself leading to an epiphany of self-awareness, or a [...] "mystical experience"; as the narrator watches a falling maple key, she feels [...] "lost, sunk ... gazing toward Tinker Mountain and feeling the earth reel down".|$|E

[...] (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) [...] "Somehow it seems to <b>fill</b> <b>my</b> head with ideas—only I don't exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{there was}} a famine, so the {{residents}} in Luo Tong's hometown and other travellers taking shelter there suffered from hunger. Luo Tong was very worried about this and his appetite decreased. His elder sister, who was widowed and had no children, was known for being very kind. She saw that her brother looked very upset, so she asked him why. Luo Tong said, [...] "I feel bad when I can <b>fill</b> <b>my</b> own stomach while those people don't have enough to eat." [...] His sister replied, [...] "You're right. Why do you suffer in silence and not tell me about this?" [...] She then took grain from her personal stores {{and gave it to}} Luo Tong, and also informed their mother about it. Luo Tong's mother agreed with what they were doing, and she distributed grain to the people. Luo Tong became famous after this incident.|$|E
2500|$|One man to {{whom they}} were ministering told them an amazing story: he had been {{separated}} from his wife {{at the very end}} of the war, and had not seen her since. At the time they were separated, his wife was a Christian, but he was not, but he had since been converted. His deep desire was to find his wife so they could at last share their faith together. But he told the Hines that he did not think he would ever see his wife on earth again. Instead he was longing for the day when they would meet in heaven, and could share in the Life Eternal there. These words again inspired Hine, and they became the basis for his fourth and final verse to 'How Great Thou Art': [...] "When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation to take me home, what joy shall <b>fill</b> <b>my</b> heart. Then we shall bow in humble adoration and there proclaim, My God How Great Thou Art!" ...|$|E

2500|$|This is Tundra's {{first album}} with vocals, {{and all but}} one of the tracks have vocals. The lyrics on Mastered by Guy at The Exchange have been {{described}} as not being rich with subtext. Max Tundra refers to this on [...] "Labial" [...] with [...] "I only sing about things that happen to me/ I never learned to <b>fill</b> <b>my</b> songs with allegory" [...] The BBC noted recurring themes included [...] "unaffected tales of Food Chemistry, bands splitting up, employment history and even an homage to video maker Michel Gondry." [...] while Pitchfork Media noted theme of [...] "girls he's loved or loves, complaints about his day jobs". The lyrics are also littered with musical references. References range from trance music and the band Yes where he sings [...] "Downstair's they're playing trance again / that awful bendy guitar / up through the floor again / It's 9am till I cry / And Time and a Word my friend / Inspires me more than guitars". Pitchfork also described the song [...] "Gondry" [...] as a plea to filmmaker and music video director Michel Gondry to direct one for him with lyrics referencing his music videos for [...] "Let Forever Be" [...] and [...] "Around the World". Stylus Magazine described the album's first single for [...] "Lysine" [...] as sounding like a nutrition manual with lyrics of [...] "many foods are rich in arginine, concentrate on the ones with more lysine". Max Tundra has also stated that not everything he wrote about actually happened. In an interview with Stylus Magazine, he proclaimed that [...] "half the lyrics on that album are true and half are false, but I’m not gonna tell you which half." ...|$|E
