Aiming at {{vehicle routing problem}} (VRP) {{with many}} {{extended}} features is widely used in actual life, multi-depot heterogeneous vehicle routing problem with soft time windows (MDHIVRPSTW) mathematical model is established. An improved ant colony optimization (IACO) is proposed for solving this model. Firstly, MDHIVRPSTW was transferred into different groups according to nearest <b>depot</b> <b>method,</b> then constructing the initial route by scanning algorithm (SA). Secondly, genetic operators were introduced, and then adjusting crossover probability and mutation probability adaptively {{in order to improve}} the global search ability of the algorithm. Moreover, smooth mechanism was used to improve the performance of ant colony optimization (ACO). Finally, 3 -opt strategy was used to improve the local search ability. The proposed IACO has been tested on a 32 -customer instance which was generated randomly. The experimental results show that IACO is superior to other three algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality, thus the proposed method is effective and feasible, and the proposed model is better than conventional model...|$|E

The authors conducted a trial {{to assess the}} efficacy (in terms of pupil diameter) of a <b>depot</b> <b>method</b> of pre-operative pupil dilatation, as compared with repeated instillations of drops (which is time-consuming for the nursing staff and uncomfortable for the patient). Methods A prospective randomised masked trial was conducted comprising 130 patients with no significant ocular history undergoing elective clear corneal phacoemulsification. 65 patients had mydriatic drops (Tropicamide 1 %, Phenylephrine 2. 5 %, Diclofenac sodium 0. 1 %) instilled prior to surgery, 65 had a wick soaked in the same drop mixture placed in the inferior fornix. Horizontal pupil diameters were recorded on a millimetre scale immediately prior to surgery. Results There {{was no significant difference}} in pupil size between the two groups (p = 0. 255, Student's t-test). Conclusion There was no significant difference between the mydriasis obtained with the depot system compared with conventional drop application. Use of a depot mydriatic delivery system appears to be a safe and efficient method of drug delivery.

Self-association {{was assessed using}} size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) monitored by UV and orthogonal reverse-phase chromatography. Results Simulating pharmaceutical formulation, degludec eluted as dihexamers, whereas aspart eluted as hexamers and mono-mers. Combining degludec at low zinc with aspart increased dihexamer content, indicating hybrid hexamer formation. At high zinc concentration, however, {{there was no evidence}} of this. Simulating the subcutaneous depot by removing preservative, degludec eluted as multihexamers and aspart as monomers. Aspart was incorporated into the multihexamer structures when combined with degludec at low zinc, but there was no such interaction with high-zinc degludec. SEC using progressively dilut-ed concentrations of phenol and m-cresol showed that dissocia-tion of aspart into monomers occurs before the formation of degludec multihexamers. Conclusion Insulins degludec and aspart can be combined with-out forming hybrid hexamers, but this combinability is dependent on zinc and preservative concentration, and requires that degludec is fully dihexameric before addition of aspart...|$|R

The role of angiogenesis in the expandability of human adipose tissue depots is unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure angiogenesis in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and to establish whether there is a relationship between obesity, metabolic status, and the angiogenic properties of these <b>depots.</b> <b>Methods</b> and Results—Angiogenic capacity was determined by quantifying capillary branch formation from human adipose tissue explants embedded in Matrigel, and capillary density was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Subcutaneous adipose tissue had a greater angiogenic capacity than visceral tissue, even after normalization to its higher initial capillary density. Gene array analyses revealed significant differences in expression of angiogenic genes between depots, including an increased subcutaneous expression of angiopoietin-like protein 4, which is proangiogenic in an adipose tissue context. Subcutaneous capillary density and angiogenic capacity decreased with morbid obesity, and subcutaneous, but not visceral, adipose tissue angiogenic capacity correlated negatively with insulin sensitivity. Conclusions—These data imply that subcutaneous adipose tissue has a higher capacity to expand its capillary network than visceral tissue, but this capacity decreases with morbid obesity. The decrease correlates with insulin resistance, suggesting that impairment of subcutaneous adipose tissue angiogenesis may contribute to metabolic diseas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Excessive {{accumulation}} of body fat, {{in particular in}} the visceral fat depot, is a major risk factor to develop a variety of diseases such as type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of obese individuals to develop co-morbid diseases are largely unclear. We aimed to identify genes expressed in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) {{that are related to}} blood parameters involved in obesity co-morbidity, such as plasma lipid and glucose levels, and to compare gene expression between the fat <b>depots.</b> <b>Methods</b> Whole-transcriptome SAT and VAT gene expression levels were determined in 75 individuals with a BMI > 35 kg/m 2. Modules of co-expressed genes likely to be functionally related were identified and correlated with BMI, plasma levels of glucose, insulin, HbA 1 c, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, ALAT, ASAT, C-reactive protein, and LDL- and HDL cholesterol. Results Of the approximately 70 modules identified in SAT and VAT, three SAT modules were inversely associated with plasma HDL-cholesterol levels, and a fourth module was inversely associated with both plasma glucose and plasma triglyceride levels (p - 5). These modules were markedly enriched in immune and metabolic genes. In VAT, one module was associated with both BMI and insulin, and another with plasma glucose (p - 5). This module was also enriched in inflammatory genes and showed a marked overlap in gene content with the SAT modules related to HDL. Several genes differentially expressed in SAT and VAT were identified. Conclusions In obese subjects, groups of co-expressed genes were identified that correlated with lipid and glucose metabolism parameters; they were enriched with immune genes. A number of genes were identified of which the expression in SAT correlated with plasma HDL cholesterol, while their expression in VAT correlated with plasma glucose. This underlines both the singular importance of these genes for lipid and glucose metabolism and the specific roles of these two fat depots in this respect. </p...|$|R

Data was gathered using a focus group technique with scenario stimulus. The data were examined using thematic analysis. Results. Themes fitted the broad categories of who RLAI was used for, how it was best used, what were the efficacy determinants and what adverse effect monitoring occurred. For many areas of exploration there was a gap between actual practice and what the psychiatrist thought might be best practice.

40|$|There is a {{trade-off}} between the total penalty paid to customers (TPC) {{and the total}} transportation cost (TTC) in depot for vehicle routing problems under uncertainty (VRPU). The trade-off refers {{to the fact that}} the TTC in depot inevitably increases when the TPC decreases and vice versa. With respect to this issue, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) with uncertain customer demand and travel time was studied to optimise the TPC and the TTC in depot. In addition, an inverse robust optimisation approach was proposed to solve this kind of VRPU by combining the ideas of inverse optimisation and robust optimisation so as to improve both the TPC and the TTC in <b>depot.</b> The <b>method</b> aimed to improve the corresponding TTC of the robust optimisation solution under the minimum TPC through minimising the adjustment of benchmark road transportation cost. According to the characteristics of the inverse robust optimisation model, a genetic algorithm (GA) and column generation algorithm are combined to solve the problem. Moreover, 39 test problems are solved by using an inverse robust optimisation approach: the results show that both the TPC and TTC obtained by using the inverse robust optimisation approach are less than those calculated using a robust optimisation approach...|$|R

Past {{research has shown that}} (R, S) order-up-to control rules for this system type can easily be obtained using a decomposition approach, where the derivation of the order-up-to level S is separated from the derivation of the rationing parameters. We show that a similar approach can be used to solve models including different shipment frequencies at the two levels. For example, a central depot receives replenishment orders every four weeks, while replenishment orders to several local warehouses are shipped weekly. In this way, inventory imbalance can be reduced compared to immediate shipment to the local warehouses after goods receipt by the central <b>depot.</b> A <b>method</b> is presented to determine the control parameters such that target fill rates for the local warehouses are obtained. Extensive experimentation with the model shows that the stock reduction is relatively small for identical holding costs throughout the network. Then the largest reduction (6. 6 %) is obtained in case of frequent resupply in the downstream part of the network. Different shipment frequencies appear to be more useful if central holding costs are (considerably) less than local holding costs...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines the depot maintenance processes of naval H- 6 O helicopters. Budget and political climate issues are discussed. Aircraft Service Period Adjustment (ASPA) deferral rates, Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM) turnaround time, depot maintenance direct labor and material costs, and projected backlog using depot requirements and funding are examined. Data analysis indicates {{a need for}} significant process improvements or radical changes to depot processes. The Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) will consolidate organizational and depot level maintenance at fleet locations. IMC offers several advantages over traditional <b>depot</b> maintenance <b>methods.</b> Using regression analysis, the direct costs of SDLMs conducted at the Pensacola Naval Aviation Depot from 1987 to 1995 were used to estimate direct costs of depot maintenance based on: aircraft age, the projected level of depot maintenance, and employment (operational versus training). Within {{the scope of this}} research, a weak correlation existed between the direct labor costs and aircraft age and employment as explanatory variables direct material costs showed a higher correlation: for total direct costs, these two variables explained 34. 4 percent of the variation. Incorporating additional explanatory variables, such as flight hours prior to SDLM, may improve the model. Finally, recommendations are made to facilitate the transition to Integrated Maintenance, emphasizing data collection requirements and data analysis techniques to better estimate maintenance and funding requirements.

Central adiposity, particularly visceral fat, may {{play a significant role in}} the development of obesity related co-morbidities such as diabetes. Accurate measures of both visceral and abdominal subcutaneous fat are essential for investigating the pathophysiology of obesity and its co-morbidities. However, anthropometry which is generally implemented in epidemiology to assess fat distribution, cannot distinguish between these two fat <b>depots.</b> Reference <b>methods</b> such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computer Tomography (CT) are often not feasible in large-scale epidemiological studies and in paediatric research due to ethical and practical issues. The aims of the thesis are: to assess the validity of ultrasound abdominal fat depths compared to MRI or CT measures of visceral fat and abdominal subcutaneous fat in populations covering a wide range of ages (from infancy to adulthood); to identify possible early life factors that may influence the quantity of these abdominal fat compartments. The findings of this thesis suggest that, ultrasonography is a suitable, non-invasive and reliable tool for quantifying abdominal fat compartments from infancy and it could be used to assess possible risk factors associated with obesity and related co-morbidities in a very early stage. The results from this thesis also indicate that during both intrauterine and postnatal periods, the accumulation of visceral and subcutaneous fat may be under different regulatory control. Early nutrition seems to contribute significantly to the quantity of these fat depots. ...|$|R

Identified by telephone interview six years later, subjects with persistent respiratory symptoms were suspected as having Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS). Medical tests were performed. For bronchial responsiveness, a cut-off point of PD(20) Results The 25 suspected RADS cases were more frequently exposed than the 99 controls; the crude odds ratio for high versus low exposure was 6. 5 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 2. 4 - 18. 0]. Suspected cases showed a lower ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity (FEV(1) /FVC; P= 0. 028). Overall, suspected cases had a higher DRS than controls. The difference was significant for males only (P= 0. 006), and non-smoking males (P= 0. 014). Highly exposed subjects had a higher DRS than low exposed subjects (P= 0. 056). These differences were significant when restricted to non-smokers (P= 0. 034) and males (P= 0. 019).

To meet the fiscal objectives {{of these programs}} requires the development of improved transportation logistics, both in the primary Earth-to-Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and secondary orbit-to-orbit space transportation segments for delivery of construction materials, scientific payloads, and personnel. The deployment of space-based orbit transfer vehicles (OTV's) and development of innovative orbit transfer methodologies that reduce secondary cyclic mission support mass requirements (e. g. propellants) is a crucial step in meeting program budgetary goals. The research performed in this thesis has developed an improved efficiency cyclic orbit transfer method, based on non-traditional optimization criteria, {{through the use of}} intermediate propellant depot orbits and rendezvous transfer. The technique was optimized for a reference cyclic transfer between LEO and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) in the presence of realistic mission affects including the following: (1) non-planar transfers; (2) perturbed (non-Keplerian) orbit motions; and (3) mission transfer risk mitigation techniques. A semianalytic model was developed to optimize the depot orbit selection and sizing for LEO/GEO cyclic missions for three NASA reference OTV mission payload profiles. The results demonstrated significant reductions in cyclic mission propellant requirements, when compared to current NASA aerobrake OTV missions, for durations of up to one week in GEO. The magnitude of the propellant mass savings was found to depend on GEO on-orbit durations, mission risk strategies, and payload profiles, with maximum propellant savings amounting to approximately 11 metric tons/mission.

Research <b>Methods</b> and Procedures: Subjects included 8 men (64 +/- 3 years) and 14 women (56 +/- 15 years) undergoing elective abdominal surgery. ASIP mRNA levels in isolated omental and subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: No significant depot difference was observed between genders; ASIP mRNA levels of omental and subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes were pooled for this analysis. BMI and ASIP gene expression were negatively correlated in men (p = - 0. 70; p < 0. 05), whereas a positive relationship was observed in women (p = 0. 48; p < 0. 05). No significant difference was observed in age, body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference between groups. Hip circumference was significantly higher in women than in men (p < 0. 05). Also, {{no significant difference in}} ASIP mRNA expression was observed between men and women, regardless of the fat depot. Discussion: These results show that men and women of similar age and BMI present similar ASIP mRNA levels in omental and subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes. However, a sexual dimorphism exists in the relationship between ASIP expression and BMI. If ASIP is involved in appetite regulation or energy homeostasis in humans, this observation may contribute to the recognized differences in these parameters between men and women...|$|R

The study population comprised 74 white individuals (41 men and 33 women, aged 67 - 76 years) participating in the Hertfordshire Birth Cohort Physical Activity trial. Anthropometry included height, weight, waist and hip circumferences. Abdominal fat was measured by ultrasound in two compartments: visceral fat defined as the depth from the peritoneum to the lumbar spine; and subcutaneous fat defined as the depth from the skin to the abdominal muscles and compared to reference measures by MRI (10 -mm single-slice image).

At minute 30 after resuscitation, oil solution of estradiol with dehydroepiandrosterone was intramuscularly injected into the study group animals in doses of 0. 1 and 5 mg/ 100 g. The comparison group of animals received the equivalent volumes of saline. Gender- and age-matched intact rats served as a control. An image analysis system of cresyl violet-stained paraffin brain sections {{was used to determine}} the density and composition of highly ischemia-perfusion-sensitive populations of pyramidal neurons of Layer V of the sensomo-tor cortex, the CA 1 and CA 4 hippocampal sectors, and Purkinje cells in the lateral cerebellum. Results. It has been established that there are {{gender differences in}} brain morphology in health, which are detectable in the postresuscitative period. The site of lesions {{has been found to be}} different in resuscitated rats of different gender. At the same time, male brain lesions are more extensive, i. e. these involve to this or that extent all the examined regions: the cerebellum and CA 4 hippocamplal sector exhibit neuronal death; the cortex and CA 1 hippocampal sector show dystrophic changes in the nerve cells. In the females, neuronal shedding processes were observed in the CA 1 hippocampal sector only. Estradiol + dehydroepiandrosterone treatment has been ascertained to prevent nerve cell death only in the males and to fail to affect the density and composition of the neuronal populations under study in the females. Conclusion. The findings suggest that it is important to identify the structural bases of sexual dimorphism in the body&# 8217;s reaction to ischemic exposure and that it is necessary to take them into account when developing effective therapy and choosing the optimal treatment policy to correct posthypoxic encephalopathies.
