5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 <b>for</b> <b>victory,</b> Australia were {{struggling}} when Healy {{came to the}} crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls <b>for</b> <b>victory.</b> Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending a stand of 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E

25|$|In a tournament, most of {{the team}} points are scored for advancement. For example, a team winning a match in the {{championship}} bracket would be awarded one team advancement point; one-half of an advancement point would be awarded if a team won a match in the wrestle-back bracket. The corresponding team points also apply if a wrestler from the team gained a bye and then won his next match in that bracket. Two additional advancement points are <b>for</b> <b>victories</b> by fall, default, disqualification, and forfeit (including victories by medical forfeit). One and one-half additional advancement points are awarded <b>for</b> <b>victories</b> by technical fall with near fall points scored {{in the course of}} the match. One additional advancement point is awarded <b>for</b> <b>victories</b> by technical fall victories with no near fall points scored during the course of the match and also <b>for</b> <b>victories</b> by major decision. A team could then win a certain number of placement points if its wrestlers have placed individually in the championship and wrestle-back brackets. Thus, whole teams are awarded placements (first, second, etc.) based on their total number of victories.|$|R
