50|$|Evidence {{of the use}} {{of green}} <b>frit</b> is so far {{confined}} to Egypt. Alongside malachite, green <b>frit</b> was usually employed as a green pigment. Its earliest occurrence is in tomb paintings of the 18th dynasty, but its use extends at least to the Roman period. The manufacture of green and blue <b>frit</b> relies on the same raw materials, but in different proportions. To produce green <b>frit,</b> the lime concentration must outweigh the copper concentration. The firing temperature required for green <b>frit</b> may be slightly higher than that of blue <b>frit,</b> in the range of 950 to 1100°C. The ultimate product is composed of copper-wollastonite (Ca,Cu3Si3O9) crystals and a “glassy phase rich in copper, sodium, and potassium chlorides.” In certain circumstances (the use of a two-step heating process, the presence of hematite), scientists were able to make a cuprorivaite-based blue <b>frit</b> that later became a copper-wollastonite-based green <b>frit</b> at a temperature of 1050°C. On some ancient Egyptian wall paintings, pigments that were originally blue are now green: the blue <b>frit</b> can “devitrify” so that the “copper wollastonite predominates over the lesser component of cuprorivaite.” As with blue <b>frit,</b> Hatton, Shortland, and Tite have analyzed evidence for green <b>frit</b> at Amarna in the form of cakes, powders, and one vessel fragment and inferred the sequential production of the three types of artifacts.|$|R

40|$|The {{post-irradiation}} examination (PIE) of the NET- 1. 2 fuel element {{was completed in}} December, 1993. The goal of the PIE work was to gather data regarding the fracture of the hot <b>frit</b> during the experiment. Five cracks were observed in the hot <b>frit</b> at various locations although only two were believed to have initiated the overall component failure. These two cracks were complete circumferential failures and were located near the open and closed ends of the <b>frit</b> within the active flow region. The location and orientation of these fractures suggested that failure {{was the result of}} thermally-induced stresses that exceeded pre-test predictions. The cause of the failure was the temperature difference between the coolant flowing through the hot <b>frit</b> and the thermally massive end fittings. The resulting axial temperature gradients in the hot <b>frit</b> imposed thermal stresses that exceeded failure in the <b>frit</b> coating material. This coating fracture then propagated through the graphite substrate. Post-test analyses of the <b>frit</b> response based on measured data from the experiment verified that the <b>frit</b> coating failure stresses were exceeded. Additionally, the cold <b>frit</b> behaved unexpectedly. The PIE inspection of this component showed {{that a majority of the}} compliant panels were permanently deformed against the cold <b>frit</b> inner wall even though the transients that the bed was exposed to were not thought to be capable of creating this magnitude of bed expansion. No evidence of bed locking was observed. A calculational error in the prediction of the total bed expansion was found (post-PIE) which certainly contributed to the underestimation of the bed displacement. Additionally, temperature differences between the bulk of the <b>frit</b> and the panels created a bowing force which may have allowed some amount of bed settling at relatively low temperatures while particle thermal expansion was minimal...|$|R
