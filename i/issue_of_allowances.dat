Among adults, salary is an area where there are consistent gender differences, with females typically asking for and receiving less than males. The present study examined differences in reward allocation (i. e., pay) among 91 boys and girls who receive an allowance or “pocket money” in grades one through four, to try to determine whether the differences noted among adults appear with first early pay experiences. Children were asked to complete a series of five tasks regarding gender stereotypes, occupations, chores and money and were tested using both a male and female experimenter. In addition children’s parents were asked to complete questiosn regarding the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>allowance</b> in their house. The results of this study were analyzed to investigate any gender differences and were compared to findings in both adult and preschool populations.

40|$|In its {{guidance}} on National Allocation Plans (NAPs), the European Commission has discouraged Member States from adopting allocation methodologies {{that would provide}} incentives to firms affecting their compliance behavior. The purpose is to promote economic efficiency and to prevent strategic behavior that deviates from individual and collective cost-minimization. For example, some methodologies would reward one type of compliance investment over another. To discourage such actions, the EU Emission Trading System guidelines prohibit ex post redistribution <b>of</b> emission <b>allowances</b> within an allocation period based on behavior in that period. Similarly, the Commission has indicated that decisions about the initial distribution <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> {{in the second phase}} (2008 - 2012) must depend on measures prior to 2005 so as not to give companies an incentive to adjust their behavior to receive a larger allowance allocation. However, two other aspects of the NAPs—the treatment of closures and new entrants—may also affect firm behavior. An undercurrent in these guidelines is the question of whether Member States should allow incumbent emitters to hold infinitely lived, once-and-for-all property rights to a share <b>of</b> the emission <b>allowances</b> in the future. This paper develops an approach for balancing efficiency considerations with perceived <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> fairness. We propose a ten-year rule to guide policy regarding closure of existing sources and the status of new sources and to guide the initial distribution <b>of</b> emission <b>allowances</b> in general. A ten-year rule would address <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> fairness and capture {{an important part of the}} potential gains that could be achieved through an efficient initial distribution <b>of</b> <b>allowances.</b> emission trading, allowance allocations, closures, new entrants, tradable permits, air pollution, cost-effectiveness, greenhouse gases, climate change, global warming, carbon dioxide...|$|R

2500|$|One of the {{environmental}} problems with IET is the large surplus <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> that are available. Russia, Ukraine, and the new EU-12 member states (the Kyoto Parties Annex I Economies-in-Transition, abbreviated [...] "IET": Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine) have a surplus <b>of</b> <b>allowances,</b> while many OECD countries have a deficit. [...] Some of the EITs with a surplus regard it as potential compensation for the trauma of their economic restructuring. When the Kyoto treaty was negotiated, it was recognized that emissions targets for the EITs might lead to them having an excess number <b>of</b> <b>allowances.</b> [...] This excess <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> were viewed by the EITs as [...] "headroom" [...] to grow their economies. [...] The surplus has, however, also been referred to by some as [...] "hot air," [...] a term which Russia (a country with an estimated surplus of 3.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent allowances) views as [...] "quite offensive." ...|$|R

25|$|Another {{criticism}} is the claimed possibility of non-existent emission reductions being recorded under the Kyoto Protocol {{due to the}} surplus <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> that some countries possess. For example, Russia had a surplus <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> due to its economic collapse {{following the end of}} the Soviet Union. Other countries could have bought these allowances from Russia, but this would not have reduced emissions.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} various {{issues related to}} the {{allotment}} of elderly people care allowance. The introduction describes the current state of social policy and services; basic concepts used in this field were defined. The concept of old age and its epiphenomena were briefly and expertly characterized. The main part of the thesis is devoted to ways of obtaining, processing, allotment and functioning <b>of</b> the <b>allowance</b> for the care of elderly people in the region of Milevsko. Given the specifics of the individual Czech regions, it was necessary to describe generally the Milevsko region and to characterize the Department of Social Affairs at the Milevsko Municipal Authority, which pursuant to Czech legislation, carries out all activities associated with the agenda <b>of</b> the <b>allowance</b> for care in the defined region. The objective of the thesis was to map in detail the <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> the <b>allowance</b> care at various stages, i. e. from filing an application till its execution and to describe partly the subsequent use <b>of</b> the <b>allowance.</b> The details <b>of</b> the early stages of processing applications are described, i. e. where there are still many problematic issues. During my work on the problem, I cooperated closely with the staff at the Milevsko Municipal Authority, competent staff at the Department of Social Affairs and a selected sample of senior citizens in the locality. To achieve the set objective, I used the strategy of qualitative research, the method of interviewing and the technique of semi-controlled non-standard interviews of selected clients ? senior citizens ? with the staff of the Department of Social Affairs. The analysis of social and medical records of the client group, along with legislation for the care allowance, was used as an additional method. The outputs of the used techniques were recorded in detail and summarized using tables. The research results yielded many interesting findings; in particular it is still a relatively low general public awareness <b>of</b> the care <b>allowance</b> and it was demonstrated that the most important source of information for senior applicants was a social worker. What needs to be constantly improving is the awareness of senior citizens and their family members of what types of care and compensating aids or activities can be covered by care allowance. It is also necessary to explain to senior citizens and their families how to use the care allowance, such as checks by social workers. According to the findings, I can confirm that the care allowance is a very important factor that helps significantly to offset the dependence of senior citizens, although its amount is questionable. Another finding was seen in an irreplaceable role of the family, family members who provide the care of the elderly and the efforts of all who are involved in ensuring senior citizens can function in their natural environment, which I think is an extremely positive finding. In any case, ?horror? scenarios of abusing the care allowance were not confirmed, which confirms the fact that the control mechanisms in the legislation are relatively well adjusted. Improvements, according to the conclusions of my thesis, must be included in the inquiry stage of processing the care allowance; {{there is a need to}} combine general social methods with an extremely sensitive and personal approach to individual applicants in order to achieve optimal use <b>of</b> the care <b>allowance</b> for individuals who could stay in their natural environment as long as possible. Another area of potential development can be seen particularly in the interaction between the actors involved in the process of allotment <b>of</b> the care <b>allowance,</b> e. g. through automated processing of the agenda using electronic forms...|$|R
