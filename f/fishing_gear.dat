5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fishing</b> <b>gear</b> is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the optimal {{management}} {{of a joint}} ownership fishery exploitation model where agents use different <b>fishing</b> <b>gears.</b> As opposed to other works, we consider a model in which the fishing technology affects resource's growth not only through the harvest function, but also through the natural growth rate of the resource. The main objective is to capture the evidence that some <b>fishing</b> <b>gears</b> alter the habitat of the resource, and may alter the natural growth rate of the resource. The main result we obtain is that, when the natural growth of the resource is altered by the fishing technology, the optimal stock is not independent of how harvest quotas are distributed among the agents. Thus, in this context, a fishing policy that determines, first, the optimum stock and, secondly, decides on how to distribute the harvest among the different agents will not be efficient. fisheries regulation, <b>fishing</b> <b>gear's</b> selectivity, sharing of quotas...|$|R

Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.|$|E
5|$|The finless sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} to bottom trawls and perhaps other demersal <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> It is a potential bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E

40|$|To {{sustainably}} and responsibly harvest commercial aquatic {{species in}} the world’s fisheries, consideration must be given towards the negative physical and biological effects that <b>fishing</b> <b>gears</b> place on marine ecosystems. Fish habitat degradation, bycatch of undersized and non-target species, carbon footprint, reductions in biodiversity and biomass {{are just some of}} the negative impacts of <b>fishing</b> <b>gears.</b> One novel method to reduce impacts while maintaining commercially viable catch rates of target species is through modification of <b>fishing</b> <b>gears.</b> Two experimental studies, conducted for this thesis, evaluated the catch characteristics of innovative, modified <b>fishing</b> <b>gears</b> designed to mitigate ecological concerns specific to each study’s respective fishery. In the first study, the Newfoundland cod pot was modified in an attempt to target flatfish species while avoiding the capture of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio). Major findings include the importance of artificial light and entrance shape in capturing American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides). Also, non-baited pots that contained only artificial light were successful in capturing plaice while greatly reducing the capture of snow crab. In the second study, at-sea catch characteristics of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) and non-targeted bycatch species were compared between two trawls, one containing a traditional rockhopper ground gear currently used in the northern shrimp fishery, the other containing an experimental ground gear designed to reduce seabed contact. Catch rates and size of shrimp were found to be comparable between trawls however the experimental trawl captured significantly more bycatch...|$|R
5|$|Gregarious in nature, {{the pink}} whipray {{has been known}} to form large active and resting aggregations, and {{associate}} with other large ray species. It preys mainly on prawns, but also consumes other benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. This species is aplacental viviparous, in which the unborn young are nourished by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Across much of its range, substantial numbers of pink whiprays are caught incidentally by a variety of <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> and marketed for meat, skin, and cartilage. It is also of importance to ecotourism, being attracted to visitors with bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, due to its wide distribution that includes relatively protected areas, such as northern Australia. However, its population in Southeast Asia is likely declining under heavy fishing pressure, and there it has been assessed as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Lead, one of {{the leading}} causes of {{toxicity}} in waterfowl, has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations. When hunters use lead shot, waterfowl such as ducks can ingest the spent pellets later and be poisoned; predators that eat these birds are also at risk. Lead shot-related waterfowl poisonings were first documented in the US in the 1880s. By 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was positively identified as the source of waterfowl deaths. Lead shot has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Other threats to wildlife include lead paint, sediment from lead mines and smelters, and lead weights from fishing lines.

5|$|Blue whales may be wounded, {{sometimes}} fatally, after {{colliding with}} ocean vessels, {{as well as}} becoming trapped or entangled in <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California. In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which {{makes it harder for}} them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Research on blue whales in the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} {{is one of}} the most important components of Pacific artisanal shark and ray fisheries, comprising around a tenth of the total annual catch. Its significance is likely underestimated, as Mexican fishery reports frequently suffer from misidentifications and a lack of species-specific data. It is mainly caught during summer and fall, being the most common ray landed in Bahía Magdalena, and second most common ray landed off Sonora state. Demersal gillnets are the main <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> employed; both adult and juvenile rays easily become entangled in the mesh by their tail spines, with juveniles known to have comprised most of the Bahía Magdalena catch in 19982000. This species is also often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, on longlines, and in fish traps. In the future, habitat degradation from increasing numbers of shrimp farms may pose an additional threat to this species in the region. As a result of these pressures, the IUCN has assessed the diamond stingray as Near Threatened in Mexican waters. No management schemes have yet been enacted for this species.|$|E
