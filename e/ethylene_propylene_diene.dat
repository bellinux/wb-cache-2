40|$|ABSTRACT: (Ind) 2 ZrCl 2 {{catalyst}} was synthesized {{and used}} for copolymerization of <b>ethylene</b> and <b>propylene</b> (EPR) and terpolymerization of <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> and 5 -ethyl-diene- 2 -norbornene (ENB). Methylaluminoxane (MAO) was used as cocatalyst. The activity of the catalyst was higher in copolymerization of <b>ethylene</b> and <b>propylene</b> (EPR) rather than in terpolymerization of <b>ethylene,</b> <b>propylene</b> and <b>diene</b> monomers. The effects of [Al] : [Zr] molar ratio, polymeriza-tion temperature, pressure ratio of ethylene/propylene and the ENB concentration on the terpolymerization behavior were studied. The highest productivity of the catalyst was obtained at 60 C, [Al] : [Zr] molar ratios of 750 : 1 and 500 : 1 for copolymerization and terpolymerization, respectively. Increasing the molar ratio of [Al] : [Zr] up to 500 : 1 increased the ethylene and ENB contents of the terpoly-mers, while beyond this ratio the productivity of the cata-lyst dropped, leading to lower ethylene and ENB contents. Terpolymerization was carried out batchwise at tempera-tures from 40 to 70 C. Rate time profiles of the polymeriza-tion were a decay type for both copolymerization and terpolymerization. Glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the obtained terpolymers were between 64 and 52 C. Glass transition temperatures of both copolymers and terpolymers were decreased with increased ethylene content of the poly-mers. Dynamic mechanical and rheological properties of the obtained polymers were studied. A compounded EPDM showed good thermal stability with time. VC 2011 Wiley Peri...|$|R
40|$|Copolymers {{based on}} <b>ethylene,</b> <b>propylene,</b> and <b>dienes</b> (EPDM) are often commercially {{produced}} with a vanadium catalyst, an alkylaluminum cocatalyst and optionally a halocarbon promoter. It is widely accepted that the catalytic species in vanadium polymerization {{is in the}} trivalent oxidation state V(III) and {{that the role of}} organohalide promoters is to oxidize the vanadium species, reduced by the alkylaluminum cocatalyst to divalent V(II), back to the trivalent state[1 - 3]. Mechanisms for polymerizations with vanadium have been proposed and kinetic modelling has been attempted in the past [4 - 9], but monomer-coordinated species and two-site behaviour, occasionally alluded to but not characterized, were not considered. In the present study, EPM and EPDM polymers were made in solution with a vanadium catalyst in a continuous stirred-tank reactor. Observations about this system include[10]: • the catalyst system without promoter and without hydrogen produces polymer with bimodal MWDs, suggesting two-site catalyst behaviour. • the addition of catalyst promoter causes an order of magnitude increase in catalyst productivity, and eliminates the higher-MW component in the MWD...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} {{reaction of}} linear and branched alkanes, initiated by dicumyl peroxide, {{has been studied}} {{as a model for}} the combination cross-linking reaction of peroxide-cured terpolymerised <b>ethylene,</b> <b>propylene</b> and <b>diene</b> monomer. Both gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and comprehensive two-dimensional GC-MS (GC x GC-MS) analyses have been employed to analyse the isomeric reaction products. The identification of these products based on their MS fragmentation patterns is quite complex, due to the high tendency of random rearrangements. Careful elucidation of the high-mass ions at optimised ionisation energy (55 eV) has resulted in proposed structures for the different isomeric reaction products. The structure assignment by MS is in agreement with the GC x GC elution pattern and with the result of a theoretical model to predict the boiling points and, thus, the GC retention times. In addition, a model that provided a direct correlation between chemical structure and retention times was developed and this was found to provide a useful fit. Quantification of the identified reaction products by GC separation and flame ionization detection allows classification according to the hydrogen abstraction sites for the alkanes by dicumylperoxide. The selectivity for hydrogen abstraction generally follows the expected order, but a higher reactivity was observed for the methylene group next to a primary methyl group, while a reduced reactivity of the methylene group next to ethyl and to methyl groups was observed. The used approach proved to be a very powerful tool to enhance our understanding of the mechanism of peroxide cross-linking of (branched) alkanes...|$|R

The objective was to evaluate the potential of FT-IR analysis of gaseous pyrolyzates (PY-G/FT-IR) for characterization of EPDM additives. Two EPDM formulations, containing additives typically employed in EPDM rubbers, were analyzed. Initially, gaseous pyrolysis products from paraffin oil, stearic acid, 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 2 -dihydroquinoline, tetramethylthiuram monosulfide (TMTM), tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), and 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) were characterized separately, and their main absorptions were identified. Subsequently, the gaseous pyrolysis products of raw, unvulcanized, and vulcanized EPDM formulations were analyzed. The similarities observed in the FT-IR spectra of unvulcanized and vulcanized EPDM show that the vulcanization process does {{not interfere with the}} pyrolysis products. The identification of the functional groups of the studied additives was possible in both unvulcanized and vulcanized EPDM samples, without solvent extraction. Results also demonstrate that the PY-G/FT-IR technique can identify additives containing sulfur in concentrations as low as 1. 4 phr (1. 26 %) in both unvulcanized and vulcanized EPDM. However, the method showed some limitation due to overlapping and to similarities of TMTM and TMTD PY-G/FT-IR spectra, which could not be distinguished from each other. The PY-G/FT-IR technique is a faster and cheaper alternative to the sophisticated techniques usually applied to detection of additives in rubbers...|$|R

40|$|The {{aluminized}} Teflon fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> outer most {{layer of}} the multilayer insulation blankets on the Hubble Space Telescope has become embrittled resulting in severe on-orbit cracking. During the second servicing mission, a piece of aluminized fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> was retrieved that had curled, exposing the back-surface aluminum to space. This extremely embrittled piece reached 200 C on-orbit, 150 C higher than the nominal temperature extreme. Therefore, experiments have been conducted {{to determine the effect}} of heating on the degradation of fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> that has been irradiated in a ground laboratory facility or in space on Hubble Space Telescope. Samples of pristine, x-ray irradiated and Hubble Space Telescope retrieved fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> were heat treated from 50 to 200 C at 25 C intervals in a high vacuum facility and tensile tested. Density measurements were also obtained. Results indicate that heating does not embrittle non-irradiated Teflon. However, there is a significant dependence of the embrittlement of irradiated Teflon on heating temperature, with near complete loss of elongation at 100 C and higher. Rate of degradation changes, which were consistent with the glass transition temperature for fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene,</b> were present in the data.

50|$|Most {{high-voltage}} cables {{for power}} transmission {{that are currently}} sold on the market are insulated by a sheath of XLPE. Some cables may have a lead or aluminium jacket in conjunction with XLPE insulation to allow for fiber optics. Before 1960, underground power cables were insulated with oil and paper and ran in a rigid steel pipe, or a semi-rigid aluminium or lead jacket or sheath. The oil was kept under pressure to prevent formation of voids that would allow partial discharges within the cable insulation. There are still many of these oil-and-paper insulated cables in use worldwide. Between 1960 and 1990, polymers became more widely used at distribution voltages, mostly EPDM (<b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> <b>diene</b> M-class); however, their relative unreliability, particularly early XLPE, resulted in a slow uptake at transmission voltages. While cables of 330 kV are commonly constructed using XLPE, this has occurred only in recent decades.|$|E
5000|$|Fine bubble {{aeration}} is an {{efficient way to}} transfer oxygen to a water body. A compressor on shore pumps air through a hose, which is connected to an underwater aeration unit. Attached to the unit are a number of diffusers. These diffusers come in the shape of discs, plates, tubes or hoses constructed from glass-bonded silica, porous ceramic plastic, PVC or perforated membranes made from EPDM (<b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> <b>diene</b> Monomer) rubber. [...] Air pumped through the diffuser membranes is released into the water. These bubbles are known as fine bubbles. The EPA defines a fine bubble as anything smaller than 2mm in diameter. This type of aeration has a very high oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE), sometimes as high as 15 pounds of oxygen / (horsepower * hour) (9.1 kilograms of oxygen / (kilowatt * hour)). On average, diffused air aeration diffuses approximately 2-4 cfm (cubic feet of air per minute) (56.6-113.3 liters of air per minute), but some operate at levels as low as 1 cfm (28.3 L/min) or as high as 10 cfm (283 L/min).|$|E

The reaction products of the mixtures were separated by both gas chromatography (GC) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC). The separated compounds were identified from their mass spectra and their GC and GC x GC elution pattern. Quantification of the various alkyl/alkyl, alkyl/allyl and allyl/allyl combination products shows that allylic-radicals comprise approximately 60 % of the substrate radicals formed. The total concentration of the products formed by combination {{is found to be}} independent of the concentration and the type of alkene. The total concentration of the products formed by addition to the alkene increases with increasing concentration of alkene. In addition, the total concentration of the formed addition products depends strongly on the type of the alkene used, viz. VNBH > ENBH approximate to DCPDH, which is a consequence of differences in steric hindrance of the unsaturation. The peroxide curing efficiency, defined as the number of moles of cross-linked products formed per mol of peroxide, is 173 % using 9 % (w/w) 5 -vinylidene- 2 norbornane (VNBH). This indicates that the addition reaction is recurrent. All {{these findings are consistent with}} experimental studies on peroxide curing of EPDM rubber.
