Believing that he is beyond help, Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman, but after Ann's tearful pleading, Gil reluctantly agrees. During the examination, Dr. Hoffman orders Gil to remain in the house at all times as a precaution until he can return with <b>help.</b> <b>Feeling</b> guilty for leaving Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang. Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy, having felt sorry for him, brought him home to her apartment. George soon arrives and, upon seeing Gil, forces him at gunpoint out into the daylight. Transforming into the creature, Gil murders George in front of the horrified Trudy before fleeing into the hills. Returning to the house, Gil finds Ann, Dr. Hoffman and Buckell waiting there and returns to his normal human state. A disturbed Gil later admits to the murder, with the others assuring him that he acted in self-defense, but when the police arrive with an arrest warrant, the hysterical Gil flees from the grounds in his car and accidentally hits a police officer.|$|E

500|$|The {{opportunity}} for an equal partnership no longer existed, however, {{as shown in}} August 1942 when the British unsuccessfully demanded substantial control over the project while paying none of the costs. By 1943 {{the roles of the}} two countries had reversed from late 1941; in January Conant notified the British that they would no longer receive atomic information except in certain areas. While the British were shocked by the abrogation of the Churchill-Roosevelt agreement, head of the Canadian National Research Council C. J.

[...] The humanist Desiderius Erasmus has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch. Glum remarked on the triptych's similarity of tone with Erasmus's view that theologians [...] "explain (to suit themselves) the most difficult mysteries... is it a possible proposition: God the Father hates the Son?

His decision of making a sequel was explained by him in an interview: [...] "I am wary of sequels having to be made. With Don 2 I could finally make an action thriller the way I wanted to. Good story, classic action and simple plot which has one goal and work towards it effectively and dramatically." [...] The film was a major success in India {{and went on to}} become the year's highest-grossing Bollywood production abroad with a worldwide gross of 210 crore. It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with Khalid Mohammed stating: [...] "Throughout, you can’t <b>help</b> <b>feeling</b> that Farhan Akhtar could have made three far more valuable films out of the budget squandered on this thriller where cars are smashed as if they were tea cups." ...|$|E

500|$|Until the {{publication}} of Frederick Ponsonby's memoirs in 1951, there was little biographical material on the Munshi. Scholarly examination {{of his life and}} relationship with Victoria began around the 1960s, focusing on the Munshi as [...] "an illustration of race and class prejudice in Victorian England". Mary Lutyens, in editing the diary of her grandmother Edith (wife of Lord Lytton, Viceroy of India 1876–80), concluded, [...] "Though one can understand that the Munshi was disliked, as favourites nearly always are... One cannot <b>help</b> <b>feeling</b> that the repugnance with which he was regarded by the Household was based mostly on snobbery and colour prejudice." [...] Victoria biographer Elizabeth Longford wrote, [...] "Abdul Karim stirred once more that same royal imagination which had magnified the virtues of John Brown...

Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, describes Paul as being very similar to fictional character J. R. Ewing. Paul is referred to in Emily Barr's fictitious novel [...] "Out of My Depth", in which character Amanda is watching Neighbours, with scenes featuring Paul and Gail receiving disapproval from Harold, Amanda opines that she believes the couple are in love. Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail commented on Paul's obsession with Rebecca stating: [...] "You can't <b>help</b> <b>feeling</b> that nothing short of a stake through the heart is going to keep Paul out of Rebecca's life." [...] Stephen later said [...] "Taking advice from Paul is like asking Charlie Sheen to be your spirit guide." [...] Paul Kalina of The Age said Dennis as Paul lightens things up and he prances about like [...] "a pantomime villain minus the moustache and cape."
