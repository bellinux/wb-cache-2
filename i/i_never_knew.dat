5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus <b>I</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Knew</b> and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
25|$|Tina Brown {{was born}} in Maidenhead, England, {{and she and her}} elder brother, Christopher Hambley Brown (who became a movie producer) grew up in Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, a Thames village in the {{countryside}} west of London. Her father, George Hambley Brown, was active in the British film industry producing the early Miss Marple films in the series starring Margaret Rutherford, based on the character created by Agatha Christie. His other films included The Chiltern Hundreds (1949); Hotel Sahara (1951), starring Yvonne De Carlo; Guns at Batasi (1964), starring Richard Attenborough and Mia Farrow. In 1939, he had an early marriage to the actress Maureen O'Hara; according to O'Hara, it was never consummated, owing to her parents' intervention, and it was annulled. George later met and married Brown's mother, Bettina Iris Mary (Kohr), who was an assistant to Laurence Olivier. Brown's mother was of part Iraqi descent; she recounted, “She was dark and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> why.” In her later years, Bettina wrote for an English-language magazine for expatriates in Spain where she and her husband lived in retirement until moving to New York in the early eighties to be with their daughter and grandchildren.|$|E
25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

500|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? {{was named}} Book of the Year by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association in 1998 {{when it was}} chosen by Christian {{retailers}} as the title they most enjoyed selling; Yancey's The Jesus <b>I</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Knew</b> had received the same award two years earlier. In 1998, Christianity Today compared What's So Amazing About Grace? to Joel A. Carpenter's Revive Us Again, writing that both books productively analyze Christian fundamentalism. That year, Karla Vallance's Christian Science Monitor review called the book similarly sentimental to John Newton's hymn [...] "Amazing Grace".|$|E
500|$|In her [...] "feisty, impassioned" [...] {{interactions}} with Darcy and [...] "rebellious refusal to 'perform'" [...] for Lady Catherine, Stewart-Beer sees Knightley's depiction as [...] "far removed from Austen's original Elizabeth, {{who has a}} greater sense of grounded maturity, even though both Elizabeths have an occasional inclination to fluster, fun and giggles." [...] According to George Washington University professor Laurie Kaplan, while Wright's focus on Elizabeth is consistent with the novel, the screenplay removed her line of self-recognition: [...] "Till this moment, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> myself". Kaplan characterises the sentence as Elizabeth's [...] "most important", and believes its deletion [...] "violates not only the spirit and the essence of Austen's story but the viewer's expectations as well." ...|$|E
500|$|The formal {{engagement}} of marriage was announced on 3 January 1878, a day Rosebery forever afterwards regarded as sacred. Writing {{to a friend}} in January 1878, Rosebery described his wife as [...] "very simple, very unspoilt, very clever, very warm-hearted and very shy... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> such a beautiful character." [...] The marriage was celebrated in London on 20 March 1878 at the Board Room of Guardians in Mount Street, and also in a Christian ceremony at Christ Church in Down Street, Piccadilly. To show [...] "official" [...] disapproval, no male member of the Rothschild family attended the ceremonies. However, any shortcomings in the guest list were compensated for by the guest of honour—the Prince of Wales—and Disraeli, who gave the bride away.|$|E

500|$|Barbauld {{demanded that}} her father teach her the {{classics}} and after much pestering, he did. Thus she {{had the opportunity to}} learn Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and many other subjects generally deemed unsuitable for women at the time. Barbauld's penchant for study worried her mother, who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism; the two were never as close as Barbauld and her father. Yet Barbauld's mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter: [...] "I once indeed knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her, and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book, roundly, without spelling; and in half a year more could read as well as most women; but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> such another, and I believe never shall." ...|$|E
500|$|Stengel tried incessantly {{to promote}} the Mets, talking to reporters or anyone else who would listen. He often used the word [...] "amazin'" [...] (as he put it) and soon this became the [...] "Amazin' Mets", a {{nickname}} that stuck. Stengel urged the fans, [...] "Come out and see my amazin' Mets. I been in this game a hundred years but I see new ways to lose <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> existed before." [...] Stengel was successful in selling the team to some extent, as the Mets drew 900,000 fans, half again as many as the Giants had prior to their departure, though the games against the Giants and Dodgers accounted for half of the total. The team was less successful on the field, finishing {{with a record of}} 40–120, the most losses of any 20th century major league team. They finished 60 games behind the pennant-winning Giants, and 18 games behind ninth-place Chicago.|$|E

500|$|He led the NHL {{in assists}} three times – 1992–93, 2000–01 and 2001–02 – and {{finished}} in the top ten on 12 occasions. He is also the only player in NHL history to centre three 50-goal scorers, helping Brett Hull, Cam Neely and Peter Bondra reach the mark. [...] His teammates praised his consistency, noting that Oates continued to score points at an elite level when he did not have star players as linemates. [...] Boston teammate Raymond Bourque suggested in 1994 that Oates was underrated: [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} take what he does for granted. He does it in a quiet way. He's not a flashy guy. He's not looking for attention, he just goes out and does it. He's the best centerman I've been around. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> he was this good playing against him because I didn't see him this much." [...] Oates was able to score himself, reaching the 20 goal mark five times, including a career high 45 in 1992–93, a season in which he led the league with 11 game-winning goals.|$|E
500|$|Walsh {{was passed}} over {{in favor of}} Bill [...] "Tiger" [...] Johnson for the head {{coaching}} job when Brown retired. In a 2006 interview, Walsh said Brown worked against his candidacy to be a head coach anywhere in the league. [...] "All the way through I had opportunities, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> about them", Walsh said. [...] "And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep {{me out of the}} NFL." [...] Brown stayed on as team president following his retirement, and the Bengals later made two trips to the Super Bowl, losing both games to Walsh and the 49ers. He rarely appeared in public, however. He died on August 5, 1991 at home of complications from pneumonia. He and Katie had three sons: Robin, Mike and Pete. Following Katie's death {{of a heart attack in}} 1969, he married his former secretary Mary Rightsell in 1973. His son Robin died of cancer in 1978. Brown is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Massillon.|$|E
500|$|... "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] was {{produced}} by Eric Foster White.

Chuck Taylor of Billboard noted that the singer [...] "turn toward the sad side" [...] on the track, with its lyrics talking {{about the loss of}} a first love and how breaking up can be hard. As the song begins, Spears declares, [...] "'Never look back', we said / How was I to know I'd miss you so? / Loneliness up ahead, emptyness behind / Where do I go?" [...] During the chorus, she realizes that she has lost her true love, stating, [...] "From the bottom of my broken heart, even though time may find me somebody new / You were my real love, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> love, till there was you."

500|$|Steiger had {{intended}} {{returning to the}} stage, and had signed on to play the title character in Bertolt Brecht's Galileo, at the Lincoln Center Repertory Company in April 1967, but the production was cancelled when he became ill. Steiger won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Chief of Police Bill Gillespie in In the Heat of the Night, opposite Sidney Poitier. He played a Southern police chief searching for a murderer. Prejudiced against blacks, he jumps {{to the conclusion that}} the culprit is Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), an African-American man passing through town after visiting his mother, who later turns out to be an experienced homicide detective from Philadelphia. The film deals with the way the two men interact and join forces in solving the crime, as Steiger's Gillespie learns to greatly respect the black man he initially took to be a criminal. Steiger drew upon his experience in the Navy with a Southerner named [...] "King", remembering his accent. Poitier considered Steiger and Spencer Tracy to have been the finest actors he had ever worked with, remarking in 1995, [...] "He's so good he made me dig into bags <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> I had." [...] A. D. Murphy of Variety described Steiger's performance as [...] "outstanding", writing: [...] "Steiger's transformation from a diehard Dixie bigot to a man who learns to respect Poitier stands out in smooth comparison to the wandering solution of the murder." [...] Steiger won a plethora of other awards, including a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Laurel Award and awards for Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversial}} single [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome" [...] references {{the murder}} of Yusef Hawkins and the 1989 riots in Virginia Beach, and it has Chuck D criticizing Jewish leaders who protested Public Enemy in response to Professor Griff's anti-Semitic remarks. He addresses the controversy as being {{in the center of}} political turmoil, with criticisms of the media and references to the Crucifixion of Jesus: [...] "Crucifixion ain't no fiction / So called chosen frozen / Apology made to who ever pleases / Still they got me like Jesus". He is also critical of Blacks and those who [...] "blame somebody else when you destroy yourself": [...] "Every brother ain't a brother / 'cause a Black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man / the shootin of Huey Newton / from the hand of Nig who pulled the trigger". His lyricism features dizzying raps and internal rhyme: [...] "Lazer, anastasia, maze ya / Ways to blaze your brain and train ya [...] Sad to say I got sold down the river / Still some quiver when I deliver / Never to say <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> or had a clue / Word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard / Lies, scandalizin', basin' / Traits of hate who's celebratin' wit Satan?". Its dense production incorporates numerous samples, including several James Brown tracks and the guitar line from The Temptations' [...] "Psychedelic Shack". Several other samples are heard amid Chuck D's rapping, such as the line [...] "come on, you can get it-get it-get it" [...] from Instant Funk's [...] "I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl)". AllMusic's John Bush cites the track as [...] "the production peak of the Bomb Squad and one of Chuck D.'s best rapping performances ever ... one of their tracks were more musically incendiary".|$|E
