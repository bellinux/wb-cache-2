5|$|Today <b>herbs</b> are {{typically}} {{thought of as}} culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they {{were considered to be}} any plant with household uses. <b>Herbs</b> were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented <b>herbs</b> would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some <b>herbs</b> were used for dyeing fabrics. Traditional cottage garden <b>herbs</b> included sage, thyme, southernwood, wormwood, catmint, feverfew, lungwort, soapwort, hyssop, sweet woodruff, and lavender.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the player}} can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition. The player has {{a limited amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by monsters. Nevertheless, players can regain their health by collecting and using <b>herbs,</b> which can be mixed with other <b>herbs</b> to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special <b>herbs.</b> Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into much deadlier opponents.|$|E

40|$|Abiotic and biotic {{factors have}} the {{potential}} to alter <b>herb</b> communities, however, few studies consider feedback between them. This study explores how variation of species interaction and climatic conditions associated with changes in altitude affect <b>herb</b> community composition. We sampled accumulated temperatures of growth duration (June-November) (ATGD), maximum summer temperatures (MST) and <b>herb</b> community composition (<b>herb</b> height, abundance, richness) on non-gaps and forest-gaps site across an elevational gradient. A significant negative relationship was detected between MST and <b>herb</b> richness. The temperature of non-gaps was cooler than that of forest gaps, and overstory cover positively correlated with <b>herb</b> abundance. However, the ATGD exhibited a negative relationship with overstory cover, in that overstory cover decreased with ATGD. We suggested that temperature has a profound effect on height and richness of <b>herb</b> communities, while the overstory cover is moderating the effect of temperature on <b>herb</b> community structure and influence the abundance of <b>herb</b> community. Conversely, decreases in ATGD weakened the relative importance of overstory cover. We concluded that the interaction of temperature and overstory cover shapes the morphology, abundance and richness of <b>herb</b> communities...|$|R

5|$|Common <b>herbs</b> such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown <b>herbs</b> were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} cottage gardens {{were more}} practical than today's, {{with emphasis on}} vegetables and <b>herbs,</b> fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock. Flowers, used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant. The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, perhaps with a rose-bowered gateway. Flowers common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists' flowers such as primroses and violets, along with flowers with household use such as calendula and various <b>herbs.</b> Others were the richly scented old-fashioned roses that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like daisies. In time, cottage-garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the <b>herbs</b> can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some <b>herbs,</b> for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All <b>herbs</b> except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild <b>herbs,</b> Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E

5|$|A 1994 {{study of}} the nilgai's diet in the Sariska Reserve {{revealed}} its preference for <b>herbs</b> and grasses; grasses became {{more important in the}} rainy season, while during winter and summer it fed additionally on flowers (Butea monosperma), foliage (Anogeissus pendula, Capparis sepiaria, Grewia flavescens and Zizyphus mauritiana), pods (Acacia nilotica, A. catechu and A. leucophloea) and fruits (Zizyphus mauritiana). Preferred grass species include Cenchrus species, Cynodon dactylon, Desmostachya bipinnata, Scirpus tuberosus and Vetiveria zizanoides. Woody plants eaten include Acacia nilotica, A. senegal, A. leucophloea, Clerodendrum phlomidis, Crotalaria burhia, Indigofera oblongifolia, Morus alba and Zizyphus nummularia; <b>herbs</b> favoured are Cocculus hirsutus, Euphorbia hirta and Sida rhombifolia.
