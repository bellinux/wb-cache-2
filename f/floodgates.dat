5|$|Before Maemi made {{landfall}} in South Korea, officials issued flood warnings {{along the}} Nakdong River due to dams opening <b>floodgates.</b> About 25,000people {{were forced to}} evacuate, either to schools or relatives' houses. The Korea Meteorological Administration advised travelers to take precaution {{in advance of the}} storm. Ferry and airplane services were canceled to Jeju island, stranding residents ahead of the Chuseok holiday.|$|E
5|$|The unused {{westbound}} tunnel {{was used}} during World War I to store {{art from the}} Victoria & Albert Museum and china from Buckingham Palace and, from 1927 to 1939, {{was used as a}} signalling school. During World War II it contained equipment to detect bombs falling in the River Thames which might require the emergency <b>floodgates</b> on the under-river tunnels to be closed.|$|E
5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the <b>floodgates.</b> The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the <b>floodgates</b> of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
5|$|The first {{effects of}} the flood began to be felt in Fairbanks late on the 29th, as the Tanana River overflowed its banks and covered low-lying areas of South Fairbanks. Thought was given on that date to closing the <b>floodgates</b> of the Moose Creek Dam, located on the Chena River {{as part of the}} Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project, but the Chena's rise was not as rapid as that of the Tanana, which lies to the south of the town, and no action was taken on the 29th. Engineers also {{considered}} lowering the gates on the 30th, but the flow of the Chena River had not reached a level where computer models mandated the closing of the gates to protect Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|With the {{combined}} efforts of Layton, Luke, Emmy, Loosha, and the Black Ravens, the mecha is eventually defeated and Descole {{is forced to}} retreat. Despite Loosha having been fatally wounded during the fight, she proceeds to destroy the <b>floodgates</b> of the town's dam, drying the lake and revealing {{the entrance to the}} Golden Garden. As the group enter the garden, Loosha dies, and Arianna learns of Loosha's true intentions. Loosha knew that the clean environment of the garden would help Arianna recover from her disease, and fought the specter to ensure the garden would survive long enough to cure her. She fully recovers from her illness a year later, and the Golden Garden's discovery is then made public, marking the beginning of Layton's fame in the field of archaeology.|$|E
50|$|The West Flood Canal {{marked the}} {{southern}} {{boundary of the}} Menteng residential area. The flood canal {{was included in the}} 1918 Batavia city plan and constructed in 1919. It runs from the <b>floodgate</b> in Manggarai, via Pasar Rumput, Dukuh Atas, Karet Kubur, Tanah Abang, Tomang, Grogol, and Pademangan to the sea at Muara Angke. Another <b>floodgate</b> is located in Karet. A still existing bronze plaque on the Manggarai <b>floodgate</b> honours Van Breen and commemorates the canal's first use in diverting the flood of 1919.|$|R

50|$|A <b>floodgate</b> {{effect is}} {{situation}} in which a small action {{can result in a}} far greater effect with no easily discernible limit. The original analogy is that of a <b>floodgate,</b> which once opened, no matter how minutely, will allow water to flow from either side through the gate until both sides are balanced up. It may also be used to refer to the effect where, once a <b>floodgate</b> has been opened, water will gush out in a torrent through the gate, making it easier to continue to open the gate, but harder to close it.|$|R
5|$|As Barry {{approached}} the Florida Panhandle, voluntary evacuations {{took place in}} eight counties. Shelters opened in six counties, though most were placed on standby. In parts of Franklin County, mandatory evacuations were ordered, and in Okaloosa County, tolls on the Mid-Bay Bridge were suspended. Forty C-130 cargo aircraft and about 300 personnel from Hurlburt Field were moved to the Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas to flee the storm's projected path. In Tallahassee, county officials filled sandbags in areas vulnerable to flooding. At Grand Isle State Park, park rangers moved picnic tables out of tidal range and closed the camping grounds {{for a period of}} time. Additionally, the storm forced NASA to delay a shuttle launch in southern Florida. Elsewhere, thousands of personnel were evacuated from several offshore oil platforms. The city of New Orleans closed 60 of its 72 <b>floodgates</b> to avoid possible flooding. Throughout southeastern Louisiana, including New Orleans, roughly 500Red Cross volunteers and staff members were on standby. The threat of the storm forced the cancellation of an 'N Sync concert at Pro Player Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{fell across}} the Dominican Republic, with isolated totals of 10inches (250mm) expected. The rainfall caused flooding along the Yaque del Norte River, and initially {{there appeared to}} be a threat that the Tavera Dam along the river would fail, potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province. Officials instead opted to open all six <b>floodgates</b> at 0400UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6milliongallons (6.1millionliters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66foot (20m) wave of water that caught many off guard due to the time of night and only about 15minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35people and left homes in seven towns flooded. Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country, and more than 34,000people fled their homes due to the storm; more than 7,500houses were damaged. Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5billion (2007DOP, $45million 2007USD). In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country. On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h).|$|E
5|$|In Florida, the {{depression}} produced moderate winds near the coast, peaking at 51mph (82km/h) in Naples. As in Cuba, the system dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at 25inches (635mm) at Arcadia Tower. Large {{portions of the}} state reported totals in excess of 10inches (255mm) from {{the depression}}, with much of Sarasota County receiving over 20inches (510mm) of rain. The rainfall was classified as a 100-year flood in Sarasota and Manatee counties, where flooding reached 6feet (1.8m) deep in some locations. Officials in Manatee County {{declared a state of}} emergency in response to the flooding. There, about 3,000people were forced to evacuate their homes due to the flooding, some of whom left by boat. The flooding damaged about 50houses in and around Oneco. Due to the evacuations, no injuries were reported. The reservoir in Manatee County rose to over 39feet (11.9m), 4feet (1.2m) above normal, which resulted in officials opening <b>floodgates</b> to prevent flooding.|$|E

5|$|The American Red Cross mobilized {{workers and}} brought food, water, and other {{supplies}} to Louisiana prior to the storm's arrival. At the request of Louisiana emergency management officials, the organization opened two shelters for residents in low-lying areas. Several <b>floodgates</b> in New Orleans were closed before the storm made landfall, and many universities and government offices were closed as well. Parishes along the coastline closed summer camps and prepared sand bags, boats, and high-wheeled vehicles. Officials declared a voluntary evacuation for Grand Isle, though few residents heeded the recommendation. Louisiana Governor Mike Foster declared a statewide state of emergency to easily make state resources available, and Mississippi Governor Ronnie Musgrove made a similar declaration for Harrison, Hancock, and Jackson Counties, where shelters were also opened. Officials in Mississippi ordered the evacuation of flood-prone areas in anticipation for a moderate storm surge and above-normal tides.|$|E
5|$|As Dennis {{approached}} the Florida Keys, several gale warnings were issued, {{with the first}} from Long Key to Dry Tortugas at 04:00UTC on August16. These gale warnings were posted progressively farther north along the East Coast of the United States, reaching {{as far north as}} Windmill Point in Virginia. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued in South Florida from Fort Myers to Palm Beach, including the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the campgrounds of Bahia Honda and John Pennekamp state parks. Shelters were also prepared to open in the Florida Keys if necessary. Typically, when a tropical cyclone approaches South Florida, the South Florida Water Management District drains Lake Okeechobee using the <b>floodgates.</b> However, due to a severe drought, water was instead directed into the lake from the connector canals. The storm resulted in a postponement of a second spraying to combat the spread of Mediterranean fruit flies in the Tampa Bay Area. About 40,000tourists fled Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, including about 500people from a campground, causing a loss of about $2million to tourism. Some United States Military vessels were sent out to sea, while about 70A-10 jets at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base were flown to England Air Force Base near Alexandria, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, overall {{commander}} on the Western Front, {{reported to}} Hitler in October 1943 regarding the weak defences in France. This {{led to the}} appointment of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to oversee the construction of enhanced fortifications along the Atlantic Wall, with special emphasis on the most likely invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high-tide mark. The terrain at Utah is flat, offering no high ground on which to place fortifications. The shallow beach varies in depth from almost nothing to , depending on the tides. The Germans flooded the flat land behind the beach by damming up streams and opening the <b>floodgates</b> {{at the mouth of the}} Douve to admit seawater.|$|E
