5000|$|The work on PAL prototypes {{remained}} at low levels until 1960. Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) successfully created {{a number of}} new combination locks that were adaptable to different types of weapons. In the spring of 1961, there was a series of hearings in Congress, where Sandia presented the prototype of a special <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>lock,</b> which was then known still as a [...] "Proscribed Action Link." [...] The military leadership, however, soon realized that this term had negative connotations for the use of weapons by the officer corps (proscribed = [...] "prohibited"), and changed the meaning of PAL to [...] "Permissive Action Link" [...] (permissive = [...] "allowing / tolerating").|$|E
50|$|In 1999 the {{acquisition}} of Effeff Fritz Fuss in Germany enabled ASSA ABLOY to sell <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> in the German market. ASSA ABLOY also acquired Fichet in France, a manufacturer of high security locks. ASSA ABLOY doubled in size in 2000 when it bought the global lock group Yale Intruder Security. In the same year, ASSA ABLOY acquired HID, a proximity identification access controls company. The acquisition added electronic identification to the ASSA ABLOYâ€™s product portfolio. In 2001 the company completed its purchase of Lockwood in Australia.|$|R
50|$|A {{six-speed}} {{manual gearbox}} (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: CRB) (gear ratios - 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.711) {{was the only}} transmission choice. Audi's Torsen-based 'trademark' quattro permanent four-wheel drive system was standard. Front and rear final drive units contained a conventional 'open' differential, and have a ratio of 4.111, although the rear (parts code prefix: 01H, identification code: AZE) also has an <b>electro-mechanical</b> diff <b>lock.</b>|$|R
40|$|Embedding a micro-machined {{sensing element}} {{in a closed}} loop, force {{feedback}} system is a technique commonly used to realise high performance MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) sensors due to the advantages of better linearity, increased dynamic range and reduced parameter sensitivity. Electro-mechanical Sigma Delta modulators (EM??) have been proposedfor this reason and high order loops {{have been shown to}} enjoy a good signalto noise ratio (SNR) of more than 100 dB. It is also well known that achieving stability in high order EM??s is a challenging task and in practice stabilitycan be lost with large input signals or due to non-ideal effects in the circuits implemented. In this work we propose a novel dfferential frequency domain technique for closed loop control of micro-machined sensors. This method, called the <b>electro-mechanical</b> phase <b>locked</b> loop (EMPLL), uses a differential <b>electro-mechanical</b> phase <b>locked</b> loop to control and measure the detection of micro-machined sensors. We believe that EMPLLs have the potential to have significant advantages over EM??s for high performance MEMS sensors. Preliminary research suggests that this novel approach will lead to significant benefits in Signal to Noise Ratio, Parameter Sensitivity, and Input Signal Range...|$|R
40|$|Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) {{condenser}} microphones {{are widely}} used because of their low cost, small size, high sensitivity, and wide bandwidth. For certain specialist applications, however, they are still out-performed by the best conventional condenser microphones, which have greater bandwidth and dynamic range, but at higher cost and larger size. The sensitivity, and hence, signal-to-noise ratio of smaller MEMS microphones can be increased by using two perforated back-plates instead of one. The maximum amplitude is limited by membrane excursion, which leads to nonlinearity and, ultimately, failure. The use of force feedback holds the promise of avoiding these problems by holding the membrane at its equilibrium position while measuring the force required to do so. Previous attempts to accomplish this using a Sigma-Delta modulator have had only limited success in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth and stability. Instead we propose to use an <b>Electro-Mechanical</b> Phase <b>Locked</b> Loop (EMPLL) to overcome these limitations. We will present lumped-parameter and Finite Element models {{of the performance of}} such a microphone, and discuss the challenges associated with its fabrication.
