5000|$|Symbols (GHS hazard pictograms): Convey health, {{physical}} and environmental hazard information, {{assigned to a}} GHS hazard class and category. Pictograms include the harmonized hazard symbols plus other graphic elements, such as borders, background patterns or cozers and substances which have target organ toxicity. Also, harmful chemicals and irritants are marked with an exclamation mark, replacing the European saltire. Pictograms will have a black symbol on a white background with a red diamond frame. For transport, pictograms will have the background, symbol and colors currently used in the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. Where a transport pictogram appears, the <b>GHS</b> <b>pictogram</b> for the same hazard should not appear.|$|E
5000|$|The GHS {{includes}} {{directions for}} {{application of the}} hazard communication elements on the label. In particular, it specifies for each hazard, and for each class within the hazard, what signal word, pictogram, and hazard statement should be used. The GHS hazard pictograms, signal words and hazard statements should be located together on the label. The actual label format or layout is not specified in the GHS. National authorities may choose to specify where information should appear on the label or allow supplier discretion. There has been discussion {{about the size of}} GHS pictograms and that a <b>GHS</b> <b>pictogram</b> might be confused with a transport pictogram or [...] "diamond". Transport pictograms are different in appearance than the GHS pictograms. Annex 7 of the Purple Book explains how the GHS pictograms are expected to be proportional {{to the size of the}} label text so that generally the GHS pictograms would be smaller than the transport pictograms.|$|E
40|$|Sweeping {{globalization}} {{has resulted in}} unparalleled economic growth, including increased international trade of hazardous chemicals. Fundamental differences between nations trading these materials, including language, literacy rates, cultural values, and technical and governmental infrastructures has created an urgent need for a common system of risk communication to reduce the occurrence of deaths and serious injuries that result from unintended chemical exposures. To accomplish this goal, the United Nations (UN) created the Globally Harmonized System for the Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) in 1992. Unfortunately, there was no requirement for testing of the GHS labeling components, including pictograms intended to depict specific hazards, before their deployment. In Experiment 1, twenty GHS hazard pictograms were subjected to comprehension testing in two non-student samples from the U. S. and Brazil, respectively. In Experiment 2, alternatives for five of the GHS pictograms that were least well understood were created and then re-tested for comprehension. Several of the new pictograms outperformed their “original ” GHS counterparts in terms of comprehension and participant preference. Overall, the results of testing showed {{that only a small}} portion of the original GHS hazard pictograms reached acceptable levels of comprehension. Therefore, additional systematic work is needed to develop <b>GHS</b> <b>pictogram</b> alternatives that effectively convey safety hazards to a global audience...|$|E
30|$|Adding pictograms, {{icons and}} symbols to PCP labels is another {{recommended}} addition. Comprehensibility testing of potential pictograms, however, {{should be conducted}} before any pictograms are legislated for use. For example, the GHS pictograms were not subjected to global comprehensibility testing prior {{to the development of}} the first purple book. Comprehensibility testing, based on the University of Cape Town’s testing methodology, took place too late [82] as there was no option for changing or adapting these pictograms. The GHS building block approach does, however, allow for countries to add additional pictograms that are relevant for the country context [5]. We do not recommend introducing more pictograms with a global scope since pictograms are not cross-culturally transferable or intuitively obvious [69]. Research has shown that pictograms are not clearly understood by consumers - especially the <b>GHS</b> <b>pictogram</b> for acute toxicity (Figure  1 a) [4]. We recommend that a mechanism be put in place for countries to evaluate and upgrade legally binding pictograms to improve RC. We therefore support the plan proposed by ECHA to perform a new analysis by 2015 before mixtures will have to be labeled with the new GHS pictograms [66]. The question of cross-cultural comprehension of pictograms as scientifically intended is illustrated by whether these are understood in the same way by an illiterate South African farm worker as by a Finnish professor. Importantly, misinterpretations of label information can even increase the health risk [69]. To reduce misinterpretations, we recommend clear hazard statements on the label with precautionary advice. We also recommend that any pictograms or icons used on labels have the meaning printed in clear and concise words underneath.|$|E
