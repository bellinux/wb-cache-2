There is also growing awareness that the existing institutional arrangements to solve multilateral issues exhibit signs of adaptive (dynamic) inefficiency, with institutional changes lagging behind rapidly evolving realities as manifested in growing tensions in reaching cooperative solutions. An International Task Force on <b>Global</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Goods</b> was constituted in 2003 to identify relevant international <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> froma perspective of reducing poverty and to study the provision and financing issues. See International Task Force on <b>Global</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Goods</b> (2006). This Task Force has identified the following priority <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> (GPGs) : (a) preventing the emergence and spread of infectious disease, (b) tackling climate change, (c) enhancing international financial stability, (d) strengthening the international trading system, (e) achieving peace and security, and (f) generating knowledge. We need a framework for defining, identifying, providing and financing GPGs. Section 2 reviews alternative approaches to defining GPGs. Section 3 classifies GPGs into two categories : pure <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> by <b>global</b> <b>public</b> choice. Section 4 considers delivery systems for GPGs. It assesses the existing institutional frameworks for the supply of pureGPGs through the lens of GPGframework developed by Kaul et al (2003).

2500|$|Frakes has {{identified}} five core {{components of the}} Common Heritage of Humanity concept. First, {{there can be no}} private or public appropriation; no one legally owns common heritage spaces. Second, representatives from all nations must manage resources contained in such a territorial or conceptual area on behalf of all since a commons area is considered to belong to everyone; this practically necessitating a special agency to coordinate shared management. Third, all nations must actively share with each other the benefits acquired from exploitation of the resources from the commons heritage region, this requiring restraint on the profit-making activities of private corporate entities; this linking the concept to that of <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>good.</b> Fourth, there can be no weaponry or military installations established in territorial commons areas. Fifth, the commons should be preserved for the benefit of future generations, and to avoid a [...] "tragedy of the commons" [...] scenario.

A second focus of the paper is on {{the differences in the}} importance that donors attach to the various types of <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods,</b> trying to detect regular patterns in their choices of financing. Statistical regularities, representative of common historical, social, cultural factors, for groups of countries (Anglo-Saxon, Northern European and Central European) give rise to the existence of a certain clusterized homogeneity in <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> financing. Potential explanatory variables are examined in a panel analysis, which reveals the dominance of the donors’ wealth, preferences for <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>public</b> finance constraints in the decision of aid funding of <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods.</b> Finally, there is evidence that some <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> with weakest-link technologies have become increasingly important at the global level. The increase in their financing through aid flows could be explained by the rich countries’ fear of an insufficient provision by poor countries, which, increasingly, cannot afford to pay for them: rich countries are therefore stepping in to avoid sub-optimal levels of provision, as already foreseen by Sandler (1998). ...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} about <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods,</b> {{particularly}} {{those related to}} the environment, {{in the context of}} the global development process. Summary This report contends that global sustainability depends (indeed, consists of) the provision of certain <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods,</b> and that the prevailing approach to development assistance does not sufficiently recognize this fact. A key question is whether the country-ownership model is even compatible with global sustainability. A second key question is whether the political will exists to make the provision of <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> an explicit and central objective of official development assistance, especially in the face of objections from those who believe aid should be solely concerned with the eradication of poverty through national or community-level interventions. A third key question concerns the mobilization and use of resources for the World Bank 2 ̆ 7 s work to support the provision of <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods.</b> The Bank is a major player on many regional and global issues, but its work at these levels is usually enabled by donor contributions, most often in the form of grants, targeted for a particular purpose. International development assistance needs to undergo a major transition, such that it takes as an explicit and principal objective the provision of <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> important for development. The World Bank can play a leadership role in this transition, working within new kinds of coalitions but not abandoning the fundamentals of its operating model. Some of the most important <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> are provided through the separate and cumulative actions of multiple countries, so the challenge for the Bank is to find ways of investing strategically and sharing knowledge across countries, while keeping faith with their national development strategies, so as to achieve maximum global impacts. The World Bank can also play a unique role in stimulating the private provision of <b>global</b> <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> through risk-sharing and market creation...|$|R
