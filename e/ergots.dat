40|$|The Grid has rapidly {{moved from}} a toolkit-centered approach, {{composed}} {{of a set of}} middleware tools, toward a more application-oriented Service Oriented Architecture in which resources are exposed as services. The soaring number of available services advocates distributed and semantic-based discovery architectures. Distribution promotes scalability and fault-tolerance whereas semantics is required to provide for meaningful descriptions of services and support their efficient retrieval. Current approaches exploit either Semantic Overlay Networks (SONs) or Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) sweetened with some ”semantic sugar”. SONs enable semantic driven query answering but are less scalable than DHTs, which on their turn, feature efficient but semantic-free query answering based on ”exact” matching. This paper presents the <b>ERGOT</b> system combining DHTs and SONs to enable distributed and semanticbased service discovery on the Grid. We argue that these two models can benefit from each other in the sense that SONs can be constructed by exploiting DHTs mechanisms thus enlightening the way to the semantics-free content publishing and retrieval mechanisms of the latter. In particular, <b>ERGOT</b> allows establishing semantic links among peers, and the SONs, by scrutinizing semantic service descriptions they advertise on the DHT. As we will show semantic links can also be viewed as semantic shortcuts on the DHT. Finally, <b>ERGOT</b> exploits an ad hoc semanti...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{available}} Internet services increases every day. This trend demands dis-tributed models and architectures to support scalability {{as well as}} semantics to enable efficient publication and retrieval of services.

This paper presents a strategy and a system, called <b>ERGOT,</b> that combine DHTs and SONs to enable semantic-based service discovery in distributed infrastructures such as Grids and Clouds. <b>ERGOT</b> uses semantic annotations that enrich service specifications in two ways: (i) services are advertised in the DHT {{on the basis of}} their annotations, thus allow-ing us to establish a SON between service providers; (ii) annotations enable semantic-based service matchmaking, using a similarity measure between service requests and descriptions.

Further improvements for the Fog platform are backup and recovery procedures for SSD-assisted database systems [147] and VM images [148] as a whole.

5000|$|Arterial {{surgery is}} only {{indicated}} once there is positive confirmation that the arteries are indeed {{the source of}} pain. Some migraine sufferers have a visibly distended artery on the temple during an attack, which confirms that the arteries are involved. The distention usually subsides as the pain is controlled by vasoconstrictor drugs (<b>ergots</b> or triptans). In some, this artery is always visible, {{but it is only}} when it becomes distended during an attack that it becomes important for diagnosis. Patients who take triptans or <b>ergots</b> for relief of migraine pain are also prime candidates for arterial surgery. The {{reason for this is that}} the action of these drugs is to constrict the painfully dilated branches of the external carotid artery - the same arteries that are targeted by the surgery. The purpose of the surgery is to provide a permanent 'triptan or ergot effect'. Most of these arteries are in the scalp and are readily accessible to minimally invasive surgery. This treatment modality is of particular value in: 1) patients who have not responded to preventive drug therapy, 2) patients who are unable to use drug therapy because they experience unacceptable side effects, 3) patients who have to make too frequent use of abortive drugs such as the triptans or <b>ergots,</b> and 4) patients who would prefer not to be on permanent medication. Included in this category are those with Chronic Daily Headache (headache on more than 15 days per month) and patients with what is known as [...] "refractory headache" [...] - headache that has not benefited from any other form of treatment. Elliot Shevel, a South African surgeon, showed that patients with chronic migraine experienced a significant reduction in pain levels and significant improvement in their quality of life following the surgery.|$|E

50|$|Midwives {{and doctors}} have used {{extracts}} from <b>ergots</b> to hasten childbirth or to induce abortions for centuries. Previous {{research has shown}} that the prophylactic use of uterotonic agents in the third stage of labour reduces both postpartum blood loss and postpartum haemorrhage. In 1808 John Stearns of upper New York State learned from an immigrant German midwife of a new means to effect the mechanics of birth. This was ergot, a powerful natural drug that stimulates uterine muscles when given orally. It causes unremitting contractions. Stearns stressed its value in saving doctors time and relieving women of the agony of long labor. However, until anesthesia became available, there was no antidote or way of controlling the effects of ergot. So if the fetus did not move as expected, the drug could cause the uterus to mold itself around the child, rupturing the uterus and killing the child. Eventually, doctors determined that the use of ergot in childbirth without an antidote was too dangerous. They ultimately restricted its use to expelling the placenta or stopping hemorrhage.|$|E

50|$|The tall fescue-endophyte {{symbiosis}} confers {{a competitive}} advantage to the plant. Endophyte-infected tall fescue compared to endophyte-free tall fescue deters herbivory by insects and mammals, bestows drought resistance, and disease resistance. In return for shelter, seed transmission, and nutrients the endophyte produces secondary metabolites. These metabolites, namely alkaloids, are responsible for increased plant fitness. Alkaloids in endophytic tall fescue include 1-aminopyrrolizidines (lolines), ergot alkaloids (clavines, lysergic acids, and derivative alkaloids), and the pyrrolopyrazine, peramine.The lolines are the most abundant alkaloids, with concentrations 1000 {{higher than those of}} ergot alkaloids. Endophyte-free grasses do not produce lolines, and, as shown for the closely related endophyte commonly occurring in meadow fescue, Neotyphodium uncinatum, the endophyte can produce lolines in axenic laboratory culture. However, although N. coenophialum possesses all the genes for loline biosynthesis, it does not produce lolines in culture. So in the tall fescue symbiosis, only the interaction of the host and endophyte produces the lolines. Lolines have been shown to deter insect herbivory, and may cause various other responses in higher organisms. Despite their lower concentrations, ergot alkaloids appear to significantly affect animal growth. <b>Ergots</b> cause changes in normal homeostatic mechanisms in animals that result in toxicity manifested through reduced weight gains, elevated core temperatures, restricted blood flow, reduced milk production and reproductive problems. Peramine, like the ergot alkaloids, is found in much lower concentrations in the host compared with loline alkaloids.

40|$|The {{activity}} of pergolide, an N-propylergoline derivative, {{has been tested}} for stimulation of central dopaminergic receptors. Binding to dopamine receptors shows that pergolide acts as an agonist with respect to these receptors. GTP decreases the potencies of dopamine agonists and of pergolide, but not of bromocriptine, to displace [3 H]spiroperidol ([3 H]Spi) from striatal membrane sites. The GTP-sensitive site labeled by [3 H]Spi seems to be localized on intrastriatal dopamine receptors. The potency of dopamine agonists and of pergolide to displace [3 H]Spi from striatal receptor sites is reduced in membranes exposed to higher temperatures. Pergolide, but not hitherto-tested dopaminergic <b>ergots,</b> stimulates dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in striatal homogenates.

40|$|Between 1085 and 1927, {{epidemics}} of convulsive ergotism were widespread {{east of the}} Rhine in Europe due {{to consumption}} of grain contaminated with ergot, which is produced by the fungus Claviceps purpurea. West of the Rhine, consumption of ergot-contaminated food caused epidemics of gangrenous ergotism. The clinical features of convulsive ergotism-muscle twitching and spasms, changes in mental state, hallucinations, sweating, and fever lasting for several weeks-suggest serotonergic overstimulation of the CNS (ie, the serotonin syndrome).

40|$|Ergot [Claviceps purpurea (fr.) Tul. ] is an {{important}} disease of cereals and grasses in Australia, as grain contaminated with ergot is rejected or heavily discounted in value because of its toxicity to animals and man. Yield losses from the disease are small. The <b>ergots</b> most commonly detected in grain samples are from ryegrass and only rarely are the much larger cereal <b>ergots</b> present. Laboratory studies showed that C. purpurea can be cultured on several synthetic media, however, yeast malt dextrose agar was the best. On this medium the fungus grew well, sporulated abundantly and pathogenic isolates maintained their virulence. Pathogenicity tests on wheat showed there was a wide range in the virulence of individual isolates. Field studies suggested that direct infection of wheat by ascosporic inoculum was unlikely, but that primary infection of ryegrass by ascospores was possible. Surveys showed that ryegrass was often infected with ergot and glasshouse tests proved that these isolates were able to infect wheat. This suggests that ergot survives {{from year to year}} on infected ryegrass and can pass to wheat by conidial transfer when conditions are favourable. The level of ergot contamination of grain was reduced to a negligible level by controlling ryegrass within a crop. Victorian wheat cultivars vary in their reactions to C. purpurea, the cultivars Kewell and Olympic being very susceptible to ergot while the cultivars Halberd, Zenith and Kalkee are moderately resistant. No cultivars tested have shown immunity. The results of these studies show ergot infection of wheat can be avoided by planting seed free of ergot, burning and deep ploughing of ergot infested land, controlling ryegrass within crops and the sowing of resistant cultivars.

The results suggested that the direct effect of the ergot derivatives on dispersed pituitary cells was mediated through dopamine receptors and emphasized the long-lasting action of bromocriptine and lisuride in vitro...|$|E
