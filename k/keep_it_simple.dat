5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, {{as the second}} entry in a planned Ace Attorney trilogy. It was originally intended to feature the first game's prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth, in all episodes; Franziska was created when the development team learned that Edgeworth had become popular among players, and Takumi {{wanted to use the}} character more carefully and sparingly. They only introduced one new gameplay mechanic in the game; Takumi wanted to keep the game focused on the core concept of finding lies, and to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> enough for his mother to play. The game was positively received by critics, who generally liked the writing, but criticized the game's short length and the lack of the Nintendo DS-exclusive gameplay mechanics that appeared in the previous game.|$|E

Let’s <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>simple,</b> and let’s say, ‘No, if you are here illegally and you don’t follow the steps {{that at some point}} through immigration reform we’re {{going to be able to}} provide, and that is to somehow allow you to work.

2500|$|According to Bunk Gardner, [...] "Cruising with Ruben & the Jets {{was an easy}} {{album to}} record. We were {{recording}} {{it at the same}} time as Uncle Meat because the songs were easy and very simple and didn't require a lot of time for arrangements and technical overdubbing. It was the beginning of the end for Ray Collins because all the new material Frank was writing was a little too far out and away from Ray's roots - which was Ruben-era material. Motorhead too was in his glory during the recording of this album. He loved Ruben and that was really his kind of music to get nostalgic over - on stage and doing the dance steps and playing that music [...] I really enjoyed playing a solo on Ray's tune 'Anything'. I remember Frank, Ray and Roy standing in the control booth while I recorded my solo. Frank was telling me after the first take to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>simple.</b> So I nailed it on the second take and everyone was happy!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Motown {{specialized}} in {{a type of}} soul music it referred to with the trademark [...] "The Motown Sound". Crafted with an ear towards pop appeal, the Motown Sound typically used tambourines to accent the back beat, prominent and often melodic electric bass-guitar lines, distinctive melodic and chord structures, and a call-and-response singing style that originated in gospel music. In 1971, Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies, along with a four-beat drum pattern, regular use of horns and strings and [...] "a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio". Pop production techniques {{such as the use}} of orchestral string sections, charted horn sections, and carefully arranged background vocals were also used. Complex arrangements and elaborate, melismatic vocal riffs were avoided. Motown producers believed steadfastly in the [...] "KISS principle" [...] (<b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>simple,</b> stupid). Despite the growth of popular music being written and performed by black artists, the songs would not become popular or recognized unless the music was being performed by white performers. However, the Motown Sound became distinctly unique, making it impossible for white performers to replicate its sound. The [...] "real" [...] Motown Sound became more favorable than the altered renditions.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns {{a weighted}} average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album four stars, {{saying that it}} [...] "retains the high quality of The Green Album".
