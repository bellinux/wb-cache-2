40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a fixation device for internally fixing fractures. The fixation device has an <b>elongated</b> support <b>plate</b> and a transverse plate and a fin member extending transversely from the <b>elongated</b> support <b>plate.</b> The <b>elongated</b> support <b>plate</b> and the transverse plate define {{a plurality of}} holes for receiving fixing elements to mount the fixation device onto a bone. The holes can be so located that the fixing elements can prevent the fixation device from rotating relatively to the bone after the fixation device is mounted onto the bone. Additionally, the fin member is formed to be more flexible than the transverse plate. Thereby, the fin member can be bent {{to conform to the}} contour of the bone for fixing or stabilizing a fractured fragment. As a result, the fixation device can both support the injured bone and fix/stabilize the fractured fragment. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} is to study changes of phytoliths in Leymus chinensis quantitatively under saline-alkali stress to assist reconstruction of saline paleoenvironments. Methods We selected similarly sized leaves of L. chinensis under six different saline-alkali levels and extracted phytoliths with the wet ashing method.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Devonian fishes of the Michigan Basin {{are poorly}} documented; however, recent {{fieldwork}} has demonstrated a relatively rich vertebrate fauna {{in both the}} Middle and Upper Devonian sediments. The current study presents the first of this material, with description of a new species of Diplognathus Newberry, Diplognathus lafargei n. sp., from the Antrim Shale (Upper Devonian). Based on a single specimen, Diplognathus lafargei possesses a number of derived features that help to determine its phylogenetic assignment. Fused occlusal and non-occlusal regions of the inferognathal indicate a eubrachythoracid arthrodiran level of organization. Within this clade, {{the form of the}} suborbital (elongated anterior process beneath the orbit and a reduced posterior portion) and posterior ventrolateral (<b>elongated)</b> <b>plates</b> indicates assignment to the aspinothoracid arthrodires. Assignment to Diplognathus is based on the large portion of the inferognathal occupied by the occlusal region (about 58. 1 %) and the possession of well-spaced and relatively large denticles (teeth) on the gnathal plates. Characterizing the new species, Diplognathus lafargei, is the depth of the inferognathal relative to the type species, Diplognathus mirabilis; the proportions of the occlusal surface for the superognathals, with the poste-rior superognathal much longer than the anterior superognathal (opposite to that in Diplognathus mirabilis); and the form of the posterior ventrolateral plate. Diplognathus is assigned to the Aspinothoracidi (Arthrodira) incertae sedis...|$|E

40|$|Bone is a biologically {{generated}} {{composite material}} comprised {{of two major}} structural components: crystals of apatite and collagen fibrils. Computational analysis of the mechanical properties of bone must make assumptions about the geometric and topological relationships between these components. Recent transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies of samples of bone prepared using ion milling methods have revealed important previously unrecognized features in the ultrastructure of bone. These studies show {{that most of the}} mineral in bone lies outside the fibrils and is organized into <b>elongated</b> <b>plates</b> 5 nanometers (nm) thick, ~ 80 nm wide and hundreds of nm long. These so-called mineral lamellae (MLs) are mosaics of single 5 nm-thick, 20 – 50 nm wide crystals bonded at their edges. MLs occur either stacked around the 50 nm-diameter collagen fibrils, or in parallel stacks of 5 or more MLs situated between fibrils. About 20 % of mineral is in gap zones within the fibrils. MLs are apparently glued together into mechanically coherent stacks which break across the stack rather than delaminating. ML stacks should behave as cohesive units during bone deformation. Finite element computations of mechanical properties of bone show that the model including such features generates greater stiffness and strength than are obtained using conventional models in which most of the mineral, in the form of isolated crystals, is situated inside collagen fibrils...|$|E
50|$|The Tonga Plate {{is a small}} {{southwest}} Pacific {{tectonic plate}} or microplate. It is centered at approximately 19° S. latitude and 173° E. longitude.

40|$|Capillary waves {{excited by}} the {{vertical}} oscillations of a thin <b>elongated</b> <b>plate</b> below an air-water interface are analyzed using time-resolved measurements of the surface topography. A parametric instability is observed above a well defined acceleration threshold, resulting in a so-called cross-wave, a staggered wave pattern localized near the wavemaker and oscillating at half the forcing frequency. This cross-wave, which is stationary along the wavemaker but propagative away from it, is described as the superposition of two almost anti-parallel propagating parametric waves making a small angle {{of the order of}} 20 ^o with the wavemaker edge. This contrasts with the classical Faraday parametric waves, which are exactly stationnary because of the homogeneity of the forcing. Our observations suggest that the selection of the cross-wave angle results from a resonant mechanism between the two parametric waves and a characteristic length of the surface deformation above the wavemaker.

40|$|Abstract. Biomimetic apatite {{deposition}} behaviors on Zr- 1 Nb and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V {{plate with}} various surface conditions were examined. Both alloys were polished with abrasive papers {{to have different}} roughness {{and some of them}} were treated in NaOH before deposition of apatites in the simulated body fluid. After, 10 days immersion in a SBF, NaOH treated Zr- 1 Nb and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V were completely coated with apatite. The deposition rate of apatite was higher on NaOH-treated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V than on NaOH-treated Zr- 1 Nb initially, but the deposition rate on Zr- 1 Nb accelerated after 2 days and the total weight gain due to the deposition on Zr- 1 Nb approached to that of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. NaOH treatment was found to enhance the deposition rate of apatite on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V significantly. On the other hand, the deposition rate of Zr- 1 Nb was not influenced by NaOH treatment. Without NaOH treatment, the polished Zr- 1 Nb with abrasive paper was found to induce more apatite nucleation than the polished Zr- 6 Al- 4 V. The presence of apatite was confirmed by XRD analysis.

Rose diagrams of current orieuted shells show one strong maximum; over {{two thirds of}} an assemblage of elongate conical or plate-form shells point into or away from the current, depending on the geometry and mass distribution of the shell. In shoaling, nonswash waves, long axes of the same forms are aligned parallel to the wave crests or ripple marks. Because of currents associated with wave progression, the maxima tend to be skewed, so that a wave orientation pattern forms an obtuse arrow pointing {{in the direction of}} wave progression. In low angle swash zones, orientations show the two maxima of wave patterns, but the shells are aligned perpendicular to the ripple marks by oncoming and outgoing swash. Equant plate-form shells, rollers, and <b>elongate</b> <b>plates</b> and cones with protuberances may develop typical orientation patterns, but commonly show nondiagnostic orientations. Heavy shells fail to develop diagnostic orientations when they become on{rapped in relatively, soft sediment.

The lignins were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (with ca. 90 % solubility), and solutions were studied with regards to their oligomeric state, heterogeneity profiles (distribution of sedimentation coefficients), and molecular weight distributions (MWD). Alcell L and soda L have similar properties showing one major low MW component and two minor high MW components, whereas kraft L appears to be larger and more uniform, i. e., it shows a more monodisperse MWD. Weight average molecular weight (M w) data from sedimentation equilibrium obtained by the new SEDFIT-MSTAR procedure in conjunction with MULTISIG analysis {{were found to be}} ~ 18 kDa (Alcell L), 25 kDa (kraft L), and 15 kDa (soda L).
