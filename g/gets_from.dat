Meanwhile, KPMG's competitive alternative report found that in 2012 Manchester had the 9th lowest tax cost of any industrialised city in the world, and fiscal devolution has come earlier to Manchester than to any other British city: it can keep half the extra taxes it <b>gets</b> <b>from</b> transport investment.|$|E

5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle <b>gets</b> <b>from</b> one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre {{is owned}} by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been {{required}} to generate funds for projects. By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75percent of the total budget to 62percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it <b>gets</b> <b>from</b> the state, about €122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance. A further €3 million to €5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As the Louvre became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180million of the Louvre's yearly $350million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.|$|E

Subsequently, both are presented standing {{close to each other}} in front of a red backdrop and a cactus.

Next, Yankee makes a cameo appearance in the clip, followed by both singers performing a synchronized choreography. The video ends in the same way it opens. Cut scenes portray Yankee, Stan and Inna singing and dancing to the song in front of yellow, green and blue backdrops, Inna performing to the club's crowd or Stan dancing on a runaway.|$|E

25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person <b>gets</b> <b>from</b> seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, {{they may be more}} likely to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E

25|$|Other {{diseases}} {{are influenced by}} genetics, but the genes a person <b>gets</b> <b>from</b> their parents only change their risk of getting a disease. Most of these {{diseases are}} inherited in a complex way, with either multiple genes involved, or coming from both genes and the environment. As an example, {{the risk of breast}} cancer is 50 times higher in the families most at risk, compared to the families least at risk. This variation is probably due to a large number of alleles, each changing the risk a little bit. Several of the genes have been identified, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, but not all of them. However, although some of the risk is genetic, the risk of this cancer is also increased by being overweight, drinking a lot of alcohol and not exercising. A woman's risk of breast cancer therefore comes from a large number of alleles interacting with her environment, so it is very hard to predict.|$|E
25|$|The Software Configuration Management system, is {{a system}} at the vendor’s site which keeps track of the {{configurations}} at the customer site. By storing this in a system the vendor {{will be able to}} give the customer particular service when it needs a new product.

In some cases {{it is possible that the}} vendor did some modifications to the product particularly for this customer. This will also have to be stored in the system. Also there needs to be configuration data, some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software.
