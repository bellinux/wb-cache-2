Adopting the non-contact 3 D scanning technology, make the laser beam sweep across the forging surface to get three-dimensional coordinates {{of the points}} on the forging surface in space. Neighboring scan points separate by less than 0. 25 mm. The measurement error is less than 6 mm. The coordinate s data are sent to the LabVIEW procedure. The procedure analyzes the coordinates to calculate {{the size of the}} large-size forging to realize automatic measurement of the forgings. The procedure can also reconstruct the image of the large-size forging. These make us detect the real-time changes of the forging far from the <b>free</b> <b>forging</b> scene. Instruction With the development of economy, water-dipper and energy resources, the need of the large-size forging is sharply increasing. The large-size forging is usually forged by the <b>free</b> <b>forging</b> method. After the large-size forging is heated to a certain temperature, press it to cause plastic deformation. The initial forging temperature of the carbon steel and alloy steel is more than 1000 ℃ and the final forging {{temperature is}} about 800 ℃. At such high temperatures, measurement o...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} a {{technique}} for predicting surface cracks in hot <b>free</b> <b>forging.</b> These surface cracks occur at the side on which strains concentrate when a round bar is compressed by hot <b>free</b> <b>forging.</b> A final product has hardly any surface cracks because they are removed by gas scarfing. These conventional manufacturing processes have an industrial problem of low productivity with a waste of time. The suppression of the surface cracks is required. The mechanism and criteria for the surface cracks are not clear. In this paper, the mechanism of surface cracking was estimated, compared with the actual forging process. The mechanical property was evaluated by a high temperature tensile test. Various numerical simulations which changed the damage parameter (C value) were carried out. The critical value (C 1) is calculated by shape comparison between the tensile test and the numerical simulation. It is possible to predict the surface cracking in the hot forging process by using this parameter...|$|E

The specimens were then turned at different cutting conditions - velocities, feeds, and depth of cuts - using high speed tools (HSS). The surface roughness values were then assessed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{manufacturing}} {{process of the}} exhaust valve in large marine diesel engines consists of an upset forging and final forming process. In the past, the exhaust valves in large marine diesel engines have been made through <b>free</b> <b>forging</b> by using the stretch forming method. This method has used the ingot and the billet as a preliminary forming process. Nimonic 80 A, a superalloy, is presently used for the material of the exhaust valve. For the forming method of the valve, the electric upset method is used. Solid bar is raised up to the forming temperature by using electric energy and is continually deformed by upset pressure. The electric upsetting processing is a useful method for the high quality of exhaust valves in large marine diesel engines. It can keep the continuous grain flow, excellent mechanical property, and corrosion resistance because of the elaborate macrostructure of the valve face. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to predict the optimum process condition through simulation of the exhaust valve with a diameter of 73 mm. The experimental result of an exhaust valve with a diameter of 19 mm is in good agreement with the simulation result using the “QForm ” that can solve electric upsetting problems. Finally, the optimal {{manufacturing process}} of the electric current and the upset load are surveyed...|$|E
40|$|Hadfield steel (110 G 13 L) is {{the basic}} {{material}} for fast wornout items of mining equipment: beaters, hammers, liners, refractory plates of crushers and mills. By way of example, the effect of cold hardening was specifically analyzed on the rate of wear of mining equipment parts for various types of wear by hard (more than 1100 HV) and soft rock. A unique ability of that steel to resist shock wear is noted. It is shown that this steel exhibits low resistance to abrasive rock wear. Meanwhile wear by rock of hardness lower than steel (less than 1100 HV), may be substantially increased by pre-hardening of samples (up to 10 -fold). In case of wear by high hardness rocks, shock impact that should contribute to hardening of the material, fails  to increase abrasive wear resistance of Hadfield steel, and in that parameter it does not differ from the conventional medium carbon steel 45. Also, {{the authors of this}} article describe a technique they developed of high-temperature thermomechanical treatment of specimen of Hadfield steel (<b>free</b> <b>forging</b> at 1150 - 950 ºC and subsequent quenching in water) and experiments in their abrasion. The results of tests show that hardness and wear resistance of Hadfield steel to hard abrasive (corundum 25 A with aggregate hardness of ~ 2500 HV) increases with plastic deformation at HTMT. For maximum plastic deformation intensity (deformation magnitude of α = 2. 25), reached in the experiments by the authors, wear resistance grew by 70 % as compared to undeformed steel. The dependence is presented of wear resistance of steel on hardness, HV, achieved in the result of plastic deformation. Since a similar positive effect was obtained earlier by the authors for 35 HGSA steel, also used in mining machinery, they conclude that the HTMT technique may be recommended for treating short lived parts of the mining and mineral processing equipment to increase their service life...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Grain {{refinement}} {{process can}} improve {{not only the}} strength, but also the forming characteristics of metals. In this paper, the <b>free</b> form <b>forging</b> process, which is broadly used in metal working factory, is considered to develop a multi-forging process, which can be served as a grain refinement process. Thereby, a bulk metal is plastically deformed repeatedly according {{to the principle of}} thermomechanical process for grain refinement. For each forging or deformation step, a flat punch is traveled onto the pre-heated material, so that the material height is to be halved. And the forged metal should then be folded or stacked after cutting and so prepared for the next deformation step, that the material will have the same height as in the previous step. However, before folding or stacking, the bulk metal must be quenched in water to hold the microstructure in the deformed metal. After folding or stacking, the material will be heated again to the forging temperature. In this paper, the commercial finite element code DEFORMTM is used to simulate such a grain refinement process in a plane strain state, in which a nickel alloy 718, 50 mm both in width and in thickness, is heated to 1000 °C and forged with a punch at 1000 °C. For the input data, especially for recrystallization processes, some stated in literatures are applied in this study. The simulation results show that the quenched grains with an average size of 22 µm can be achieved just after one forging step on th...|$|R

This paper summarises a one-day workshop held in Edinburgh on 10 July 2014 to discuss Trial Forge and how to advance this initiative. We first outline the problem of inefficiency in randomised trials and go on to describe Trial Forge. We present participants' views on the processes in the life of a randomised trial that should be covered by Trial Forge. General support existed at the workshop for the Trial Forge approach to increase the evidence base for making randomised trial decisions and for improving trial efficiency. Agreed upon key processes included choosing the right research question; logistical planning for delivery, training of staff, recruitment, and retention; data management and dissemination; and close down. The process of linking to existing initiatives where possible was considered crucial. Trial Forge will not be a guideline or a checklist but a ‘go to' website for research on randomised trials methods, with a linked programme of applied methodology research, coupled to an effective evidence-dissemination process. Moreover, it will support an informal network of interested trialists who meet virtually (online) and occasionally in person to build capacity and knowledge in the design and conduct of efficient randomised trials. Some of the resources invested in randomised trials are wasted because of limited evidence upon which to base many aspects of design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials.
