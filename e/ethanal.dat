40|$|Catalysis has a {{profound}} impact on all living species on the earth. Nature’s catalysts, the enzymes, have the ability to selectively promote a specific bio-chemical transformation, given the required substrate. As well as being highly selective, enzymes enhance the speed of these reactions, helping them to run at temperatures much lower than normally required, i. e. at body temperature. In comparison, reactions used in the production of new materials such as polymers, medicines, fragrances, petrochemicals, etc. are often catalyzed by transition metals. This thesis describes how the selectivity and activity of these catalysts can be influenced via two conceptually different methods: chelation control and microwave heating. The thesis primarily focuses on regio- and stereochemical aspects of the palladium-catalyzed arylation of olefins, i. e. the Heck reaction. Reaction rate enhancement of both palladium and enzyme (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) catalysis by microwave heating is also discussed. Novel chelation-controlled palladium-catalyzed multi- and asymmetric arylations of vinyl ethers were performed, resulting in tetra-substituted olefins as well as chiral quaternary carbon centers with excellent optical purity. In addition, a new synthetic route to diarylated <b>ethanals,</b> relying on a double chelation-controlled regioselective arylation followed by hydrolysis, has been discovered. High temperature conditions, using microwave heating, substantially reduce the reaction time for ligand-controlled asymmetric Heck arylations, while retaining levels of enantioselectivity in most cases. In addition, a potentially useful fast synthetic protocol for the employment of aryl boronic acids in oxidative Heck arylation was developed. Finally, microwave-assisted PCR was described for the first time; this method allows reductions in the run time of 50 %...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAmbient {{formaldehyde}} concentrations {{are reported}} from the North Atlantic Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (NAMBLEX) campaign at Mace Head {{on the west}} coast of Eire during August 2002. The results from two techniques, using direct determination via gas chromatography and the Hantzsch technique, show similar trends but a significant off set in concentrations. For westerly air flows characteristic of the marine boundary layer, formaldehyde concentrations from the gas chromatographic and Hantzsch technique ranged from 0. 78 ? 1. 15 ppb and 0. 13 ? 0. 43 ppb, respectively. Possible reasons for the discrepancy have been investigated and are discussed, however, no satisfactory explanation has yet been found. In a subsequent laboratory intercomparison the two techniques were in good agreement. The observed concentrations have been compared with previous formaldehyde measurements in the North Atlantic marine boundary layer and with other measurements from the NAMBLEX campaign. The measurements from the Hantzsch technique and the GC results lie at the lower and upper ends respectively of previous measurements. In contrast to some previous measurements, both techniques show distinct diurnal profiles with day maxima and with an amplitude of approximately 0. 15 ppb. Strong correlations were observed with <b>ethanal</b> concentrations measured during NAMBLEX and the ratio of <b>ethanal</b> to formaldehyde determined by the gas chromatographic technique is in good agreement with previous measurements. Some simple box modelling has been undertaken to investigate possible sources of formaldehyde.

The temperature dependence of the hyperfine coupling constant was calculated from a Boltzmann population of rotational states.

40|$|Using {{infrared}} spectroscopy, {{studies of}} the interaction of small molecules {e. g. CO, C(_ 2) H(_ 2), CH(_ 3) CHO) with zeolites have been carried out. The work {{has resulted in the}} observation of both stable chemisorbed complexes and reacting species for which time-resolved measurements have been made. The isomerization of cyclopropane on ZnNa-A has been followed using time resolved spectroscopy. From the intensity of the v(C=C) stretch of the product, propene, the kinetics of the reaction have been followed and the reaction sites identified. The rate of isomerization was found to be very much faster than that previously reported for similar systems. In a separate study the adsorbed complex formed between propene and Na-A zeolite has been investigated. On adsorption of carbon monoxide on Cu{I) containing Y zeolite, three different locations for the adsorbed CO have been observed. These experiments have been repeated for a variety of sample pretreatment conditions and the results used to explain the inconsistency in the scientific literature, where a range of v(C= 0) stretching frequencies have been pre sented by different authors. In essence, {{it has been shown that}} the sample pretreatment has a marked effect on this cation distribution within the zeolite, and hence on the number and intensity of CO bands that are observed, since each site has a characteristic carbonyl stretching frequency. Copper containing Y zeolites were also investigated through the adsorption of ammonia and the reduction of the Cu(II) form by CO and NH(_ 3). The rationale for this work was to attempt to better understand the reduction process. A study of ethyne adsorbed on ZnNa-A has revealed two adsorption sites within the framework. At one site C(_ 2) H(_ 2) was found to be weakly n-bonding to the Na cations. The second site was identified as the Zn cations, at which the C 2 H 2 was observed to lose hydrogen and form Zn-acetylide. The Zn-acetylide was observed to react slowly with zeolitic water to form <b>ethanal.</b> In separate studies <b>ethanal</b> was shown to be formed when C 2 H 2 was adsorbed on Ag-A zeolite but no chemical reaction was observed on the Na-A form. <b>Ethanal</b> adsorbed on some ion-exchanged type A zeolites (Zn, Na, Ag) has been observed to form complexes with the charge compensating cations and framework hydroxyl groups. On zeolite ZnNa-A three species were identified; a hydrogen bonding complex formed with the framework hydroxyl groups, and two coordinating complexes formed with the charge compensating cations; (one with the Na(I) ions and one with the Zn(II) ions). In contrast two complexes were found on Ag-A (one hydrogen bonding, the other with the Ag(^+) cation) and one on Na-A, formed with the Na(I) ions. When adsorbed <b>ethanal</b> was heated, under vacuum, on ZnNa-A and Na-A new species were formed. These were tentatively identified as carboxylate species. A study of ethene adsorbed on ZnNa-A has been made by infrared and inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy (INS). The IR measurements clearly showed the formation of a TT-bonded adsorption complex, by the observation of the formally inactive V 2 (C=C) stretching mode of ethene but no v(C-H) stretching vibrations were observed. In the INS data a number of vibrations of the adsorbed C(_ 2) H(_ 4) with respect to the surface were seen, as well as a weak broad band due to the v(C-H) stretching modes...|$|E

Six compounds tentatively identified are benzene, ethanol, butenal, 2 -heptenal, acetic acid and naphthodioxane. The first known mass spectrum of but- 2 -en- 1, 4 -dial is included...|$|E
