For example, by the eighteenth century, belief in witches had waned in the United Kingdom. Such things {{were thought to be}} the simple stories of foreigners, farmers, and superstitious Catholics. However art depicting supernatural subjects was very popular. John Runciman, {{as one of the first}} artists to use Shakespearean characters in his work, created an ink-on-paper drawing entitled The Three Witches in 1767–68. In it, three ancient figures are shown in close consultation, their <b>heads</b> <b>together</b> and their bodies unshown. Runciman's brother created another drawing of the witches called The Witches show Macbeth The Apparitions painted circa 1771–1772, portraying Macbeth's reaction to the power of the witches' conjured vision. Both brothers' work influenced many later artists by removing the characters from the familiar theatrical setting and placing them in the world of the story.|$|E

The Effectiveness {{of using}} Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together</b> (NHT) to Increase Students’ Reading Comprehension of Seventh Grade at Mts Aswaja Tunggangri. Thesis. English Education Department. Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Erna Iftanti SS.,M. Pd. Keyword: Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together</b> (NHT), Reading Comprehension Reading is one skill {{that is very}} {{important}} in implementing teaching and learning process at Junior High School level. However, many students have difficulties in learning English, especially reading comprehension. Reading comprehension means the ability to read the text, to understand the content of the text, and to get information from the text. Most of students feel that reading activity is burdensome and boring. Therefore, in this study, the researcher will try to apply Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together</b> (NHT). This technique is expected to solve the difficulty of students in reading comprehension. This research was conducted to answer the following problems of the research: 1) How is students’ reading comprehension score before being taught by applying Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together</b> (NHT) ? 2) How is students’ reading comprehension score after being taught by applying Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together</b> (NHT) ? 3) Is there any significant different score of the students’ before and after being taught by applying Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together</b> (NHT) ? This research was conducted by using quantitative approach with one group pre-test and post-test design. The research was conducted at MTs Aswaja Tunggangri. There were 22 students as the sample of study. The instrument of this study was test. The data was analyzed by using t-test. The result showed that the student’s score in reading before they are taught using Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together</b> (NHT) was 58. 86. While the students’score after they are taught using Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together</b> (NHT) was 77. 04. The tcount was 7. 286 and at the significant level of 0. 05 the score of ttable was 1. 721. It means that the score of t-test is higher than score of ttable. Thus, it can be conclude that Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together</b> (NHT) is effective to teach reading for Junior High School, especially at seventh grade...|$|R

Once the male has landed, the male assumes a position next to the female with their <b>heads</b> <b>together</b> and with their bodies aligned at a 45-degree angle. At this time, the male engages in a specific action called the wing clap display in which the male continuously claps its wings open and closed. During this time, the antennae of the female are placed between the opening and closing wings. After the male ceases wing movement, the male butterfly will move into a position that facilitates genital contact with the female. The average duration of the copulation process including the wing clap display is approximately 11 seconds.|$|E

On occasions when Superman did use physical force, he would take crooks out in a single karate-style chop or, if he happened to have two criminals in hand, banging their <b>heads</b> <b>together.</b> More often than not, the villains were likely to knock themselves out fleeing Superman.

Writing of this thesis aim to (1) increases motivation of learning at mathematics subject through study model of co-operative type NHT (Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together),</b> (2) by increasing motivation of student learning to lesson of mathematics expected at achievement or complete learnt student to increase. This research is qualitative research by using descriptive method as well as using research planning of action of class (PTK). To see motivation of student mathematics learning, data analyses done with analyzing equate result that do been given to research subject. Data analysis to see is complete learnt done with analyzing result of achievement test. Result of research before and after hit by study model NHT (Numbered <b>Head</b> <b>Together)</b> shows percentage of average of motivation of learning from fifth of element of motivation, that is seriously faces duty, resilient faces difficulty, enthusiasm, independence, love to look for and solves problem and self confidence to experience improvement.

The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to know is there any different or not in achievity the learning achievement in civic study basic completence Human Right Essence between Jigsaw method with strucktural numbered <b>head</b> <b>together.</b> This study uses experimental method to know student’s learning achievement from cognitive aspect. The population of this study are 7 th grade students in even semester of SMP N 2 Wuryantoro academic year 2009 / 2010. The sample consist of two classes, class VII C are the experimental class 1 for jigsaw method and class VII D for numbered <b>head</b> <b>together</b> method as the experimental class 2 chosen with random sampling. The main data of this study is the students learning achievement gained from cognitive aspect. Data analysis for hypothesis test is conducted by using t-test analysis of two sides. The result of the study can be conclude : there is different between learning achievement of civic study by using jigsaw method with learning achievement of civic study by using structural numbered <b>head</b> <b>together</b> method on cognitive aspect. The matter is showed through (tcount > ttable = 4, 744 > 1, 995). ...|$|R
