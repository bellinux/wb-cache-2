Geological Survey is evaluating the geologic and hydrologic characteristics of the ground-water system. The study area covers approximately 100, 000 square kilometers between lat 35 {degrees}N., long 115 {degrees}W and lat 38 {degrees}N., long 118 {degrees}W and encompasses the Death Valley regional <b>ground-water</b> flow system. <b>Hydrology</b> {{in the region is}} a result of both the and climatic conditions and the complex described as dominated by interbasinal flow and may be conceptualized as having two main components: a series of relatively shallow and localized flow paths that are superimposed on deeper regional flow paths. A significant component of the regional ground-water flow is through a thick Paleozoic carbonate rock sequence. Throughout the regional flow system, ground-water flow is probably controlled by extensive and prevalent structural features that result from regional faulting and fracturing. Hydrogeologic investigations over a large and hydrogeologically complex area impose severe demands on data management. This study utilized geographic information systems and geoscientific information systems to develop, store, manipulate, and analyze regional hydrogeologic data sets describing various components of the ground-water flow system...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{coastal area}} of northeastern Florida Bay, where it {{interfaces}} with the southeast portion of Everglades National Park, {{is of interest}} to water managers in ecological restoration, both inland and offshore. In order to represent the dynamic and interconnected surface-water and <b>ground-water</b> <b>hydrology</b> of this area, the US Geological Survey developed the Southern Inland and Coastal Systems (SICS) model by linking the two-dimensional dynamic surface-water model SWIFT 2 D with the variable-density ground-water flow model SEAWAT. Application of the coupled code to the SICS area has shown the capability of representing water-level fluctuations, leakage, discharge, salinity, and inundation patterns. In order to allow the SICS model to represent different water-supply scenarios, a further coupling with a regional model developed by the South Florida Water Management District and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers is underway. Surface water flows into the SICS area, simulated by the regional model for various water-supply scenarios, provide boundary conditions for simulations that lend detailed insight into the effects of modifying the larger scale hydrologic system.

40|$|This {{study of}} fossils (pollen, plant macrofossils, stomata and fish) and sediments (lithostratigraphy and geochemistry) from the Wendel site in North Dakota, USA, {{emphasizes}} the importance of considering <b>ground-water</b> <b>hydrology</b> when deciphering paleoclimate signals from lakes in postglacial landscapes. The Wendel site was a paleolake from about 11, 500 14 C yr BP to 11, 100 14 C yr BP. Afterwards, the lake-level lowered until it became a prairie marsh by 9, 300 14 C yr BP and finally, at 8, 500 14 C yr BP, an ephemeral wetland as it is today. Meanwhile, the vegetation changed from a white spruce parkland (11, 500 to 10, 500 14 C yr BP) to deciduous parkland, followed by grassland at 9, 300 14 C yr BP. The pattern and timing of these aquatic and terrestrial changes are similar to coeval kettle lake records from adjacent uplands, providing a regional aridity signal. However, two local sources of ground water were identified from the fossil and geochemical data, which mediated atmospheric inputs to the Wendel basin. First, the paleolake received water from the melting of stagnant ice buried under local till for about 900 years after glacier recession. Later, Holocene droughts probably caused the lower-elevation Wendel site to capture the ground water of upgradient lakes...|$|E
40|$|The geology and {{hydrology}} of the Basin and Range Province of {{the western}} conterminous United States are characterized {{in a series of}} data sets depicted in maps compiled for evaluation of prospective areas for further study of geohydrologic environments for isolation of high-level radioactive waste. The data sets include: (1) average precipitation and evaporation; (2) surface distribution of selected rock types; (3) tectonic conditions; and (4) surface- and <b>ground-water</b> <b>hydrology</b> and Pleistocene lakes and marshes. Rocks mapped for consideration as potential host media for the isolation of high-level radioactive waste are widespread and include argillaceous rocks, granitic rocks, tuffaceous rocks, mafic extrusive rocks, evaporites, and laharic breccias. The unsaturated zone, where probably as thick as 150 meters (500 feet), was mapped for consideration as an environment for isolation of high-level waste. Unsaturated rocks of various lithologic types are widespread in the Province. Tectonic stability in the Quaternary Period is considered the key to assessing the probability of future tectonism with regard to high-level radioactive waste disposal. Tectonic conditions are characterized {{on the basis of the}} seismic record, heat-flow measurements, the occurrence of Quaternary faults, vertical crustal movement, and volcanic features. Tectonic activity, as indicated by seismicity, is greatest in areas bordering the western margin of the Province in Nevada and southern California, the eastern margin of the Province bordering the Wasatch Mountains in Utah and in parts of the Rio Grande valley. Late Cenozoic volcanic activity is widespread, being greatest bordering the Sierra Nevada in California and Oregon, and bordering the Wasatch Mountains in southern Utah and Idaho. 43 refs., 22 figs...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the cause-effect relationship of a free water table aquifer that changes laterally to an artesian aquifer was made for regions bounded internally by a circular cylinder. For a hydrologic system with a large pressure-head energy, development of the water resource by a single well {{is not the most}} practical approach and thus the study was extended {{to solve the problem of}} a line array of wells. The flow characteristic of the hydrologic system was divided into a regime of flow near the line array of wells which is titled the conduit regime, and a regime of flow distant from the line array, which is called the reservoir regime. This classification of flow type is based on the fact that the storage coefficient is not constant and accordingly the hydraulic diffusivity of the aquifer in the conduit region is much smaller than that in the reservoir region. Therefore, the mathematical continuity, which was assumed in previous analyses by other authors becomes discontinuous because linearity does not prevail throughout the flow system. The superposition principle, which is based on linearity and homogeneity, can not be applied to this non-linear system. By subdividing the flow system into the two regimes of conduit and reservoir, Carslaw's solution for the circular cylinder may be amplified by two integrations to achieve mathematical continuity of the whole system. The range that Goldenberg solved analytically for a similar problem was extended to meet practical requirements in the field of <b>ground-water</b> <b>hydrology.</b> A new approach was developed for the solution of the mutual interference problem of an infinite line array of wells. The interference is expressed in terms of what is called the discharge efficiency factor. The findings were applied to a hydrologic {{analysis of}} the ground-water resources of the Western Desert, U. A. R. (Egypt) in or der to describe its significance and importance in the design of systems for water resources development in extensive aquifers. The results aid also in defining the applicability limits of the theory of images, which has been used by several authors to solve for the interference problem of an infinite line array of wells...|$|E

Several deep geothermal wells drilled into the lower rift have confirmed the presence of high temperatures and of an active hydrothemeral system associated with the rift. The maximum temperatures encountered in the deep wells approach the critical point of water (374 C) but show a sharp decline on the southern boundary of the rift. Petrologic studies of drill cuttings from the deep geothermal wells have shown that intermittent, intense geothermal alteration has occured to depths of at least 2. 5 km. The alteration phases present indicate that metmorphism reaches the greenschist facies and have strong similarities to suites found in midocean-ridge hydrothermal systems.

40|$|The Niobrara River of Nebraska is a geologically, ecologically, and {{economically}} significant resource. The State of Nebraska has {{recognized the need}} to better manage the surface- and ground-water resources of the Niobrara River so they are sustainable in the long term. In cooperation with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, the U. S. Geological Survey is investigating the hydrogeomorphic settings and hydraulic geometry of the Niobrara River to assist in characterizing the types of broad-scale physical habitat attributes that may be of importance to the ecological resources of the river system. This report includes an inventory of surface-water and <b>ground-water</b> <b>hydrology</b> data, surface water-quality data, a longitudinal geomorphic segmentation and characterization of the main channel and its valley, and hydraulic geometry relations for the 330 -mile section of the Niobrara River from Dun¬lap Diversion Dam in western Nebraska to the Missouri River confluence. Hydraulic microhabitats also were analyzed using available data from discharge measurements to demonstrate the potential application of these data and analysis methods. The main channel of the Niobrara was partitioned into three distinct fluvial geomorphic provinces: an upper province characterized by open valleys and a sinuous, equiwidth channel; a central province characterized by mixed valley and channel settings, including several entrenched canyon reaches; and a lower province where the valley is wide, yet restricted, but the river also is wide and persistently braided. Within the three fluvial geomorphic provinces, 36 geomorphic segments were identified using a customized, process-orientated classification scheme, which described the basic physical characteristics of the Niobrara River and its valley. Analysis of the longitudinal slope characteristics indicated that the Niobrara River longitudinal profile may be largely bedrock-controlled, with slope inflections co-located at changes in bedrock type at river level. Hydraulic geometry relations indicated that local (at-a-station) channel adjustments of the Niobrara River to changing discharge are accommodated mainly by changes in velocity, and streamwise adjustments are accommodated through changes in channel width. Downstream hydraulic geometry relations are in general agreement with values previously published for rivers of the Great Plains, but coefficients are likely skewed low because the locations of the streamflow-gaging stations used in this analysis are located at natural or engineered constrictions and may not be accurately representing downstream adjustment processes of the Niobrara River. A demonstration analysis of hydraulic microhabitat attributes at a single station indicated that changes in velocity-related habitat types is the primary microhabitat adjustment over a range of discharges, but the magnitude of that adjustment for any particular discharge is temporally variable...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} two {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for the measurement of both the magnitude and the direction of ground-water flow under some natural gradient. These have the advantage that in spite of being single well techniques; {{it is not necessary to}} radio-active tracers for direction measurements. Consequently no health hazards, no costly equipment and, therefore, no foreign exchange component is involved in their operation. Both these component is involved I n their operation. Both these techniques have been published in the international journal of repute viz: journal of hydrology (Netherlands) in its different issues (see references). In the first technique, the ground-water flow has been considered as a vector quantity, consequently by introducing another vector quantity, of known magnitude and direction, both the direction as well as the magnitude of the un-known vector quantity can be easily determined. The new known vector quantity, in <b>ground-water</b> <b>hydrology,</b> can be introduced by installing a small pumped well in the vicinity of an observation well (hence forth called master well). All flow measurements are carried out in this master well when the tubewell is in operation and when it is not in operation. A non radio-active solution of potassium bromide is injected in the master well at horizon where flow measurements are desired. Dilution of this tracer (potassium bromide) takes place due to the ground-water flow. The dilution rates are computed by measuring, at different time intervals, the electrical conductivities (reciprocal of resistances) by using a wheat-stone bridge arrangement energized with low voltage alternating current. Using the mathematical formulae developed in this thesis and the data so collected the magnitude of the ground-water flow can be easily determined. After this the tubewell is started at a discharge such that the velocity, due to pump age, introduced at the master well is in comparison to the velocity of the ground-water flow already measured. The magnitude of the resultant is again determined in the same master well in the some manner as for the case of ground-water flow in the absence of the tubewell. These observations help in determining the direction of the flow of ground-water. Instead of one discrete direction of flow, the mathematical formulae give four directions of flow. For further differentiation among these four directions, to get the true direction of flow, a simple experiment in also described. In the second technique, which strictly a single well technique, no additional tubewell is required. All flow measurements are carried out in the same observation well both for determining the magnitude as well as direction of flow and no radio-active tracers are needed. The observation well, this time, is specially prepared, over short lengths, at those horizons where flow measurements are required. The remaining length of the bore is quite identical with that used in the previous technique. Thus at the selected points, the well screen, instead of being uniformly perforated (slotted) all round, is such that it is slotted over 180 o while the remaining half is all blind. The dilution rates of the injected salt, if computed in this type of bore hole, are a function of the relative orientation of the slotted segment with respect to the direction flow which can, therefore, be easily determined. Apart from the measurement of magnitude and direction of flow, the formulas developed in this thesis have also practical side applications in determining (1) seepage losses from big irrigation channels and (2) the rate and amount of incrustation in tubewells at different horizons. Apart from these two applications, it is also possible to determine the permeability coefficient of a complicated strainer material like coir string (coco-nut fibre string). A strainer prepared with such a has a permeability which cannot ordinarily be determined. The reason being that apart from the fine slits of irregular widths between two consecutive string windings, the string in itself is porous, the measurement of these strainer permeabilities are necessary to determine the head loss through the strainer. This head loss has a great impact on the incrustation of the strainer. Both the formulae as well as the technique for determining these permeabilities are also described in this thesis...|$|E
