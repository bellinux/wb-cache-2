As soon as they finished their turn, one of them began to shoot at my leader. I opened fire against the trailing airplane and I saw shell strikes all over the aircraft. I watched that suddenly it went upwards turning, and his leader after him.Right then, ahead of me from the left went by tracers. I looked to the left and saw that 300 meters behind at the left were two Focke-Wulfs. They shoot right at me, and the tracers of their aircraft get closer and closer to my airplane. What should I do? To climb was impossible, because there were two more Focke-Wulfs. Immediately broke to the left, underneath the tracers. I dove ...Many years later, while I described this episode to a journalist friend of mine, {{he told me that he}} saw in German memoirs a report of the leader of that Schwarm. ... After the combat with me, while returning home, one of his pilots, because of unexplainable reasons, got into a dive and crashed into the ground. I realized that one of the shells of my cannons hit the pilot's cockpit and wounded the pilot, who because of the loss of blood fainted and crashed to his death.|$|E

The use of micro-hetero structured fuel, generically called “cer-liq-mesh” will further improve burnup up to 90 %. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>it</b> has typically large dimensions, being heavy to be transported in space, in a single piece, but because it will deliver energy in hundreds MW level for about 100 years per charge using natural Uranium or Thorium as fuel available on the planet's surface, and because it can be assembled locally becomes a very attractive option for self sustainable power cycles. The “cer-liq-mesh” fuel based singular wave reactor is smaller, less than ¼ from the size of “Candle” reactor, and has a very high burnup reducing the fuel cycle drastically. It can be transported by parts, with extremely small probability of over-unity criticality accident and be assembled to run on the surface. This represents a better option for extraterrestrial applications; <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>it</b> requires a more complicated fuel fabrication that pays back in a simplified fuel cycle and minimum waste...|$|E
40|$|In Textile production, {{measurement}} of the yarn mass in 1 mm range is utmost importance to properly evaluate the evenness, as several irregularities occur in 1 to 4 mm yarn length. Until present, measurements in 1 mm range are still not directly performed. In this paper we present a direct mass measurement in 1 mm range based on capacitive sensors and signal processing techniques. The results {{point out that the}} evaluation of yarn mass, with this approach, is feasible in the 1 mm range. The new approach allows on-line measurement (1 mm yarn mass) in a spinning frame for real-time control. Several Digital Signal Processing techniques are used to improve the results. A value of capacity variation is close to 2, 08 E- 17 F for a 57 tex (0, 057 g/m) yarn. It is possible, with this equipment, to detect small variations but signal to noise ratio (SNR) is still low. With the current electronic conditioning it is possible to detect these variation <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>it</b> is in microvolt range. As a spin-off the developed sensor is being used in knitting machines to control the yarn break and bobbin end...|$|E

Gossip, affect, and bodily experience are all knowledges and ways of knowing that have been feminized are therefore frequently devalued and derided in scholarship and practice. The form, content, and tone of these papers are used to make an argument for the value of gossip as a discursive practice. This article contributes to the growing literature in archival studies on conceptualizing and contending with human experiences—especially affects, sex, and bodily experiences—that challenge, defy, and problematize archival capture, theory, and practice asserting that gossip should be deployed as vital source in this larger project...|$|E
40|$|Power {{analysis}} is {{a branch of}} side channel attacks where power consumption data is used as the side channel to attack the system. First using a device like an oscilloscope power traces are collected when the cryptographic device is doing the cryptographic operation. Then those traces are statistically analysed using methods such as Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) to derive the secret key of the system. Being possible to break Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in few minutes, power analysis attacks have become a serious security issue for cryptographic devices such as smart card. As {{the first phase of}} our project, we build a testbed for doing research on power analysis attacks. As power {{analysis is}} a practical type of attack in order to do any research, a testbed is the first requirement. Since building a test bed is a complicated process, having a pre-built testbed would save the time of future researchers. The second phase of our project is to attack the latest cryptographic algorithm called Speck which has been released by National Security Agency (NSA) for use in embedded systems. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>it</b> has lot of differences to AES making impossible to directly use the power analysis approach used for AES, we introduce novel approaches to break Speck in less than an hour. In the third phase of the project, we select few already introduced countermeasures and practically attack them on our testbed to do a comparative analysis. We show that software countermeasures such as random instruction injection and randomly shuffling S-boxes are good enough for their simplicity and cost. But we identify the possible threat due to the problem of generating a good seed for the pseudo-random algorithm running on the microcontroller. We attempt to address this issue by using a hardware-based true random generator that amplifies a random electrical signal and samples to generate a proper seed...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The old convent site of MBH located {{related in}} the center of Lisbon city. This place is the nucleus point, from an Urbanistic point of view, of the city and from there we can connect all other regions of Lisbon, meaning from there we can send “Octopus arms” as to Baixa, Bairro Alto, Saldanha, S. Joao, Beato and more. Today this {{important}} location is closed and isolated by a wall. <b>In</b> <b>spite,</b> <b>it</b> is in the city center and we are passing through it frequently, almost nobody is going there or passing through this place, just as a middle age fortress. We don’t even pay attention on how uncomfortable and damaged this isolated and closed location surrounded by walls does to Lisbon city by opening her “borders” and becoming big modern integrative metropole. Another problem we are dealing with is the entrance to Miguel Bombard area, climbing there through all the small streets until the entrance is an interesting experience for us. But the main and “only” entrance is from the south part of the convent, which keeps the other parts of the city isolated without any access to north or east. In fact, we do have other two accesses but they are not active, one is from the East side, R. Gomes Freire, have stairs inside the wall, which with R. Donna Estefania is important junction to {{the right side of the}} hills, means right side from Av. Liberdade. Probably this Gog and Magog war is important to create new order for better world, new borders, new and better priorities as Ecological problem we have to solve before we have no earth to fight for, or Global warming, science and education. New society which each one follow his own belief while others respect him and let him live according to his belief, when no one is trying to force you or brainwash others to follow him in the name of God or any other idea. A society when following your religious is something you do on your extra time, kind of a hobby and not the main reason of living and life. Having the 3 majority religious under one roof can be a good starting point to avoid Gog and Magog war, it will an opportunity to see what others are doing and at the end to see that we are all care and want and wish for the same things and values. We all want being respected, to love and be loved, to live with dignity, to bring food to our family and more and above all to see that we all pray to the same “God” to the same idea and sharing the same belief and hope. According to Urbanism point of view, we need to find a solution how to open the walls, to create an access to MB inside and outside, how to integrate MB which located in the city center with other part of city and make it growing and wanted and popular area for citizens, to making them want to pass by, visit, living in MB site and surround it to make it an organic integrate location or even I might say new vibrant neighborhood in Lisbon between the 2 main hills but on the other hand in the existences building to keep the tradition and the history but will transfer it functional living area by doing residential dormitories for students from all over the world, Bio food market, to keep the tradition and the beauty of MB as historical and architectural part of the city. The project should integrate between the old and new part of Lisbon. Such a project could be the beginning of SOHO of Lisbon, The nucleus point of the city. When we are checking the radius of the area in relative to the all-city we can city how central it is. I want the Project to be “outside the wall” by preserve the convent morphology, the existence buildings and the walls but on the other hand open it to public, to make it direct path with other parts of the city. International religious center will bring new people to the area from all over the world. There will be research department, events, conferences and the area will open their walls, gates, to the citizens of Portugal. N/...|$|E
