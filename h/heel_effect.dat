50|$|Diagnostic X-ray beams can be {{collimated}} {{to large}} or small beams. A large beam will emit more intensities of the beam along the cathode-anode axis than a small beam. A large image receptor will also capture more of this beam than a small receptor. Both of these factors will greatly influence the visibility of the anode <b>heel</b> <b>effect.</b> A smaller field size results in a less pronounced <b>heel</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sailing yachts, {{especially}} racing yachts, {{are designed}} to be stiff, meaning the distance between the centre of mass and the metacentre is very large in order to resist the <b>heeling</b> <b>effect</b> of the wind on the sails. In such vessels, the rolling motion is not uncomfortable because of the moment of inertia of the tall mast and the aerodynamic damping of the sails.|$|R
5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the <b>heeling</b> <b>effect</b> of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|R

50|$|In X-ray tubes, the <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> or more accurately, the anode <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> is a {{variation}} of the intensity of X-rays emitted by the anode depending on the direction of emission. Due to the geometry of the anode, X-rays emitted towards the cathode are in general more intense than those emitted perpendicular to the cathode-anode axis. The effect stems from the absorption of X-ray photons before they leave the anode in which they are produced. The probability of absorption depends on the distance the photons travel within the anode material, which in turn depends on the direction of emission.|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} from the anode (source of X-rays) to the image receptor greatly influences the apparent magnitude of the anode <b>heel</b> <b>effect.</b> The shorter the distance, the less space the beam has to diverge. The effect is less noticeable at larger source-image distances (SID).|$|E
50|$|When {{the angle}} of the anode is great, the usable X-ray photons will not have to travel through as much of the anode {{material}} to exit the tube. This results in a much less apparent anode <b>heel</b> <b>effect,</b> though the effective focal spot size is increased.|$|E

50|$|Almost {{all modern}} {{diagnostic}} x-ray machines exhibit the <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> to some degree. Its effect on images is mostly avoided through consideration of patient positioning. For example, when imaging a foot which is thicker at the ankle end than the toes, the toes should be positioned towards the anode and the ankle towards the cathode.|$|E
50|$|In general, an X-ray's beam {{intensity}} is not uniform. When it focuses to a target, a conical shape appears. The {{intensity of the}} positive anode {{is lower than the}} intensity of the negative cathode. Because intensities are different, a visible difference in the picture is produced; this effect is called the <b>heel</b> <b>effect.</b> The heat problem produced by the anode is solved by rotation of the anode up to 10,000 rpm. This rotation also increases the total area.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{discusses}} the development challenges of an offshore fluvial oil reservoir with horizontal wells. In highly productive sandstone reservoirs, horizontal wells suffer from uneven flow profile and subsequent premature coning effects because of sand heterogeneity and <b>heel</b> to toe <b>effect.</b> Moreover, excessively increasing {{the production rate}} or horizontal well length can {{increase the risk of}} limited sweep efficiency, resulting in remaining oil in the toe or poor sand with low permeability. First, we analyze the characters of fluvial oil reservoir focusing on sand architecture and heterogeneity. Second, the sweep efficiency was calculated by the production data. Finally, we optimize inflow control device (ICD) for several wells and compare the response of ICD wells with conventional screen completion wells.|$|R

The study shows that righting moment increase nonlinearly with heeling angle, and endplates enhance the righting. The asymmetric aerodynamic distribution along span of wing with heeling angle introduces adverse yaw moment. <b>Heeling</b> in ground <b>effect</b> with small ground clearance increases the vertical aerodynamic force and makes WIG craft climb.

Male and female participants viewed two photographs of the same woman’s body profile; the woman wore high heels in the one and flat heels in the other, although her shoes and feet were not visible. Participants were asked to select one photograph of the woman on several dimensions of body attractiveness. A significant greater number of male and female participants selected the target with high heels as the sexier, the prettier, and the more elegant, with the more attractive legs and buttocks. The same target was also perceived as the younger person and the photograph that would be preferred by others and the more appropriate for a photo album. The findings support the assumption that high heels could act as secondary sexual characteristics that increase the attractiveness of women to men.|$|R

AimIn this study, {{the effect of}} anode angle on photon beam spectra, depth dose and photon fluence per initial electron was studied for a commercial orthovoltage unit of X-RAD 320 biological irradiator. Materials and methodsThe MCNPX MC code was used for modeling in the current study. We used the Monte Carlo method to model the X-RAD 320 X-ray unit based on the manufacturer provided information. The MC model was validated by comparing the MC calculated photon beam spectra {{with the results of}} SpekCalc software. The photon beam spectra were calculated for anode angles from 15 to 35 degrees. We also calculated the percentage depth doses for some angles to verify the impact of anode angle on depth dose. Additionally, the <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> and its relation with anode angle were studied for X-RAD 320 irradiator. ResultsOur results showed that the photon beam spectra and their mean energy are changed significantly with anode angle and the optimum anode angle of 30 degrees was selected based on less <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> and appropriate depth dose and photon fluence per initial electron. ConclusionIt can be concluded that the anode angle of 30 degrees for X-RAD 320 unit used by manufacturer has been selected properly considering the <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> and dosimetric properties...|$|E
40|$|Gain {{calibration}} for X-ray imaging {{systems with}} a movable flat panel detector and an intrinsic crosshair {{is a challenge}} due to the geometry-dependent <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> and crosshair artifact. This study aims to develop a gain correction method for such system by implementing the Multi-Acquisition Gain Image Correction technique. Flood field images containing crosshair and <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> were acquired in 4 different flat panel detector positions at fixed exposure parameters. The crosshair region was automatically detected using common image processing algorithms and removed by a simple interpolation procedure, resulting in a crosshair-removed image. A large kernel-based correction was then used to remove the <b>heel</b> <b>effect.</b> Mask filters corresponding to each crosshair region were applied to the resultant heel effect-removed images to invalidate the pixels of the original crosshair region. Finally, a seamless gain map was composed with corresponding valid pixels from the processed images either by the sequential replacement or by the selective averaging techniques developed in this study. Quantitative evaluation was performed based on normalized noise power spectrum and detective quantum efficiency improvement factor for the flood field images corrected by the Multi-Acquisition Gain Image Correction-based gain maps. For comparison purpose, a single crosshair-removed gain map was also tested. As a result, it was demonstrated that the Multi-Acquisition Gain Image Correction technique achieved better image quality than the crosshair-removed technique, showing lower normalized noise power spectrum values over most of spatial frequencies. The improvement was more obvious at the priori-crosshair region of the gain map. The mean detective quantum efficienc...|$|E
40|$|The most {{significant}} radiation field nonuniformity is the well-known <b>Heel</b> <b>effect.</b> This nonuniform beam effect {{has a negative}} influence {{on the results of}} computer-aided diagnosis of mammograms, which is frequently used for early cancer detection. This paper presents a method to correct all pixels in the mammography image according to the excess or lack on radiation to which these have been submitted {{as a result of the}} this effect. The current simulation method calculates the intensities at all points of the image plane. In the simulated image, the percentage of radiation received by all the points takes the center of the field as reference. In the digitized mammography, the percentages of the optical density of all the pixels of the analyzed image are also calculated. The <b>Heel</b> <b>effect</b> causes a Gaussian distribution around the anode–cathode axis and a logarithmic distribution parallel to this axis. Those characteristic distributions are used to determine the center of the radiation field as well as the cathode–anode axis, allowing for the automatic determination of the correlation between these two sets of data. The measurements obtained with our proposed method differs on average by 2. 49  mm in the direction perpendicular to the anode–cathode axis and 2. 02  mm parallel to the anode–cathode axis of commercial equipment. The method eliminates around 94 % of the <b>Heel</b> <b>effect</b> in the radiological image and the objects will reflect their x-ray absorption. To evaluate this method, experimental data was taken from known objects, but could also be done with clinical and digital images...|$|E
40|$|One kind {{of therapy}} for the {{treating}} of the acute laminitis in horses {{has been discussed}} elevating the heel of the horse to avoid {{the rotation of the}} third phalanx. Because of the bad influence of the prognosis, horses with laminitis are treated with an artificial elevating of the <b>heel.</b> The <b>effects</b> of that elevation were the aim of that work, trying to make conclusions about that subject. In the first part of that work I present a historical summary of the different hoof pressure measurement techniques and a short introduction in the basics of physics and dynamics. An overview of acute laminitis follows presenting a retrospective of know-how and possibilities of treatment. This work is divided into two parts, one measuring the hoof pressures under flat feet and one under feet which were elevated in the heel region. Two groups were created, one defined as the static group (prepared legs measured in a special pressure machine) and the other defined as the dynamic group (horses, which were measured in standing position). Each measurement had to be repeated three times and those three results were averaged, because of the hazard error of the measurement technic. 30 legs were used for the static component and 30 horses for the dynamic component. The aim of that work was to get informations about the hoof pressures (in kN) under all 4 receptors (together) and under each receptor (each quadrand of the sole) and to draw conclusions about them. Further, the percentage of body weight or hoof pressure repartition under each receptor and for different axis (lateral/medial, dorsal/palmar) had to be calculated.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of initial resting posture on range of motion of the lumbar spine in 18 normal subjects. Subjects resting posture and active range of motion was measured using the CA- 6000 Spinal Motion Analyser (OSI, USA) in five test positions, namely in flat standing and with a variety of heel raises. Analysis showed that there was no significant correlation between subject's normal resting posture and active range of motion. However, when subjects resting posture was artificially altered with <b>heel</b> raises, significant <b>effects</b> on the active range of motion were demonstrated. Increasing heel height significantly influenced resting posture in the sagittal plane only. As heel height increased, the lumbar lordosis decreased and a significant reduction in the range of lumbar spine flexion (P< 0. 001) was observed. Simulating pelvic asymmetry influenced resting posture in the frontal plane and significant effects on the range of lateral flexion (P< 0. 05) were observed. These results have important clinical implications in terms of using range of motion of the lumbar spine as an examination tool and suggest that studies using range of motion as an outcome measure should consider initial resting posture...|$|R
40|$|The current Canadian {{regulations}} for fishing vessel stability meet the accepted international standards for fishing boats {{provided by the}} International Maritime Organization (IMO, 1993). However, the geometric proportions of Canadian boats, especially in Newfoundland, are extreme, with very wide beams and very high decks.

The intention of this research was to compare the effectiveness of the current hydrostatic assessment of fishing vessel stability against more realistic cases by including the dynamics of the vessel in waves. The analysis was carried out using a computer code for predicting ship motions, up to and including a capsize. The results of the analysis showed that the value of righting arm (GZ) at 40 degrees of <b>heel</b> had an <b>effect</b> on the vessels ability to survive in waves. Vessels that met the requirements of STAB 4 but had the lowest values of GZ from 30 to 40 degrees heel were predicted to capsize in lower waves than vessels with high values of GZ in the same range. Other factors that affected survivability were the amount of superstructure fitted to the ship and the steepness of the waves. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: X-ray imaging is an {{important}} part of medicine and plays a crucial role in radiotherapy. Education in this field is mostly limited to textbook teaching due to equipment restrictions. A novel simulation tool, ImaSim, for teaching the fundamentals of the x-ray imaging process based on ray-tracing is presented in this work. ImaSim is used interactively via a graphical user interface (GUI). Materials and methods: The software package covers the main x-ray based medical modalities: planar kilo voltage (kV), planar (portal) mega voltage (MV), fan beam computed tomography (CT) and cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging. The user can modify the photon source, object to be imaged and imaging setup with three-dimensional editors. Objects are currently obtained by combining blocks with variable shapes. The imaging of three-dimensional voxelized geometries is currently not implemented, but can be added in a later release. The program follows a ray-tracing approach, ignoring photon scatter in its current implementation. Simulations of a phantom CT scan were generated in ImaSim and were compared to measured data in terms of CT number accuracy. Spatial variations in the photon fluence and mean energy from an x-ray tube caused by the <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> were estimated from ImaSim and Monte Carlo simulations and compared. Results: In this paper we describe ImaSim and provide two examples of its capabilities. CT numbers were found to agree within 36 Hounsfield Units (HU) for bone, which corresponds to a 2 % attenuation coefficient difference. ImaSim reproduced the <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> reasonably well when compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Discussion: An x-ray imaging simulation tool is made available for teaching and research purposes. ImaSim provides a means to facilitate the teaching of medical x-ray imaging...|$|E
40|$|X-rays {{produced}} in X-ray tubes originate from a focal {{spot on the}} target material. This spot is not infinitely small, but has a finite size. This finite size of the spot will affect the radiographic projections taken during X-ray Compted tomography.

This can be done by modelling a two dimensional profile of the spot and use this model to convolve the simulated radiographic projections simulated with an infinitely small spot size. A second effect, the <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> that originates in directional X-ray tubes will also have an influence on the final projections.

An ion chamber and a solid state detector were used to measure scattered radiation and primary beam profile.

40|$|Confinement of {{the heel}} {{due to the}} counter of the shoe is {{believed}} to influence heel pad biomechanics. Using a two-dimensional finite element model of the heel pad and shoe during a simulation of static standing, {{the aim of this}} study was to quantify the potential effect of confinement on internal heel pad stress. Non-weightbearing MRI and weightbearing MRI with plantar pressure and ground reaction force data were recorded for a single subject. The non-weightbearing MRI was used to create two FE models of the heel pad, using either homogeneous or composite material properties. The composite model included a distinction in material properties between fat pad and skin. Vertical and medial-lateral forces, as measured on the subject's heel, were applied to the models and vertical compressive strains for both models were comparable with those observed by weightbearing MRI. However, only for the composite model was the predicted plantar pressure distribution comparable with measured data. The composite model was therefore used in further analyses. In this composite model, the internal stresses were located mainly in the skin and were predominantly tensile in nature, whereas the stress state in the fat pad approached hydrostatic conditions. A representation of a running shoe, including an insole, midsole and heel counter was then added to the composite heel pad to form the shod model. In order to investigate the counter effect, the load was applied to the shod model with and without the <b>heel</b> counter. The <b>effect</b> of the counter on peak stress was to elevate compression (0 - 50 %), reduce tension (22 - 34 %) and reduce shear (22 - 28 %) in the skin. In addition, the counter reduced both compressive (20 - 40 %) and shear (58 - 80 %) stress in the fat pad and tension in the fat pad remained negligible. Taken together the results indicate that a well-fitted counter works in sympathy with the internal structure of the heel pad and could be an effective reducer of heel pad stress. However, further research needs to be undertaken to assess the long-term effects on the soft-tissues, practicalities of achieving good fit and behavior under dynamic events...|$|R

Half value layer (HVL) measurements were conducted to specify protocol-specific energy spectra. Air kerma measurements were carried out with an ionisation chamber positioned against the X-ray tube to obtain the total filtration attenuation characteristics. The framework is applicable to bowtie and non-bowtie inherent filtrations, and it accounts for the anode <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> and the total filtration of the tube housing. The code was adjusted to the Promax 3 D Max (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) dental CBCT scanner. For each clinical protocol, calibration factors were produced to allow absolute MC dose calculations.

Methods: A 6 -cm 3 ionization chamber was placed at 5 -cm intervals of 225 locations in a 70 × 70 cm 2 x-ray beam field. The chamber was placed {{at a level of}} 30 cm above the x-ray table to measure the air kerma intensity of the x-ray output across the whole area. Three different brands of radiographic units with different anode target angles and at different tube aging stages were studied. The same exposure parameters were used for each location, and measurements were made for three different tube potentials at 60, 85, and 110 kilovoltage peaks (kV[p]). Results: At the tube potential of 85 kV(p), the relative maximum percentage differences on the average air kerma measured along the central anode-cathode axis (x-axis) of the x-ray tube were found to be 31. 5 %, 15. 5 %, and 43. 1 % more at the cathode ends than those at the anode ends of the three radiographic units. Results of a paired samples t test (confidence intervals at 95 %, two-tailed) on three of the four fixed pair-wise sampling points along the x-axis were found to be statistically significant in their relative percentage differences in air kerma intensity with respect to the central point (labeled as 35 cm) with a P value ≤. 03. However, those measured at four fixed pair-wise points at 90 ° across the anode-cathode direction were all found to be statistically nonsignificant (P ≥. 29). Similar trends were observed for the other two tube potentials tested. From the three-dimensional displays of radiation output intensity, a similar unique pyramidal shape pattern with a skewed peak toward the cathode end was observed for all three diagnostic x-ray tubes tested.

A double exposure technique using X-rays is performed in therapeutic radiology; it is difficult to use in a diagnostic examination because of the <b>heel</b> <b>effect.</b> Therefore, it is suggested that ultraviolet (UV) rays be substituted for X-rays.

40|$|The main aim of {{the breast}} {{screening}} programme (BSP) is to provide early detection of breast lesions permitting efficient treatment. At present the BSP is technically run using conventional screen film (S/F) X-ray mammography, which suffers {{from a number of}} inherent limitations. Most of these limitations could be overcome by the use of digital mammography technology. Such a technology has to, however, show image performance that is as good as or better than that for S/F systems. The performance of a digital mammography system can be quantified and compared {{in a number of different}} ways. These include contrast detail and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) measurements. In practice, various limitations and problems have, however, become apparent in applying these measurements. For the CNR measurements the main problems are the presence of the uncorrected <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> and the effect of the size of region of interest (ROI). The contrast detail analysis, using human observers, is time consuming and suffers from the presence of significant inter-observer error. These can be solved by using an "automatic observer". One limitation of using the automated approach is that the relationship between automated and human observer scoring was not fully explored across the wide variety of systems and circumstances encountered in practice. An alternative approach would be to predict contrast detail response from measurements of modulation transfer function (MTF) and detection quantum efficiency (DQE) using a model of the imaging process. In this thesis, the procedure of measuring CNR was revised and the use of an automatic approach for contrast detail measurements was further examined, using different modalities of digital mammography. The contrast detail performance was then analysed across a range of doses for a wide range of clinically used digital mammography systems, using the human results predicted from the automated measurements. MTF and DQE were also measured for the detectors used in these systems. A simple signal-matched noise-integration model was then adopted to theoretically predict the contrast detail response of these systems. The most remarkable findings of this thesis are as follows: the use of multiple small ROIs led to CNR results that were essentially the same as if a <b>heel</b> <b>effect</b> correction had been applied; the automated measurements can be used to predict the threshold contrast for a typical observer; an encouragingly good level of agreement was found between the experimental contrast detail data and theoretical predictions. Finally, image performance of promising hybrid pixel semiconductor detectors, not commercially available, was also evaluated with the aid of Monte Carlo simulation, for application to digital mammography...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{increase}} in sea surface temperature and ocean acidification raises major {{concerns about the}} evolution of the coral calcification rate. Digitized X-radiographs have been used for coral skeleton density measurements since the 1980 s. The main limitation of coral densitometry from digitized X-radiographs is the X-ray intensity heterogeneity due to spherical spreading (inverse square law) and <b>heel</b> <b>effect.</b> Until now, extra X-ray images or aluminum standards have been used to correct X-radiographs. However, such corrective methods may be constraining when working with a high number of coral samples. Here, we present an inexpensive, straightforward, and accurate digital detrending (DD) method to correct the heterogeneities of the X-ray irradiation that affect X-radiographs. The X-radiograph is corrected against the irradiation imprint recorded by its own background using a kriging interpolation method, thus allowing reliable optical density measurements directly on the corrected X-ray image. This digital detrending (DD) method was validated using skeletal bulk density measurements and computerized tomography (CT). Coral densitometry using DD corrected X-radiographs does not require the destruction of the coral sample and provides high-resolution measurements. Since DD does not require extra aluminum standards to correct X-radiographs, this method optimizes the working space available on the X-ray image. Moreover, it corrects the entire X-radiograph, thus larger samples or numerous samples can be X-rayed at the same time...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{quantitative}} potential of breast tomosynthesis by estimating the percent density of voxelized anthropomorphic breast phantoms. Methods and Materials: A Siemens breast tomosynthesis system was modeled using Monte Carlo methods and a voxelized anthropomorphic breast phantom. The images {{generated by the}} simulation were reconstructed using Siemens filtered back-projection software. The non-uniform background due to scatter, <b>heel</b> <b>effect,</b> and limited angular sampling was estimated by simulating and subtracting images of a uniform 100 % fatty breast phantom. To estimate the density of each slice, {{the total number of}} fatty and glandular voxels was calculated both before and after applying a thresholding algorithm to classify voxels as fat vs. glandular. Finally, the estimated density of the reconstructed slice was compared to the known percent density of the corresponding slice from the voxelized phantom. This percent density estimation comparison was done for a 35 %- and a 60 %-dense 5 cm breast phantom. Results: Without thresholding, overall density estimation errors for the central eleven slices were 4. 97 % and 2. 55 % for the 35 % and 60 % dense phantoms, respectively. After thresholding to classify voxels as fat vs. glandular, errors for central eleven were 7. 99 % and 6. 26 %, respectively. Voxel to voxel matching of the phantom vs. reconstructed slice demonstrated 75. 69 % and 75. 25 % respectively of voxels were correctly classified. Conclusion: The errors in slice density estimation were Thesi...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} method {{to calculate the}} primary and scattered x-ray photon fluence component of a mammographic image. This {{can be used for}} a range of clinically important purposes, including estimation of breast density, personalized image display, and quantitative mammogram analysis. The method is based on models of: the x-ray tube; the digital detector; and a novel ray tracer which models the diverging beam emanating from the focal spot. The tube model includes consideration of the anode <b>heel</b> <b>effect,</b> and empirical corrections for wear and manufacturing tolerances. The detector model is empirical, being based on a family of transfer functions that cover the range of beam qualities and compressed breast thicknesses which are encountered clinically. The scatter estimation utilizes optimal information sampling and interpolation (to yield a clinical usable computation time) of scatter calculated using fundamental physics relations. A scatter kernel arising around each primary ray is calculated, and these are summed by superposition to form the scatter image. Beam quality, spatial position in the field (in particular that arising at the air-boundary due to the depletion of scatter contribution from the surroundings), and the possible presence of a grid, are considered, as is tissue composition using an iterative refinement procedure. We present numerous validation results that use a purpose designed tissue equivalent step wedge phantom. The average differences between actual acquisitions and modelled pixel intensities observed across the adipose to fibroglandular attenuation range vary between 5 % and 7 %, depending on beam quality and, for a single beam quality are 2. 09 % and 3. 36 % respectively with and without a grid...|$|E
