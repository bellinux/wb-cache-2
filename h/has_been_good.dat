25|$|It is {{believed}} in Theosophy of Helena Blavatsky that each religion (including Theosophy) {{has its own}} individual heaven in various regions of the upper astral plane that fits the description of that heaven that is given in each religion, which a soul that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> in their previous life on Earth will go to. The area of the upper astral plane of Earth in the upper atmosphere where the various heavens are located is called Summerland (Theosophists believe Hell {{is located in the}} lower astral plane of Earth which extends downward {{from the surface of the}} earth down to its center). However, Theosophists believe that the soul is recalled back to Earth after an average of about 1400 years by the Lords of Karma to incarnate again. The final heaven that souls go to billions of years in the future after they finish their cycle of incarnations is called Devachan.|$|E

500|$|In the Browns' early years, Paul Brown {{wanted to}} keep on reserve a number of {{promising}} players who {{did not make the}} team's official roster.

Too much depends on ideal weather conditions, and this is no climate to risk a buck on a raindrop." ...|$|E

There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> investigation done, serious investigation. All the evidence shows there's no evidence at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America. The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there's a new book put out by an Israel stalwart. His name is Walter Laqueur, a very prominent scholar. It's called The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism. It just came out, 2006, from Oxford University Press. He looks at the evidence, and he says no. There's some in Europe among the Muslim community, there's some anti-Semitism, but the notion that in the heart of European society or North American society there's anti-Semitism is preposterous. And in fact — or no, a significant rise in anti-Semitism is preposterous." ...|$|E
