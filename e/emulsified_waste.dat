40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is to analyze the {{possibilities}} and feasibilities, as well as the main experimental results reported about the emulsification method applied to waste cooking oils and fatty acid distillates as diesel engine fuels, compared with other commonly used methods. These waste products are obtained in the refining oil industry, food industry and service sector from the frying process, mainly. However, they are a little used as feedstocks to produce biofuels and constitute a potential source of contamination. From the review of the state of arts, significant decreases in exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides, cylinder pressure, as well as increases of the ignition delay, brake specific fuel consumption, hydrocarbon, smoke opacity, carbon monoxide, particulate matters to <b>emulsified</b> <b>waste</b> cooking oils and fatty acid distillates compared with diesel fuel are reported. In some experiments the <b>emulsified</b> <b>waste</b> cooking oils achieved better performance than neat fatty acid distillates, neat waste cooking oils and their derivates methyl esters...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a zero-cement brick is {{manufactured}} by replacing cement with recycled aggregates and {{blast furnace slag}} powder. Experimental tests were conducted with standard sized samples of 190 × 57 × 90 mm (KS F 4004), and this manufacturing technique was simulated in practice. Results showed that the zero-cement brick with 0. 35 W/B had the highest compressive strength, but the lowest absorption ratio. This absorption ratio of zero-cement brick with 0. 35 W/B was lower than the required level determined by KS F 4004. Hence, to increase the absorption ratio, crushed fine aggregate (CA) and <b>emulsified</b> <b>waste</b> vegetable oil (EWO) were used in combination in the zero-cement brick. It {{was found that the}} zero-cement brick with CA of 20 % and EWO of 1 % had the optimum combination, in terms of having the optimum strength development (12 MPa) and the optimum absorption ratio (8. 4 %) that satisfies the level required by KS. In addition, it is demonstrated that for the manufacturing of zero-cement brick of 1000, this technique reduces the manufacturing cost by 5 % compared with conventional cement brick...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{electroflotation}} in <b>emulsified</b> oil <b>wastes</b> was studied. A rectangular electroflotation cell {{was designed}} and constructed in acrylic with stainless steel cathode and DSA® anode with a nominal composition of Ti/Ru 0. 34 Ti 0. 66 O 2. The variables studied in the present work were current density and oil, flocculant and electrolyte (NaCl) concentrations. The experiments were carried out in accordance with 2 (4) full factorial experimental designs with two center points. The STATISTICA 5. 5 software was used for calculations in order to relate experimental data to a statistical model. The best results, yielded 99. 71 % oil removal were obtained from 1050 ppm of emulsified oil feed...|$|R
40|$|High {{efficient}} {{production of}} lower alcohols (C- 1 -C- 5 mixed alcohols) from hydrogen rich bio-oil derived syngas was achieved in this work. A non-catalytic partial oxidation (NPDX) gasification technology was successfully {{applied in the}} production and conditioning of bio-oil derived syngas using bio-oil (BO) and <b>emulsifying</b> <b>waste</b> engine oil (EWEO) as feedstock. The effects of water addition and feedstock composition on the gasification performances were investigated. When the BO 20 and EWEO 30 was mixed with mass ratio of 1 : 0. 33, the maximum hydrogen yield of 93. 7 % with carbon conversion of 96. 7 % was obtained, and the hydrogen rich bio-oil derived syngas was effectively produced. Furthermore, a two-stage bed reactor was applied in the downstream process of lower alcohols synthesis from hydrogen rich bio-oil derived syngas (H- 2 /CO/CO 2 /CH 4 /N- 2 = 52. 2119. 513. 0 / 9. 4 / 15. 9, v/v). The highest carbon conversion of 42. 5 % and the maximum alcohol yield of 0. 18 kg/kg(cat) h with selectivity of 53. 8 wt% were obtained over the Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 (2. 5) //Cu 25 Fe 22 Co 3 K 3 /SiO 2 (2. 5) catalyst combination system. The mechanism and evaluation for lower alcohols synthesis from model bio-oil derived syngas and model mixture gas were also discussed. The integrative process of hydrogen rich bio-oil derived syngas production and downstream lower alcohols synthesis, potentially providing a promising route for the conversion of organic wastes into high performance fuels and high value-added chemicals.

40|$|Emulsified water-in-oil (W/O) {{systems are}} {{extensively}} {{used in the}} oil industry for water control and acid stimulation. Emulsifiers are commonly utilized to emulsify a water-soluble material to form W/O emulsion. The selection of a particular surfactant for such jobs is critical and certainly expensive. In this work, the impact of surfactant structure on the stability of W/O emulsions is investigated using the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of the surfactant. Different commercial surfactants were evaluated for use as emulsifiers for W/O systems at high-temperature (up to 120 °C) high-salinity (221, 673 [*]ppm) HTHS conditions. Diverse surfactants were examined including ethoxylates, polyethylene glycols, fluorinated surfactants, and amides. Both commercial Diesel and waste oil are used for the oleic phase to prepare the <b>emulsified</b> system. <b>Waste</b> oil has shown higher stability (less separation) in comparison with Diesel. This work has successfully identified stable emulsified W/O systems that can tolerate HTHS environments using HLB approach. Amine Acetate family shows higher stability in comparison with Glycol Ether family and at even lower concentration. New insights into structure-surfactant stability relationship, beyond the HLB approach, are provided for surfactant selection...|$|R
30|$|Tannery {{industries}} are continuously using {{large amount of}} chemicals for dehairing in leather processing. These dehairing chemicals contain a high amount of pollutants such as soda-lime, salts, chromate, sulphide, solvent flashy, <b>emulsified</b> fatty matter, <b>waste</b> lime liquor. Beside these biological wastes from leather itself causing environmental pollution (Pepper and Wyatt 1989). The chemicals used in leather processing are also corrosive and health hazardous. Some tanneries {{have been forced to}} close down due to their pollution effect in environment (Davighi 1988). Very recently, government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has taken an initiative to move the tannery industry from Dhaka city; and build up the tannery industry outside Dhaka city and modernize the industry.|$|R
40|$|<b>Emulsified</b> oil in <b>waste</b> water {{constitutes}} is {{a severe}} {{problem in the}} different treatment stages before disposed off {{in a manner that}} does not violate environmental criteria. One commonly used technique for remediation of petroleum contaminated water is adsorption. The main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the removal of oil from oil–water emulsions by adsorption on bentonite, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and deposited carbon (DC). The results gave evidence of the ability of the adsorbents to adsorb oil and that the adsorptive property of the three adsorbents (bentonite, PAC, and DC) has been influenced by different factors. The effects of contact time, the weight of adsorbents and the concentration of adsorbate on the oil adsorption have been studied. Oil removal percentages increase with increasing contact time and the weight of adsorbents, and decrease with increasing the concentration of adsorbate. Equilibrium studies show that the Freunlich isotherm was the best fit isotherm for oil removal by bentonite, PAC, and DC. The data show higher adsorptive capacities by DC and bentonite compared to the PAC...|$|R
30|$|As {{depicted}} in Fig.  1, the VRM unit is {{preceded by a}} dissolved air flotation (DAF) unit to remove free and <b>emulsified</b> oily <b>wastes.</b> The raw sewage coming from the Sharjah Municipality Drainage Department (SMDD) flow divider is first screened through a 3  mm screen to reduce solids loading, and stabilize and optimize the DAF unit performance. The screened wastewater is pumped into the flocculation pipes that have several fissures for coagulants and/or flocculent additions. However, no flocculent or any other chemicals are added during the runs. The flow passes through the sedimentation tank, then to the inflow tank. A portion of the effluent is combined with compressed air {{and returned to the}} sedimentation tank in the DAF unit. DAF unit is employed to perform sedimentation, aeration and for the removal the oils and greases. The accumulated sludge (including scum cleaned out by scraper, and the sediment sludge) is pumped into a manhole, which join the SMDD sludge treating line. The pretreated influent of the raw wastewater is screened up to 3  mm size and it is free of grit, oil, and grease. It is supplied at constant flow during experimentation but the wastewater flowrate to the bioreactor may vary between one and 3.5  m 3 /h. The screened, raw influent is pumped from the inflow tank via a submersible pump into the aeration chamber. The mixture of activated sludge and inflow is transferred by the recirculation pump, into the VRM chamber, and the mixture will return to the aeration chamber by over flow. The permeate pump draws permeate through the ultrafiltration membranes in the bioreactor at a vacuum (160 – 230  mbar). Permeate is then directed to the permeate tank. The permeate pump operates for a specified time interval; 8  min permeate with 2  min rest cycle.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} the functionality and functionalisation of waste particles as an emulsifier for oil-in-water (o/w) and water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions. Ground coffee waste {{was chosen as}} a candidate waste material due to its naturally high content of lignin, a chemical component imparting <b>emulsifying</b> ability. The <b>waste</b> coffee particles readily stabilised o/w emulsions and following hydrothermal treatment adapted from the bioenergy field they also stabilised w/o emulsions. The hydrothermal treatment relocated the lignin component of the cell walls within the coffee particles onto the particle surface thereby increasing the surface hydrophobicity of the particles as demonstrated by an emulsion assay. Emulsion droplet sizes were comparable {{to those found in}} processed foods in the case of hydrophilic waste coffee particles stabilizing o/w emulsions. These emulsions were stable against coalescence for at least 12 weeks, flocculated but stable against coalescence in shear and stable to pasteurisation conditions (10 min at 80 °C). Emulsion droplet size was also insensitive to pH of the aqueous phase during preparation (pH 3 –pH 9). Stable against coalescence, the water droplets in w/o emulsions prepared with hydrothermally treated waste coffee particles were considerably larger and microscopic examination showed evidence of arrested coalescence indicative of particle jamming at the surface of the emulsion droplets. Refinement of the hydrothermal treatment and broadening out to other lignin-rich plant or plant based food waste material are promising routes to bring closer the development of commercially relevant lignin based food Pickering particles applicable to emulsion based processed foods ranging from fat continuous spreads and fillings to salad dressings...|$|R
