25|$|They all got {{together}} {{up there and}} there was a bloody massacre because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> shot about three hundred natives all in one hit {{and there was a}} hell of a row over it. It was all published in the papers and somebody let the cat out of the bag and anyhow the government and the judges in those times they realised what the trouble was and the whole thing was hushed up you see.|$|E
25|$|As for the Chinese, I {{have the}} highest opinion {{not only of the}} Chinese character, but of the Chinese fitness for self-government. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are eminently fitted to make a {{republic}} successful. China, for instance, is infinitely better fitted than is Russia for development along republican lines. In fact, China has always been practically a republic. It has had its dynasties of rulers, but the political unit of China has always been the village. The village people have always had their influence upon the Government. What is more, the average Chinaman is intelligent.|$|E

25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E
500|$|Jackie Joseph later {{recalled}} [...] "at first {{they told me}} it was a detective movie; then, while I was flying back , <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> wrote a whole new movie, more in the horror genre. I think over a weekend they rewrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|Rootes' design {{director}} Roy Axe commented {{later that}} [...] "The Alpine and Tiger were always oddballs in the [...] range. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> [...] didn't understand it, {{or have the}} same interest in it as the family cars– I think it was as simple as that." ...|$|E

500|$|Potter and Warne agreed {{volume of}} nursery rhymes {{would be created}} in 1905 but she also brought his {{attention}} to a story she had previously written, writing to him, [...] "I think 'Mrs. Tiggy' would be all right; it is a girl's book ... {{there must be a}} large audience of little girls. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> would like the different clothes." [...] She began the illustrations in the summer once he agreed to the concept.|$|E
500|$|After {{hearing all}} the evidence, the Special Master Richard Hixson, {{who presided over}} the {{testimony}} for the Florida Legislature, declared that the state had a [...] "moral obligation" [...] to make restitution to the former residents of Rosewood. He said, [...] "I truly don't think they cared about compensation. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> simply wanted the truth to be known about what happened to them... whether they got fifty cents or a hundred and fifty million dollars. It didn't matter." ...|$|E
500|$|In the evening, tens of {{thousands}} of government supporters, borrowing the anti-government protesters' slogan [...] "no Sunni, no Shia, only Bahraini", gathered in Al Fateh Mosque in Juffair. [...] One participant interviewed by The New York Times said, [...] "The democracy they have been asking for is already here, but the Shias, they have their ayatollahs, and whatever they say, they will run and do it. If they tell them to burn a house, they will. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have a clear intention to disrupt this country".|$|E

500|$|Keaton's casting {{caused a}} {{controversy}} among comic book fans, with 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Bros. offices. Bob Kane, Sam Hamm and Michael Uslan also heavily questioned the casting. [...] "Obviously {{there was a}} negative response from the comic book people. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{thought we were going}} to make it like the 1960s TV series, and make it campy, because they thought of Michael Keaton from Mr. Mom and Night Shift and stuff like that." [...] Keaton studied The Dark Knight Returns for inspiration.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Rolling Stone placed [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] {{at number}} 90 on {{its list of}} [...] "The 100 Greatest Beatles Songs". On a similar list {{compiled}} by Mojo in 2006, the song appeared at number 27. In his commentary for the magazine, Brian Wilson described it as his [...] "all time favourite Beatles track", saying that while the Beatles were [...] "genius songwriters", this song was distinguished by a [...] "heart-and-soul melody". Wilson concluded: [...] "When they broke up I was heartbroken. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> should have kept going." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} decade, {{she went on}} more than 40 field missions, meeting with {{refugees}} and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries. In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, [...] "Awareness of the plight of these people. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon." [...] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, {{which was published in}} October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} far they see it. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> allow it to themselves, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> would {{understand}} some of it; as, for instance, when I heard him talking the other day as if he assumed that Christianity was only a development of people's tendency to believe,--as fleeting as other forms of faith. It was not very broadly stated, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should have seen it, {{if it had not}} chimed in with something I had read; and, besides, I knew what was in the man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> do. Grandma <b>thinks</b> I'm better, and grandpa, and <b>I</b> {{let them}} <b>think</b> so; but Miss Roxy, can't {{you think of}} {{something}} else?" ...|$|R

500|$|The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was {{released}} that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies {{in its first}} week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, {{with much of the}} criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, [...] "I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that".|$|E
500|$|On February 2, 2015, Paul {{generated}} controversy {{by suggesting}} that states should not require parents to vaccinate their children, because parents should {{have the freedom to}} make that decision for their children. In an interview with CNBC on February 2, Paul clarified this statement, commenting [...] "I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children, and it is an issue of freedom." [...] On February 3, he posted a photograph to Twitter of himself being vaccinated.|$|E
500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{just wanted a}} northwest guy to do it, because they were shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris sent me his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E

500|$|He {{also began}} {{studying}} revolutionary politics including the Marxist theory of Henri Lefebvre, who {{introduced him to}} the Communist poet Louis Aragon in 1928. Berni continued corresponding with Aragon after leaving France, later recalling, [...] "It is a pity that I have lost, among the many things I have lost, the letters that I received from Aragon all the way from France; if I had them today, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>they</b> would be magnificent documents; because in that correspondence we discussed topics such as the direct relationship between politics and culture, the responsibilities of the artist and the intellectual society, the problems of culture in colonial countries, the issue of freedom." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, Moran told an anti-war audience in Reston, Virginia, that if [...] "it {{were not for}} the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, we would not be doing this. The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> should". This brought criticism from many of his own party, including, among others, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Joe Lieberman. Nancy Pelosi, who was House Minority Leader at the time, remarked that [...] "Moran's comments have no place in the Democratic Party." ...|$|E
500|$|Rodman {{admitted}} {{his frequent}} transgressions, but asserted {{that he lived}} his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people: [...] "I just took {{the chance to be}} my own man... I just said: 'If you don't like it, kiss my ass.' ...Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves. They look at me and see someone trying to do that... I'm the guy who's showing people, hey, it's all right to be different. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> feel: 'Let's go and see this guy entertain us.'" ...|$|E

60|$|ABSOLUTE Very true, sir; {{but if a}} man never utters his thoughts, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>they</b> might stand {{a chance}} of {{escaping}} controversy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mass {{unless you}} {{absolutely}} have to," [...] were his words of caution. [...] "They have the weight, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have the wind. Keep {{them on the}} jump. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is your only chance." ...|$|R
