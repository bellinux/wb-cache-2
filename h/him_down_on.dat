25|$|After a punt {{from both}} teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring drive. Newton {{completed}} {{all four of}} his pass attempts for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter. Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, {{but none of them}} attempted to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the Panthers 14-yard line. Despite Denver's excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.|$|E

His win at the 1993 was however his most infamous as he accidentally stepped on the heel of Moses Tanui's shoe at the bell, causing it to fly off his foot. After the contact, with just one shoe, an angered Tanui moved out to a 10-meter lead, only to have Haile run <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the final straight.

25|$|At {{the summit}} of their social success, Rawdon is arrested for debt, {{possibly}} at Becky's connivance. The financial success of the Crawleys had been a topic of gossip; in fact they were living on credit even when it ruined those who trusted them, such as their landlord, an old servant of the Crawley family. The Marquis of Steyne had given Becky money, jewels, and other gifts but Becky does not use them for expenses or to free her husband. Instead, Rawdon's letter to his brother is received by Lady Jane, who pays the £170 that prompted his imprisonment. He returns home to find Becky singing to Steyne and strikes <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the assumption—despite her protestations of innocence—that they are having an affair. Steyne is indignant, having assumed the £1000 he had just given Becky {{was part of an}} arrangement with her husband. Rawdon finds Becky's hidden bank records and leaves her, expecting Steyne to challenge him to a duel. Instead Steyne arranges for Rawdon to be made Governor of Coventry Island, a pest-ridden location. Becky, having lost both husband and credibility, leaves England and wanders the continent, leaving her son in the care of Pitt and Lady Jane.|$|E

500|$|The seventh {{match was}} the Extreme Rules {{lumberjack}} match between Sabu and John Cena. Before the match began, the ECW and Raw superstars {{made their way}} to ringside to take their place as lumberjacks. The match quickly began with Cena throwing Sabu out of the ring onto the Raw lumberjacks, in which they assaulted Sabu and threw him back in the ring. Sabu would later get the upper hand and throw Cena out onto the ECW lumberjacks, at ringside. Throughout the match, Sabu took the advantage over Cena as he performed a somersault leg drop, driving a steel chair onto Cena's face. Cena got the upper hand when he was able to counter a flying crossbody attempt by Sabu. Mid-way in the match, the ECW and Raw lumberjacks started brawling at ringside. At ringside, the ECW lumberjacks began their assault on Cena, after [...] he was hit with a steel chair by Sabu. They laid his head on a table, in which Sabu attempted to perform a high-flying maneuver. The Raw superstars, however, gave Cena the upper hand to hit Sabu with a kendo stick in mid-air. Back in the ring, Cena hit Sabu with a steel chair then lifted him over his shoulders and threw <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a table that was at ringside to execute the FU. Following this, Sabu was thrown back into the ring where Cena applied the STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent, in which Sabu submitted to and giving Cena the win.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash deduced {{from the}} words [...] "Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her" [...] in [...] that Abraham came {{directly}} from Mount Moriah and the binding of Isaac. The Midrash told {{that at the}} very moment in [...] that the angel of the Lord stayed Abraham from sacrificing Isaac, the Satan appeared to Sarah in the guise of Isaac. When Sarah saw him, she asked what Abraham had done to him. He told Sarah that Abraham had taken him to a mountain, built an altar, placed wood upon it, tied <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> it, and took a knife to slaughter him, and had God not told him not to lay a hand on him, Abraham would have slaughtered him. As soon as he finished speaking, Sarah's soul departed. Similarly, reading [...] "And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah," [...] the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer reported that Abraham came from Mount Moriah to find that Sarah had died. When Abraham set out from Mount Moriah in peace, the anger of Sammael (the Satan) was kindled, for he saw that his desire to frustrate Abraham's offering had not been realized. So Sammael told Sarah that Abraham had killed Isaac and offered him as a burnt offering upon the altar. Sarah began to weep and to cry aloud three times, corresponding to the three sustained notes (of the shofar), and she gave forth three howlings corresponding to the three disconnected short notes (of the shofar), and her soul fled, and she died.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis told in a Baraita {{an account}} in {{relation}} to [...] Once a Sadducee High Priest arranged the incense outside and then brought it inside the Holy of Holies. As he left the Holy, he was very glad. His father met {{him and told him}} that although they were Sadducees, they were afraid of the Pharisees. He replied that all his life he was aggrieved because of the words of [...] "For I appear in the cloud upon the Ark-cover." [...] (The Sadducees interpreted [...] as if it said: [...] "Let him not come into the holy place except with the cloud of incense, for only thus, with the cloud, am I to be seen on the Ark-cover.") The Sadducee wondered when the opportunity would come for him to fulfill the verse. He asked how, when such an opportunity came to his hand, he could not have fulfilled it. The Baraita reported that only a few days later he died and was thrown on the dung heap and worms came forth from his nose. Some say he was smitten as {{he came out of the}} Holy of Holies. For Rabbi Hiyya taught that a noise was heard in the Temple Court, for an angel struck <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his face.

2500|$|During World War I Count von Salm {{served as}} a dragoon officer in the Austrian Army and as a {{military}} aide to the Governor of Vienna. After the war he settled in Vienna, where he lost much of his fortune and properties over card games held at the Jockey Club. He married his first wife, Anne-Marie von Kramsta, on 30 June 1909. [...] His second marriage, on 8 January 1924, was to American heiress Millicent Rogers and produced one child, but the couple had divorced before he was born. Apart from playing tennis he occasionally acted in movies thanks to his friend Count Alexander Kolowrat, who was a film producer and owner of Sascha-Film. His director Mihály Kertész encouraged Alexander to offer Ludwig movie roles and hire him. He was cast in three feature films alongside Lucy Doraine, including the 1922 pieces Masters of the Sea and A Vanished World. In 1929 he published a book dedicated to his son, Peter, entitled Mein lieber Peter ... beichte eines vaters. While living in Austria he gave private tennis etiquette and fair-play lessons to Viennese children. After his financial breakdown Salm moved to Budapest and started a wine business. He rented and lived in a second-story room in the Hotel Dunapalota-Ritz. On 23 July 1944 he jumped off the hotel balcony onto the Danube Promenade and died immediately. According to the Winona Daily News he did so because the Nazis had {{arrived on the scene}} to arrest him for his Jewish ancestry. According to his friend Sidney Wood, the root cause behind his suicide was that the Nazi regime pressured him to engage in espionage, which he refused to do and thus the SS wanted to hunt <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> <b>On</b> the contrary, according to the Jewish Criterion he was a Nazi collaborationist and avid anti-Semite and chose to end his life in fear of post-war reprisals. He was buried on 28 July; his funeral was a big social affair.|$|E
