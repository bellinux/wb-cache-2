500|$|In general, Sullivan {{preferred}} {{to write in}} major keys. In the Savoy operas, there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key (less than 5% of the musical numbers), and even in his serious works the major prevails. Examples of Sullivan's rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the Irish Symphony, [...] "Go away, madam" [...] in the Act I finale of Iolanthe (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the funeral march in the Act I finale of The Yeomen of the Guard. Sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect. When reproached for using consecutive fifths in Cox and Box, he replied [...] "if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, {{so long as there}} is no offence to the ear." [...] Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in [...] "Expressive glances" [...] (Princess Ida), where he smoothly negotiates E major, C sharp minor and C major, or [...] "Then one of us will be a queen" [...] (The Gondoliers), where he writes in F major, <b>D</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> and D minor.|$|E
