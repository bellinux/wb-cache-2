40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} different warp densities on changes of relevant physical-mechanical properties of coated fabrics. Coating process of cotton fabric was performed by polyurethane coating. In order to {{examine the impact of}} polyurethane coating on the properties of multi-component materials, with a fabric as a basic component,tests were carried out on the fabricwith different warp densities: 24, 22, 20, 18 and 16 threads/cm before polyurethane coating. Weft density did not change and for all samples remained the same (11 threads/cm). The results of the study indicate that physical-mechanical properties of <b>fabric,</b> with different <b>warp</b> densities, before coating, differ fromphysical-mechanical properties of coated <b>fabric</b> with respectivelydifferent <b>warp</b> densities. Just minimal warp density reduction leads to significant change of the basic fabric properties, as well as the properties of multi-component material with appurtenant <b>fabric.</b> Changes in <b>warp</b> density provide significant correlation coefficients between the warp density and physical- mechanical properties of fabrics and multi-component materials.

(d) Final composite generated by our system. (e). Composite generated using 2 D alignment and blending. Note the unnaturally short distance between the mouth and the chin. We {{address the problem of}} correcting an undesirable expression on a face photo by transferring local facial components, such as a smiling mouth, from another face photo of the same person which has the desired expression. Direct copying and blending using existing compositing tools results in semantically unnatural composites, since expression is a global effect and the local component in one expression is often incompatible with the shape and other components of the face in another expression. To solve this problem we present Expression Flow, a 2 D flow field which can <b>warp</b> the target <b>face</b> globally in a natural way, so that the <b>warped</b> <b>face</b> is compatible with the new facial component to be copied over. To do this, starting with the two input face photos, we jointly construct a pair of 3 D face shapes with the same identity but different expressions. The expression flow is computed by projecting {{the difference between the two}} 3 D shapes back to 2 D. It describes how to <b>warp</b> the target <b>face</b> photo to match the expression of the reference photo.

5000|$|Like other {{indigenous}} garments, the quechquemitl is {{made from}} uncut pieces of cloths as they come off the loom. Quechquemitl designs are achieved through weaving (fiber, color, structure), surface ornamentation (usually embroidery) and finishes applied to the seams and edges. [...] Various kinds of weaves are done for quechquemitls includes gauze, seersucker, brocade and curved or shaped weaving. The finest gauze pieces are from the Sierra Norte de Puebla, with very complex arrangements of heddles, often with six used {{and as many as}} twenty have been noted. These gauze weavings tend to be more complex than those used for huipils. Some appear as a checkerboard pattern. Seersucker is used by adding commercial threads in stripes along with the handspun threads. The commercial threads do not shrink when washed and the puckering effect is created. Weft brocade is a decorative technique where heavier threads are introduced in the weft to create patterns. A looped brocade is also created by tugging on these weft threads to raise them. These brocades are often mistaken as embroidery in both Mexican and Guatemalan textiles. The curved weaving technique is particularly complicated and unique. Part of the warp is of white cotton and part a colored wool, either red or pink. The wool warp is much longer than the cotton at a point in the weaving producing <b>warp</b> <b>faced</b> <b>fabric.</b> The wool <b>warp</b> is cult and used as weft in a weft faced band, given the look of a colored border. The curvature is designed to fall on the shoulders of the wearer. This type of garment {{can be found in the}} Sierra Norte de Puebla region.|$|R
40|$|Practical face {{recognition}} {{has been studied}} in the past decades, but still remains an open challenge. Current prevailing approaches have already achieved substantial breakthroughs in recognition accuracy. However, their performance usually drops dramatically if face samples are severely misaligned. To address this problem, we propose a highly efficient misalignment-robust locality-constrained representation (MRLR) algorithm for practical real-time {{face recognition}}. Specifically, the locality constraint that activates the most correlated atoms and suppresses the uncorrelated ones, is applied to construct the dictionary for face alignment. Then we simultaneously align the <b>warped</b> <b>face</b> and update the locality-constrained dictionary, eventually obtaining the final alignment. Moreover, we {{make use of the}} block structure to accelerate the derived analytical solution. Experimental results on public data sets show that MRLR significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and scalability with even better performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a garment during its usage {{is very important for}} consumers. Performance as such is a very wide term and may range from satisfying the requirements during its use to the durability. Comfort is also considered by many consumers today as one of the performance requirements. For stretchable denim fabric, the fit related comfort lies in the ability of the material to be stretched when a load is applied according to body movements and retain to its original length. While designing the stretch denim, fabric weight and weave plays important role for comfort, performance and fashion. In this study, the effect of fabric parameters such as areal density, Lycra content and weave on characteristics of stretchable denim fabrics were investigated. Various properties such as thickness, tensile strength, flexural rigidity, stretch and recovery properties and air permeability of the fabrics were evaluated. The test results revealed that increasing the fabric weight increased <b>fabric</b> <b>warp</b> tensile strength, compressibility, stretch and recovery, whereas the flexural rigidity, weft tensile strength and air permeability were decreased. As Lycra contents in fabric increased, fabric thickness was increased which resulted in higher flexural rigidity of fabric. Fabric construction and weave also influenced the fabric flexural rigidity and air permeability related to performance and comfort of stretchable denim fabric...|$|R
30|$|Denim as a fabric, has {{received}} the widest acceptance among all textile products. It has had an incredible influence on consumers both socially and culturally (Paul 2015). This twill cotton <b>fabric</b> usually has <b>warp</b> threads indigo dyed while weft remains plain white. The <b>warp</b> <b>faced</b> <b>fabric</b> therefore looks blue {{on one side and}} white on reverse. The warp being ring dyed, creates denim’s fading characteristics, which is unique compared to every other textile material. With changing times, many new variants of denim came into existence. Denim washing {{is one of the key}} areas in getting the faded look. Earlier stone washing used to be done to achieve soft feel and the desired appearance. During washing, the pumice stone, scraps off the dye particles from the yarn surface in the denim fabric. Due to the ring dyeing of denim fabric and heavy abrasion during stone washing process, the faded effect is achieved. Oxidative bleaching agent with or without the addition of stones have also been used to get fading effect. Difficulty in removing residual pumice from fabric, damage to equipment and clogging of machine drainage passage due to particulate material proved to be major drawbacks with the technique (Heikinheimo et al. 2000). Later on use of enzymes became a sustainable option to get the worn out look in denim. The enzymes used are cellulase enzymes, specifically acting on the cellulose part, mainly on the surface of the fabric. This gives the desired look and at the same time, removes hairiness from surface thus giving a smooth and soft feel. Enzymes are substrate specific in their action, unaffecting the others. They are primarily used in textiles to promote hydrolysis of the required substrate (Patra 2003).|$|R

Sometimes threads of different colours were woven into the base fabric in patterns; an ornamented border, an elaborate pallu, and often, small repeated accents in the cloth itself. These accents are called buttis or bhuttis (spellings vary). For fancy saris, these patterns could be woven with gold or silver thread, which is called zari work.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} pose in 2 D face {{recognition}} is widely acknowledged.

This is a problem, when using face recognition for surveillance applications in which people can move freely. We suggest a preprocessing step to <b>warp</b> <b>faces</b> from a non frontal pose to a near frontal pose. We use view-based active appearance models to fit to a novel face image under a random pose. The model parameters are adjusted to correct for the pose and used to reconstruct the face under a novel pose. This preprocessing makes face recognition more robust with respect to variations in the pose. An improvement in the identification rate of 60 % (from 15 % to 75 %) is obtained for faces under a pose of 45 degree...|$|R
