40|$|Savings {{generated}} by the sector <b>of</b> <b>households</b> constitute an important growth factor in every economy. They are the basic source of capital accumulation, determining investment opportunities of the economy. Financial behaviour <b>of</b> <b>households</b> in terms <b>of</b> the accumulation of savings is infl uenced  by numerous factors, both internal, i. e. connected directly with a given household, and external, independent of it. The aim {{of this paper was}} to analyse savings behaviour <b>of</b> <b>households</b> <b>of</b> farmers as compared to the other socio-economicgroups in Poland in the years 2003 and 2013. Analyses were conducted on saving propensity, savings rates, and objectives and forms of savings accumulation by <b>households</b> <b>of</b> various socio-economic groups. Analyses showed that in  2013, saving propensity and savings rates in <b>households</b> <b>of</b> farmers were relatively low in comparison to other household groups. In <b>households</b> <b>of</b> farmers the objective of savings was, more frequently than in the other socio-economic groups <b>of</b> <b>households,</b> to ensure provisions for running consumption expenditure, purchase durable goods and expand their economic activity.
