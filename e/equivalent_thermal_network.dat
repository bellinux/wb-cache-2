40|$|Out of {{the many}} options {{available}} for thermal simulation of digital electronic systems, those based on solving an RC equivalent circuit of the thermal network {{are the most popular}} choice in the EDA community, as they provide a reasonable tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. HotSpot, in particular, has become the de-facto standard in these communities, although other simulators are also popular. These tools have many benefits, but they are relatively inefficient when performing thermal analysis for long simulation times, due to the occurrence {{of a large number of}} redundant computations intrinsic in the underlying models.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} an aggregator controlling heat pumps in households to offer a direct control flexibility service for network management purposes, such as solving system balance or congestion issues. The service is defined by a 15 minutes power modulation, upward or downward, followed by a payback effect on a fixed duration that models the corresponding relative decrease or increase of consumption. The service modulation is relative to an optimized baseline that minimizes the energy costs given a forward price signal. The amount of modulable power and payback effect is computed by solving a series of mixed integer linear programs. Within these optimization problems, the building thermal behavior is modeled as an <b>equivalent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>network</b> made of thermal resistances and lumped thermal capacitances whose parameters are identified from more complex and validated models.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} an aggregator controlling residential heat pumps to offer a direct control flexibility service. The service consists of a power modulation, upward or downward, that is activated {{at a given time}} period over a fixed number of periods. The service modulation is relative to an optimized baseline that minimizes the energy costs. The load modulation is directly followed by a constrained rebound effect, consisting of a delay time with no deviations from the baseline consumption and a payback time to return to the baseline state. The potential amount of modulation and the constrained rebound effect are computed by solving mixed integer linear problems. Within these problems, the thermal behavior of the building is modeled by an <b>equivalent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>network</b> made of resistances and lumped capacitances. Simulations are performed for different sets of buildings typical of the Belgian residential building stock and are presented in terms of achievable modulation amplitude, deviations from the baseline and associated costs. A cluster of one hundred ideal buildings, corresponding to retrofitted freestanding houses, is then chosen to investigate the influence of each parameter defined within the service. Results show that with a set of one hundred heat pumps, a load aggregator could expect to harvest mean modulation amplitudes of up to 138 kW for an upward modulation and up to 51 kW for a downward modulation. The obtained values strongly depend on the proposed flexibility service. For example, they can decrease down to 2. 6 kW and 0. 4 kW, respectively, if no rebound effect is allowed. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{design of}} {{electrical}} machines for extreme oper- ating conditions must include a thermal analysis {{coupled with the}} magnetic analysis. However, the traditional coupling of the thermal and the magnetic models can result in an unacceptable increase in computation time, particularly if ﬁnite elements (FEs) are used for the machine analysis. This paper proposes a coupled thermal–magnetic analysis of an induction motor (IM) with {{the primary goal of}} achieving a rapid and accurate prediction of the IM performance. Only a minimum set of FE magnetic analyses is carried out so as to determine the parameters of the IM equivalent circuit. These parameters are nonlinear and are adjusted {{on the basis of the}} operating point. Then, this equivalent circuit is coupled with a lumped-parameter <b>thermal</b> <b>network</b> to predict the temper- ature in each part of the IM. Since both the <b>equivalent</b> circuit and <b>thermal</b> <b>network</b> solutions are analytic, the analysis converges very rapidly. At the same time, the FE analysis yields a precise estimation of the IM parameters used in the equivalent circuit.

40|$|Membrane Distillation (MD) is an {{emerging}} sustainable desalination technique. While MD has many advantages {{and can be}} powered by solar thermal energy, its main drawback is the low water production rate. However, the MD process has not been fully optimized {{in terms of its}} manipulated and controlled variables. This is largely {{due to the lack of}} adequate dynamic models to study and simulate the process. In addition, MD is prone to membrane fouling, which is a fault that degrades the performance of the MD process. This work has three contributions to address these challenges. First, we derive a mathematical model of Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD), which is the building block for the next parts. Then, the proposed model is extended to account for membrane fouling and an observer-based fouling detection method is developed. Finally, various control strategies are implemented to optimize the performance of the DCMD solar-powered process. In part one, a reduced-order dynamic model of DCMD is developed based on lumped capacitance method and electrical analogy to thermal systems. The result is an electrical <b>equivalent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>network</b> to the DCMD process, which is modeled by a system of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (DAEs). This model predicts the water-vapor flux and the temperature distribution along the module length. Experimental data is collected to validate the steady-state and dynamic responses of the proposed model, with great agreement demonstrated in both. The second part proposes an extension of the model to account for membrane fouling. An adaptive observer for DAE systems is developed and convergence proof is presented. A method for membrane fouling detection is then proposed based on adaptive observers. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the membrane fouling detection method. Finally, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the process efficiency of a solar-powered DCMD. The adapted method is known as Extremum Seeking (ES). A Newton-based ES is designed and the proposed model is used to accurately forecast the distilled water flux. Although good results are obtained with this method, a practical modification to the ES scheme is proposed to enhance the practical stability...|$|E

Experiments were conducted at two identical and highly instrumented houses. One house is modified with different oor coverings, while the other is kept unchanged and used for reference. Through experimentation and simulation, peak power (due to space heating) reduction strategies are investigated. Twelve <b>equivalent</b> RC <b>thermal</b> <b>network</b> models of varying model resolution are developed for a north zone of the houses. Modelling approximations including linearization of the heat transfer, spatial and/or temporal discretization and approximations for reduction in model complexity are implemented into the models and their effects are investigated. The focus is on simple and physically meaningful building thermal models suited for model-based control. The models are used to study the impact of set point ramping lengths and-optimal" transition curves between two temperatures on peak demand reductions for a very cold day. Alterations to walls and ceilings in the models were done to hypothetically modify their properties in the zone and the effects in combination with ramping profiles were analyzed.
