60|$|The {{business}} of the father, in all this incipient child-development, is to stand outside as a final authority and make the necessary adjustments. Where {{there is too much}} sympathy, then the great voluntary centers of the spine are weak, the child tends to be delicate. Then the father by instinct supplies the roughness, the sternness which stiffens in the child the centers of resistance and independence, right from the very earliest days. Often, for a mere infant, it is the father's fierce or stern presence, the vibration of his voice, which starts the frictional and <b>independent</b> <b>activity</b> of the great voluntary ganglion and gives the first impulse to the independence which later on is life itself.|$|E
6000|$|But making {{education}} {{a process}} of self-evolution, has other advantages than this of keeping our lessons in the right order. In the first place, it guarantees a vividness and permanency of impression which the usual methods can never produce. Any piece of knowledge which the pupil has himself acquired--any problem which he has himself solved, becomes, {{by virtue of the}} conquest, much more thoroughly his than it could else be. The preliminary activity of mind which his success implies, the concentration of thought necessary to it, and the excitement consequent on his triumph, conspire to register the facts in his memory in a way that no mere information heard from a teacher, or read in a school-book, can be registered. Even if he fails, the tension to which his faculties have been wound up, insures his remembrance of the solution when given to him, better than half-a-dozen repetitions would. Observe, again, that this discipline necessitates a continuous organisation of the knowledge he acquires. It is in the very nature of facts and inferences assimilated in this normal manner, that they successively become the premises of further conclusions--the means of solving further questions. The solution of yesterday's problem helps the pupil in mastering to-day's. Thus the knowledge is turned into faculty as soon as it is taken in, and forthwith aids in the general function of thinking--does not lie merely written on the pages of an internal library, as when rote-learnt. Mark further, the moral culture which this constant self-help involves. Courage in attacking difficulties, patient concentration of the attention, perseverance through failures--these are characteristics which after-life specially requires; and these are characteristics which this system of making the mind work for its food specially produces. That it is thoroughly practicable to carry out instruction after this fashion, we can ourselves testify; having been in youth thus led to solve the comparatively complex problems of perspective. And that leading teachers have been tending in this direction, is indicated alike in the saying of Fellenberg, that [...] "the individual, <b>independent</b> <b>activity</b> of the pupil is of much greater importance than the ordinary busy officiousness of many who assume the office of educators;" [...] in the opinion of Horace Mann, that [...] "unfortunately education amongst us at present consists too much in telling, not in training;" [...] and in the remark of M. Marcel, that [...] "what the learner discovers by mental exertion is better known than what is told to him." ...|$|E

The present study aimed to clarify compatibility between the <b>independent</b> <b>activities</b> and ICF categories by conducting a survey of teaching staff in schools for special needs education. The <b>independent</b> <b>activities</b> consist of 6 major items accompanied {{by a total of}} 26 sub-items. The ICF involves 4 components: body functions and structures, activities and participation, environmental factors and personal factors. Thirty items at the first level of classification were employed for the present investigation, excluding personal factors. The <b>independent</b> <b>activities</b> were linked not only to activities and participation in the ICF, but also body functions and structures and environmental factors. Amongst the <b>independent</b> <b>activities</b> "psychological stability" had the largest degree of compatibility with ICF items (15 items); while "health care" and "understanding situations" had the smallest number (6 items). The results suggest that a combined use of <b>independent</b> <b>activities</b> and ICF categories provides a more useful and quantitative foundation to assess the <b>independent</b> <b>activities</b> and to facilitate individual teaching plans...|$|R
