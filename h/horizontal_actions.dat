However, when subjected to cyclic <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions,</b> such as earthquakes, they can present a deficient behaviour. With the purpose of evaluating the seismic vulnerability of adobe structures, {{a series of tests}} were conducted on a full-scale adobe wall considering constant dead and live loads combined with cyclic <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions</b> with rising amplitude. A structural strengthening solution was tested on the repaired wall after its assessment test. The adopted repair solution, based on cracks injection, combined with the strengthening solution, proved to be very efficient in improving the performance of the adobe wall. With the study conducted, it was possible to contribute to the characterization of adobe structural walls in terms of deformation capacity and failure modes, establishing the basis for the calibration of numerical models for adobe structures...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a FE homogenized limit {{analysis}} {{code for}} the collapse analysis of 3 D masonry buildings subjected to <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions</b> is presented. In the code, masonry is modelled through a fictitious macroscopic homogeneous material. Masonry macroscopic mechanical properties are obtained {{by means of}} a recently presented equilibrated limit analysis approach performed on a suitable unit cell, which generates the entire structure by repetition. Masonry homogenised failure surfaces are then implemented in the 3 D code here outlined. With respect to previously presented models, the algorithm allows to analyze real scale buildings for coupled in-plane and out-of-plane actions. The possible presence of steel, RC and ring beams is also considered introducing in the numerical model two-node beam elements. A relevant 3 D structural example consisting of a masonry school subjected to <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions</b> is treated. Full sensitivity analyses and a comparison with results obtained with a commercial elasto-plastic software are also presented to validate the model proposed...|$|E

The plastic flow is described by introducing a suitable yield function and evolution laws in terms of effective stresses. Small strain and displacement assumptions hold. A 4 -node finite element is formulated with three degrees-of-freedom for each node and a predictor–corrector procedure is used to solve the damage-plastic evolutionary problem.

40|$|Several {{methods of}} {{analysis}} are available in engineering practice to study old masonry constructions. Two commonly used approaches {{in the field of}} seismic engineering are global and local analyses. Despite several years of research in this field, the various methodologies suffer from a lack of comprehensive experimental validation. This is mainly due to the difficulty in simulating the many different kinds of masonry and, accordingly, the non-linear response under <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions.</b> This issue can be addressed by examining the local response of isolated panels under monotonic and/or alternate actions. Different testing methodologies are commonly used to identify the local response of old masonry. These range from simplified pull-out tests to sophisticated in-plane monotonic tests. However, {{there is a lack of}} both knowledge and critical comparison between experimental validations and numerical simulations. This is mainly due to the difficulties in implementing irregular settings within both simplified and advanced numerical analyses. Similarly, the simulation of degradation effects within laboratory tests is difficult with respect to old masonry in-situ boundary conditions. Numerical models, particularly on rubble masonry, are commonly simplified. They are mainly based on a kinematic chain of rigid blocks able to perform different “modes of damage” of structures subjected to <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions.</b> This paper presents an innovative methodology for testing; its aim is to identify a simplified model for out-of-plane response of rubbleworks with respect to the experimental evidence.

The construction solution consists in placing the entire outer sheet of the enclosure ahead of the building’s structure, so as to use the brick wall itself as its own supporting structure.

40|$|After the 2005 M 7. 6 Kashmir {{earthquake}} (Pakistan), field observations {{reported that}} several buildings manufactured with traditional techniques well resisted to this strong seismic event. Nonetheless, these techniques {{have never been}} deeply studied from a structural engineering point of view yet. This thesis reports a full analytical study on the static and seismic behavior of simple one-storey buildings made with a typical construction technique commonly named as “Bhatar” system, used for several centuries and widely diffused in rather remote areas of the Himalayan regions like India, Nepal and Pakistan. The Bhatar system consists of load-bearing walls made of common dry-stacked rubble stone masonry held together by horizontal wooden bands disposed at several levels (spaced at intervals of about 60 cm). It is widely adopted in developing countries due to its advantages from both economical and constructive point of view {{with respect to the}} conventional constructions techniques (i. e. brick masonry and concrete structures). In the present work, analytical analyses are conducted with reference to a one-storey building modulus characterized by a 3. 6 m x 3. 6 m square plan covered by an heavy wooden roof with 20 cm thick earth coverage, in order to investigate its response under both gravity and seismic inertial loadings. In detail, in-plane and out-of-plane response of a single wall under <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions</b> is discussed and particular attention is focused on the connections between the timber elements, which are fundamental for the transmission of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions</b> and for preventing overturning and other failure mechanisms. The main aim is twofold: (i) to provide a first insight into the actual seismic response of such construction technique, as a basis for the specific design of ad-hoc laboratory tests on full-scale models, and (ii) to give some rules of thumb for a proper dimensioning and construction of this kind of structures...|$|E

30|$|Due to an un-normalized {{constructive}} process, in fact, the Italian heritage {{includes a}} wide range of different typologies of masonry buildings that have not been designed to resist to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions</b> as those due to earthquakes. Among these construction typologies, the ones characterized by a high flexibility are particularly vulnerable to the seismic events, as they may show large amplitude oscillations incompatible with the mechanical properties of their structural elements (Ahmadi et al. 2014; Bartoli et al. 2013; Diaferio et al. 2014 b; Foti 2014, 2015; Gentile and Saisi 2007; Tomaszewska and Szymczak 2012).

At the structural level, masonry is modeled as a homogeneous, orthotropic material featuring softening in tension, shear, and compression. Rigid, infinitely resistant triangular elements connected by elastoplastic interfaces are used to perform full-scale nonlinear analyses. To reduce further processing time needed for the simulations, preliminary FE limit analyses were conducted to identify the failure mechanisms, and hence the interfaces that undergo plasticization during the deformation process. In this way, it is possible to concentrate nonlinearity exclusively on those interfaces that prove active in the limit-analysis problem. Finally, full nonlinear pushover curves are compared with collapse loads; the latter is provided by a limit analysis that assumes a limited number of possible preassigned failure mechanisms, as required by the recent Italian Building Code guidelines on monumental buildings...|$|E
