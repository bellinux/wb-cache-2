The PCI DSS is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design and other critical protective measures.|$|E
25|$|Cost Management: As in {{any other}} fields of engineering, an {{application}} with good structural software quality costs less to maintain and is easier to understand and change in response to pressing business needs. <b>Industry</b> <b>data</b> demonstrate that poor application structural quality in core business applications (such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) or large transaction processing systems in financial services) results in cost and schedule overruns and creates waste {{in the form of}} rework (up to 45% of development time in some organizations). Moreover, poor structural quality is strongly correlated with high-impact business disruptions due to corrupted data, application outages, security breaches, and performance problems.|$|E

25|$|Administrative {{controls}} (also called chibai) {{consist of}} approved written policies, procedures, standards and guidelines. Administrative controls form {{the framework for}} running the business and managing people. They inform people on how the business is to be run and how day-to-day operations are to be conducted. Laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business. Some industry sectors have policies, procedures, standards and guidelines that must be followed – the Payment Card <b>Industry</b> <b>Data</b> Security Standard (PCI DSS) required by Visa and MasterCard is such an example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, password policy, hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.|$|E
25|$|Storm Data {{was started}} by the Weather Bureau, {{predecessor}} to the National Weather Service (NWS), in 1959. It is updated continuously {{on a monthly basis}} with a lag of a few months from the present. This delay is because the data is compiled and verified by local NWS offices and sent to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) which does further refinements and publishes Storm Data in reports covering the entire country. The local NWS offices initially gather the data, starting when a severe weather event unfolds and continuing until sufficient information is obtained. The initial data, considered preliminary, is sent in real-time to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) which does limited quality control as new information becomes available and enters it into its (and its predecessor the National Severe Storms Forecast Center) Storm Events Database that begins in 1950. Original sources of the data include {{but are not limited to}} local law enforcement, local, state, and federal emergency management, storm spotter and storm chaser reports, the news media, insurance <b>industry</b> <b>data,</b> NWS damage surveys, and reports from the general public.|$|E

Similarly, competitive intelligence offense and defense also vary according to environment. Given the evidence here that knowledge assets vary widely by industry and by firm, as do competitive intelligence efforts, organizations should scan their environments and adopt knowledge strategies appropriate to their circumstances...|$|R
