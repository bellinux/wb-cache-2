The current limits on all types of non-resident investor holdings (be they institutional or individual) are as follows: a single investor (i.e. one {{who is not a}} Ghanaian and who lives outside the country) is allowed to hold up to 10% of every equity. Secondly, for every equity, foreign investors may hold up to a cumulative total of 74% (in special circumstances, this limit may be waived). The limits also exclude trade in Ashanti Goldfields shares. These restrictions were abolished by the Foreign Exchange Act, 2006 (Act 723).|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on {{understanding}} of {{the economics of the}} <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> liberalisation in macroeconomic perspectives and, therefore, the article does not attempt to interpret or explore the legal background relating to <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> and liberalization and details of liberalization measures and their impact. The <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> {{is a part of the}} broad regulatory policy package to intervene in or guide economic activities and markets in terms of the relevant legal provisions that empower the authorities to apply such interventions in the public interest. Accordingly, the <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> and its liberalisation involve a considerable volume of legal aspects and procedures. However, the <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> as well as its liberalization should be applied and evaluated carefully with a good understanding of the underlying economics because their purpose is to promote the economic welfare of the general public.

40|$|The paper {{tries to}} give an {{analysis}} of the quantitative <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> system, which Kenya took over from the Colonial Administration at independence. After presenting the legal framework of <b>exchange</b> <b>control,</b> the paper discusses the provisions applied to the various international transactions covered by <b>exchange</b> <b>control.</b> From this presentation it becomes apparent, that the <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> administration played in the past a minor role in the formulation of policies for imports which in 1971 accounted for 77 % of all transactions in the current account. The bulk of the exchange provisions center on invisible payments, which are normally granted upon documentary proof or within specified limits. For the most important item in this section, International Investment Income, the role of the <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> administration is reduced to policing the very liberal provisions granted to investors under the foreign Investment Protection Act. The paper closes with a discussion on how the present quantitative system of <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> could be improved...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} impact that the {{relaxation}} of UK <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> in October 1979, had on the transmission of equity market volatility from the UK to other major equity markets. It is suggested {{that the existence of}} <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> in the UK was an important source of market segmentation which disturbed the transmission of shocks from one country to another, even when shocks contained global information. It is found that when a spillover GARCH(1, 1) model is estimated for the five years before and after the removal of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls,</b> volatility shocks spill over from the UK to other markets much more strongly after the removal of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls.</b> This appears to suggest that volatility as well as returns have become more closely related since the UK removed <b>exchange</b> <b>controls.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} the impact of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> on economic performance of emerging economies and South Africa in particular. Amidst South Africa’s newly established stable political environment and its reintroduction to the global economy, a fierce debate exists on whether some measure of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> are necessary or whether they should be abolished altogether. The debate also extends {{to the nature of}} the economic liberalisation process in the removal of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls,</b> either in an instantaneous “big bang” approach or in a gradual manner. The research describes arguments for both the support of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> and their abolition. This includes a description of the path South Africa has adopted and an assessment of the merits of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls.</b> Experience from other emerging economies is investigated and correlated with the South African experience. Results indicated that a gradual approach in the relaxation of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> is recommended and that domestic monetary and fiscal policy and trade reforms first before liberating the capital account. It was found that the intensive use of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> as a means of capital account restriction appears to hinder good economic performance; instead it is recommended to create and maintain an institutional environment in which the investment process can occur and where policy-makers can stimulate investment activity with a consequential elimination of capital flight.

Bermuda responded on 30 June 1972 by amending its own <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> laws accordingly, such as to impose <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> restrictions {{in relation to}} Bermuda only. At the same time, Bermuda realigned its dollar back to one-to-one with the US dollar and formally pegged it to the US dollar at that rate.

To some (natural societies), legitimatimacy of <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> is derived by associating it with certain physical signifiance of 'real' goods. <b>Exchange</b> <b>control</b> is thus decided by producers in commodity exchanges.
