In the cichlid-keeping hobby, Rusty Wessel collected one such fish, the <b>Honduran</b> Red Point Cichlid (Amatitlania sp.) from a stream in Honduras. The <b>Honduran</b> Red Point Convict ranges from Atlantic Honduras south to Costa Rica.

5|$|Then-president Carlos Roberto Flores {{estimated}} that Mitch reversed 50years {{of progress in}} the country. Officials estimated it would take at least 15years to rebuild completely. The national gross domestic product (GDP) only grew {{at a rate of}} 3% due to the storm, compared with 5.1% in 1997, due to damaged infrastructure and lingering effects. In 1999, the economy of Honduras contracted by 1.9%, largely due to the storm. The <b>Honduran</b> government increased spending by 24.7%,. much of it emergency funds to restore communications and provide relief, which caused economic deficits. This caused inflation to increase from 13.6% to 15.7%. The <b>Honduran</b> government adjusted its economic plan, including privatization of various federal entities. For two years, the government temporarily halted taxes to businesses affected by the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Mitch caused such {{massive and}} {{widespread}} damage that <b>Honduran</b> President Carlos Roberto Flores claimed it destroyed {{fifty years of}} progress in the country. Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico quickly gave help, sending 700tons of food, 11tons of medicine, four rescue planes, rescue personnel, and trained search dogs. Cuba also volunteered, sending a contingent of physicians to the country. The U.S. administration offered at first troops stationed in Honduras, and then withdrew them {{a few days after}} the storm. They also at first offered only $2million (1998USD) in aid, which came as a shock to residents, and president Carlos Roberto Flores alike. The U.S. later increased their offer to $70million (1998USD). The <b>Honduran</b> government distributed food, water, and medical services to the hurricane victims, including the more than 4million without water. In addition, the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, largely due to the destruction of crop lands. However, rebuilding provided jobs in the following years. In Costa Rica, reconstruction after the hurricane increased the number of jobs by 5.9%, lowering the unemployment rate slightly.|$|E

The two Spanish fleets soon opened fire upon each other while Olid {{attempted}} to negotiate a truce in order to delay Las Casas offshore until Briones returned.

On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed the <b>Honduran</b> town of San Pedro de Copán; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by the Guatemalan air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. The handful of bombers that the rebel forces had begun with were shot down by the Guatemalan army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide these additional planes, bolstering the rebel force. William Pawley had a crucial role to play in the delivery of these aircraft.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of 1913, Yorktown conducted local operations out of San Diego and San Francisco. In January 1914, though, the gunboat returned to Mexican waters and investigated local conditions at Ensenada between 3 and 6 January before moving, in subsequent months, to a succession of Mexican ports: Mazatlán, San Blas, Miramar, Topolobampo, and La Paz. Following an overhaul at Mare Island from 24 June to 2 September 1914, Yorktown served in Mexican waters again into June 1915. From that point until the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917, Yorktown continued her routine of patrols off Mexican, Nicaraguan, and <b>Honduran</b> ports with occasional repairs at Mare Island and maneuvers out of San Diego.|$|E

5|$|In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became {{governor}} of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.

Work then began on building a highway from the port to the new capital of the colony, modern Antigua Guatemala, following the Motagua Valley into the highlands. Indigenous guides scouting the route from the highlands would not proceed further downriver than three leagues below Quiriguá, because the area was inhabited by the hostile Toquegua.|$|E

The <b>Honduran</b> government put its military, police, and Red Cross on standby in advance of the storm, due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Fifi in 1974. However, unlike Fifi, which caused deadly floods in the region four years prior and took a similar track, Greta did not cause as significant river flooding in Honduras.|$|E
