40|$|In Benin, family {{poultry farming}} {{has become an}} {{important}} activity in economic and social aspects that contribute to food security, poverty reduction and well-being. However, current information about poultry production and consumption is still limited. This information {{would be useful to}} improve the sustainable exploitation of agricultural and commercial genetic resources. We aimed to identify and assess the socio-economic and phenotypic features as well as to investigate phenotypic variability and growth performance of guinea <b>fowls</b> <b>raised</b> under different environments. Growth performance and survival rates of local guinea fowl varieties were recorded in three zones of Benin: Collines, Atacora and Borgou. Seven varieties, Gray, Common, Bonaparte, White, Black, Isabelle and Multicolored, were identified in Benin. The farmers choose a variety to be raised based on breeding system, agro-ecological zone, disease resistance, market price and production purpose. Bonaparte, Common and Gray varieties emerged as the most resistant whereas White, Black and Gray outperformed in growth and may be used for breeding purposes. The semi-confinement system could be recommended for startup as a temporary solution to improve production of local guinea fowls in Benin. The existence of several varieties on farms does not encourage genetic conservation and improvement of these resources. Establishing selection or crossbreeding programs in controlled environments would be more appropriate for guinea <b>fowls</b> <b>raised</b> in Benin. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Blindness was {{observed}} in 10 day-old Guinea fowl chicks. The incidence {{during the first week}} after its appearance ranged from 25 to 40 % in a population of 100, 000 Guinea <b>fowl</b> <b>raised</b> on different farms. At the beginning of the syndrome the clinical signs of blindness in birds included aimless wandering and increased mortality rate due to starvation (2 - 3 % over the average). The birds lacked pupillary reflexes to light and there were no gross lesions in the eyes. Histologically there was degeneration and disorganization of photoreceptors in the retina. The Guinea fowl chicks came from three different breeder sources but all the birds were given the same feed. The condition was not observed in the subsequent flocks that came from the same breeder sources but were given different feed. Based on these observations toxicity of feed is suspected as the cause of blindness in the Guinea fowl...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY-Antibodies for Bryan Rous sarcoma virus {{indicating}} {{infection with}} a member or members of group A avian sarcoma leukosis viruses were Found in sera of game Fowl, including wild ducks, Francolins, guinea fowl, bustards, and ostriches, in three areas of Kenya (Lake Naivasha, Makindu, and Selengai). Antibodies for group A viruses were also common in sera of domestic chickens, whether maintained on a large, commercial farm or in small flocks in native villages. Infection with these agents could apparently maintain itself in game Fowl with different social habits (guinea fowl vs. bustards) and contact between game fowl and domestic chickens did not seem essential to the persistence of infection in either group. Sera obtained from domesticated game <b>fowl</b> <b>raised</b> in the United States were all negative for antibodies to the group A viruses.

40|$|Abstract. The {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the performance indices and physiologic changes in pearl guinea fowls (Numida meleagris) supplemented with molasses through drinking water. A total of thirty-two (n= 32) day-old pearl guinea <b>fowls</b> <b>raised</b> to 12 -week-old {{were used for the}} study. The fowls were randomly allocated to two groups (control and experimental) of 16 fowls each, with each having two replicates. Experimental fowls were given 5 mL molasses per litre of drinking water for 8 weeks, while control fowls were given only drinking water. Performance indices which include: feed consumption, water intake and percentage weight gain were measured. Rectal temperature was measured and blood samples were collected to evaluate the changes in haematological parameters, serum triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4) concentrations.  Results revealed that the molasses-treated fowls had significantly (P< 0. 05) higher percentage weight gain, blood total protein, packed cell volume and mean corpuscular volume compared to control. However, the feed consumptionwas significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in the molasses-treated fowls compared to control. In both groups, rectal temperature increased significantly (P< 0. 05) during the afternoon hours and was lower (P< 0. 05) in molasses-treated fowls than control during the evening hours. There {{was no significant difference in}} other haematological parameters, serum glucose, T 4 and T 3 betweengroups. In conclusion, molasses supplementation decreased feed consumption, improved body weight gain and enhanced nutritional status and erythropoiesis in guinea fowls...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{evaluated the}} growth of breast and leg muscle fibers of domestic <b>fowl</b> <b>raised</b> in two enclosure sizes (SE: Small Enclosure, 1. 125 m 2 / 10 birds; LE: Large Enclosure, 5. 25 m 2 / 10 birds). In breast muscles, the number of fibers per area decreased over time and higher values were observed in broilers housed in SE compared to LE. The fiber size increased with age and was greater in LE than SE at 56 days of age, suggesting greater hypertrophic growth of fibers in breast muscle for broilers maintained in LE. In leg muscles, the muscle cross-sectional area was greater for broilers raised in LE than SE at 56 days of age and decreased from 42 to 56 days of age in broilers raised in SE, suggesting leg muscle atrophy in these birds. The Fast Glycolytic (FG), Fast Oxidative-Glycolytic (FOG) and Slow Oxidative (SO) fibers grew until 42 days of age in both enclosure sizes. The area of FOG fibers was greater in broilers raised in LE than those in SE at 28 and 56 days of age; in LE-raised broilers, the SO area was greater at 28, 42 and 56 days of age, suggesting that the muscles of broilers housed in LE are more oxidative. The BW gain was greater for broilers raised in LE than SE, whereas BW, feed intake and feed conversion were not influenced by enclosure size. Thus, the enclosure space affected hypertrophic growth and metabolic characteristics of breast and leg muscle fibers. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2012...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{current study}} investigates the anti-stress effects of clove (Eugenia caryophyllus) {{extracts}} (0, 200, 400, and 600  mg/kg) on serum antioxidant biomarkers, immune response, immunological organ growth index, and expression levels of acute phase proteins (APPs); ovotransferrin (OVT), ceruloplasmin (CP), ceruloplasmin (AGP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum amyloid-A (SAA) mRNA in the immunological organs of 63 -d-old male black-meated Silkie fowls subjected to 21 d chronic heat stress at 35 [*]±[*] 2  °C. Results The results demonstrated that clove extract supplementation {{in the diet}} of Silkie fowls subjected to elevated temperature (ET) improve growth performance, immune responses, and suppressed the activities of glutathion peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD); reduced serum malonaldehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) concentrations when compared with <b>fowls</b> <b>raised</b> under thermoneutral condition (TC). Upon chronic heat stress and supplementation of clove extracts, the Silkie fowls showed a linear increase in GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, and TXNRD activities (P[*]=[*] 0. 01) compared with fowls fed diets without clove extract. ET decreased (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) the growth index of the liver, spleen, bursa of Fabricius and thymus. However, the growth index of the liver, spleen, bursa of Fabricius and thymus increased significantly (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) which corresponded {{to an increase in}} clove supplemented levels. The expression of OVT, CP, AGP, CRP, and SAA mRNA in the liver, spleen, bursa of Fabricius and thymus were elevated (P[*]<[*] 0. 01) by ET compared with those maintained at TC. Nevertheless, clove mitigates heat stress-induced overexpression of OVT, CP, AGP, CRP and SAA mRNA in the immune organs of fowls fed 400  mg clove/kg compared to other groups. Conclusions The results showed that clove extracts supplementation decreased oxidative stress in the heat-stressed black-meated fowls by alleviating negative effects of heat stress via improvement in growth performance, antioxidant defense mechanisms, immunity, and regulate the expression of acute phase genes in the liver and immunological organs...|$|R

Champagne has grown too common among {{them to be}} mentioned, and roast <b>fowls,</b> <b>raised</b> pies, and lobster-salad, have become mere drugs. The very tall young man has recovered his spirits, and again alludes to the exciseman. His comrade's eye begins to emulate his own, and he, too, stares at objects without taking cognizance thereof. There is a general redness {{in the faces of}} the ladies; in the face of Mrs Perch particularly, who is joyous and beaming, and lifted so far above the cares of life, that if she were asked just now to direct a wayfarer to Ball's Pond, where her own cares lodge, she would have some difficulty in recalling the way. Mr Towlinson has proposed the happy pair; to which the silver-headed butler has responded neatly, and with emotion; for he half begins to think he is an old retainer of the family, and that he is bound to be affected by these changes. The whole party, and especially the ladies, are very frolicsome. Mr Dombey's cook, who generally takes the lead in society, has said, it is impossible to settle down after this, and why not go, in a party, to the play? Everybody (Mrs Perch included) has agreed to this; even the Native, who is tigerish in his drink, and who alarms the ladies (Mrs Perch particularly) by the rolling of his eyes. One of the very tall young men has even proposed a ball after the play, and it presents itself to no one (Mrs Perch included) in the light of an impossibility. Words have arisen between the housemaid and Mr Towlinson; she, on the authority of an old saw, asserting marriages to be made in Heaven: he, affecting to trace the manufacture elsewhere; he, supposing that she says so, because she thinks of being married her own self: she, saying, Lord forbid, at any rate, that she should ever marry him. To calm these flying taunts, the silver-headed butler rises to propose the health of Mr Towlinson, whom to know is to esteem, and to esteem is to wish well settled in life with the object of his choice, wherever (here the silver-headed butler eyes the housemaid) she may be. Mr Towlinson returns thanks in a speech replete with feeling, of which the peroration turns on foreigners, regarding whom he says they may find favour, sometimes, with weak and inconstant intellects that can be led away by hair, but all he hopes, is, he may never hear of no foreigner never boning nothing out of no travelling chariot. The eye of Mr Towlinson is so severe and so expressive here, that the housemaid is turning hysterical, when she and all the rest, roused by the intelligence that the Bride is going away, hurry upstairs to witness her departure.|$|R

The most important crop in the municipality is coconut as the number one producer in the state, accounting for over sixty percent of cropland. Other important crops include cacao and bananas. Corn and beans are generally grown in small plots for family consumption. Livestock is not an important economic product although some cattle, pigs and domestic <b>fowl</b> is <b>raised.</b> There are still some tropical hardwood trees such as mahogany which is mostly used to make furniture. Fishing occurs in both ocean and fresh waters catching sea bass, shrimp and shellfish. It is a major producer and distributor of oysters and lately of edible jellyfish, most of which is farmed. However, fishing has been threatened {{by a number of}} factors. Oil spills and red tide have led to closure of fishing areas. In the 2000s, wild oyster yields dropped almost fifty percent in the lagoons of the Tabasco coast. It is traditional here for men to harvest oysters and the women to process them but this economic model is disappearing. Over exploitation of the mollusk is the main reason behind the drop in production. A study by the Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco strongly recommends the implementation of oyster farming to replace reliance on oysters growing wild, with state authorities also pushing for this change. However, local fishermen have been resistant to outside interference.|$|R
50|$|Broiler {{chickens}} (Gallus gallus domesticus), or broilers, are a gallinaceous domesticated <b>fowl,</b> bred and <b>raised</b> {{specifically for}} meat production. They are {{a hybrid of}} the egg-laying chicken, both being a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Typical broilers have white feathers and yellowish skin. Most commercial broilers reach slaughter-weight at between five and seven weeks of age, although slower growing breeds reach slaughter-weight at approximately 14 weeks of age. Because the meat broilers are this young at slaughter, their behaviour and physiology are that of an immature bird. Due to artificial selection for rapid early growth and the husbandry used to sustain this, broilers are susceptible to several welfare concerns, particularly skeletal malformation and dysfunction, skin and eye lesions, and congestive heart conditions. The breeding stock (broiler-breeders) grow to maturity and beyond but also have welfare {{issues related to the}} frustration of a high feeding motivation and beak trimming. Broilers are usually grown as mixed-sex flocks in large sheds under intensive conditions, but some breeds can be grown as free-range flocks.

The ADFI and ADG of 3 breeds of Korean local chicken were greater than those of silky fowl (p< 0. 05). Within the Korean local breeds, ADFI of white-mini broiler was the highest (p< 0. 05), and ADG of Hanhyup- 3 -ho and white-mini broiler was the highest (p< 0. 05). Gain:feed of silky fowl was less than that of the 3 breeds of Korean local chicken. The carcass and breast yield of white-mini broiler were the greater than those of other breeds (p< 0. 05). The breast meat color (CIE L*, a*, and b*) of 3 breeds of Korean local chicken were higher than that of silky fowl (p< 0. 05). The breast meat of Hanhyup- 3 -ho had greater cooking loss (p< 0. 05), whereas water holding capacity and pH were less than those of other breeds (p< 0. 05). The color score of 3 breeds of Korean local chicken was higher than that of silky fowl (p< 0. 05). Woorimatdag had a higher score on tenderness (p< 0. 05), whereas flavor score was less than that of other breeds (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Adapt! Adopt! Be adept! The exhortations of well, {{of those}} who exhort rain down {{every day on the}} heads of farmers. Out in the field, the {{flexibility}} of agricultural systems is not top of the agenda, but just how far should a farmer look ahead? Come fly with us. Only a bird could do this. Imagine (we exhort you) that you are a bird. You are a bird flying on your annual autumn migration from Finland to the Niger delta in Mali. Your journey takes you over northern seas unnaturally full of algae and empty of fish, over fields of temperate Europe, yellow with the harvests of rapeseed, sunflower and maize, and brown with the ploughed stalks of wheat too dear to harvest, over the quasi-deserts of southern Europe full of subsidised olive trees and hydroponic tomatoes, down over the citrus orchards of north Africa and its reviving vineyards, before crossing the bleak Sahara. Less than a hundred years ago, it would have looked different, very different. Smaller fields, many more woods and forests, less dust in the air, less glare from glass-housed surfaces, the nights unscarred by streaks of light, and more errant insects to snap up out of the airstream. Why the change? Was it man who chose to change, man, that most conservative of beasts? In a way, yes, because the hand of the farmer changed the fields. It was not, though, the farmer who had the idea. His hand was guided by changing markets, in turn steered by interventionist politicians responding to changes in land use, in population, in governance, and to changes in climate (though they are only recently understood, and then only slightly). Come, now, come back down, down to the ground, back to being the farmer. We all recognise the changes seen by the generations of birds. Of our generations, of Spore readers, our adult feet have all trodden and trudged the soils of {{the second half of the}} last century and we have all seen changes happen to our countryside, our livelihood and our cultures. The deserted or deserting villages and smallholdings of our youth, the arrival of new land owners, or vacationing visitors, from the town. The building of long sheds by men with strange accents to <b>raise</b> <b>fowl</b> that neither walk nor fly, to sell in town. The demise of your entire groundnut sector because of newly discovered consumer allergies in another continent. The fun of watching strangers telling you how to plough straight, and you beating them in a ploughing competition. The long walks to school and to market replaced, for the fortunate, by journeys on pedal bikes and mopeds and trucks. The intrusion of radio and television, blaring out their, your, reasons to leave and reasons to stay, like a nanny goat unsure what to bleat, but not knowing what else she should do. And they say that nothing ever happens, nothing ever changes, in the countryside. No way. It s in the town that things don t change so much. The crowding, smells, hustle and bustle, the anonymity of city life, and the regret that country life will not, apparently, provide a living for our nearest and dearest. A city life is fuller of shared regrets than it is of shared harvests, yet it is the countryside that they exhort to adapt, to be flexible. Change is always with us Why is there so much talk about change in agriculture at the moment? It is a tad incongruous, is it not, to see so much nervous twitching about change in a profession where it is known that some things just cannot be hurried along. At the level of global macropolicy, specialists are struggling to practise the very imprecise art of balancing agricultural production with masses of other inter-related issues: biodiversity, cultural diversity, economic diversity, ecology, energy, employment, empowerment, food security, gender, health, industry, least-developed, rural life, trade, water to name but a few (in alphabetical order). During these considerations, a recurring concern is that the agricultural systems of the ACP States and other developing countries may not be flexible and resilient enough to face up to the challenges of globalisation, or the threats of climate change. The problems lie not in flexibility, but in being able to look ahead clearly. Globalisation, like climate change, is not the splinter new phenomenon that some people like to pretend. Climate change, with its hot and cold flushes, has been affecting people on the planet for ages. Globalisation, a man-made process, is younger but no babe either. Used as a code word for The Strange, The Innovative and The Opportunity, for a Threat to be tamed and harnessed, communities have been dealing with this reality ever since man first saw a horizon. What is perhaps new is the scale and the pace of each phenomenon; what is surely new is the depth and complexity of our understanding of it, however incomplete it may be. Opposing directions, or rainbow farming? What do these phenomena mean to the farmer? What do they mean in terms of priorities for those who should serve the farmer the scientist, the banker, the trader even though they may describe their role differently. There are routes attracting us whichever way we look, enticing us to serve different markets. A seminal list of attractions was recently set out by Stein Bie, the director general of the International Service for National Agricultural Research, for his own profession of soil scientists, but his routes (ladders) have a general value: the green ladder, which emphasises natural resource management; the equity ladder, stressing fair development aimed at poverty eradication; the eco-label ladder, producing healthy, often organic, food and the cheap food ladder, maintaining high-yielding agriculture. To choose one route to market will mean missing out, in part, on the benefits of the others. They are in part an illusion of contradictions, in part complementary, a sort of rainbow agriculture. Each route requires obtaining and investing various forms of capital, of which the single most important element is probably information, namely on production techniques and the nature and needs of the market. There are countless examples, starting with a farm near you, of the flexibility of the ACP farmer in shifting production towards export of organic, or fair, or dinner-party products, or meeting regional demand. With access to adequate financial, social and informational capital, such a change can be made. But can the next? And the next? Agriculture needs actuaries The smart farmer these days, the one who plays her or his cards right, is the one with ideas about the changes after tomorrow s changes. On some you can take a well-informed guess, if you analyse recurring themes in Spore and other agricultural media: the costs of energy and transport, water stress, and the regulations affecting food hygiene and safety, will be but three key factors of increasing importance in ACP agriculture s choices. There are other, less tangible elements, of which volatile climate changes will probably have the most impact. It may well be that future agricultural practices will need to be more sheltered, perhaps more intensive in management if not in energy input, and more separated from the environment whilst being more respectful of natural cycles. The potential of hydroponics, featured in this Spore, could be a example of such agriculture. How can a farmer plan, how can a policy maker shape an enabling environment, and how can a trader invest in a supply chain, without being able to calculate risk? Each of these players in the food chain is flexible, pliable and adaptable, but they each need to be able to see further ahead. Information systems must start to address the issue of assessing and covering risk. In past issues of Spore we have urged the banker and the planner to join the trader and the farmer. Perhaps the next partner to join in strengthening our agriculture is the insurance agent; few know better than the actuary how to plan for the day after tomorrow.
