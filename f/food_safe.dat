2500|$|Absolute poverty, extreme poverty, or abject {{poverty is}} [...] "a {{condition}} characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including <b>food,</b> <b>safe</b> drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information. It depends {{not only on}} income but also on access to services." [...] The term 'absolute poverty', when used in this fashion, is usually synonymous with 'extreme poverty': Robert McNamara, {{the former president of}} the World Bank, described absolute or extreme poverty as, [...] "a condition so limited by malnutrition, illiteracy, disease, squalid surroundings, high infant mortality, and low life expectancy as to be beneath any reasonable definition of human decency." [...] Australia is one of the world's wealthier nations. In his article published in Australian Policy Online, Robert Tanton notes that, [...] "While this amount is appropriate for third world countries, in Australia, the amount required to meet these basic needs will naturally be much higher because prices of these basic necessities are higher." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the impoverished}} {{population}} exists {{a wide range}} of real income, from less than $2 USD a day, to the United States poverty threshold, which is $22,350 for a family of four. Within impoverished populations, being relatively versus absolutely impoverished can determine health outcomes, in their severity and type of ailment. According to the World Health Organization, the poorest of all, globally, are the least healthy. Those in the lowest economic distribution of health, marginalized and excluded, and countries whose historical exploitation and inequality in global institutions of power and policy-making, suffer the worst health outcomes. As such, two broad categories distinguish between relative severity of poverty. Absolute poverty is the severe deprivation of basic human needs such as <b>food,</b> <b>safe</b> drinking water and shelter, and is used as a minimum standard below which no one should fall regardless of where they live. It is measured in relation to the 'poverty line' or the lowest amount of money needed to sustain human life. Relative poverty is [...] "the inability to afford the goods, services, and activities needed to fully participate in a given society." [...] Relative poverty still results in bad health outcomes because of the diminished agency of the impoverished. Certain personal, household factors, such as living conditions, are more or less unstable {{in the lives of the}} impoverished and represent the determining factors for health amongst the poverty gradient. According to Mosley, these factors prove challenging to individuals in poverty and are responsible for health deficits amongst the general impoverished population. Having sufficient access to a minimum amount of food that is nutritious and sanitary plays an important part in building health and reducing disease transmission. Access to sufficient amounts of quality water for drinking, bathing, and food preparation determines health and exposure to disease. Clothing that provides appropriate climatic protection and resources to wash clothes and bedding appropriately to prevent irritation, rashes, and parasitic life are also important to health.Housing, including size, quality, ventilation, crowding, sanitation, and separation, prove paramount in determining health and spread of disease. Availability of fuel for adequate sterilizing of eating utensils and food and the preservation of food proves necessary to promote health. Transportation, which provides access to medical care, shopping, and employment, proves absolutely essential. Hygienic and preventative care, including soap and insecticides, and vitamins and contraceptives, are necessary for maintaining health. Differential access to these life essentials depending on ability to afford with a given income results in differential health.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Food safety {{education}} {{is most effective}} when messages are targeted toward changing behaviors most {{likely to result in}} foodborne illness. The five major control factors for pathogens are personal hygiene, adequate cooking, avoiding cross-contamination, keeping <b>food</b> at <b>safe</b> temperatures, and avoiding foods from unsafe sources. Pathogens associated with poor personal hygiene have the highest incidence and costs. Inadequate cooking and cross-contamination have lower incidence. Keeping <b>food</b> at <b>safe</b> temperatures and unsafe food sources have the lowest incidence, although costs per case are sometimes very high. We recommend that consumer food safety educators primarily focus on hand washing, adequate cooking, and avoiding cross-contam-ination. Secondary messages should focus on keeping <b>food</b> at <b>safe</b> temperatures and avoiding food from an unsafe source. Evaluation tools are needed to evaluate self-reported behavior changes. The evaluation questions must focus on salient behaviors that are most likely to result in foodborne illnesses and must withstand rigor-ous standards of reliability and validity.
