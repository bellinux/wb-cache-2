5|$|The {{identity}} {{of the old man}} remains unclear, though context implies that he may be Pattern Recognition's protagonist Cayce Pollard's father, having removed himself from the channels of normal life to focus on disrupting what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> criminal elements operating in the United States Government.|$|E
5|$|Jürgen von Beckerath is less {{assertive}} about Sheshi's {{identity and}} assigns {{him to his}} combined 15th/16th Dynasty, where he regroups Hyksos rulers whose chronological position is uncertain together with kings whom <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> vassals of the Hyksos. Von Beckerath's analysis relies on the hypothesis that Manetho's 16th Dynasty comprised minor rulers of the Nile Delta region, called lesser Hyksos, who served the great Hyksos kings of the 15th Dynasty such as Khyan and Apophis.|$|E
5|$|Referring {{to the two}} ontological {{arguments}} {{proposed by}} Anselm in Chapters 2 and 3 of his Proslogion, Malcolm supported Kant's criticism of Anselm's argument in Chapter 2: that existence cannot be a perfection of something. However, he identified what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the second ontological argument in Chapter 3 which is not susceptible to such criticism.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} widely {{divergent}} views on Khayyám. At {{one end of the}} spectrum, there are nightclubs named after Khayyám, and <b>he</b> is <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an agnostic hedonist. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, <b>he</b> is <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a mystical Sufi Muslim poet with a complex set of ideals.|$|R
5|$|The Sermons, a {{political}} treatise composed {{in the guise}} of sermons, went almost unnoticed by contemporaries. In the Sermons, Skarga discusses what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the problems of the ailing Commonwealth: lack of patriotism, internal quarrels, tolerance of heretics, the king's relative powerlessness, perverse laws (a critique of the nobility's Golden Freedoms), and immorality. Another notable aspect of the book is its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs (the peasants).|$|E
5|$|The South African comics writer Anton Kannemeyer has parodied the {{perceived}} racist {{nature of the}} book to highlight what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the continuing racist undertones of South African society. In his Pappa in Afrika (2010), a satire of Tintin in the Congo, he portrays Tintin as an Afrikaner with racist views of indigenous Africans.|$|E
5|$|Anniyan (English: Outsider or Stranger) is a 2005 Indian Tamil-language {{psychological}} thriller film {{written and}} directed by S. Shankar and produced by V. Ravichandran of Aascar Films. The plot centres on a disillusioned everyman whose frustration at what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> increasing social apathy and public negligence leads to a split personality that attempts to right the system. Vikram stars as Ramanujam, an idealistic, law-abiding lawyer who suffers from multiple personality disorder and develops two other identities: a metrosexual fashion model Remo and a vigilante serial killer named Anniyan. Sadha plays his love interest, Nandini. Actors Vivek, Prakash Raj, Nedumudi Venu and Nassar also feature in the film.|$|E

5|$|Konnan {{is known}} to be outspoken, and in the last decade, he has been openly {{critical}} of promotions that he feels have mistreated either himself personally or the talent in general. He has been particularly outspoken against what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> racism against Latino wrestlers in United States promotions – he butted heads with TNA over treatment of himself and Ron Killings, and WWE over issues regarding Latino wrestlers Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio, but he has also come into conflict with AAA over what he alleged was non-payment of talent.|$|E
5|$|The Almost Nearly Perfect People {{is divided}} into five {{sections}} for Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden. Beginning with Denmark, Booth explains the Danish concept of hygge ("cosy times"), which <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> conformism. He criticises the Danish population's environmental footprint and notes that their taxation rate and levels of personal debt are {{among the highest in}} the world. Moving to Iceland, Booth details the banking practices that led to the collapse of the country's largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the popular belief among Icelanders in the existence of Huldufólk (elves).|$|E
5|$|The pair {{interview}} {{the cast and}} crew as suspects, discovering that many would benefit from either of the deaths—producer Kenny Neiderman had been having an affair with Danbury; Rowdy Beeman replaced Carroll as director; Ruby Dahl and Ramona Tangent, whose roles in the film will expand without Danbury; and Mark Bianco, a method actor relishing the opportunity to meet Black, whose role he plays. Also questioned is Hugo Winston, the man whose partner was murdered in the earlier case and who is campaigning against what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> a disrespectful production.|$|E

5|$|With The Birds a box-office success, Hitchcock and Hedren {{begin work}} on Marnie. However, Hedren finds the film's content (including a marital-rape scene) and Hitchcock's {{obsession}} with her mentally and emotionally exhausting. The director is frustrated by what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> Hedren's coldness towards him. During {{a conversation with}} writer Evan Hunter, Hitchcock admits that he has erectile dysfunction and his only sexual partner is his wife (screenwriter Alma Reville). He later declares his love for Hedren; she walks away, leaving him frustrated and further rejected.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E
5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> a threat to his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings {{form the basis of}} the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Chandrakumar is {{attacked}} by his company's labourers {{because he had}} suspended their union leader. Divya brings him to a nearby hospital, where he survives after receiving treatment. After he is discharged from the hospital, Divya takes care of him and realises that she has {{fallen in love with}} him. She tries to show it by wearing the anklets Chandrakumar gave her shortly after their marriage but, irritated by what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> Divya's immaturity, Chandrakumar asks her to return to her parents home and books her trip. At the railway station, Chandrakumar gives Divya the divorce papers that she had requested as a wedding gift. Divya breaks down, telling Chandrakumar that she loves him, and they reconcile.|$|E
5|$|His third studio album, titled Mockingbird (2005), was {{released}} on December 26, 2005. The album touches on subjects such as politics, social justice, and war. Webb has stated that he tackled these subjects to stimulate discussion and engage people to bring about changes in what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> {{some of the greatest}} problems the world is facing today. In order to broaden this discussion to people less inclined to purchase his album, beginning September 1, 2006, Webb offered Mockingbird for free on the website Free Derek Webb (no longer exists), where it was available for download until December 8, 2006. Over 80,000 free copies of the album were downloaded during this time.|$|E
5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this {{was the right thing to}} do someday.|$|E

5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> a path to combating poverty.|$|E
5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number of reports {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles {{to make sense of}} what <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse makes no sense if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at the well and the sacrifice in the temple could be two different versions of the story or, alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Naomi {{lives with}} her hippy mother Gina (Olivia Colman) and fifteen other people in a {{communal}} living arrangement. This {{is a source of}} annoyance to Naomi, whose privacy is invaded when she wakes up one morning, naked, to discover that a male hippy is sleeping in her bed. At college, she avoids Emily to meet with her politics teacher Kieran instead. In the students' common room, they are informed of the upcoming elections for Student President. Emily encourages Naomi to run for president, but Naomi refuses. She later comes across Cook, who tries to persuade her to have sex with him. She jokingly tells him that he has a better chance of winning the student elections, which <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> a challenge and decides to register. Kieran walks her {{home at the end of}} the day and urges her to run in the elections, giving her a registration form. When she arrives at her house, she finds Emily waiting in her bedroom with another registration form. Emily starts to leave when Naomi is rude and standoffish to herdespite taking Emily's advice to enter the electionsbut returns and confronts her. She coldly tells her that she is not obsessed with pursuing a sexual relationship with her, and Naomi suggests she stay the night with her.|$|E
