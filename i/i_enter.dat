25|$|In his mid-twenties in {{the early}} 1960s, he {{switched}} to race walking. Ladany walked his first race in 1962. Commenting on the sport, he reflected:You need {{a certain type of}} mental attitude: a willingness to take punishment, to have a lack of comfort, and pain, to continue and continue. I'm not a psychologist, but was I stubborn, so I entered race walking? Or did <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> race walking, and become stubborn? It's the same in all long-distance events. Quitters don't win, and winners don't quit.|$|E
25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
500|$|Shays's Rebellion {{contributed to}} the belief that the Articles of Confederation needed to be revised. In 1787, delegates to the Philadelphia Convention, instead of {{revising}} the Articles, created a new United States Constitution with a much stronger national government. The Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, when Adams expressed his displeasure. [...] "I confess," [...] he wrote to Richard Henry Lee in 1787, [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> the Building I stumble at the Threshold. I meet with a National Government, instead of a Federal Union of States." [...] Adams was one of those derisively labeled [...] "Anti-Federalists" [...] by proponents of the new Constitution, who called themselves [...] "Federalists". Adams was elected to the Massachusetts ratifying convention which met in January 1788. Despite his reservations, Adams rarely spoke at the convention, and listened carefully to the arguments rather than raising objections. Adams and John Hancock had reconciled, and they finally agreed to give their support for the Constitution, with the proviso that some amendments be added later. Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.|$|E

500|$|On 30 April 1827, Abbott {{was made}} Baron Tenterden, of Hendon in the County of Middlesex; having feared that [...] "Lord Abbott" [...] would leave him open to ridicule, he instead picked {{the name of}} a Kentish town near his roots. On 24 May Abbott {{formally}} took up his position, attending the House of Lords regularly, and was the last Chief Justice to wear his official robes to the Lords (other than those acting as interim Speakers). In 1830 he introduced several bills to Parliament following reports {{on the state of the}} Ecclesiastical Courts, common law courts and law of real property; all were passed, except the ecclesiastical bills, as Parliament ran out of time to hear them. They were heard during the next Parliamentary session in 1831, and both passed; they [...] "by no means established for him the reputation of a skilful legislator... the judges have found it infinitely difficult to put a reasonable construction upon them". The Reform Act 1832 led to his departure from the Lords, and is considered to have greatly shortened his life; he fought strongly for the city corporations, which he claimed the bill treated [...] "with absolute contempt", but would be defeated. Having threatened that, should it pass, [...] "Never, never my Lords, shall <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> the doors of this House", he was true to his word, and never returned to politics, although from 8 August to 3 September 1827 he was interim Chancellor of the Exchequer, following the convention that, when vacant, the position should be held by the Lord Chief Justice.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{during its}} decline, Sparta never forgot {{its claim to}} be the [...] "defender of Hellenism" [...] and its Laconic wit.

2500|$|The Symphony No. 1 in G minor, [...] "Sérieuse", was {{the only}} one of Berwald's four symphonies that was {{performed}} in his lifetime. In 1843, it was premiered in Stockholm with his cousin Johan Frederik conducting the Royal Opera House Orchestra. At that same concert, his operetta Jag går i kloster (<b>I</b> <b>enter</b> a monastery) was also performed, but its success is credited to one of the roles having been sung by Jenny Lind. In 1846, Jenny Lind sang in one of Berwald's cantatas. Another operetta, The Modiste, had less success in 1845.|$|E

Kojima has noted that growing up he was a {{latchkey}} kid, often having to look after himself {{when he came home}} from school. Staying at home by himself in isolation still affects him to this day stating, [...] " [...] I travel and stay at a hotel I put the TV on as soon as <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> the room, just to deal with the feeling of loneliness." ...|$|E
