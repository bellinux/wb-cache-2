5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E
25|$|According to an Egyptian {{telegram}} {{intercepted by}} the Israelis, the forces {{in what would}} become the Fallujah Pocket were ordered to move to Beersheba, not knowing of the Israeli plan to take the town. Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion did not believe in the IDF's ability to take Beersheba in such a short time, but the telegram significantly increased the town's importance <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> he worked to delay the United Nations-imposed ceasefire as much as possible so that it could be taken.|$|E
25|$|The {{final scene}} {{takes place in}} the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its unkempt riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems {{determined}} to wed Christine and expresses his love for her ("Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and The Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade and he turns back, with a determined and violent look <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> produces a Priest and Chorus Girl to bear witness to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, The Persian {{and the rest of the}} group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In act of love to Christine, The Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms ("Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain").Christine remarks that The Phantom was always the angel of music ("He Will Not Go Without A Friend").|$|E

500|$|Nelson's {{body was}} placed in a cask of brandy mixed with camphor and myrrh, which was then lashed to the Victory's {{mainmast}} and placed under guard. Victory was towed to Gibraltar after the battle, and on arrival the body was transferred to a lead-lined coffin filled with spirits of wine. Collingwood's dispatches about the battle were carried to England aboard , and when the news arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news of Nelson's death to Emma Hamilton. She later recalled, They brought me word, Mr Whitby from the Admiralty. [...] "Show him in directly", I said. He came in, and with a pale countenance and faint voice, said, [...] "We have gained a great Victory." [...] – [...] "Never mind your Victory", I said. [...] "My letters – give me my letters" [...] – Captain Whitby was unable to speak – tears <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> a deathly paleness over his face made me comprehend him. I believe I gave a scream and fell back, and for ten hours I could neither speak nor shed a tear.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tillery {{describes}} {{the making of}} Chants of India as a [...] "labor of love" [...] for Harrison following his participation in the Beatles' Anthology project, and Barham similarly recalls it as having been [...] "a pleasure working on this beautiful record". In Shankar's recollection, following a playback {{of some of the}} tracks, Harrison was so moved that he [...] "embraced me with tears <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> simply said, 'Thank you, Ravi, for this music.'" [...] According to Lavezzoli, the album was one of Shankar's [...] "personal favorite works".|$|E
2500|$|The yeth hound, {{also called}} the yell hound, is a black dog found in Devon folklore. According to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the yeth hound is a {{headless}} dog, {{said to be the}} spirit of an unbaptised child, which rambles through the woods at night making wailing noises. The yeth hound is also mentioned in The Denham Tracts. It may have been one inspiration for the ghost dog in The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, described as [...] "an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen" [...] - with fire <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> breath (Hausman 1997:47).|$|E

2500|$|By age {{fourteen}} Thad had {{ventured out}} on his own first to Portland, Maine, then back to Boston where he joined his older brother Joseph in the shoe [...] cutting trade. At eighteen Thad became quite ill and returned home. While he was still recuperating, his younger brother invited him to attend a chemistry lecture by one Professor Reginald Dinkelhoff featuring the phenomenon of lighter-than-air gases, specifically hydrogen. When the Professor requested a volunteer from the audience, an eager Thaddeus jumped to the fore. Dinkelhoff could see the interest <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> after the show offered to take him on the road with him as an assistant. Lowe did so and after two years, upon the professor’s retirement, bought out the show using the appellation “Thaddeus Sobieski Counlicourt Lowe, Professor of Chemistry.” ...|$|E
2500|$|With Joe Fall still {{unavailable}} {{because of}} an injury sustained in pre-season training, Charles Partridge was replaced in goal by reserve Jim Roach, who made an eventful debut at local rivals Aston Villa. According to the Birmingham Daily Post, he should take no blame {{for any of the}} five goals conceded before half-time, {{due in part to the}} sun <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> with the half-backs [...] "little more than landmarks on the field". On change of ends, the balance of play tilted towards the visitors, but the match still finished 7–3. Fall returned to fitness for Small Heath's third defeat of the season, at home to Stoke in a game characterised by excessive foul play. At Nottingham Forest, Tommy Hands and Jack Hallam were lively on the wings, but the weakness of the half-back line was noted in yet another loss.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the fourth}} round, Ali coasted, keeping his distance. However, when he {{returned}} to his corner, he started complaining that there was something burning <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> he could not see. [...] "I didn't know what the heck was going on", Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, recalled on an NBC special 25 years later. [...] "He said, 'cut the gloves off. I want to prove to the world there's dirty work afoot.' And I said, 'whoa, whoa, back up baby. C'mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. What are you doing? Sit down!' So I get him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever's there, but before I did that I put my pinkie in his eye and I put it into my eye. It burned like hell. There was something caustic in both eyes." ...|$|E

2500|$|During this period, Tidwell {{would often}} return home from New York to Virginia Beach, to be [...] "rejuvenated" [...] and {{teach at the}} studio with his mother. [...] While still active in dance, Tidwell's career was losing focus, and his mother feared that he was losing his love for dance. That changed in late 2006 when the two went to see Tidwell's brother, Travis, perform in the So You Think You Can Dance tour in Madison Square Gardens. Travis had come in second place during the {{previous}} season, and was heavily featured in the touring show. His mother recalled, [...] "At Madison Square Garden, Danny {{looked at me with}} tears <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I want to do that.

2500|$|Ennis {{travels to}} meet with Jack's mother and father, and offers to take Jack's ashes to the mountain. The father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. Permitted by Jack's mother to see his {{childhood}} bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt {{he thought he had}} lost on Brokeback Mountain. He discovers Jack kept it hanging with his own stained shirt from that summer's fight. Ennis holds both shirts up to his face, silently weeping. Jack's mother lets him keep the shirts. Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis' trailer to tell her father she is engaged. She asks for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fiancé really loves her and she replies [...] "yes". After Alma leaves, Ennis goes to his closet, where his and Jack's shirts hang together, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above. He stares at the ensemble for a moment, tears <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> murmurs, [...] "Jack, I swear..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} first shown as a non-playable demo at the 2005 GDC in March {{when it was}} {{revealed}} {{it was no longer}} a third-person shooter, but was now a GTA-style open world game. Vivendi stated the game would be non-linear, with players free to do missions in whichever order they wish, with an estimated playtime of 50–60 hours. Vivendi also made a point that Montana would be unable to kill innocent people in the game. Producer Cam Weber explained the concept of Rage mode, which was on show in the demo, was very much inspired by the film; [...] "For fans of the movie, you'll remember that Tony has this crazy temper that {{every once in a while}} gets set off. You hear the organ music play, you see a camera cut to the intensity <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> he just suddenly snaps.

2500|$|The {{outcome of}} the fight was a major upset. At the opening bell, Liston rushed at Clay, {{seemingly}} angry {{and looking for a}} quick knockout, but Clay's superior speed and mobility enabled him to elude Liston, making the champion miss and look awkward. At {{the end of the first}} round, Clay opened up his attack and hit Liston repeatedly with jabs. Liston fought better in round two, but at the beginning of the third round Clay hit Liston with a combination that buckled his knees and opened a cut under his left eye. This was the first time Liston had ever been cut. At the end of round four, Clay was returning to his corner when he began experiencing blinding pain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> asked his trainer Angelo Dundee to cut off his gloves. Dundee refused. It has been speculated that the problem was due to ointment used to seal Liston's cuts, perhaps deliberately applied by his corner to his gloves. Though unconfirmed, Bert Sugar claimed that two of Liston's opponents also complained about their eyes [...] "burning".|$|E

2500|$|Williams' pay {{doubled in}} , going from $5,000 to $10,000. With the {{addition}} of a new bullpen in right field of Fenway Park, which reduced the distance from home plate from 400 feet to 380 feet, the bullpen was nicknamed [...] "Williamsburg", because the new addition was [...] "obviously designed for Williams". Williams was then switched from right field to left field, as there would be less sun <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> it would give Dom DiMaggio a chance to play. Finally, Williams was flip-flopped in the order with the great slugger Jimmie Foxx, with the idea that Williams would get more pitches to hit. Pitchers, though, were not afraid to walk him to get to the 33-year-old Foxx, and after that the 34-year-old Joe Cronin, the player-manager. Williams also made his first of sixteen All-Star Game appearances in 1940, going 0-for-2. Although Williams hit [...]344, his power and runs batted in were down from the previous season, with 23 home runs and 113 RBIs. Williams also caused a controversy in mid-August when he called his salary [...] "peanuts", along with saying he hated the city of Boston and reporters, leading reporters to lash back at him, saying that he should be traded. Williams said that the [...] "only real fun" [...] he had in 1940 was being able to pitch once on August 24, when he pitched the last two innings in a 12 – 1 loss to the Detroit Tigers, allowing one earned run on three hits, while striking out one batter, Rudy York.|$|E
