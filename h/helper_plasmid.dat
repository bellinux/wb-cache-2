40|$|Background & objectives: Chandipura virus (CHPV) is an {{emerging}} pathogenic rhabdovirus {{with a high}} case fatality rate. There are no reports of a minigenome system for CHPV, which could help its study without having to use the infectious agent. This study was, therefore, undertaken {{for the establishment of}} T 7 polymerase-driven minigenome system for CHPV. Methods: The minigenome rescue system for CHPV consists of three <b>helper</b> <b>plasmids</b> expressing the nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P) and large protein (L) based on a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing bacteriophage T 7 polymerase (vTF 7 - 3). The minigenome construct is composed of a reporter gene, flanked by the non-coding regions of CHPV. Two minigenomes were constructed in an antigenome or complimentary sense, expressing luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP). The minigenome system was evaluated by co-transfection of the minigenome construct and three <b>helper</b> <b>plasmids</b> into CV- 1 cells and analysis of the reporter gene activity. Results: All the helper proteins were expressed from the <b>helper</b> <b>plasmids</b> confirmed by Western blotting. Expression of reporter genes was observed from both the GFP and luciferase-based minigenomes. Green fluorescence could be visualized directly in live CV- 1 cells. Luciferase activity was found to be significantly different from control. Interpretation & conclusions: The results showed that the <b>helper</b> <b>plasmids</b> provided all the necessary viral structural proteins required for the production of minigenome mRNA template, which in turn could rescue the expression of reporter genes.

However, despite {{substantial}} sequence homology to other members of the family Filoviridae, Reston ebolavirus displays reduced pathogenicity for nonhuman primates and has never been demonstrated to cause clinical disease in humans, despite its ability to cause infection. In order to develop a tool to explore potential roles for transcription and replication in the reduced pathogenicity of Reston ebolavirus, we developed an RNA polymerase I (Pol I) -driven minigenome system. Here we demonstrate successful Reston ebolavirus minigenome rescue, including encapsidation, transcription, and replication, as well as the packaging of minigenome transcripts into progeny particles. The Pol I-driven Reston ebolavirus minigenome system provides a higher signal intensity with less background (higher signal-to-noise ratio) than a comparable T 7 -driven Reston ebolavirus minigenome system which was developed simultaneously.

In this study, a fast and simple method is presented to generate AAV 2 vector <b>helper</b> <b>plasmids</b> encoding capsid proteins with single, double or triple Y→F mutations.   Materials and Methods: A one-step, high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning procedure involving the use of two partially overlapping primers to amplify a circular DNA template was applied to produce AAV 2 cap genes encoding VP 1 mutants with Y→F substitutions in residues 444, 500 or 730. The resulting constructs were used to make the different double and triple mutant by another round of PCR (Y 444500 F mutant), subcloning (Y 444730 F and Y 500730 F mutants) or a combination of both techniques (Y 444500730 F mutant). Results: Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed successful introduction of the desired mutations in the AAV 2 cap gene and showed the absence of any unintended mutations in the DNA fragments used to assemble the final set of AAV 2 vector <b>helper</b> <b>plasmids.</b> The correctness of these plasmids was further confirmed by restriction mapping.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a series of powerful and versatile conditional-replication, integration, and modular (CRIM) plasmids. CRIM plasmids can be replicated at medium or high copy numbers in different hosts for making gene (or mutant) libraries. They can be integrated in single copies into the chromosomes of Escherichia coli and related bacteria to study gene function under normal physiological conditions. They can be excised from the chromosome, e. g., to verify that phenotypes are caused by their presence. Furthermore, they can be retrieved singly or en masse for subsequent molecular analyses. CRIM plasmids are integrated into the chromosome by site-specific recombination at one of five different phage attachment sites. Integrants are selected as antibiotic-resistant transformations. Since CRIM plasmids encode different forms of resistance, several can be used {{together in the same}} cell for stable expression of complex metabolic or regulatory pathways from diverse sources. Following integration, integrants are stably maintained in the absence of antibiotic selection.

Cosmid clones mapping {{to the right of}} the known oncogenic T-region of pTiChry 5 conferred Amadori opine production on tumors induced by the nopaline strain C 58. Sequence analysis of DNA held in common among these cosmids identified two 25 -bp, direct repeats flanking an 8. 5 -kb segment of pTiChry 5. These probable border sequences are closely related to those of other known T-regions and define a second T-region of pTiChry 5, called T-right (TR), that confers production of the Amadoriopines. The oncogenic T-left region (TL) was located precisely by identifying and sequencing the likely border repeats defining this segment. The two T-regions are separated by approximately 15 kb of plasmid DNA. Based on these results, we predicted that pKYRT 1, a vir <b>helper</b> <b>plasmid</b> derived from pTiChry 5, still contains all of TR and the leftmost 9 kb of TL. Consistent with this hypothesis, transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants selected for with a marker encoded by a binary plasmid following transformation with KYRT 1 co-inherited production of the Amadori opines at high frequency. All opine-positive transgenic plants also contained TR-DNA, while those plants that lacked TR-DNA failed to produce the opines.

NDV virions possess a non-segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome which contains six genes encoding the nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), large polymerase protein (L), matrix protein, fusion protein, and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase. The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex consisting of the genomic RNA and the three proteins NP, P, and L are the active template for transcription and replication of the viral genome. The purpose of this study was to construct the expression plasmids of NP, P and L genes of NDV Italien strain in which phage T 7 promoter was a transcription promoter for the aim of generation of recombinant NDV. Methods NP, P and L genes were cloned from the genome RNA of NDV Italien followed by introduction into the downstream of T 7 promoter and internal ribosome entry sites to construct the expression plasmids of NP, P and L, respectively. Expression of exogenous gene in BSR-T 7 / 5 cells which constitutively express phage T 7 RNA polymerase and transfected with plasmids of NP and P was detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay.

In an effort to compare the role of serotype-specific virion shells on vector transduction, we cloned each of the serotype capsid coding domains into a common vector backbone containing AAV type 2 replication genes. This strategy allowed the packaging of AAV 2 inverted terminal repeat vectors into each serotype-specific virions. Each of these <b>helper</b> <b>plasmids</b> (pXR 1 through pXR 5) efficiently replicated the transgene DNA and expressed helper proteins at nearly equivalent levels.

The physical titer of these hybrid vectors ranged between 1. 3 × 1011 and 9. 8 × 1012 /ml (types 1 and 2, respectively). Of the five serotype vectors, only types 2 and 3 were efficiently purified by heparin-Sepharose column chromatography, illustrating the high degree of similarity between these virions. We analyzed vector transduction in reference and mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in heparan sulfate proteoglycan and saw a correlation between transduction and heparan sulfate binding data. In this analysis, types 1 and 5 were most consistent in transduction efficiency across all cell lines tested. In vivo each serotype was ranked after comparison of transgene levels by using different routes of injection and strains of rodents. Overall, in this analysis, type 1 was superior for efficient transduction of liver and muscle, followed in order by types 5, 3, 2, and 4. Surprisingly, this order changed when vector was introduced into rat retina. Types 5 and 4 were most efficient, followed by type 1.

A trap vector has been constructed and successfully applied to capture the island on a plasmid. Monitoring of segregation of SGI 1 indicated high stability of the island. SGI 1 -free segregants did not accumulate during long-term propagation, but several SGI 1 variants could be obtained. Most of them appeared to be identical to SGI 1 -B and SGI 1 -C, but two new variants caused by deletions via a short-homology-dependent recombination process have also been detected. We have also noticed {{that the presence of}} the conjugation <b>helper</b> <b>plasmid</b> increased the formation of these deletion variants considerably. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite that excision of SGI 1 from the chromosome was proven in SGI 1 (+) Salmonella populations, its complete loss could not be observed. On the other hand, we demonstrated that several variants, among them two newly identified ones, arose with detectable frequencies in these populations in a short timescale and their formation was promoted by the <b>helper</b> <b>plasmid.</b> This reflects that IncA/C helper plasmids are not only involved in the horizontal spreading of SGI 1, but may also contribute to its evolution...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} strain of Drosophila virilis was genetically transformed with a hobo vector carrying the miniwhite cassette using a <b>helper</b> <b>plasmid</b> with an hsp 70 -driven hobo transposase-coding sequence. The rate of transformation was 0. 5 % per fertile G 0 animal. Three transgenic insertions were cloned and characterized {{and found to}} be authentic hobo insertions. These results, together with the known wide-spread distribution of hobo in diverse insect species, suggest that hobo and related transposable elements may be of considerable utility in the germline transformation of insects other than D. melanogaster...|$|E
40|$|Yersinia strains {{frequently}} harbor plasmids, {{of which}} the virulence plasmid pYV, indigenous in pathogenic strains, has been thoroughly characterized during the last decades. Yet, it has been unknown whether the nonconjugative pYV can be transferred by <b>helper</b> <b>plasmids</b> naturally occurring in this genus. We have isolated the conjugative plasmids pYE 854 (95. 5 kb) and pYE 966 (70 kb) from a nonpathogenic and a pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica strain, respectively, and demonstrate that both plasmids are able to mobilize pYV. The complete sequence of pYE 854 has been determined. The transfer proteins and oriT of the plasmid reveal similarities to the F factor. However, the pYE 854 replicon {{does not belong to}} the IncF group and is more closely related to a plasmid of gram-positive bacteria. Plasmid pYE 966 is very similar to pYE 854 but lacks two DNA regions of the larger plasmid that are dispensable for conjugation...|$|R
40|$|The Aedes aegypti {{densovirus}} (AeDNV) {{has previously}} shown potential in mosquito control. To improve its efficacy as a biopesticide, {{the gene for}} an excitatory insect-specific toxin from Buthus martensii Karsch (BmK IT 1) was inserted into the AeDNV genome and cloned into pUCA plasmid. The coding sequence for green fluorescent protein was ligated to the C-terminus of the BmK IT 1 gene as a screening marker. Recombinant and <b>helper</b> <b>plasmids</b> were cotransfected into C 6 / 36 cells; wild-type viruses were the controls. The recombinant viruses were identified and quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and exposed to Ae. albopictus larvae {{for the evaluation of}} its bioinsecticidal activity. LT 50 and LD 50 bioassays showed that the recombinant AeDNV had stronger and faster pathogenic effects on Ae. albopictus than the wild-type virus. This is the first report on the recombinant AeDNA containing the insect-specific toxin, BmK IT 1, which may be used to develop a novel type of insecticide...|$|R
40|$|Lentiviral {{constructs}} and infection The gateway lentiviral destination vector pLOVE (for Lentiviral Over-Expression) {{was generated}} by PCR amplification of the CMV-attR 1 /R 2 -V 5 -Stop fragment of pLenti 4 /TO-DEST (Invitrogen) and cloning into {{the backbone of}} the EcoRI-cut and XbaI-cut lentiviral vector pSicoR/GFP (Ventura et al., 2004). Open reading frames of genes for over-expression were PCR cloned from ES cell cDNA or plasmids obtained from Open Biosystems into pENTR 1 A or pENTR 1 D (Invitrogen) and recombined into pLOVE according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All pENTR and pLOVE constructs were verified by sequencing and western blot for the V 5 tag. Lentiviruses were produced in 293 cells by co-transfection of pLOVE and the <b>helper</b> <b>plasmids</b> pMDL, pRSV and pVSV-G as described (Ventura et al., 2004). Medium was collected at 48 h post- transfection, filtered and added to MEFs that had been plated the previous day at 300, 000 cells per 6 cm dish (1. 4 x 104 cells/cm 2). Cell culture MEFs were isolated form E 13. 5 embryos double transgenic fo...|$|R
