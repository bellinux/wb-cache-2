40|$|A {{systematic}} review {{was conducted to}} evaluate whether chocolate or its constituents were capable of influencing cognitive function and/or mood. Studies investigating potentially psychoactive fractions <b>of</b> <b>chocolate</b> were also included. Eight studies (in six articles) met the inclusion criteria for assessment <b>of</b> <b>chocolate</b> or its components on mood, of which five showed either an improvement in mood state or an attenuation of negative mood. Regarding cognitive function, eight studies (in six articles) met the criteria for inclusion, of which three revealed clear evidence of cognitive enhancement (following cocoa flavanols and methylxanthine). Two studies failed to demonstrate behavioral benefits but did identify significant alterations in brain activation patterns. It is unclear whether the effects <b>of</b> <b>chocolate</b> on mood are due to the orosensory characteristics <b>of</b> <b>chocolate</b> or to the pharmacological actions <b>of</b> <b>chocolate</b> constituents.

25|$|Four {{varieties}} <b>of</b> <b>chocolate</b> {{are found}} {{scattered around the}} castle rooms' floors, along with four species of animal. Each animal type can only eat <b>chocolate</b> <b>of</b> the same color. The player must slide all <b>of</b> the <b>chocolate</b> pieces into large blocks before maneuvering the appropriate animal next to the bar in order to consume it. Animals can only eat one piece <b>of</b> <b>chocolate</b> <b>of</b> any size before being removed from play. Animals and chocolate can be dragged across rooms via the player's mouse. If players move two identical types <b>of</b> <b>chocolate</b> next to each other, either horizontally or vertically, they form a larger bar. Once the pieces <b>of</b> <b>chocolate</b> has been formed into larger bars, they cannot be separated again. Larger bars hinder the player by blocking access to {{different parts of the}} room; the effects of combinations must be considered before they are made.|$|R
