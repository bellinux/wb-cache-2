The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to review a law or an official act of a government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to prerogative orders, the <b>equitable</b> <b>remedy</b> of a declaration {{can be employed}} to control an excess of legal authority. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. In contrast to the prerogative orders which are termed public law remedies, the declaration is called a private law remedy as it was originally developed in court cases between private parties. Only the High Court may grant declarations in judicial review cases; although the Subordinate Courts are generally empowered by the Subordinate Courts Act to grant declarations, a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot deal with any action {{in which there is}} no claim for any sum of money.|$|E

[...] Judge Choy also emphasized that the tribes were [...] "entitled to an equitable apportionment {{of the opportunity to}} fish in order to safeguard their federal treaty rights" [...] and that the Ninth Circuit should grant the district court a [...] "great amount of discretion as a court of equity" [...] when apportioning rights to fisheries. He held that the district court's apportionment [...] "was well within its discretion", but clarified that tribes were not entitled to compensation for [...] "unanticipated heavy fishing" [...] that occurred off Washington's coast. Judge Choy also clarified that the district court's <b>equitable</b> <b>remedy</b> should attempt to minimize hardships for white reef net fishermen.|$|E

2500|$|A {{contract}} is often evidenced in writing or by deed, {{the general rule}} is {{that a person who}} signs a contractual document will be bound by the terms in that document, this rule {{is referred to as the}} rule in L'Estrange v Graucob. [...] This rule is approved by the High Court of Australia in Toll(FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd. But a valid contract may (with some exceptions) be made orally or even by conduct.

2500|$|Geoffrey Lane LJ {{would have}} upheld the injunction. [...] However, Lord Denning MR and Cumming-Bruce LJ held that damages were a {{sufficient}} remedy, holding that the discretionary <b>equitable</b> <b>remedy</b> of an injunction was not necessary.

[...] The Millers had bought a house with the benefit of an open space adjacent to their land, and had to accept that the innocent and lawful use of the open land could restrict the enjoyment of their garden.|$|E
2500|$|Constructive trust: Unlike {{an express}} trust, a {{constructive}} trust is not created by {{an agreement between}} a settlor and the trustee. A constructive trust is imposed by the law as an [...] "equitable remedy". This generally occurs due to some wrongdoing, where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it. A constructive trust is, essentially, a legal fiction. For example, a court of equity recognizing a plaintiff's request for the <b>equitable</b> <b>remedy</b> of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them {{to the person who}} rightfully should have them. The constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing, and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization. The distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust, the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust. The latter is an [...] "equitable remedy" [...] imposed by law being truly remedial; the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property.|$|E

40|$|Most {{spheres of}} life are now {{regulated}} by statute. Many such statutes give courts both specific and wide-ranging general remedial powers in contexts where, potentially, general law, mainly <b>equitable,</b> <b>remedies</b> also apply. This article seeks to explore the relationship between statutory remedial schemes contained in such Acts as the Trade Practices Act, Corporations Act and ASIC Act, and remedies at general law. A number of possibilities may arise. Statutory remedies may abrogate general law remedies entirely or in part, or may be alternative to general law remedies. In many cases, {{the relationship between the}} general law and statutory remedies is not clear. Whichever is the case, many important questions arise: Are the statutory remedies broader or narrower in scope than similar <b>equitable</b> <b>remedies?</b> What are the practical advantages and disadvantages of the different remedies? Do the statutory remedies help our understanding of, or influence the development of, <b>equitable</b> <b>remedies?</b> Do <b>equitable</b> concepts continue {{to play a role in}} shaping the statutory remedies (eg, are broad injunctive powers subject to equitable limits?) Where statutes are silent as to the meaning of key concepts, are equitable or common law approaches to remedy more relevantly applicable? Alternatively, should those concepts be interpreted in light of the regulatory objectives being pursued by the regulator, and general law approaches be disregarded where the technical rules inherent under those approaches frustrate the achievement of the regulatory objectives? Given the predominance of statute, these are important questions that will shed light on the ongoing relevance and importance of <b>equitable</b> <b>remedies,</b> and on the ongoing debates about fusion, remedial discretion and taxonomy. Conversely, the uncertain operation of <b>equitable</b> <b>remedies</b> suggests the importance of legislation expressly spelling out the relationship of <b>equitable</b> <b>remedies</b> to a particular statutory remedy...|$|R

Although oil may be highly effective at calming troubled waters, we know that seafarers would not rely on this ancillary technique alone. Instead, they tried to engineer strong ships capable of breaking waves on their own. In Australia, there are two distinct types of remedies available to a litigant when seeking judicial review through constitutional means. First, the writs of mandamus, certiorari and prohibition which are called ‘constitutional writs’. Second, injunctions and declarations which are ‘equitable remedies’. The constitutional writs are often criticised for being only obtainable through archaic processes and governed by technical rules. Accordingly, <b>equitable</b> <b>remedies,</b> which are available in the field of public law precisely because of the inadequacies of the constitutional writs, have played a critical part in shaping modern Australian administrative law. However, mainly due to their different historical backgrounds, the constitutional writs and the <b>equitable</b> <b>remedies</b> operate in a fundamentally different manner. It has been proposed by some Australian legal minds that <b>equitable</b> <b>remedies</b> will have a “knock-on” effect for the other remedies by refocusing judicial review. However, it will be suggested by the author of this text that administrative lawyers should not rely too heavily upon the capacity of <b>equitable</b> <b>remedies</b> to become the forefront of judicial review.
