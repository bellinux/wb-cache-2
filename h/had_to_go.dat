5|$|A mutant {{criminal}} {{recruited by}} the Brotherhood in a prison truck, Juggernaut is incredibly strong, fast and, once he gains momentum, he is nearly unstoppable. The film's version of Juggernaut is depicted as a mutant and his relation to Charles Xavier was never mentioned. Matthew Vaughn cast Jones, who he met producing the Guy Ritchie gangster movies where Jones begun his acting career. The actor <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through a four-hour make-up process to portray Juggernaut, which included a muscle suit and a prostethic chin. The costume tried to retain the bullet-shaped helmet of the comics without going excessively over the top.|$|E
5|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm {{the plans for the}} launch of the ARG.|$|E

5|$|Browning's {{dealings}} with the British Army were no smoother. His successor as commander of the 1st Airborne Division, Major-General Hopkinson, had sold the British Eighth Army commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, on Operation Ladbroke, a glider landing to seize the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse. Browning's objections to the operation were ignored, and attempts to discuss airborne operations with the corps commanders elicited a directive from Montgomery that all such discussion <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through him. Browning concluded that to be effective, the airborne advisor had to have equal rank with the army commanders.|$|E
5|$|Education {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} education within the modern borders of Scotland, {{between the end of}} the Middle Ages in the late fifteenth century and the beginnings of the Enlightenment in the mid-eighteenth century. By the sixteenth century such formal educational institutions as grammar schools, petty schools and sewing schools for girls were established in Scotland, while children of the nobility often studied under private tutors. Scotland had three universities, but the curriculum was limited and Scottish scholars <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> abroad to gain second degrees. These contacts were {{one of the most important}} ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life. Humanist concern with education and Latin culminated in the Education Act 1496.|$|E

To succeed in making this script effective, Pagliarulo, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in the opposite direction to his previous work on Oblivion, which both for setting and characters, represented an extreme Fallout inverse.|$|E

After being contacted repeatedly by All Souls producers, he read for the parts of Fortado and Sterling; he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the lines a total of five times. During the audition, he met and talked to Aaron Spelling. After failing to be cast in The Street, Rodriquez committed to portraying Fortado. He said that his main attraction to the television project was the ability to work on a show produced by Spelling. While filming the episodes in a wheelchair, Rodriquez said that he gained an increased awareness and appreciation for handicapped people.|$|E
5|$|Schafer noted at {{the time}} of Grim Fandango {{original}} development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> looking for original concept art to figure out the design.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} {{generally}} very well received outside London, {{and especially in}} north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted {{not so much on}} the field of play as off it".|$|E

5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since {{it takes a long time}} to produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on for a while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed {{his hand over his}} heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the bathroom during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E

East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E

5|$|When {{plans were}} drawn {{up for a}} major {{expansion}} of the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum in the mid-1970s, it was initially assumed that the planetarium, then still a comparatively new facility, would be left untouched. As {{the scope of the}} expansion increased, it was realized that its north annex would need to be demolished in order {{to make way for the}} museum's need for a wing devoted to curatorial facilities. As a result, a theatre entrance, sound studio, workshop, passenger elevator and a third of the existing gallery area of the planetarium <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> The remaining gallery area was removed in March 1978 to make space for temporary space to replace the workshop and studio.|$|E
5|$|White {{said that}} The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced {{him to write}} about the sort of world he would like to live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out to work. Hence he relied on {{epidemics}} and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meant to}} take place in Santa Barbara, California, the installment, like the {{majority}} of Psychs episodes, was filmed in and around the Vancouver area of British Columbia. According to the show's creator Steve Franks, about half of the scenes in each episode are filmed in the suburb town of White Rock. Several of the sets, like the Psych office and Henry Spencer's house, are located along the coast in the White Rock area. Because of the differences between Vancouver and Santa Barbara, the show's producers were forced to bring in props for each episode, such as nine fake palm trees which had to be trucked to the set every day. The scripts for each Psych episode <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through several reviews, and often were cut down by as much as a few dozen pages. A large portion of show's dialogue consists of on-the-spot improvisation by the actors, specifically Roday and Hill. The writers noted that much of the humor in the installments came from improvisation. The episode also included several reoccurring gags on the show, such as an introductory flashback and the inclusion of a pineapple; both gags were created by the action of one of the actors.|$|E
