25|$|An {{important}} {{concept for}} insulating fluids is the static relaxation time. This {{is similar to}} the time constant τ (tau) within an RC circuit. For <b>insulating</b> <b>materials,</b> it is the ratio of the static dielectric constant divided by the electrical conductivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is sometimes approximated by dividing the number 18 by the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electrical conductivity of 1 pS/m has an estimated relaxation time of about 18 seconds. The excess charge in a fluid dissipates almost completely after four to five times the relaxation time, or 90 seconds for the fluid in the above example.|$|E

40|$|Space charge {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{as an agent of}} insulation degradation for power transmission cable especially under high voltage dc ap 1 ication. It penetrates into bulk of <b>insulating</b> <b>material,</b> namely cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE), by time during dc voltage application. The increase in space change density enhances local electric field in the <b>insulating</b> <b>material.</b> In other words, the local electric field is distorted. When the field distortion reaches a critical value, dc breakdown of the <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> will occurs, causing a catastrophic damage to the cable. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} space charge inside an <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> in order to improve the reliability of next generation power cables...|$|R

2500|$|The use of ice to {{refrigerate}} and preserve food {{dates back to}} prehistoric times. Through the ages, the seasonal harvesting of snow and ice was a regular practice of many cultures. China, Greece, and Rome stored ice and snow in caves, dugouts or ice houses lined with straw or other <b>insulating</b> <b>materials.</b> Rationing of the ice allowed the preservation of foods during hot periods, a practice that was successfully employed for centuries. For most of the 19th century, natural ice (harvested from ponds and lakes) was used to supply refrigerator cars. At high altitudes or northern latitudes, one foot tanks were often filled with water and allowed to freeze. Ice was typically cut into blocks during the winter and stored in insulated warehouses for later use, with sawdust and hay packed around the ice blocks to provide additional insulation.

2500|$|Modern day atom probe {{tomography}} (APT) uses a position-sensitive detector {{to deduce}} the lateral location of atoms. The {{idea of the}} APT, inspired by J. A. Panitz's Field Desorption Spectrometer patent, was developed by Mike Miller starting in 1983 and culminated with the first prototype in 1986. Various refinements {{were made to the}} instrument, including the use of a so-called position-sensitive (PoS) detector by Alfred Cerezo, Terence Godfrey, and George D. W. Smith at Oxford University in 1988. The Tomographic Atom Probe (TAP), developed by researchers at the University of Rouen in France in 1993, introduced a multichannel timing system and multianode array. Both instruments (PoSAP and TAP) were commercialized by Oxford Nanoscience and CAMECA respectively. Since then, there have been many refinements to increase the field of view, mass and position resolution, and data acquisition rate of the instrument. [...] The Local Electrode Atom Probe was first introduced in 2003 by Imago Scientific Instruments. [...] In 2005, the commercialization of the pulsed laser atom probe (PLAP) expanded the avenues of research from highly conductive materials (metals) to poor conductors (semiconductors like silicon) and even <b>insulating</b> <b>materials.</b> [...] AMETEK acquired CAMECA in 2007 and Imago Scientific Instruments (Madison, WI) in 2010, making the company the sole commercial developer of APTs with more than 90 instruments installed around the world in 2016.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Cross-linked {{polyethylene}} (XLPE) {{high voltage}} cables {{have been widely}} used in power transmission and distribution systems. Ageing deterioration of XLPE <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> can not be avoided because it is made of polymeric material. This paper present results of artificial ageing test of 22 kV XLPE cable for a distribution system application in Thailand. XLPE <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> of 22 kV cable was sliced to 60 - 70 µm in thick and subjected to AC high voltage stress at 23 ◦C, 60 ◦C, 75 ◦C and 90 ◦C. The specimens were tested under different electrical stress levels varying from 50 kV/mm to 130 kV/mm. Testing voltage was constantly applied to the specimen until breakdown. Five specimens were tested at each temperature and voltage stress level. Breakdown voltage and average time to breakdown were used to evaluate life time of <b>insulating</b> <b>material.</b> Furthermore, the physical model by J. P. Crine for prediction life time of XLPE <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> was adopted as life time model and was determined in order to compare with the experimental results. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for chemical analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) for physical analysis were conducted on the tested specimens.
