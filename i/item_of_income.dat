50|$|A {{withholding}} tax, {{also called}} a retention tax, {{is a government}} requirement for the payer of an <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> to withhold or deduct tax from the payment, and pay that tax to the government. In most jurisdictions, withholding tax applies to employment income. Many jurisdictions also require withholding tax on payments of interest or dividends. In most jurisdictions, there are additional withholding tax obligations if {{the recipient of the}} income is resident in a different jurisdiction, and in those circumstances withholding tax sometimes applies to royalties, rent or even the sale of real estate. Governments use withholding tax as a means to combat tax evasion, and sometimes impose additional withholding tax requirements if the recipient has been delinquent in filing tax returns, or in industries where tax evasion is perceived to be common.|$|E

40|$|In {{a globalized}} market for private equity investments, {{the risk for}} {{international}} double taxation has made the applicability of tax treaties all the more important. The study is concerned with private equity fund structures, where a Luxembourgian SIF or SICAR is used as fund vehicle, where the investor is resident in Finland and where the target company is resident in a third state. In such triangular investment structures {{the determination of the}} applicable tax treaty may not always be clear due to differing tax and private laws of the states involved as well as their different interpretations of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Conflicting laws and interpretations of states lead to classification conflicts, which in turn may result in double taxation or double non-taxation; both of which are undesired outcomes in view of many states. The problems with and risks for double taxation are not limited to the determination of the correct applicable tax treaty. There may also exist a conflict regarding the determination of which tax treaty article shall be applied to a certain <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> In this study that <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> consists of the proceeds from the realized private equity investment. To solve these questions states employ different methods of classification of foreign entities and foreign-sourced income. Classification in Finland is not regulated by law and is thus open to wide interpretation in Finnish courts. Entity and income classification by the Finnish courts is, however, subject to EU law. Classification may not result in taxation which is in conflict with EU law; i. e. EU law may have a strong guiding effect in the classification process. When the applicable tax treaty and tax treaty article has been determined the foreign-sourced income shall be classified for domestic tax law purposes to determine the tax consequences for the recipient of the income. The study consequently considers tax consequences for different Finnish investors. Tax regimes may not necessarily be permanent. Due to tax laws being strongly affected by fiscal interests of states lightly taxed investment structures run the risk of seeing tax benefits limited by changes in prevailing tax regimes. The OECD has recently begun its work on the BEPS project, which may {{have a significant impact on}} the tax treaty applicability in private equity fund structures. The study gives an insight into the likely coming changes...|$|E
40|$|Double {{taxation}} has a {{detrimental effect}} on the movement of capital, technology and persons and on the exchange of goods and services. Tax conventions, when properly applied, remove the obstacles of double taxation, thereby promoting the development and flow {{of international trade and}} investment. Hence, {{one of the most important}} roles of double income treaties is to remove the double taxation and to beat these obstacles for cross-border economic transactions. The globalization of financial markets and the backdrop of the financial crisis have caused international cooperation in tax matters to increase in importance. Treaties try to remove double taxation in two ways. First of all, tax agreements delineate specific types of income (e. g., dividends and interest) and provide special rules to tax these items. It can be said that in a tax treaty the source country generally gives way to the recipient’s country of domicile. Tax agreements usually provide that under certain conditions the recipient of a particular <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> is taxed at a lower tax rate or is exempted from taxation in the source country. The second way to remove double imposition goes through the establishment of “competent authority” procedures, that provide to taxpayers the chance to present disputes about treaty dispositions to the officials of their home countries for resolution...|$|E
