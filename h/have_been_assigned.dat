5|$|Coprolites (fossilized dung) {{containing}} small bones but {{no trace}} of plant fragments, discovered in the Ischigualasto Formation, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to Herrerasaurus based on fossil abundance. Mineralogical and chemical analysis of these coprolites indicates that if the referral to Herrerasaurus was correct, this carnivore could digest bone.|$|E
5|$|Other {{specimens}} {{from this}} deposit collected and described by Massalongo in 1855 were actually trace fossils, and they remain assigned to Zoophycos; only the specimens of Z. caput-medusae <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to Postelsiopsis, as those are fossils {{of the original}} plant, and not trace fossils.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the Sangam age Tamil {{country were}} ruled over by several {{independent}} chieftains, alongside the three crowned monarchs. Among them, coins {{belonging to the}} chieftains of the Malayaman clan {{have been found in}} Tamil Nadu. Many of them contain a written legend on the obverse and all of them have the image of a flowing river on their obverse. Based on the legends some of these coins <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to specific rulers such as Tirukkannan, also known as Malaiyan Choliya Enadi Tirukkannan, and Tirumudi Kari. A series of coins without a legend but with a horse as the principal motif on the obverse <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to the Malayaman chieftains, because of the river symbol on the obverse. Numismatist R. Krishnamurthy, dates these coins to the period between 100 BCE and 100 CE.|$|E

5|$|Since 2002, {{subtropical}} storms <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> {{names from}} the same naming sequence as tropical storms. Nicole was the first named subtropical storm since the policy change to not achieve full tropical cyclone status. In 1972 and 1973, four subtropical storms were named using the Phonetic alphabet, while all other subtropical cyclones remained unnamed.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} {{additional}} species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to the genus Daspletosaurus over the years, although as of 2007 {{none of these}} species have received a proper description or scientific name. In the meantime, all are designated as Daspletosaurus spp; this {{does not imply that}} they all are the same species.|$|E
5|$|Asides from Brancasaurus, other {{constituents}} of the Bückeberg Group are benthic invertebrates, including neomiodontid bivalves; hybodont sharks, including Hybodus, Egertonodus, Lonchidion, and Lissodus; the actinopterygian fish Caturus, Lepidotes, Coelodus, Sphaerodus, Ionoscopus, and Callopterus, which Brancasaurus would have preyed on in surface waters; the turtle Desmemys; crocodilians, including Goniopholis, Pholidosaurus, and Theriosuchus; the theropod Altispinax; the marginocephalian Stenopelix; and an ankylosaur referred to Hylaeosaurus. Other indeterminate remains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to pterosaurs; the crocodilian clades Hylaeochampsidae and Eusuchia; and the dinosaurian clades Dryosauridae, Ankylopollexia, Troodontidae, and Macronaria.|$|E

5|$|Because Iguanodon {{is one of}} {{the first}} dinosaur genera to have been named, {{numerous}} species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to it. While never becoming the wastebasket taxon several other early genera of dinosaurs (such as Megalosaurus) became, Iguanodon has had a complicated history, and its taxonomy continues to undergo revisions. Although Gregory Paul recommended restricting I. bernissartensis to the famous sample from Bernissart, ornithopod workers like Norman and McDonald have disagreed with Paul's recommendations, except exercising caution when accepting records of Iguanodon from France and Spain as valid.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the wide}} range of tasks which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to the aircraft, the RAAF is {{currently}} not operating its Globemasters in all the roles of which the type is capable. For instance, in February 2013 the Air Force was reported to be investigating using C-17s to drop special forces boats as well as supplies to warships. Trials to develop the capacity to refuel RAAF Globemasters in flight from the force's Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports began in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|I {{have been}} {{increasingly}} perturbed over the blatant {{disparity between the}} major role which Negro women have played and are playing in the crucial grassroots levels of our struggle and the minor role of leadership they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> in the national policy-making decisions. It is indefensible to call a national march on Washington and send out a call which contains the name of not a single woman leader.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, the backup crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the Gemini 9 mission, scheduled for early June. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the mission's backup crew, and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without the Gemini experience, it is unlikely that Aldrin would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Sinoceratops {{is known}} from the Xingezhuang Formation of {{southern}} China. It is known from skull material. Alongside it, in the formation, lived Shantungosaurus, a very common hadrosaurid to {{which most of the}} material has been assigned, Zhuchengtyrannus, an Asian tyrannosaurid related to Tarbosaurus, Zhuchengceratops, an Asian leptoceratopsid, and Huaxiaosaurus, a possible older individual of Shantungosaurus. Other possible remains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to Zhuchengosaurus, a probable junior synonym of Shantungosaurus, and material tentatively assigned to Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The average {{distance}} between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers (9AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68km/s, it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about years), to finish one revolution around the Sun. The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48° {{relative to the}} orbital plane of the Earth. The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957AU, on average. The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).|$|E

5|$|About 250 Pictish stones {{survive and}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> by {{scholars}} to three classes. Class I stones are those thought to {{date to the}} period up to the seventh century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals such as fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus).|$|E
5|$|Ampelosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{completely}} known titanosaurian sauropods from Europe. Since 1989, over 500 bones discovered at the Upper Cretaceous Bellevue locality of southern France <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to A. atacis. An abundant amount of well-preserved elements have been uncovered at Bellevue. In the original description, only a tooth and some vertebrae were examined. In 2005, a complete description was made by Le Loueff of all known material, allowing Ampelosaurus to be much better understood. All the material has been assigned to the species, and even though there are some differences in limb proportions, it has all been linked to individual variation.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> a rotation period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E

5|$|General Bulfin, {{commanding}} the XXI Corps, issued {{orders for the}} continuation of the battle on 20 September. The 7th (Meerut) Division's objectives were to attack and capture Deir Sheraf, Sebustiye and Burqa, while the 3rd (Lahore) Division's objective was to establish a position through Beit Udhen and Qusein {{commanding the}} Nablus-to-Deir Sheraf road. The 7th and 3rd Divisions advanced to the northeast, through the hills towards ancient Samaria, while the 60th Division moved east from Tulkarm along the Tulkarm to Nablus road with the 5th Light Horse Brigade, still attached to the 60th Division, advancing north of Tulkarm to cut the railway line between Messudieh and Jenin. The 75th Division continued in reserve at Et Tire, where they may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> the management of thousands of prisoners.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., Agent Fox Mulder appears {{before an}} FBI panel {{regarding}} {{his experiences in}} Antarctica. Meanwhile, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) reports to the Syndicate on the alien in Phoenix, confident that he'll be able to kill it. Assistant Director Walter Skinner tells Mulder, {{who is working on}} restoring the burned X-Files, that Mulder and Scully have been denied reassignment on the X-Files, but that Mulder should seek out a folder left on the desk in his old office. Mulder goes there, only to discover that Jeffrey Spender and Diana Fowley <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to the X-Files. Feeling betrayed by Fowley, Mulder leaves, but not before stealthily taking the folder with him.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from {{hundreds}} of individual specimens, of which over 75 <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to the type species, P. mongoliensis. All Psittacosaurus fossils discovered {{so far have been}} found in Early Cretaceous sediments in Asia, from southern Siberia to northern China, and possibly as far south as Thailand. The most common age of geologic formations bearing Psittacosaurus fossils is from the late Barremian through Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or approximately 126 to 101mya (million years ago). Many terrestrial sedimentary formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of Psittacosaurus, leading to the definition of this time period in the region as the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E
