500|$|I'm {{so excited}} about the 'Alejandro' video, [...] Actually, we're {{shooting}} it very soon and I don't want to say who the director is yet because it's {{going to give a}} lot away. [...] Are you absolutely mad? I would never, ever tell you ! I {{would be more likely to}} lie through my teeth to you [...] what the video's about so that you could all be surprised. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it's not the sequel to the 'Telephone' video.|$|E
500|$|Fieldy {{has said}} of the album [...] "Right now, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> this... we've done {{something}} we've never done before. Normally if we do a new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put {{the best of what}} we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's {{going to be a little}} extra special this time." [...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E

500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out.

500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that I decide what I do and I play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E

And give attendance to the reading of them (1 Tim 4:13). For, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> he that slights the scriptures, doth also slight him of whom they testify. And <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> also, that for this cause God hath given up many to strong delusions, that they might believe a lie: 'that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness' (2 Thess 2:11,12).|$|R

2500|$|The {{effect of}} Myrick's {{statement}} on Little Crow {{and his band}} was clear however. In a letter to General Sibley, Little Crow {{said it was a}} major reason for commencing war: [...] "Dear Sir – For what reason we have commenced this war <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> it is on account of Maj. Galbrait [...] we made a treaty with the Government a big for what little we do get and then cant get it till our children was dieing with hunger – it is with the traders that commence Mr A J Myrick told the Indians that they would eat grass or their own dung." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{original}} Norwegian black metal musicians believe that black metal {{does not need to}} hold any ideologies. For example, Jan Axel [...] "Hellhammer" [...] Blomberg of Mayhem has {{said in an interview with}} Metal Library: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that neither I nor other [...] members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else.

[...] Although rejecting the idea of [...] "Christian black metal", Satyricon's vocalist Sigurd Wongraven stated in the Murder Music documentary that black metal [...] "doesn't necessarily have to be all Satanic as long as it's dark".|$|E
2500|$|On 5 January 1990, {{addressing}} Conservatives in Liverpool, Powell {{claimed that}} if the Conservatives played the [...] "British card" [...] at the next general election, they could win; the new mood in Britain for [...] "self-determination" [...] had given the newly independent nations of Eastern Europe a [...] "beacon", adding that Britain should stand alone, if necessary, for European freedom, adding: [...] "We are taunted—by the French, by the Italians, by the Spaniards—for refusing to worship at the shrine of a common government superimposed upon them all... where were the European unity merchants in 1940? <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> They were either writhing under a hideous oppression or they were aiding and abetting that oppression.

2500|$|In August 2009, Clinton {{embarked}} on her longest trip yet, {{to a number}} of stops in Africa. On August 10, 2009, at a public event in Kinshasa, a Congolese student asked her what her husband, [...] "Mr Clinton", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clinton looked irritated at the question and replied, [...] "Wait, {{you want me to tell}} you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband." [...] The incident was played in newsrooms around the world. Clinton aides suggested there might have been a mistranslation, but that was not the case; however the student had later apologized to her, saying he had meant to ask what [...] "Mr Obama" [...] thought.|$|E
2500|$|Ida's war-like (and dull) {{brothers}} Arac, Guron and Scynthius, {{arrive at}} Hildebrand's palace ("We are warriors three"), preceding their father. [...] King Gama enters, explains his misanthropy ("If {{you give me}} your attention <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I am"), and promptly displays it by insulting Hildebrand and his son. [...] He then announces that Princess Ida has forsworn men and founded a women's university at Castle Adamant, {{one of his many}} country houses. [...] The two Kings advise Hilarion to go to Castle Adamant to claim Ida, and that if she refuses him, Hildebrand will storm the castle ("P'raps if you address the lady"). [...] But Hilarion plans to use romantic means, rather than force, to gain the princess's love. [...] He explains that nature has [...] "armed" [...] him and his friends, the courtiers Cyril and Florian, to win this [...] "war" [...] ("Expressive glances will be our lances"). The three set off to Castle Adamant, while King Gama and his sons are to remain at Hildebrand's palace as hostages ("For a month to dwell in a dungeon cell").|$|E
2500|$|Many famous {{international}} musicians have complimented her vocal prowess. Grammy-award winner Michel Legrand has praised Velasquez, saying, [...] "The {{first time}} I heard her sing, I said to myself, 'what the hell? I {{owe it to}} the rest of the world to introduce this voice to them'. She is the voice with both the range and the heart - which is like none I've ever heard of in my entire career." [...] After singing A Piece of Sky with Velasquez, Legrand exclaimed, [...] "It's tough to sing that song after Barbra Streisand, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> but to sing with Regine is.. I'm in heaven. She sings so well, she has such an extraordinary technical and sensitive voice and talented expression." [...] When asked who was Brian McKnight's favorite Filipino singer, the 16-time Grammy nominated artist immediately answered Regine Velasquez, [...] "Regine is probably one of the greatest singers I have ever heard anywhere. She can hold her own next to anyone. I doubt that anybody would want to come behind her after she sings." ...|$|E
