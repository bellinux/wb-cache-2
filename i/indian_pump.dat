40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{reducing}} the occupational risks while assembling a multistage pump. A sample of 10 employees who assemble the multistage <b>pump</b> from an <b>Indian</b> semiautomatic <b>pump</b> manufacturing industry was studied. Awkward postures manifested in these tasks cause strain in the employee’s body {{which lead to}} fatigue, injuries and musculoskeletal disorders. These tasks were evaluated {{on the basis of}} standards set by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This evaluation adopts posture assessment using Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and bio-mechanical approach to examine the tasks. Engineering interventions were then developed and evaluated in ergonomics laboratory to document the reduction of risks. The ergonomic tool introduced in this study has the potential to considerably reduce the occupational risk in pump assembly...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{unavailability}} of electricity, about 85 % {{of groundwater}} irrigation in eastern India employs fuel-powered surface pumps, which can have system efficiencies {{as low as}} 5 %. As fuel prices continue to rise, impoverished smallholder farmers cannot afford the operation costs of their systems and, as a result, irrigate less land. This research aimed to develop a more efficient off-grid system that eliminates suction head while continuing to utilize a fuel engine on the surface. Design requirements included increased discharge, increased efficiency, portability, maintainability, availability of replacement parts, and affordability. Flow rates and efficiencies of <b>Indian</b> <b>pumps</b> at varying pressure heads were tested to establish baseline performance and test the hypothesis that removing suction lift reduces operation costs. It was found that eliminating suction head can decrease operation costs up to 44 % for the farmers. Fuel-driven system options investigated include flexible shafts and telescoping shafts to transmit power from a surface engine to a submersible pump, fluid machinery such as semi-open hydraulic systems, jet pumps, compressed air motors, and air lifts, and off-grid electricity generation employing a household backup generator or automotive alternator. However, none of these alternatives met all the design requirements. Instead, a hybrid motorized-manual rope pump was prototyped and tested on a well in Ruitola, Jharkhand. Although this system does not meet all the design requirements, it has {{the added benefit of}} providing domestic water supply. The prototype discharged an average of 155. 4 L/min in motorized mode and 17. 2 L/min for men and 13. 3 L/min for women in manual mode. The rope pump received positive feedback from the users and thus could be taken forward with several modifications to improve performance. To increase the available water resources, evaporation reduction strategies to limit water loss from farm tanks were explored. The strategies employed waste materials and included covering a water surface with waste PET bottles and floats comprised of PET waste bottles and old saris. While waste bottles proved promising in a preliminary test, data in a larger experiment has thus far proved inconclusive and further testing is needed. by Emily Gorbaty. Thesis: S.

25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful {{in the manufacture of}} articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well <b>pumps.</b> <b>Indian</b> rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s and 1940s {{the demand}} in Europe for reed organs and {{harmoniums}} significantly declined and the factory started exporting the reeds to India where Indian style hand-pumped harmoniums had become very popular creating the demand and {{a market for}} the German Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch reeds. Although these organ reeds were originally designed and manufactured for American style suction organs they became the favored reeds for their tone quality and tuning stability in <b>Indian</b> hand <b>pumped</b> harmoniums which work on an air pressure system. In {{order for them to}} be attached to the Indian harmonium reed board (as opposed to sliding into the reed chambers as they did on the reed organs) holes were drilled at the top tongue end of the reed casing and a notch was drilled at the base end. This enabled the Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch reeds to be screwed directly and tightly onto the reed board with the reed tongue over the air holes connected to the playing keys. Subsequently, the factory began selling the reed sets labeled as Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch Harmonium Brass Reeds Made in Germany with the screw holes already drilled in the outer reed casing to suit the Indian harmonium market. The distinguishing visual features of the German Jubilate reeds are the words Jubilate, Harmola or Monarch and Made in Germany which are stamped on each individual reed in addition to the pitch of the reed and the distinct rounded bottom edge of the casing at the tongue end of the reed. There were also German reeds that were stamped with only [...] "Made in Germany" [...] and some were stamped only with the note/pitch of the reed. The latter version with the note/pitch stamp only can be identified by the distinct rivet structure securing the reed tongue on the German reeds which is the same on all versions of these reeds made on the same machinery in Germany. Most of the German reeds used in the Indian style harmoniums do not have the typical reed tongue shaping for the voicing of the reeds found in American or German style suction organs.|$|R
40|$|Upstream India and {{downstream}} Bangladesh share {{more than}} 50 international rivers. India {{has set up}} water diversion constructions in more than 50 % of these rivers, the largest one being on the Bangladeshâs northwest upon the Ganges River, puts Bangladeshâs Gangetic ecosystem at stake. In some border rivers, India has set up groins on her side of river banks. Also, <b>Indian</b> side <b>pumps</b> Bangladesh river water stealthily from border-rivers. Further, India is constructing another dam and reservoir upstream on the Barak River on the northeast of Bangladesh. Furthermore, India has chalked out a grand plan for river networking. Exploration {{has been made to}} assess the degree of the ecosystem degradation both inland and on the coast due to all water diversion constructions around the border, except for the Tipaimukh Dam in which case estimation of projected ecosystem degradation has been mentioned. Finally, Indian grand plan of river networking plan has been briefly touched upon. Site visitations, observations, surveys, measurements and interviews of professionals were made in the project country. Relevant literatures on this issue were reviewed in electronic and print databases. Related published articles in electronic and print media were systematically searched following the key words for the case. Finally, both electronic and print news media have been closely followed to know the latest developments on this issue. The reduced flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh has caused scarcity of fresh water, species endangerment and extinction, obstruction to livestock raising, loss of livelihoods, peopleâs displacement, changes in crop production, reduction in navigable routes, extreme weather, increased flood occurrences, scarcity of potable water, groundwater contamination, reduction in coastal sediment deposition, deterioration of the Ganges water quality and inland intrusion of saline water front. Water diversion constructions in other rivers have caused similar type of ecological problems. The construction of groins on the Indian side of the border rivers has caused bank erosion on the Bangladesh side which changes her map. India benefits herself by occupying the resulting shoal formation within the Bangladesh side of the riverbeds. The Tipaimukh Dam on the Barak River will affect the virgin haor ecosystem {{the same way as the}} Ganges basin over a certain time scale. Indiaâs river networking plan is going to create a widespread ecocide in the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin. Water, if not the most, is one of the most important components in an ecosystem. Living being cannot survive without it. Ecocide occurs in its absence. Obstruction to the downstream natural flow of rivers by the upstream country unilateral actions is tantamount to violations of human rights which is a crime. With the dilapidated ecosystem, Bangladeshâs national security is at stake. Bangladeshâs internal immunity is not strong enough to face the threats of climate change events. Bangladesh government should take a tough stand for the countryâs interests. Since she has failed to save her interests on a bilateral basis with India, she should take immediate steps for fair share of the pirated river water under the UN supervision. Also, she should approach the UN for getting back the river shoals captured by India. Bangladesh should have a master plan of dredging rivers and canals for water storage and inland distribution to the depleted surface water bodies to reestablish the wetland ecosystem. This will help, to some extent, in the gradual mitigation of all the problems including groundwater arsenic contamination, fish scarcity, erratic climate. It is due for Bangladesh to charge the upstream country for the dredging cost of the rivers and canals since upstream countryâs water piracy has regionally silted her rivers and canals. Since the saving of the biodiversity is an international slogan of the time, Bangladesh should ask the UN to enforce strict international laws to stop any means of upstream water piracy including new constructions of dams, barrages, reservoirs, link canals upon international rivers to save the downstream biodiversity. Sanctions should be put in place for the violators of the law. Bangladeshâs approach to international court may be an option, too...|$|R
