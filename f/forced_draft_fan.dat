40|$|Lakvijaya {{power station}} (LVPS) {{is the first}} coal power {{experience}} in Sri Lanka. Even though the main objective of the power plant is to meet the increasing power demand at low cost, still it is behind the expectations due to low reliability of the power plant. Failures in the boiler side equipment have been considerably responsible for this with a huge financial loss to the country. This project studies the suitable designs for design faults and shortcomings of LVPS to improve {{the reliability of the}} power plant related to the boiler side. By analyzing the past data until the first overhaul of the power plant, it is revealed that the main failures are arisen in the primary air system, coal pulverizing system, secondary air and flue gas systems related to the boiler side. In addition to the low reliability of primary air system, it is not supplying the required total amount of primary air to the system to run the pulverizers within the safe margins. Installing a new primary air fan in the system not only meets the deficiency, but also improves the reliability. Failures related to the pitch controllers of <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> <b>fans</b> and induced <b>draft</b> <b>fans</b> resulting to high vibrations and high bearing temperatures directly affect to the low reliability in the secondary air and flue gas system. Variable speed drivers to control the air flow instead of fan pitch controlling or inlet vane controlling methods are discussed in this paper. According to the past data of the plant, 53 % of failures arose in the pulverizing system have been recovered within ten hours. Rearranging the system with pulverized coal storages for ten hours with a suitable fire protection system is also discussed here.

40|$|The <b>Forced</b> <b>Draft</b> <b>Fan</b> (FDF) blade in a 300  MW {{coal fired}} power plant that {{experienced}} catastrophic failure has been investigated. There were two main {{locations of the}} blade damage, namely damage {{at the root of}} the blade and the other one is at the third of the blade height. The FDF blade has been run for 5 years and before its failure, the FDF experienced high vibration (14  mm/s). The <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> <b>fan</b> is an axial flow fan horizontally in front of the boiler and the fan is single stage. Visual inspection, metallographic analysis, chemical composition and hardness test were carried out to find the cause of the failure. It is concluded that the material of the blade is cast Al-Si alloy (A 356. 0) that fits the requirements for FDF blade application, the failure of the third of the blade height is owing to the external particles collide to the leading edge of the blades causing erosion and notch. That notch acted as initial crack. The failure at the root blade was caused by broken fragments of the others damaged blades entered in between casing (stator) and the blade (rotor) so they obstructed the blade rotation...|$|E

This force drought fan is used for supplying air from atmosphere to the boiler. The boilers is used for producing the steam required for the entire plant and also for generating most of the Power required for the plant to run. As failure of the boiler is critical problem, it was found out that vibration was the cause for it and vibration in turn caused bearing failure. In order to reduce vibration levels within the fan setup, some improvements are suggested...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, water pumped {{from the tower}} basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility. [...] The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns {{to the top of}} the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. [...] As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural <b>draft</b> or by <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> using large <b>fans</b> in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to evaporate. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the draw-off water.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis conducted upon the sensor data {{gathered from the}} distribution control system of a central heating and cooling plant in Ottawa, Canada. After observing that the performance of four boilers and five chillers of this plant vary substantially in time under steady-state conditions, data-driven models were developed to explain this variability from the archived sensor data. By employing a forward stepwise regression and a repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation approach, two-layer feed-forward artificial neural network models with seven to fifteen hidden-nodes were selected for each boiler and chiller. The selected boiler models could explain 84 to 95 % of the variability in a boiler's efficiency, and the selected chiller models could explain 65 to 94 % of the variability in a chiller's coefficient of performance. Among studied nine variables, the most informative ones to predict a boiler's efficiency were identified as follows: flue gas O 2 concentration, pressure, part-load ratio, <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> <b>fan</b> state, and return water flow rate. Unlike boilers, all four studied variables were found useful in predicting a chiller's coefficient of performance. These four variables were the return water flow rate, part-load ratio, outdoor temperature, and return water temperature.

40|$|Process {{analysis}} of refinery crude charge heater {{was used to}} investigate the effect of changes in fuel gas composition on crude charge heater efficiency of Port Harcourt refinery. Material and energy balance around the heater {{provided the basis for}} the calculation of heat absorbed by crude charge. The efficiency of the crude charge heater was then calculated as the quantity of heat absorbed by crude charge divided by the quantity of heat generated by combustion of fuel gas and the result multiplied by one hundred. This was done for various forced-draft fan (FDF) damper openings for fuel gas A (from the refinery mixing drum) and B (used to design the heater). Also the percentage oxygen content of the flue gas was calculated for the same FDF damper openings for the two fuel gas samples. For fuel gas A, the crude charge heater efficiency records ranged from 73. 34 to 82. 62 %, with the highest value 0 f 82. 62 % recorded at 45 % FDF damper opening. For fuel gas B, the efficiency ranged from 76. 51 to 86. 59 %, with the 45 %FDF damper opening also recording the highest value (86. 6 %). Statistical analysis showed that at various FDF damper openings, the efficiency values of the heater when firing fuel gas A were not significantly (p> 0. 05) different from the values when firing fuel gas B. Hence, changes in fuel gas composition have no significant (p> 0. 05) effect on the crude charge heater efficiency.

The effort in this quarter has concentrated on installing the CFBC Facility and for conducting cold fluidization operations tests in the CFBC facility. The assembly of the ash recirculation pipe duct from the cyclones back to the bed area of the combustor, including {{the upper and lower}} loop seals was completed. The electric bed pre-heater was installed to heat the fluidizing air as it enters the wind box. The induced draft fan along with its machine base and power supply was received and installed. The flue gas duct from secondary cyclone outlet to induced draft fan inlet was received and installed, as well as the induced fan flue gas discharge duct. Pressure testing from the <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> <b>fan</b> to the outlet of the induced fan was completed.

The reliability and plant efficiency depend on the design conditions of all plant components. Induced <b>draft</b> <b>fans</b> handle high temperature flyash-laden flue gas, and are often plagued by mass-flow deficiencies and excessive vibration in fossil fuel powerplants [1]. In this research an existing induced-draft fan is analysed to investigate the occurrence of high stresses forming on the impeller, as these stresses lead to cracks appearing on the centre plate of the impeller. The basic approach used {{to address this problem}} is implementing the Finite Element Method starting with different cantilever beam configurations to simulate the connection of the blade with the centre plate. Geometries are kept constant to facilitate in the practical set-up implementation stage of the dissertation.
