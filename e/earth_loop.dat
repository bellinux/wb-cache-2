50|$|Naim's {{choice of}} {{connectors}} {{is part of}} its objective of achieving the Naim sound. Pre-amplifiers employ the BNC connector for phono inputs, as providing better impedance matching and earthing compared with RCA connectors. The DIN connector is also used in preference to the RCA connector for other inputs, as the DIN connectors help to ensure the equipment is properly earthed without multiple pathways that create hum-inducing <b>earth</b> <b>loops</b> and increase noise. Vereker noted that the cheapest RCA socketry was used with earlier designs as there was no sonic benefit to using the costlier DIN plugs, and that higher quality sockets were progressively substituted as systems improved. While Naim's practice of using DIN connectors has gained them fans and detractors alike, DIN sockets continue to be Naim's choice for line-level inputs, although some RCA inputs may be included, depending on the model.|$|R

To better understand the system under such faults, this study analyses the behaviour of HVDC systems based on both conventional two-level converter and multilevel modular converter technology, experiencing a permanent line-to-earth fault. Operation of the proposed system under two different earthing configurations of converter side AC transformer earthed with converter unearthed, and both converter and AC transformer unearthed, was analysed and simulated, with particular attention paid to the converter operation.

This paper analyses the behaviour of a VSC-based HVDC system under varying DC fault conditions. A two terminal multi-terminal DC system, consisting of a single sending and receiving end is used as a case study. Recharging of the DC link Capacitor after a DC line-to-line fault was found to act as additional damping for the AC fault current, helping to reduce the AC current offset. Also, it was discovered that the development of potential <b>earth</b> <b>loops</b> with the system as a result of DC lineto-earth faults can lead to substantial overcurrent if an effective earthing scheme is not in place...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{problems}} is earth loops, where different pieces of equipment are connected together by signal wires, but powered from different power sockets {{in different parts of the}} room or building. The combination of the mains earth and signal earth creates a receiving loop that produces an interference signal proportional to the area within the <b>earth</b> <b>loop.</b> Various steps are used to prevent interference on audio and video equipment.

50|$|In {{anticipation}} of particularly corrosive soils, DX systems {{come with a}} Cathodic Protection system. The principle {{is to protect the}} metal surface from corrosion by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell. In that process, the metal -copper - is connected to a sacrificial metal which will corrode in its place. Corrosion of metals is an electrochemical process of deterioration that results from a loss of electrons as they react with water and/or oxygen. As the current flows from the <b>Earth</b> <b>Loop</b> Protection system, the metal surface to be protected is given in a uniform negative electrical potential that precludes corrosion of the ground loops, even in hostile environments.|$|E
50|$|While {{they require}} more {{refrigerant}} and their tubing {{is more expensive}} per foot, a direct exchange <b>earth</b> <b>loop</b> is shorter than a closed water loop for a given capacity. A direct exchange system requires only 15 to 40% {{of the length of}} tubing and half the diameter of drilled holes, and the drilling or excavation costs are therefore lower. Refrigerant loops are less tolerant of leaks than water loops because gas can leak out through smaller imperfections. This dictates the use of brazed copper tubing, even though the pressures are similar to water loops. The copper loop must be protected from corrosion in acidic soil {{through the use of a}} sacrificial anode or other cathodic protection.|$|E
5000|$|In TN, an {{insulation}} fault {{is very likely}} to lead to a high short-circuit current that will trigger an overcurrent circuit-breaker or fuse and disconnect the L conductors. With TT systems, the <b>earth</b> fault <b>loop</b> impedance can be too high to do this, or too high to do it within the required time, so an RCD (formerly ELCB) is usually employed. Earlier TT installations may lack this important safety feature, allowing the CPC (Circuit Protective Conductor or PE) and perhaps associated metallic parts within reach of persons (exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-parts) to become energized for extended periods under fault conditions, which is a real danger.|$|R

40|$|Protection against {{electric}} shock {{in our homes}} and work places {{is one of the}} most important priorities for electrical services engineers who are now designing electrical installations to conform to the requirements of the 17 th edition IEE Wiring Regulations (BS 7671 : 2008). Now Chapter 41 of BS 7671 : 2008 requires that additional protection by means of a 30 mA 40 ms residual current protection device be provided for final circuits supplying general purpose socket outlets that are intended for use by ‘Ordinary persons’. However, there are few publications and little information available on the theory describing how touch voltage of a dangerous magnitude could be transferred from a faulty circuit onto the exposed-conductive-parts of Class 1 equipment of another healthy circuit. This paper summarises the theory of transfer touch voltage calculations and expands on it to show how to carry out a sensitivity analysis in relation to the design parameters that are being used by designers and installers. Based on the results of a real case study, it appears that there is sufficient evidence to show that it may not be sufficiently safe to use the nominal external <b>earth</b> fault <b>loop</b> impedance quoted by the electricity utility companies for adopting a low touch voltage design. Practical application: The touch voltage sensitivity equation derived in this paper is a powerful tool for designers and installers of electrical installations to investigate and identify the sensitivity of resulting touch voltages of any electrical circuits.

40|$|People using {{electrical}} installations {{have to be}} protected against electrical shock. For purposes of protection a distinction is made between direct and indirect contact. Direct contact is contact with a live conductor. Protection {{is provided by the}} insulation of cables or the screening of live parts. An indirect contact happens when someone touches exposed metal parts which are not intended to carry current but have become live {{as a result of a}} fault. In this case metallic parts raise the metal to a dangerous potential (contact voltage). Here protection is provided by connecting the exposed metal part (i. e. the case of the electrical machine) to the earthing point of the installation. A protective device will disconnect the circuit as soon as a fault current flows to earth. The earth fault value will depend on the impedance of the path taken by the fault current, which is known as the earth fault loop. The resistance of the earth electrode plays an important role in the final impedance of the earth fault loop, especially when the neutral of the transformer is earthed without any impedance. A good earth electrode should have the lowest possible value compared with the rest of the <b>earth</b> <b>loop</b> (voltage divisor). If this can be achieved, the contact voltage will be limited and the current that trips the protections will be of a higher value. The maximum duration of a contact voltage is established according to IEC 60364 - 4 413. 1. 1. 1. An important constraint in obtaining a good resistance value for the earth electrode is the resistivity of the soil...|$|E

All such equipments are interconnected with network cable wiring system unless few remote operating equipments exist. On the other hand, building electrical wiring system is also laid throughout the building. In this context, it may have opportunity to interfere unwanted electrical noise to the data and voice systems hence malfunction or giving flaw data outputs. Electrical noise cause for an abnormal humming sound of the voice signals and thereby degrade the quality of sound systems. Such interference can happen due to both radiated and conductive electrical noise. One of major reasons for the conducted noise is, operation of switched mode power supplies hence lead to create of earth loops that should eliminate at the design and installation stages. Analysis of electrical noise in the system and design filtering systems need to be practiced, when noise issues are raised after the commissioning of electrical installations. It is required to do analyzing of electrical noise in the building in order to come across comprehensive conclusion for root cause for the disturbances. In doing so, harmonic levels, noise in the live wires, noise through the earth wire and <b>earth</b> <b>loop</b> possibilities are investigated. The most important part is to identify major frequency components filter those from the system. Different type of filter arrangements can be used to evaluate its performances against the noise level of the site. Similarly, installation guide lines can be followed prior to the site erection and that is the very effective method to avoid unnecessary noise induced in sensitive equipments. Though general filter arrangements eliminate noise, some frequency ranges need to be filtered separately, according to the site conditions. Since calculated L and C values can’t be exactly found out, next closet practical values were chosen thereby cutoff frequency is slightly shifted. Simulation results, for common mode noise filtering indicate, 106 Hz to 107 Hz minimal variation of cutoff frequency and 0. 03 variation in damping factor. Earth leakage currents drastically reduced with increasing of the earth line choke and that is possible way to control common mode noise. Introducing separate earth cables instead of single copper tape in the vertical busbar trunking system, is the elimination method of the earth loops between floors at far apart in the high rise building. Besides, it is required to use same earth termination point for the camera and the display system of the CCTV system in high rise buildings...|$|E

5000|$|In the UK [...] "Earthing" [...] is the {{connection}} of the exposed-conductive parts of the installation by means of protective conductors to the [...] "main earthing terminal", which is connected to an electrode {{in contact with the}} earth's surface. A protective conductor (PE) (known as an equipment grounding conductor in the US National Electrical Code) avoids electric shock hazard by keeping the exposed-conductive surface of connected devices close to earth potential in fault conditions. In the event of a fault, a current is allowed to flow to earth by the earthing system. If this is excessive the overcurrent protection of a fuse or circuit breaker will operate, thereby protecting the circuit and removing any fault-induced voltages from the exposed-conductive surfaces. This disconnection is a fundamental tenet of modern wiring practice and {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Automatic Disconnection of Supply" [...] (ADS). Maximum allowable <b>earth</b> fault <b>loop</b> impedance values and the characteristics of overcurrent protection devices are strictly specified in electrical safety regulations to ensure this happens promptly and that whilst overcurrent is flowing hazardous voltages do not occur on the conductive surfaces.

40|$|The Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, {{passed by}} Congress {{in the wake}} of the {{disaster}} at Farmington, West Virginia, led to an extensive study by the National Academy of Engineering of the problems involved in coal mine safety. One of the results of this report and subsequent research conducted by the U. S. Bureau of Mines has been the investigation of electromagnetic techniques for the location of trapped miners after a mine emergency. The Westinghouse Georesearch Laboratory has been involved in both the 2 theoretical and field studies relating to this problem. A compact personal beacon transmitter has been developed which can be attached to and powered by a miner's lamp battery. A compatible lightweight loop antenna package has also been developed which can be easily carried on a miner's belt. This antenna can be quickly deployed on the mine tunnel floor. For the purpose of calculating its electromagnetic fields on the <b>earth's</b> surface, the <b>loop</b> can be considered to be a magnetic dipole buried in the earth. (The earth is assumed to be homogeneous and to have a conductivity of ? mhos/m.) The surface of the earth is assumed to be uniformily sloping and the transmitter dipole oriented as in Figure 1. The fields on the earth's surface can be computed by using a superposition of the fields of a 4 vertical magnetic dipole 3 and of a horizontal magnetic dipole in proportions which depend on the slope of the terrain. In the case of level terrain a null in the horizontal magnetic 5 field occurs on the surface directly above the dipole. This null is designated as the apparent source location and is the criterion by which the source is located. The criterion was tested at two hardrock mines and two coal mines in the fall of 1972. The apparent source locations were compared to actual locations determined by conventional surveying techniques. It was found that due to nonlevel terrain the apparent and actual source locations differed by up to 13 meters. This discrepancy can be resolved by an examination of the fields of a source beneath uniformly sloping terrain...|$|R
