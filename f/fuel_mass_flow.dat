40|$|Abstract: An {{adaptive}} estimator, {{based on}} an extended Kalma filter, is presented for the non linear fuel film dynamics in the intake port of a spark ignition engine. In {{order to meet the}} stringent limits imposed on automotive exhaust emissions, electronic engine control systems have to constrain Air-Fuel ratio in a narrow band around the stoichiometric value, since even a small excursion results in a large reduction of catalyst conversion efficiency. A two states dynamic model is used to describe liquid and vapor <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flows</b> into the intake manifold, accounting for both the partial impingement of the injected liquid fuel on the manifold walls and the evaporation process. The application of an extended Kalman filter allows to deduce a minimum error estimate of both model states (liquid and vapor <b>fuel</b> <b>mass)</b> and parameters (evaporation time constant and injected liquid fraction impinging the wall) making use of the information derived from both system model and UEGO sensor measurement at exhaust location. The observer has been tested on a set of 14 Air-Fuel ratio dynamic transients measured on a commercial FIAT 1242 16 V engine, showing a good accuracy in predicting the Air/Fuel ratio.

The primary objectives are to investigate the pilot flame dynamics and to provide bases {{for the study of}} the interaction mechanisms between the pilot flame and the main flame. Dynamic pressures are measured by dynamic pressure transducers. A high speed camera with CHâˆ— bandpass filter is used to capture the pilot flame dynamics. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to further analyze the high speed images. With the increase of the pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate, the pilot flame changes from stable to unstable state gradually. The combustion instability frequency is 136 Hz when the pilot flame is unstable. Numerical simulation results show that the equivalence ratios in both the shear layer and the recirculation zone increase as the pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate increases. The mechanism of the {{instability of}} the pilot flame can be attributed to the coupling between the second order acoustic mode and the unsteady heat release due to symmetric vortex shedding.

It was found that increasing of steam pressure results in increase in the combined cycle thermal efficiency. The effect of the inlet flue gases temperature on the gas turbine and on the combined cycle efficiencies was also predicted. The maximum PFCB combined cycle efficiency occurs at a compression ratio of 18, which is the case of utilizing an extra combustor.

Incorporated into the rig s design are features that approximate conditions similar to those that would be encountered by a candidate device if it were installed on an actual combustion research rig. The characterized dynamic performance measures obtained through testing in the rig are planned to be accurate indicators of expected performance in an actual combustion testing environment. To evaluate how well the characterization rig predicts fuel modulator dynamic performance, characterization rig data was compared with performance data for a fuel modulator candidate when the candidate was in operation during combustion testing. Specifically, the nominal and off-nominal performance data for a magnetostrictive-actuated proportional fuel modulation valve is described.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In a CODAD {{propulsion}} plant configuration, with two diesel engines {{assigned to a}} shaft line, the power balancing between the two diesel engines is managed by the {{propulsion plant}} governor mainly by equally distributing the <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> between the two engines, without verifying the effective power delivered by each engine. If one of the diesel engines of a CODAD propulsion plant runs under faulty conditions, its power is different, also in case of equal <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow,</b> from that delivered by the other (un-faulty) diesel engine of the same propulsion system. Usually this power unbalancing cannot be detected by the engines governor and then cannot be corrected, with the consequence that one engine of the system (the un-faulty one) runs in overloading conditions.
