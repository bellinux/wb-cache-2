50|$|Asarum europaeum, {{commonly}} known as asarabacca, <b>European</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ginger,</b> hazelwort, and wild spikenard, is a species of wild ginger (unrelated to the rhizome spice ginger) with single axillary dull purple flowers, lying on the ground. It is widespread across Europe, ranging from southern Finland and northern Russia south to southern France, Italy and the Republic of Macedonia. It is also grown extensively outside of its range as an ornamental. It is sometimes harvested {{for use as a}} spice or a flavoring.|$|E
5000|$|Flora in {{the region}} {{represent}} a combination of species from four biomes: taiga, сool-temperate forests, tundra and steppe and are more diverse than flora {{of many of the}} surrounding areas. [...] The trees include a mix of coniferous and broadleaf tree species. These include Scots pine, silver birch, Eurasian aspen, Siberian pine, Siberian fir, Siberian spruce and Siberian linden. [...] The hemiboreal zones are dominated by Scots Pine and silver birch in wet areas. Moss cover is present, but sparse. Dry areas are dominated by either Scots pine or Siberian larch depending on temperature. Siberian larch is typically more prevalent in cooler areas while warmer and drier ares favor Scots pine. [...] Siberian larch also dominates the forest-steppe ecotone. [...] Epiphyte species include multiple genera of lichen. These include nitrophyte genera such as Physcia and Melanelia, acidophytes such as Usnea and Bryoria and other genera including Hypogymnia and Sticta. Understory plants include Eurasian baneberry, <b>European</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ginger,</b> Baikal anemone, golden saxifrage, bittercress and grasses of the genera Carex, Brachypodium and Calamagrostis.|$|E
40|$|Traditional herbal {{products}} {{are widely used}} in Australia to treat {{a broad range of}} conditions and diseases. It is popularly believed that these {{products are}} safer than prescribed drugs. While many may be safe, it is worrying that the specific effects and harmful interactions of a number of their components with prescription medications is not well understood. Some traditional herbal preparations contain heavy metals and toxic chemicals, as well as naturally occurring organic toxins. The effects of these substances can be dire, including acute hepatic and renal failure, exacerbation of pre-existing conditions and diseases, and even death. The content and quality of herbal preparations are not tightly controlled, with some ingredients either not listed or their concentrations recorded inaccurately on websites or labels. Herbal products may also include illegal ingredients, such as ephedra, Asarum europaeum (<b>European</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ginger)</b> and endangered animal species (eg, snow leopard). An additional problem is augmentation with prescription medications to enhance the apparent effectiveness of a preparation. Toxic substances may also be deliberately or inadvertently added: less expensive, more harmful plants may be substituted for more expensive ingredients, and processing may not be adequate. The lack of regulation and monitoring of traditional herbal preparations in Australia and other Western countries means that their contribution to illness and death is unknown. We need to raise awareness of these problems with health care practitioners and with the general public. Roger W Byard, Ian Musgrave, Garth Maker, Michael Bunc...|$|E

50|$|Asarum caudatum (British Columbia <b>wild</b> <b>ginger,</b> western <b>wild</b> <b>ginger,</b> or long-tailed <b>wild</b> <b>ginger)</b> is {{native to}} rich moist forests of western North America from British Columbia to California and as far east as western Montana. It is an {{evergreen}} with flowers that develop from March to August. The flowers are distinct, hirsute (hairy), cup-shaped, and brown-purple to green-yellow which terminate in three, long, gracefully curved lobes, often concealed by leaves. The long rhizomes give rise to persistent reniform (kidney/heart shaped) leaves. Leaves are found in colonies or clusters as the rhizome spreads, forming mats. The leaves emit a ginger aroma when rubbed.|$|R

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{survey was conducted}} in five different villages in Mpumalanga Province. Hundred and fifty traditional healers were interviewed. The aim of the survey was to record and document indigenous knowledge held by the traditional healers on <b>wild</b> <b>ginger</b> and eight other popular plants used by them. The healing properties of <b>wild</b> <b>ginger</b> as perceived by traditional healers, ranged from healing coughs, colds, flu, hysteria, malaria and menstrual disorder, to protection against lightning. Majority (77 %) {{said that there was}} no difference in medicinal value between cultivated and those grown in the wild. The majority of the traditional healers (72 %) said they would appreciate proper training on how to domesticate these plants. Traditional healers do not have professional knowledge and skills to produce theses medicinal plants. Therefore training is crucial to impart these skills. The income category of traditional healers ranged from less than R 200 to a maximum of R 3000. Traditional healers received as few as 1 to 5 patients per day. The consultation cost ranged from R 20 to more than R 95. People who gathered plants for traditional healers ranged from 1 to 10 depending on the popularity of the traditional healer and the size of his/ her surgery. An experiment was carried out at Johannesburg Center for the disabled (JOCOD), Lenasia, South of Johannesburg, in a plastic tunnel and under a shade net. The objective of the experiment was to determine the effect of using a tunnel or a shade net on the yield of rhizome and to determine the effect of different harvesting periods on rhizome yield of <b>wild</b> <b>ginger.</b> The treatments were four in number, namely; two growing structures (tunnel and shade net) and two harvesting periods. On the effect of harvesting periods on yield, although there was no significant differences in the number of enlarged roots harvested between the first harvesting period and the second harvesting period, the number of roots tended to be higher during the first harvesting period compared to the second harvesting period. There was a significant difference in the number of rhizomes between the first and the second harvesting periods. On the effect of growth structure on yield of <b>wild</b> <b>ginger,</b> the number of enlarged roots was significantly higher from plants grown in a tunnel compared with those grown in a shade net. There was a significant difference in rhizome circumference between plants grown in a plastic tunnel and those grown in a shade net. There were interactions between the harvesting date and growth structure for fresh enlarged root mass. Fresh mass of enlarged roots of <b>wild</b> <b>ginger</b> was greater during the first harvesting date than during the second harvesting date for plants grown in a plastic tunnel. For small scale or resource poor farmers, herbalists and traditional healers who wish to grow <b>wild</b> <b>ginger</b> under protection, it is better to grow <b>wild</b> <b>ginger</b> in a plastic tunnel than under a shade net, probably because <b>wild</b> <b>ginger</b> performs well in warm conditions. The plastic tunnels have a tendency of maintaining warm temperatures during winter months. Early harvesting of <b>wild</b> <b>ginger</b> at the end of June 28 / 06 than harvesting in September. This could be because <b>wild</b> <b>ginger</b> grows rapidly throughout the summer season and in winter, the growth rate drops (dormant stage) making early winter the right time to harvest.
