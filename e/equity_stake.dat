40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the main bank's equity-debt structure, (i. e., <b>equity</b> <b>stakes</b> and debt claims) on firm performance and financial policies in Japan over the period 1977 - 1987. Results show that firms with main bank <b>equity</b> <b>stakes</b> have lower performance than those without. However, among firms with main bank <b>equity</b> <b>stakes,</b> the equity-debt structure of claims has a positive effect on firm performance. The positive effect of the main bank's equity-debt structure is found to be greater in group-affiliated firms than in independent firms. The main bank maximizes its own interests by charging a higher interest rate when its <b>equity</b> <b>stakes</b> are relatively less than its debt claims and by prompting firms to pay more dividends when its <b>equity</b> <b>stakes</b> are relatively high. ...|$|R
