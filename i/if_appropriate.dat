5|$|<b>If</b> <b>appropriate</b> {{electrical}} contacts {{are attached to}} a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) can be generated by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E
5|$|For three years, Albin's {{activities}} are unreported until, on 30 April 1260, he was recorded as being at Montrose, {{again as a}} papal mandatory. He gave judgment on a dispute between Archibald, Bishop of Moray, and the latter's cathedral chapter, concerning the bishop's rights of visitation. On 13 June 1263, Albin, Roger, Bishop of Ross, and Richard de Inverkeithing, Bishop of Dunkeld, were selected by the papacy to judge the fitness and, <b>if</b> <b>appropriate,</b> consecrate Walter de Baltrodin as Bishop of Caithness.|$|E

5|$|After some deliberation, with {{opinions}} {{sought and}} obtained from Percival Keith, Norris Bradbury, Darol Froman, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Nichols and Edward Teller, {{it was decided}} that this could be done safely <b>if</b> <b>appropriate</b> precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent product. At this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: enrichment in uranium-235 also enriched the product in the unwanted and fairly useless uranium-234, making it difficult to raise the enrichment to 95 percent. On 6 December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady 2.56kg per day enriched to 93.7 percent uranium-235, along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 enrichment activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947.|$|E

25|$|Each {{defence area}} {{comprised}} zigzag trenches, machine gun posts, weapons pits, barbed wire, minefields and <b>if</b> <b>appropriate</b> had Tobruk pits, personnel bunkers, fixed location flame throwers that were fired remotely, mortars, armoured machine gun tank turret, 3.7cm Pak 35/36, 4.7cm Pak K 36(t) or 5 cm Pak 38 anti tank gun, coastal gun. Concrete bunkers and casemates {{as well as}} open positions.|$|E
60|$|Fisheries {{are another}} example. Fisheries {{in the open}} sea are not appropriated, but {{fisheries}} in lakes or rivers almost always are so, and likewise oyster-beds or other particular fishing-grounds on coasts. We may take salmon-fisheries {{as an example of}} the whole class. Some rivers are far more productive in salmon than others. None, however, without being exhausted, can supply more than a very limited demand. All others, therefore, will, <b>if</b> <b>appropriated,</b> afford a rent equal to the value of their superiority.|$|R
5000|$|Ghosting {{is a form}} of {{identity}} theft in which someone steals the identity, and sometimes even the role within society, of a specific dead person (the [...] "ghost") who is not widely known to be deceased. Usually, the person who steals this identity (the [...] "ghoster") is roughly the same age that the ghost would have been if still alive, so that any documents citing the birthdate of the ghost will not be conspicuously incorrect <b>if</b> <b>appropriated</b> by the thief now claiming to be that person.|$|R

25|$|Men who {{transferred}} {{in or out}} of the Mercantile Marine from or to {{the fighting}} services also qualified for the award of the Victory Medal and, <b>if</b> <b>appropriate,</b> the 1914 Star or 1914–15 Star, while still being eligible for the Mercantile Marine War Medal. Service solely in the Mercantile Marine, however, did not count for the award of the Victory Medal or either of the two Stars.|$|E
25|$|Most badges have an {{inscription}} on the reverse, which often recorded where the badge was made and, <b>if</b> <b>appropriate,</b> what special occasion it commemorated. In addition the reverse may also feature a revolutionary slogan, a quotation from Mao, or respectful wishes for long life to Chairman Mao. Thus each obverse design may {{have hundreds of}} different varieties with different reverse inscriptions, being produced {{in different parts of}} the country or to commemorate different events.|$|E
25|$|The {{conservation}} status of N.leonardoi {{has not been}} formally assessed for the IUCN Red List, but the describing authors suggested it be considered Critically Endangered based on the IUCN criteria, due to its localised distribution and small population size. Although the habitat of N.leonardoi remains untouched my human activity, the describing authors cited mining operations to the south, on the Mount Victoria massif (to which N.attenboroughii is endemic), as a possible future threat <b>if</b> <b>appropriate</b> conservation measures are not taken.|$|E

25|$|If {{it seemed}} that the patient would recover but still needed nursing, the injurer was {{responsible}} for that. This was known as sick maintenance, rendering variously crólige, folog n-othrusa, folog, or othrus in different texts. Bretha Crólige goes into great detail about this process, describing how the injurer had to find a suitable location and move the victim. Then the injurer had to pay for food for the victim and a retinue—which could be considerable depending on the victim's rank. The injurer also had to provide someone to fulfill the victim's duties while he was incapacitated. He also had to pay a fine for the missed opportunity for procreation <b>if</b> <b>appropriate.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{depressive}} disorders, a stepped-care intervention (watchful waiting, CBT {{and medication}} <b>if</b> <b>appropriate)</b> achieved a 50% lower incidence rate {{in a patient}} group aged 75 or older. Another depression study found a neutral effect compared to personal, social, and health education, and usual school provision, and included a comment on potential for increased depression scores {{from people who have}} received CBT due to greater self recognition and acknowledgement of existing symptoms of depression and negative thinking styles. A further study also saw a neutral result. A meta-study of the Coping with Depression course, a cognitive behavioral intervention delivered by a psychoeducational method, saw a 38% reduction in risk of major depression.|$|E
25|$|A hazard is any {{agent or}} {{situation}} that poses {{a level of}} threat to life, health, property, or environment. Most hazards remain dormant or potential, with only a theoretical risk of harm, and when a hazard becomes active, and produces undesirable consequences, it is called an incident and may culminate in an emergency or accident. Hazard and vulnerability interact with likelihood of occurrence to create risk, which can be {{the probability of a}} specific undesirable consequence of a specific hazard, or the combined probability of undesirable consequences of all the hazards of a specific activity. A hazard that is understood and acknowledged may present a lower risk <b>if</b> <b>appropriate</b> precautions are taken, and the consequences may be less severe if mitigation procedures are planned and in place.|$|E

25|$|The {{spoilage}} of meat occurs, if untreated, in {{a matter}} of hours or days and results in the meat becoming unappetizing, poisonous or infectious. Spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent decomposition of meat by bacteria and fungi, which are borne by the animal itself, by the people handling the meat, and by their implements. Meat can be kept edible for a much longer time – though not indefinitely – if proper hygiene is observed during production and processing, and <b>if</b> <b>appropriate</b> food safety, food preservation and food storage procedures are applied. Without the application of preservatives and stabilizers, the fats in meat may also begin to rapidly decompose after cooking or processing, leading to an objectionable taste known as warmed over flavor.|$|E
25|$|The {{management}} {{work for}} the park includes the maintenance of tourism structures (such as trails, cabins), {{as well as the}} maintenance of certain meadows. <b>If</b> <b>appropriate,</b> the park authorities can regulate the beaver population, which is capable of harming the forest. Elk, deer, and American mink hunting is allowed for population regulation purposes, but is forbidden between 1January and 15August. To protect the birds, access to certain zones can be forbidden during nesting season, from 1January to 15June. These fixed zones have been replaced in 2015 by the possibility of creating temporary zones permitting themselves to adapt to zones where the most vulnerable species are found. The ban on commercial activity has also been lifted. Finally, the speed limit for boats was lowered from 12 to 7 knots except for certain sections where the maximum speed is capped at 12 or 20 knots.|$|E
25|$|Arbitration can {{be either}} {{voluntary}} or mandatory (although mandatory arbitration can only come from a statute or from a contract that is voluntarily entered into, in which the parties agree to hold all existing or future disputes to arbitration, without necessarily knowing, specifically, what disputes will ever occur) and {{can be either}} binding or non-binding. Non-binding arbitration is similar to mediation in that a decision cannot be imposed on the parties. However, the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground on which to compromise, the (non-binding) arbitrator remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and, <b>if</b> <b>appropriate,</b> {{an indication of the}} quantum of damages payable. By one definition arbitration is binding and non-binding arbitration is therefore technically not arbitration.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus a treasure buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes <b>if</b> <b>appropriated</b> properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|R
