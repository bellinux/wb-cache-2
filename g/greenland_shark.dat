25|$|Clonal {{immortality}} apart, {{there are}} certain species whose individual lifespans stand out among Earth's life-forms, including the bristlecone pine at 5062 years or 5067 years (however Hayflick states that the bristlecone pine has no cells older than 30 years), invertebrates like the hard clam (known as quahog in New England) at 508 years, the <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> at 400 years,, various deep-sea tube worms at over 300 years, fish like the sturgeon and the rockfish, and the sea anemone and lobster. Such organisms are sometimes said to exhibit negligible senescence. The genetic aspect has also been demonstrated in studies of human centenarians.|$|E
25|$|A full-grown moose has few enemies except Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) which {{regularly}} prey {{on adult}} moose, but {{a pack of}} gray wolves (Canis lupus) can still pose a threat, especially to females with calves. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) are also known to prey on moose of various sizes, including many pregnant adult cows {{in some parts of}} Alaska and Scandinavia and even the rare bull moose, and are the only predator besides the wolf to attack moose both in Eurasia and North America. However, brown bears are more likely to take over a wolf kill or to take young moose than to hunt adult moose on their own. American black bears (Ursus americanus) and cougars (Puma concolor) can be significant predators of moose calves in May and June and can, in rare instances, prey on adults (mainly cows rather than the larger bulls). Wolverine (Gulo gulo) are most likely to eat moose as carrion but have killed moose, including adults, when the large ungulates are weakened by harsh winter conditions. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are the moose's only known marine predator as they have been known to prey on moose swimming between islands out of North America's Northwest Coast, however, {{there is at least one}} recorded instance of a moose preyed upon by a <b>Greenland</b> <b>Shark.</b>|$|E

500|$|Shark lifespans vary by species. Most live 20 to 30 years. The spiny dogfish {{has one of}} {{the longest}} lifespans at more than 100 years. Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) may also live over 100 years. Earlier {{estimates}} suggested the <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> (Somniosus microcephalus) could reach about 200 years, but a recent study found that a [...] specimen was 392 ± 120 years old (i.e., at least 272 years old), making it the longest-lived vertebrate known.|$|E
500|$|One {{contender}} in maximum size among the predatory sharks is the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). While tiger sharks which are typically both {{a few feet}} smaller and have a leaner, less heavy body structure than white sharks, have been confirmed to reach at least [...] in the length, an unverified specimen {{was reported to have}} measured [...] in length and weighed , more than two times heavier than the largest confirmed specimen at [...] Some other macropredatory sharks such as the <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> (Somniosus microcephalus) and the Pacific sleeper shark (S. pacificus) are also reported to rival these sharks in length (but probably weigh a bit less since they are more slender in build than a great white) in exceptional cases. The question of maximum weight is complicated by the unresolved {{question of whether or not}} to include the shark's stomach contents when weighing the shark. With a single bite a great white can take in up to [...] of flesh, and can also consume several hundred kilograms of food.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Life-stage-based {{management}} of marine fishes requires information on juvenile habitat preferences to ensure sustainable population demographics. This is espe-cially {{important in the}} Arctic region given very {{little is known about}} the life histories of many native species, yet exploitation by developing commercial and artisanal fisher-ies is increasing as the ice extent decreases. Through scien-tific surveys and bycatch data from gillnet fisheries, we document captures of rarely reported juvenile <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> (Somniosus microcephalus; B 200 cm total length [TL]) during the ice-free period in the Canadian Arctic. A total of 22 juvenile animals (42 % of total catch; n = 54), including the smallest reliably measured individual of 117 cm TL, were caught on scientific longlines and bottom trawls in Scott Inlet and Sam Ford Trough over three con-secutive years. Molecular genetic nuclear markers confirmed species identity for 44 of these sharks sampled; however, two sharks including a juvenile of 150 cm TL were identified as carrying a Pacific sleeper shark (Somniosus pacificus) mito-chondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) haplotype. This represents the first record of a Pacific sleeper shark genetic signature in <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> in Eastern Arctic waters. Juvenile sharks caught as bycatch in gillnet fisheries were only observed offshore in Baffin Bay surrounding a fishery closure area, while larger subadult and mature <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> ([200 cm TL) were caught in all fishing locations, including areas where juveniles were observed. The repeatable occur-rence of juvenile <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> in a fjord and their pre-sence at two offshore sites indicates that these smaller animals either reside in nurseries or have defined home ranges in both coastal and offshore regions or undertake large-scale inshore– offshore movements...|$|R
2500|$|Ringed seal are an {{important}} food item in particular for polar bears. [...] During the pupping season, Arctic fox and glaucous gulls take ringed seal pups born outside lairs while killer whales, <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> and occasionally Atlantic walruses prey upon them in the water.|$|R
50|$|Like other elasmobranchs, <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> {{have high}} {{concentrations}} of the nitrogenous waste products urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their tissues, which increases their buoyancy and function as osmoprotectants.

40|$|Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) tissue (mainly blubber) {{was found}} in the {{gastrointestinal}} tracks of <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> (Somniosus microcephalus) collected in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, Norway. In order to determine whether the sharks were actively hunting the whales, finding naturally dead whales or consuming offal from whaling, we checked the genetic identity of the whale tissue found in the sharks against the DNA register for minke whales taken in Norwegian whaling operations. All of the minke whale samples from the sharks that had DNA of sufficient quality to perform individual identifications were traceable to the whaling DNA register. During whaling operations, the blubber is stripped from the carcass and thrown overboard. The blubber strips float on the surface and are available for surface-feeding predators. This study revealed that <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> are scavenging this material; additionally, it demonstrates the capacity of this &#x 2018;benthic-feeding&#x 2019; shark to utilize the whole water column for foraging...|$|R
40|$|Harbour {{seals in}} Svalbard have short longevity, despite being {{protected}} from human hunting and having limited terrestrial predation at their haulout sites, low contaminant burdens and no fishery by-catch issues. This {{led us to}} explore the diet of <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> (Somniosus microcephalus) in this region as a potential seal predator. We examined gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) from 45 <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> in this study. These sharks ranged from 229 to 381 cm in fork length and 136 - 700 kg in body mass; all were sexually immature. Seal and whale tissues were found in 36. 4 and 18. 2 %, respectively, of the GITs that had contents (n = 33). Based on genetic analyses, the dominant seal prey species was the ringed seal (Pusa hispida); bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) and hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) tissues were each found in a single shark. The sharks had eaten ringed seal pups and adults based {{on the presence of}} lanugo-covered prey (pups) and age determinations based on growth rings on claws (< 1 year and adults). All of the whale tissue was from minke whale (Balenoptera acutorostrata) offal, from animals that had been harvested in the whale fishery near Svalbard. Fish dominated the sharks' diet, with Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) being the most important fish species. Circumstantial evidence suggests that these sharks actively prey on seals and fishes, in addition to eating carrion such as the whale tissue. Our study suggests that <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> may play a significant predatory role in Arctic food webs...|$|R
25|$|<b>Greenland</b> <b>Sharks</b> are {{currently}} the vertebrate species with the longest known lifespan. An examination of 28 specimens {{in one study}} published in 2016 determined by radiocarbon dating that {{the oldest of the}} animals that they sampled had lived for about 392 ± 120 years (a minimum of 272 years and a maximum of 512 years). The authors further concluded that the species reaches sexual maturity at about 150 years of age.|$|R

50|$|Having {{left their}} natal streams, they {{experience}} {{a period of}} rapid growth during the one to four years {{they live in the}} ocean. Typically, Atlantic salmon migrate from their home streams to an area on the continental plate off West Greenland. During this time, they face predation from humans, seals, <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks,</b> skate, cod, and halibut. Some dolphins have been noticed playing with dead salmon, but it is still unclear whether they consume them.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{all modern}} {{predation}} of narwhals is by humans. Other predators are polar bears, which attack at breathing holes mainly for young narwhals, <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> and walruses. Killer whales (orcas) group together to overwhelm narwhal pods {{in the shallow}} water of enclosed bays, in one case killing dozens of narwhals in a single attack. To escape predators such as orcas, narwhals may use prolonged submergence to hide under ice floes {{rather than relying on}} speed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> migrate {{annually}} {{based on}} depth and temperature rather than distance, although some do travel.

50|$|<b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> of {{the family}} Somniosidae are hunted for food in Iceland.
