5000|$|In 1996, Atkinson {{was elected}} to an unusual five-year term as vice mayor under the Metropolitan Charter, which had been adopted by voters four years earlier to merge many of the {{functions}} of Davidson County and the Nashville municipal government. In one of the charter's many compromise provisions, most {{of which had been}} included to overcome the objections which had led to the defeat of an earlier Metropolitan Charter proposed during the 1950s, it was agreed that the second group of office holders elected under the charter would serve for five years rather than the usual four in order to take the metropolitan offices out of the election cycle for statewide offices such as governor and state legislature and holdover county offices such as property assessor, court clerk, and the like. Ostensibly this was in the interest of a shorter ballot and to give these offices the weight of importance that they deserved; to critics this provision meant to move the offices to being elected at a time when only persons with a strong interest in the local government [...] - [...] most notably municipal <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> their <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> [...] - [...] were likely to vote.|$|R

40|$|As {{the number}} of older adults in Australia increases, {{attention}} is being directed toward ensuring their good health.  Research suggests that health outcomes of older adults are impacted by social belonging and loneliness, <b>and</b> that <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationship quality is pivotal to wellbeing.  However, the roles of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships in promoting social belonging {{have yet to be}} determined.     Aims: This study investigated if perceptions of social belonging in late adulthood are differentiated by the quality of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships. Method:  The study consisted of two phases.  In Phase 1, 260 university staff and students, aged 18 to 75, completed an online survey investigating the quality of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> their association with social belonging.  In Phase 2, 88 older adults completed a refined print version of the survey.   Results:  Multiple regression was used to analyse the predictive ability of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships on social belonging. In Phase 1, significant associations were found between both <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> social belonging, with friendship yielding the strongest relationship.  Interestingly, in Phase 2 the association between quality of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> social belonging was mediated by age. Those aged 65 to 74 reported a significant relationship between <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> social belonging, which contrasted with those aged over 75.  A significant association between social belonging <b>and</b> <b>family</b> relationships was also found for the entire cohort aged over 65, while high quality friend relationships enhanced social belonging when family relationships were not strong. Conclusions: These results are tentative, but suggest that future research should consider the role that both friendships <b>and</b> <b>family</b> play in promoting social belonging in older adults...|$|R
30|$|Despite a {{range of}} {{symptoms}} associated with problem gambling, there is limited research exploring the role of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> {{in the treatment of}} problem gamblers or the efficacy of treatment for this group.
