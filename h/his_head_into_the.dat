5|$|In {{the third}} match, Carlito faced Mankind, who {{was chosen by}} the fans' vote with 52%. The match began when Carlito {{performed}} a dropkick on Mankind. However, Mankind got the advantage over Carlito. Midway through the match, Mankind tried to use a steel chair on Carlito, but Carlito avoided, executeing drop toe-hold, sending Mankind into the steel steps. Mankind rose to his feet, which led Carlito to perform a standing dropkick, resulting in Mankind to hit the back of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> steel steps. Back in the ring, Mankind received the upper hand after delivering a DDT and forced Carlito to submit with the Mandible claw and win the match.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Heavyweight Championship was defended in a Raven's Rules match by Raven against Rhino in {{the eighth}} {{encounter}} on the card. A contest conducted under Raven's Rules means there are no count-outs or no disqualifications, and weapons are provided for the environment; {{the only way to}} win is by pinfall or submission. Raven used a pizza cutter early on in the bout to cut open Rhino's forehead, causing him to bleed heavily. Later, Raven's forehead was also cut open due to being hit by a trashcan. Rhino used a staple gun during the contest; Rhino placed several staples in Raven's forehead. Cassidy Riley, Jeff Hardy, and Jeff Jarrett interfered in the bout. Riley interfered by accidentally distracting the referee during a pin attempt by Raven, whom Riley was attempting to aid. Jarrett came down to the ring near the end trying to bash Raven in the face with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt, but was stopped by Hardy. Raven then performed his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver on Jarrett, forcing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring mat. Afterwards, Raven performed the Raven Effect DDT on Rhino and covered for the pinfall victory to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at 14 minutes and 28 seconds.|$|E
25|$|On the March 14 {{episode of}} SmackDown Live, Styles ambushed SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon {{when he arrived}} at the venue and ended up {{slamming}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> window of a parked car. Afterwards, SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan confronted Styles and—in storyline—fired him for his actions before having security escort Styles out of the building. However, later that night McMahon returned to the arena and stated that he would face Styles at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Styles defeated McMahon. On the April 4 episode of SmackDown Live, Styles made reconciliation with Shane McMahon via a handshake and thus turned back into a fan favorite in the process.|$|E

25|$|Their feud began, with Flair {{portrayed as}} the protagonist and Race as the antagonist, who {{was afraid to}} lose the title and {{employed}} unethical tactics to remain the champion. The storyline involved Race offering a $25,000 bounty to have Flair put out of professional wrestling to avoid losing the title. On August 31, Bob Orton, Jr. and Dick Slater attacked Flair by performing an aided piledriver, dropping <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> canvas. Flair was portrayed as suffering from a serious neck injury, and they collected the bounty from Race. Flair announced his retirement from professional wrestling, but returned on September 21 by attacking Orton and Slater with a baseball bat. The promoters planned for their feud to culminate at Starrcade after a long pursuit.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, Powell {{repeatedly}} banged <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> iron {{walls of}} his cell aboard the Saugus. Whether this was a suicide attempt (as his jailers believed) or not, it deeply alarmed military officials. A canvas padded hood, with only a slit for the mouth and nostrils, was fashioned. Powell {{and all the other}} prisoners aboard the monitors were forced to wear them 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to prevent any further suicide attempts. Only Mary Surratt and Dr. Mudd were not required to wear the hoods. Powell cried when the hood was placed on him. The hoods were hot, claustrophobic, and uncomfortable, and in the humid confines of the monitors in the steaming Washington summer the prisoners suffered immensely. On June 6, Hartranft ordered them removed—except for Powell's.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was a steel cage match between Ric Flair and Harley Race for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, with former NWA World Champion Gene Kiniski as the special referee. The match began with Flair having the {{advantage}} with a headlock. Race fought back by targeting Flair's head and neck. Race, using a piledriver maneuver, dropped Flair head {{first into the}} canvas and then sent <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cage. Flair fought back after sending Race {{into the corner of}} the ring. Flair performed a piledriver and sent Race's head into the cage. After slamming Race down with a belly to back suplex, Flair applied a figure four leglock. Race broke the hold by rolling into the ropes and fought back with a headbutt from the top turnbuckle. As Race applied a headlock, Flair sent Race's head into Kiniski's head. Flair then performed a body press from the top turnbuckle and pinned Race to win the match and the title.|$|E

25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was Randy Orton versus Rey Mysterio for Mysterio's world {{championship}} match at WrestleMania 22. Their match stemmed from the Royal Rumble, the pay-per-view three weeks before No Way Out. At the Royal Rumble, Mysterio won the 2006 Royal Rumble match and a world championship match at WrestleMania 22 by last eliminating Randy Orton. On the February 3 episode of SmackDown!, Orton claimed that there's {{no way he could}} beat him in a normal match and that he won the match because of some divine intervention. Orton then challenged Mysterio to a match at No Way Out for his title match at WrestleMania 22, and claimed that Eddie Guerrero was not in heaven, but in hell. Later that night, Orton along with Mark Henry defeated Mysterio and Kurt Angle. Midway through the match, Davari confronted Angle and was chased outside the ring and into the crowd. Henry followed, leaving Mysterio and Orton on their own. Orton gained the pinfall after sitting on Mysterio. After the match, Orton claimed that Mysterio had as much chance of defeating him as Guerrero did of coming back to life. Mysterio responded by accepting Orton's challenge on behalf of Guerrero. The next week on SmackDown!, Orton set the record straight about the comments he made about Eddie Guerrero. Backstage, he said that he only made the comments to get inside Mysterio's head, and {{that he did not know}} or care if Guerrero was in Hell. Orton later entered the arena in a lowrider to further explain his actions, and read an excerpt from Guerrero's book, Cheating Death, Stealing Life – The Eddie Guerrero Story, but Mysterio attacked him, dropkicking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> steel ringpost. On the February 17 episode of SmackDown!, Mysterio faced off against Sylvan, which Mysterio won after a West Coast Pop. After the match, Orton came out and said that Mysterio would never main event WrestleMania, he would never become World Champion and that he could never beat him.|$|E
500|$|During his {{coaching}} career, Rymkus was renowned for his strictness. While with the Oilers, he repeatedly threatened to whip his players. He {{could also be}} melodramatic. He once repeated a speech Leahy gave at Notre Dame before a practice in a blizzard. He told his players during a hot August in Houston to be [...] "like the Great Northern Buffalo, whose coat is shaggy and whose muscles are strong. The Great Northern Buffalo sticks <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wind and braves the cold, not like the puny Southern Buffalo, who turns {{his back to the}} storm." ...|$|E
500|$|Nixon speechwriter William Safire {{had been}} told of the sign by a friend of Nixon, Richard Moore, who left the train at {{campaign}} stops to mingle with the crowd and seek items of local color for the speechwriters to use. Safire stated in his book on {{the early days of}} the Nixon administration (originally published in 1975) that at Deshler, [...] "Moore boarded the train with that mystic look that a writer gets when he has something delicious to work with, some piece of color that could be more than a gimmick." [...] According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore stuck <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, [...] "There's a little kid out there with a hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'." [...] Safire wrote in that column that he inserted the phrase into Nixon's remarks for the speech to be given at the next stop.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{time after}} {{entering}} the Lodge, Cooper and Annie reappear in the woods. [...] They are discovered by Sheriff Truman, {{who has been}} waiting for them since he saw Cooper disappear. Annie is bloodied and hospitalized, but Cooper's injuries are minor enough that Doctor Hayward is able to treat them in Cooper's room at the Great Northern Hotel. Upon waking, Cooper asks about Annie's condition, and then states he needs to brush his teeth. When Cooper enters the bathroom and looks into the mirror, his reflection is Bob, revealing that he is Cooper's doppelgänger from the Black Lodge. He then rams <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mirror and, while laughing maniacally, repeatedly mocks his earlier question about Annie's condition.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time as a comet appears in the western skies, Alric orders the {{majority}} of the surviving members of the Legion, twenty-two hundred men, to launch a frontal attack on Balor's fortress in a suicide mission designed to cause a distraction, as he takes the remaining one-hundred men through a World Knot (a teleportation device) to a spot behind the fortress. As they near the fortress, Alric tells the stunned soldiers that Balor is in fact Connacht, and with this in mind, he intends to raise the Myrkridian battle standard found in the Tain, hoping to enrage Balor into making a tactical error. The plan works; furious {{at the sight of the}} flag, Balor leaves the fortress, and Alric immobilizes him with an Eblis Stone. The Legion decapitate him, and take his head to a bottomless pit known as [...] "The Great Devoid", as only by throwing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Devoid can he be destroyed. The thirty remaining members of The Legion are ambushed by Soulblighter as they approach the Devoid, but they fight their way through, and fling the head into the pit. Soulblighter turns into a murder of crows and flees, moments before a massive explosion erupts from within the Devoid. With Balor's destruction, the remaining Fallen are rendered powerless, and their armies collapse, bringing to an end the war between the Light and the Dark.|$|E
