40|$|In the paper, {{we present}} some {{applications}} of Huff’s and Laksmanan–Hansen’s models {{to the trade}} area range analysis. The subjects discussed are illustrated by {{an example of the}} real area with three hypothetical trade centers. In order to quantitatively express the factors describing trade centers we propose an approach using the experts evaluation method. The contour and surface probability maps for trade centers and financial flow matrices have been evaluated and designed. Composing the maps of several centers in the same picture, the areas of dominance of particular centers have been marked. The border lines of the range of the neighbouring centers are represented by the <b>equal</b> <b>probability</b> <b>curves.</b> We show that the model can be used for forecasting purposes. To this end, we define and illustrate the notion of the trade area range conditional probability. marketing geography, trade area range, trade centers location, forecasting...|$|E
40|$|The {{validity}} and benefit of <b>probability</b> <b>curves</b> in allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) testing and their applicability {{to more than}} a few allergens are still pending. One study [1] presented <b>probability</b> <b>curves</b> for 4 food allergens and proposed decision points to rule out the need for food challenges in his clinic. Since then, such cutoffs were reported by Boyano-Martinez [2] to be dependent on population, age, allergen and disease. A recent article by Söderström [3] extended the use of <b>probability</b> <b>curves</b> to 8 inhalant allergens. The results were allergen dependent and site specific. None of the studies, however, has addressed the potential impact of IgE specific for cross-reacting carbohydrate determinants (CCD) on these <b>probability</b> <b>curves</b> [4]. In this study, we use logistic regression model to compare the <b>probability</b> <b>curves</b> for food and inhalant allergens using two quantitative sIgE assays; an FEIA (Pharmacia CAP) and DPC's automated chemiluminescent IMMULITE® 2000. The FEIA yields explicit results down to 0. 35 kU L - 1; the "third-generation" IMMULITE 2000 has an analytical sensitivity of 0. 1 kU L - 1 and provides precise quantification down to 0. 2 kU L - 1. In previous studies [6, 7], patients with suspected IgE-mediated allergy were evaluated according to skin prick tests or food challenges positive or negative allergen-specific diagnosis. Logistic regression was performed using the online regression analysis facility at: [URL] {{which is part of the}} Interactive Statistical Calculations web site. For inhalant allergens, almost identical overall <b>probability</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained for the FEIA and IMMULITE 2000 methods. For food allergen, similar <b>probability</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained with the two methods. The <b>probability</b> <b>curves</b> were allergen dependent. The FEIA and IMMULITE 2000 methods gave similar allergen-dependent profiles, however and in one case (W 6), both methods yielded identical <b>probability</b> <b>curves.</b> The present study demonstrates that the 2 sIgE assays yield comparable <b>probability</b> <b>curves</b> for the inhalant and food allergens tested. Because the FEIA method is unable to yield explicit results below 0. 35 kU L - 1, the <b>probability</b> <b>curve</b> generated is necessarily truncated at this level. Methods for sIgE measurement that allow for extending <b>probability</b> <b>curves</b> below 0. 35 kU L - 1 can also assess assay performance more definitively at the traditional 0. 35 kU L - 1 cutoff. Thus the third-generation IMMULITE 2000 is a better tool for defining <b>probability</b> <b>curves,</b> as the applicability of such curves in allergy testing and the potential impact of IgE to CCD become well understood...|$|R
