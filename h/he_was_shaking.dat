25|$|Eventually Rico {{allowed his}} brother {{to find out about}} his racketeering. When Joe {{witnessed}} Rico murder an innocent cafe owner who had refused to pay him protection money, Joe arrested him. Rico resisted arrest by opening fire, but the shots went wide. Given Rico's skill with a firearm, Joe would later posit the theory that Rico was trying to commit suicide by cop out of a deep disgust at what he had become, rather than trying to kill him. In The Third Law, Rico reveals the shop owner was a chocolate smuggler <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> down and claims he had only meant to wound the owner to throw a scare into him. Rather than suicide by cop, Rico claims he just couldn't shoot his brother. Whatever his motive, Rico was sentenced to twenty years hard labour on the prison colony of Titan, where he grew to hate his brother. He was particularly angry that Joe didn't testify in his favour.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Chapman {{contacted}} Connolly, Priest, Scott, and Tucker in 1988, {{offering to}} finance a recording session in Los Angeles. As he remembers: [...] "I met them {{at the airport and}} Andy and Mick came off the plane. I said, 'Where's Brian?' They said, 'Oh, he's coming.' All the people had come off the plane by now. Then this little old man hobbled towards us. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking,</b> and had a ghostly white face. I thought, 'Oh, Jesus Christ.' It was horrifying." [...] Reworked studio versions of [...] "Action" [...] and [...] "The Ballroom Blitz" [...] were recorded, but it became clear that Connolly's voice and physical health had made Sweet's original member comeback too difficult to promote commercially. Consequently, the reunion attempt was aborted.|$|E
