40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a Multi-Input Single-Output fully coupled transfer function model of a civil light helicopter in hover. A frequency domain identification method is implemented. It is discussed that the chosen frequency range of excitation allows to capture some important rotor dynamic modes. Therefore, studies that require coupled rotor/body models are possible. The pitch-rate response with respect to the longitudinal cyclic is considered in detail throughout the paper. Different transfer functions are evaluated to compare the capability to capture the main helicopter dynamic modes. It is concluded that models with order less than 6 are not able to model the lead-lag dynamics in the pitch axis. Nevertheless, a transfer function model of the 4 th order can provide acceptable results for handling qualities evaluations. The <b>identified</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> models are validated in the time domain with different input signals than those used during the identification and show good predictive capabilities. From the results it is possible to conclude that the <b>identified</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> models are able to capture the main dynamic characteristics of the considered light helicopter in hover...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Transfer {{function}} {{models is}} of considerable interest in economics, engineering, biology, {{and many other}} fields. Models of this kind can describe not only the behavior of industrial processes but also that of economic and business systems. <b>Transfer</b> <b>function</b> model building {{is important because it}} is only when the dynamic characteristics of a system are understood that intelligent direction, manipulation, and control of the system is possible. Engineering methods for estimating <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are usually based on the choice of special inputs to the system such as step and sine wave inputs and “pulse ” inputs.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} model {{predictive control}} (MPC) using a non-minimal state-space (NMSS) form, {{in which the}} state vector consists only of the directly measured system variables. Two control structures emerge from the analysis, namely the conventional feedback form and an alternative forward path structure. There is a close analogy with proportional-integral-plus (PIP) control system design, which is also based on the definition of an NMSS model with two control structures. However, the MPC/NMSS approach has the advantage of handling system constraints at the design stage. Also, since the NMSS model is obtained directly from the <b>identified</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> model, the covariance matrix for the parameter estimates can be used to evaluate the robustness of the predictive control system to model uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulation. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by means of simulation examples, including the IFAC’ 93 benchmark and the ALSTOM non-linear gasifier problem. For the simulation examples considered here, the forward path form preserves the good performance properties of the original MPC/NMSS controller, {{while at the same time}} yielding improved robustness...|$|E

Premature convergence to local minima, {{as a result}} of search space boundary constraints, is a key consideration in the application of SGAs. The new method improves the convergence to global optima by resizing or extending the upper and lower search boundaries. The resizing of the search space boundaries involves two processes, first, an identification of initial value by approximating the dynamic response period and desired settling time.

A hardware-in-the loop test facility developed for continuously variable transmissions is utilized in this paper. The test facility includes two induction motors to emulating engine and vehicle characteristics. Software models of engine and vehicle, running in real-time, provide reference torque and speed signals for the motors, which are connected to a transmission that is the hardware in the loop. Speed control of the output motor that emulates the vehicle dynamics is used to demonstrate an application of the proposed technique. A feedforward compensator, based on the transfer function inversion, is used {{to compensate for the}} nonminimum phase motor and drive system dynamics. The vehicle model can not be run ahead of time to provide the future values required by the noncausal inversion technique that requires the current torque at the output of the transmission, therefore, the feedforward controller has to be applied causally. A frequency domain estimation technique and a multi-frequency test signal are utilized to estimate, within the frequency range of interest, a low relative order transfer function of the closed loop system incorporating a manually added delay in the feedback loop.

The model was identified with collected data from an energy efficient solar single-family residential building, the Ecoterra™ house located in Eastman, Quebec. The TABS is a ventilated concrete slab (VCS) serving as an energy storage medium for active and passive solar gains in the basement. The system uses the structural mass {{of the house to}} store active solar gains collected by the building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) roof and passive solar gains entering the living space through the energy efficient windows. A data-driven system identification approach is used. Identifying a linear model and obtaining a low-order polynomial model were the main identification criteria. The thesis addresses the issues of the monitoring sensor accuracy on the model parameters, how physical knowledge of the VCS dynamic system can be considered during its validation and how the identification assumptions guide the future use of the model. This thesis also demonstrates that the identified linear polynomial model is an efficient tool to carry out redesign studies and possible control studies.

40|$|Dynamic {{characteristics}} of airframe structures {{are expected to}} vary as aircraft flight conditions change. Accurate knowledge of the changing dynamic characteristics is crucial to enhancing {{the performance of the}} active noise control system using feedback control. This research investigates the development of an adaptive, on-line state estimator using a neural network concept to conduct active noise control. In this research, an algorithm has been developed {{that can be used to}} estimate displacement and velocity responses at any locations on the structure from a limited number of acceleration measurements and input force information. The algorithm employs band-pass filters to extract from the measurement signal the frequency contents corresponding to a desired mode. The filtered signal is then used to train a neural network which consists of a linear neuron with three weights. The structure of the neural network is designed as simple as possible to increase the sampling frequency as much as possible. The weights obtained through neural network training are then used to construct the transfer function of a mode in z-domain and to identify modal properties of each mode. By using the <b>identified</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> and interpolating the mode shape obtained at sensor locations, the displacement and velocity responses are estimated with reasonable accuracy at any locations on the structure. The accuracy of the response estimates depends on the number of modes incorporated in the estimates and the number of sensors employed to conduct mode shape interpolation. Computer simulation demonstrates that the algorithm is capable of adapting to the varying dynamic {{characteristics of}} structural properties. Experimental implementation of the algorithm on a DSP (digital signal processing) board for a plate structure is underway. The algorithm is expected to reach the sampling frequency range of about 10 kHz to 20 kHz which needs to be maintained for a typical active noise control application...|$|E
40|$|Non-uniform {{sampling}} comes natural in many applications, due to {{for example}} imperfect sensors, mismatched clocks or event-triggered phenomena. Examples {{can be found}} in automotive industry and data communication as well as medicine and astronomy. Yet, the literature on statistical signal processing to a large extent focuses on algorithms and analysis for uniformly, or regularly, sampled data. This work focuses on Fourier analysis, system identification and decimation of non-uniformly sampled data. In non-uniform sampling (NUS), signal amplitude and time stamps are delivered in pairs. Several methods to compute an approximate Fourier transform (AFT) have appeared in literature, and their posterior properties in terms of alias suppression and leakage have been addressed. In this thesis, the sampling times are assumed to be generated by a stochastic process, and the main idea is to use information about the stochastic sampling process to calculate a priori properties of approximate frequency transforms. These results are also used to give insight in frequency domain system identification and help with analysis of down-sampling algorithms. The main result gives the prior distribution of several AFTs expressed in terms of the true Fourier transform and variants of the characteristic function of the sampling time distribution. The result extends leakage and alias suppression with bias and variance terms due to NUS. Based on this, decimation of non-uniformly sampled signals, using continuous-time anti-alias filters, is analyzed. The decimation is based on interpolation in different domains, and interpolation in the convolution integral proves particularly useful. The same idea is also used to investigate how stochastic unmeasurable sampling jitter noise affects the result of system identification. The result is a modification of known approaches to mitigate the bias and variance increase caused by the sampling jitter noise. The bottom line is that, when non-uniform sampling is present, the approximate frequency transform, <b>identified</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> and anti-alias filter are all biased to what is expected from classical theory on uniform sampling. This work gives tools to analyze and correct for this bias...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the Tapping Mode-Atomic Force Microscope (TM-AFM) {{has become one of}} the most {{important}} tools for imaging on the nanometer scale. In comparison with other contemporary technologies, the AFMs have been able to obtain atomic resolution both in high vacuum and liquid environments thus affirming their supremacy. The AFM can be perceived as a combination of a mechanical profilometer, where mechanical springs are used to sense the forces, and a Scanning tunneling microscope, where piezo-electric transducers are used for scanning. The AFM is widely used to generate a topographical image of the sample surface and also to study certain characteristics of the sample. The latter is aided by measuring the forces between the sample surface and the tip of the probe. The non-linear, rapidly changing and hysteretic behavior of the tip-sample forces makes their accurate estimation extremely difficult in dynamic AFM. Moreover, the cantilever probe responds to an average of the different forces acting on the probe tip. Since several permutations of different forces can give the same periodic average, the accurate estimation of each of these forces has been evidently impossible. However, some probes exist for which the motion of the cantilever consists of super harmonic components of the tip-sample forces which provide more information about the tip-sample forces. Nevertheless the construction of these cantilevers is challenging and time consuming. Knowledge of the dynamic properties of the cantilever facilitates one to study its behaviour to a particular input. Since different forces act at different tip sample distances, a more mathematical approach towards tip-sample force estimation which includes the dynamic characteristics of the cantilever is necessary. The accurate knowledge of the cantilever dynamics is extremely important for precise estimation of tip-sample forces, deduction of mechanical properties, controller synthesis etc. Therefore in this research, the techniques to identify the state space matrices is explored. One, rather old but an immensely useful identification method are the black box identification techniques. These techniques can be used to accurately estimate the fully parameterized state space matrices of the system. The main difficulty arises in estimating these parameters specially in the absence of one of the inputs (tip-sample interactions). In this thesis research, an algorithm is developed to identify the fully parameterized state space matrices. A secondary cantilever of very high fundamental resonance frequency is used as a force sensor. This force sensor set up along with the periodic property of the tip-sample forces during TM-AFM is used to reconstruct the tip-sample interaction forces. Using the estimated tip-sample forces, a transfer function between the cantilever deflection and the estimated force is identified using a curve fitting technique. The curve fitting technique uses iterative least squares to reduce the two norm between the experimental frequency response and the frequency response estimated using the <b>identified</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function.</b> Systems and Contro...|$|E

40|$|The lagged {{responses}} of tree-ring indices to annual climatic or hydrologic series are {{examined in this}} study. The objectives are to develop methods to analyze the lagged {{responses of}} individual tree-ring indices, and to improve upon conventional methods of adjusting for the lag in response in regression models to reconstruct annual climatic or hydrologic series. The proposed methods are described and applied to test data from Oregon and Southern California. Transfer-function modeling is used to estimate the dependence of the current ring on past years' climate and to select negative lags for reconstruction models. A linear system is assumed; the input is an annual climatic variable, and the output is a tree-ring index. The estimated impulse response function weights the importance of past and current years' climate on the current year's ring. The <b>identified</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> model indicates how many past years' rings are necessary {{to account for the}} effects of past years' climate. Autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) modeling is used to screen out climatically insensitive tree-ring indices, and to estimate the lag in response to climate unmasked from the effects of autocorrelation in the tree-ring and climatic series. The climatic and tree-ring series are each prewhitened by ARMA models, and crosscorrelation between the ARMA residuals are estimated. The absence of significant crosscorrelations Implies low sensitivity. Significant crosscorrelations at lags other than zero indicate lag in response. This analysis can also aid in selecting positive lags for reconstruction models. An alternative reconstruction method that makes use of the ARMA residuals is also proposed. The basic concept is that random (uncorrelated in time) shocks of climate induce annual random shocks of tree growth, with autocorrelation in the tree-ring index resulting from inertia in the system. The steps in the method are (1) fit ARMA models to the tree-ring index and the climatic variable, (2) regress the ARMA residuals of the climatic variable on the ARMA residuals of the treering index, (3) substitute the long-term prewhitened tree-ring index into the regression equation to reconstruct the prewhitened climatic variable, and (4) build autocorrelation back into the reconstruction with the ARMA model originally fit to the climatic variable. The trial applications on test data from Oregon and Southern California showed that the lagged response of tree rings to climate varies greatly from site to site. Sensitive tree-ring series commonly depend significantly only on one past year's climate (regional rainfall index). Other series depend on three or more past years' climate. Comparison of reconstructions by conventional lagging of predictors with reconstructions by the random-shock method indicate that while the lagged models may reconstruct the amplitude of severe, long-lasting droughts better than the random-shock model, the random-shock model generally has a flatter frequency response. The random-shock model may therefore be more appropriate where the persistence structure is of prime interest. For the most sensitive series with small lag in response, the choice of reconstruction method makes little difference in properties of the reconstruction. The greatest divergence is for series whose impulse response weights from the transfer function analysis do not die off rapidly with time...|$|E

The estimates are calculated by applying a quadratic penalty to the curvature of the <b>transfer</b> <b>functions.</b> The identification scheme has been implemented in MATLAB, and partly coded in C programming language for maximum computational efficiency. This system ID method has been validated with analytical results for a few well-known LTP systems. The validation results show excellent agreement between the <b>identified</b> and analytical <b>transfer</b> <b>functions.</b> by Afreen Siddiqi. Thesis (S. M.)

This method {{is based on the}} Refined Instrumental Variable (RIV) algorithm which, because of an appropriate choice of particular design variables, achieves minimum variance estimation of the model parameters. The Box-Jenkins model is the most natural since it does not constrain the process and the noise models to have common polynomials. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by Monte Carlo analysis in comparison with other alternative closed loop estimation methods...|$|R
30|$|The maximum {{allowable}} value of τ in the <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> (Eq.  1) was 100 breaths, yet six subjects had optimized values at this maximum (Table  1). Values greater than 100 breaths were also tested {{to ensure the}} resultant correlations were maximized. No subjects displayed appreciable gains in correlation (no difference in r values to the four significant digits reported) with values of τ above 100 breaths. The {{aim of this study}} was not to <b>identify</b> specific <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> constants, but to show a significant relationship between metabolic power estimated from gas exchange and EMG. This was accomplished within the constraints imposed on the constants.|$|R
