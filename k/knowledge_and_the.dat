5|$|Matangi {{is one of}} the Mahavidyas, ten Tantric goddesses and {{a ferocious}} aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. She is {{considered}} to be the Tantric form of Sarasvati, the goddess of music and learning. Like Sarasvati, Matangi governs speech, music, <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arts. Her worship is prescribed to acquire supernatural powers, especially gaining control over enemies, attracting people to oneself, acquiring mastery over the arts and gaining supreme knowledge.|$|E
5|$|In the Hindu religion, {{there has}} been partial success in terms of gender {{equality}} reform laws and family law. While {{this is a major}} advancement relative to other religions in India, it is still not a complete triumph in terms of feminism and relieving oppression. Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are not exclusively male. Hinduism sheds a positive light on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete their male counterparts. It {{is important to note that}} both the deity of <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> deity of wealth are female.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Thunberg also profited from his teachings himself.

Yet, he likewise brought back knowledge on Japan's religion and societal structure, thus boosting an increasing interest into Japan, an early cultural form of Japonism.|$|E

Other philosophers (e.g. Wittgenstein, Quine, Searle, Foucault) argue that categorization and conceptualization is subjective and arbitrary.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> behaviours on foot self-care {{in patients}} with type 2 diabetes mellitus; analyse <b>the</b> influential factors, <b>and</b> provide information for the intervention study. Methods: A total of 5961 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from 144 hospitals in China {{were included in the}} study. The investigation content included patients' demographic data, foot self-care <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> behaviours. <b>The</b> investigation tools were the questionnaires on the general diabetes information, on <b>the</b> foot self-care <b>knowledge,</b> <b>and</b> on <b>the</b> foot self-care behaviours. Results: The foot self-care <b>knowledge</b> was medium <b>and</b> <b>the</b> foot self-care behaviour was poor. <b>The</b> status of <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> behaviours were influenced by education, duration of diabetes mellitus, periodic inspection, and education about diabetic complications. Pearson analysis demonstrated that there was positive correlation between <b>knowledge</b> score <b>and</b> behaviour score (r =  0. 27, p <  0. 001). Conclusions: The status of foot self-care <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> behaviours are not optimistic. According to the patients' own characteristics, the theory of <b>knowledge,</b> attitude <b>and</b> practice applies to encouraging patients to go for periodic inspection and education about diabetic complications so as to enhance <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> promote <b>the</b> self-care behaviours...|$|R

These determinants appear to influence performance largely through the acquisition and usage of job <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> motivation to do well.
