The first pillar is the state pension, {{administered}} by the government, and funded by National Insurance contributions. The third pillar is private, or [...] "personal pensions", which individuals buy themselves. The second pillar, and deriving from the contract of employment, is occupational pensions. Traditionally, these came from a collective agreement, or from an employer setting one up. The Pensions Act 2008 gives every [...] "jobholder" [...] (defined as a worker, age 16 to 75, with wages between £5,035 and £33,540) {{the right to be}} automatically enrolled by the employer in an occupational pension, unless the <b>jobholder</b> chooses to opt out. This is a simple [...] "defined contribution" [...] scheme: whatever the <b>jobholder</b> contributes, they get out. Although collectively invested, benefits are individualised, meaning the risk of living longer and running out of money grows. To reduce administration costs, a non-departmental trust fund called the National Employment Savings Trust was established as a [...] "public option" [...] competing with private asset managers. Employers set aside an agreed percentage of jobholders' wages, and negotiate how much they will contribute. This is particularly important for people who do not created a union and collective bargained for an occupational pension. Collectively bargained pensions are often better, and historically had [...] "defined benefits": on retirement, people receive money based either on their final salary, or a career average of earnings {{for the rest of their}} lives. Living longer does not become an individual risk, but is collectivised among all contributors. In principle, the rules for pension trusts differ from ordinary law of trusts as pensions are not gifts and people pay for their benefits through their work. Pensions operating through contracts also engender mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship. An employer is under a duty to inform their staff about how to make the best of their pension rights. Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements. The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the pension beneficiaries, so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or [...] "member nominated trustees". The Secretary of State has the power by regulation, as yet unused, to increase the minimum up to one half. Trustees are charged with the duty to manage the fund in the best interests of the beneficiaries, in a way that reflects their preferences, by investing the savings in company shares, bonds, real estate or other financial products.|$|E

To {{gain a better understanding}} of this phenomenon, we systematically varied the gender connotation of occupations (males overrepresented, females overrepresented, equal share of males and females) and measured additional dependent variables, predicting that gender fair language would reduce the impact of the gender connotation on participants' perceptions.

However, no effect of language form on the ascription of competence was found.

40|$|If <b>jobholders</b> {{are more}} {{motivated}} to help jobseekers {{to whom they}} are strongly tied rather than those to whom they are weakly tied, why do <b>jobholders</b> so often help acquaintances and strangers instead of kin and friends? The strength-of-weak-ties theory holds that weak ties {{are more likely to}} be conduits for information and influence that best leads to jobs. Recent research, however, calls into question the theory’s key assumption that this is because strongties cannot act as bridges (they can). Drawing from in-depth interviews with 146 blue- and white-collar workers at a large public sector employer, in this paper I offer an alternative explanation for why weak ties matter, one rooted in cognitive and affective processes: <b>Jobholders</b> often know too much about their close associates’ flaws and so assess the risks of making a bad match as high.

40|$|Purpose - Do similar job titles {{refer to}} the same work activities, as assumed often, but hardly empirically tested? The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the {{similarity}} of 160 occupations within and across eight European countries using interrater agreement statistics (rWG). Design/methodology/approach - Using a multilingual web survey, experts and <b>jobholders</b> in the eight countries rated the frequency of ten tasks per occupation they had knowledge of (n= 4, 197 ratings). Three hypotheses are investigated: first, interrater agreements of occupations are similar regardless the country; second, interrater agreements of occupations are similar within countries; and third, experts and <b>jobholders</b> are similar in their ratings. Findings - Half of the occupations reveal no agreement across ratings, one-third shows a weak/moderate agreement and one in ten shows a strong agreement. H 1 is rejected for task frequency but not for task importance. Within-country similarity of occupations is larger than across-country similarity. H 2 is supported for two countries and rejected for two other countries. H 3 is not supported. <b>Jobholders</b> demonstrate higher agreement than experts. Research limitations/implications - An empirical testing of occupation-specific tasks for a wide range of occupations across Europe seems a viable approach. Practical implications - The paper contributes to the challenges related to labor market mobility across borders. Originality/value - Work tasks for a wide range of occupations and countries, using job-specific work activities in combination with web surveys and the internet for recruitment of <b>jobholders,</b> have not been used before...|$|R
5000|$|Lone Star Planet (1958, {{originally}} A Planet for Texans) with John J. McGuire [...] The {{work is a}} {{clear and}} obvious tribute to H.L. Mencken's classic essay [...] "The Malevolent Jobholder" [...] (from The American Mercury, June 1924), in which Mencken proposed [...] "...that it shall be no longer malum in se for a citizen to pummel, cowhide, kick, gouge, cut, wound, bruise, maim, burn, club, bastinado, flay, or even lynch a government <b>jobholder,</b> and that it shall be malum prohibitum {{only to the extent}} that the punishment exceeds the jobholder’s deserts. The amount of this excess, if any, may be determined very conveniently by a petit jury, as other questions of guilt are now determined." [...] In 1999, the novel won the Prometheus Award, Hall of Fame Award for Best Classic Libertarian SF Novel. This tongue-in-cheek tale features a planet of Texans whose dinosaur-sized cattle have to be herded with tanks, and whose system of government derives its character from Mencken's essay. The protagonist is an insubordinate junior diplomat who is appointed as ambassador to this cantankerously independent planet in the hope that he will be assassinated (as the previous ambassador had been), thereby justifying the forcible invasion and conquest of the Texans. The crux of the story is the trial of the previous ambassador's assassins—actually paid killers hired by an alien empire also planning invasion—under a legal system that considers the killing of a practicing politician to be justifiable homicide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{taxonomy}} of under-specified service skills {{is one of}} several tools developed as part of the New Zealand Pay and Employment Equity Plan of Action – a five-year, three-phase Plan designed to make gender equity ‘ordinary’. As skill under-recognition is a source of pay and career path inequity, one of the Plan’s projects has been to develop a universally- applicable framework for naming and classifying ‘hidden ’ skills. A new research-based taxonomy allows the specification of eleven key skills of awareness-shaping, relationship-shaping and coordination, at varying degrees of granularity and at five learning-based proficiency levels. Focused on activity-based work processes, the taxonomy supplements existing approaches to identifying job demands and <b>jobholder</b> capabilities. We illustrate its potential for equitable skill analysis in jobs ranging from low-paid to policy-level, and make a business case for using it to pinpoint sources of quality in the new education and health occupations emerging in response to population diversity.

40|$|Background: The private {{medical care}} sector is {{expanding}} in urban cities in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, people’s health-care-seeking behaviors {{in this new}} landscape remain poorly understood; furthermore, distinguishing {{between public and private}} providers and among various types of private providers is critical in this investigation. This study assessed, by type, the healthcare providers urban residents in Burkina Faso visit, and their choice determinants. Method: We conducted a population-based survey of a representative sample of 1, 600 households in Ouagadougou from July to November 2011, consisting of 5, 820 adults. We assessed the types of providers people typically sought for severe and non-severe conditions. We applied generalized estimating equations in this study. Results: Among those surveyed, 97. 7 % and 53. 1 % indicated that they seek a formal provider for treating severe and non-severe conditions, respectively. Among the formal provider seekers, 20. 5 % and 17. 0 % chose for-profit (FP) providers for treating severe and non-severe conditions, respectively. Insurance coverage was held by 2. 0 % of those surveyed. Possessing insurance was the strongest predictor for seeking FP, for both severe (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 15, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 04 – 1. 28), and non-severe conditions (OR = 1. 22, 95 % CI = 1. 07 – 1. 39).
