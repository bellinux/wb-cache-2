5|$|The Clausius–Clapeyron {{relation}} {{leads to}} another equation also attributed to Kelvin, as the Kelvin equation. It explains why, because of surface tension, the vapor pressure for small droplets of liquid in suspension <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> than standard vapor pressure {{of that same}} liquid when the interface is flat. That {{is to say that}} when a liquid is forming small droplets, the equilibrium concentration of its vapor in its surroundings <b>is</b> <b>greater.</b> This arises because the pressure inside the droplet <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> than outside.|$|E

50|$|It is {{impossible}} {{that the same}} thing should be necessitated by the being and the not-being of the same thing. I mean, for example, that it {{is impossible}} that B should necessarily <b>be</b> <b>great</b> if A <b>is</b> white, and that B should necessarily <b>be</b> <b>great</b> if A <b>is</b> not white. For if B <b>is</b> not <b>great</b> A cannot <b>be</b> white. But if, when A is not white, it is necessary that B should <b>be</b> <b>great,</b> it necessarily results that if B <b>is</b> not <b>great,</b> B itself <b>is</b> <b>great.</b> But this <b>is</b> impossible.

5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} can never be more than five times the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> than or equal to F'N+1 which in turn <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> than or equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{kinematics}} and muscle activity between chin-ups and lat-pull down exercises and between muscle groups during the two exercises. Normalized electromyography (EMG) of biceps brachii (BB), triceps brachii (TB), pectoralis major (PM), latissimus dorsi (LD), rectus abdominus (RA), and erector spinae (ES) and kinematics of back, shoulder, and seventh cervical vertebrae (C 7) was analysed during chin-ups and lat-pull down exercises. Normalized EMG of BB and ES and kinematics of shoulder and C 7 for chin-ups <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than lat-pull down exercises during the concentric phase (p < 0. 05). For the eccentric phase, RA during lat-pull down exercises <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> than chin-ups and the kinematics of C 7 during chin-ups <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> than lat-pull down exercises (p < 0. 05). For chin-ups, BB, LD, and ES <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than PM during the concentric phase, whereas BB and LD <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than TB, and LD <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> than RA during the eccentric phase (p < 0. 05). For lat-pull down exercise, BB and LD <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than PM, TB, and ES during the concentric phase, whereas LD <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> than PM, TB, and BB during the eccentric phase (p < 0. 05).
