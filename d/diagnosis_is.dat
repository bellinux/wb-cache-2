5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> usually {{confirmed}} by a surgical pathologist, {{taking into account}} the clinical presentation, microscopic findings, and other laboratory tests. It may arise from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{people were}} not diagnosed with epilepsy during their lifetime. A retrospective <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> speculative and, as detailed below, can be wrong.|$|E
30|$|Patients used a non-admission {{bed at the}} {{outpatient}} surgery unit and were discharged after a few hours. The patients whose final <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> an endometrial polyp needed no additional procedure in the follow-up interval. When the final <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> a hyperplasia with atypia, a hysterectomy was performed, however if the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> endometrial cancer, the gynecology oncologic commitee in our hospital selected the final treatment. In all cases of endometrial cancer, hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy were performed.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} case of {{thoracic}} aortic dissection in a 33 -year-old woman. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> difficult, and the right <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made 4 months after the initial clinical manifestation. Aortic dissection was caused by necrosis of the media combined with longstanding arterial hypertension. Surgical intervention was performed timely and was effective. </p...|$|R
40|$|A 55 -year-old male was {{referred}} to our hospital with the chief complaint of painless right scrotal swelling. Serum tumor marker levels were all within the normal range. A right radical orchiectomy was performed and the histopathological <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> plasmacytoma. Chest and abdominal computed tomographic scan and bone scintigraphy did not show metastasis. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis and bone marrow biopsy <b>were</b> negative. <b>Diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> primary testicular plasmacytoma (extramedullary plasmacytoma). Eleven months after the operation, multiple bone lesions appeared and our <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> conversion to multiple myeloma...|$|R
5|$|A biopsy by fine needle aspiration, often {{guided by}} {{endoscopic}} ultrasound, {{may be used}} where there is uncertainty over the diagnosis, but a histologic <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> not usually required for removal of the tumor by surgery to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reports of}} {{poisoning}} in humans are rare, ingestion of ferric chloride {{can result in}} serious morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis. Early <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> important, especially in seriously poisoned patients.|$|E
40|$|In a {{prospective}} study of 98 consecutive patients with undiagnosed ascites examined by laparoscopy a correct immediate <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made in 76 (78 %) {{and a final}} diagnosis in 92 (94 %) of those who underwent laparoscopy. Visual <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> highly accurate in patients with tuberculous peritonitis but only moderately accurate in those with carcinomatosis and liver disease. When the laparoscopic findings were compared with histological and microbiological results visual <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> {{found to be the}} most accurate diagnostic method. Laparoscopy may readily be used in rural hospitals for diagnosing ascites...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} renal angiomyolipoma without {{tuberous}} sclerosis are reported. The first case {{was of a}} 35 -year-old man with complaints of right upper abdominal and right flank pain. Preoperative <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> right renal angiomyolipoma. Thoracoabdominal radical nephrectomy and lymphadenectomy were performed. The pathological <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> renal angiomyolipoma with lymph node involvement. The second case was of a 46 -year-old woman whose left renal mass had been accidentally found by ultrasound study. Preoperative <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> left renal angiomyolipoma. This tumor was enucleated from the left kidney through flank incision...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} report of a {{postoperative}} left ventricular-right atrial (LV-RA) communication after aortic valve replacement. Such intracardiac defects are rare but encountered occasionally after valve surgery. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made by use of transesophageal echocardiography with echo-Doppler and color-flow imaging. Complications of LV-RA shunts and differential <b>diagnosis</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R
5|$|Asthma {{is thought}} to be caused by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. <b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} a person's {{symptoms}} and history of medication use. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, and meningitis should be ruled out. No laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|Histiocytosis X of {{the lung}} is {{associated}} with bone lesions in 4 to 20 %.

40|$|Background: Medical {{errors in}} the {{emergency}} department (ED) are common, and proportion of preventable adverse events is among the highest for all areas of medical care. Some {{of the most common}} types of medical mistakes in ED include misdiagnosis, medication errors, surgery errors, nosocomial infections, laboratory test errors, and administrative errors. The present work aims to assess rate and identify contributing factors to miss and missed diagnoses at the ED of King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU) in Khobar, KSA. Methods: It is a retrospective cohort study. Target population was medical records and database of inpatients admitted from the ED to the study hospital during the year 2007 and the study sample amounted to 441 cases. Accuracy of the diagnosis {{in the present study was}} assessed by comparing the degree of matching between ED diagnosis and the final discharge diagnosis using (ICD- 9 -CM) diagnostic codes. Accuracy of <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> divided into four main categories: fully matched, partially matched, unmatched and symptoms & unspecific. However, missed <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> defined as cases where the ED <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> not documented in the ED sheet. Results: Missed diagnosis represented (8. 4 %), fully/partially matched <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> 62. 3 %, unmatched <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> 10. 7 % and symptoms & unspecific <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> (18. 6 %). Consultants experienced high percentage of fully/partially matche...|$|R

5|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{suspected}} {{based on}} lesion circumstances and clinical evidence, most prominently a neurological examination, for example checking whether the pupils constrict normally {{in response to}} light and assigning a Glasgow Coma Score. Neuroimaging helps in determining the diagnosis and prognosis and in deciding what treatments to give.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
5|$|Envenomation from a redback spider bite {{produces}} a syndrome known as latrodectism. A {{small but significant}} percentage of people bitten develop significant pain or systemic symptoms. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> made from the clinical condition, often based on the victim being aware of a bite and ideally with identification of the spider. Laboratory tests are rarely needed {{and there is no}} specific test for the venom or latrodectism.|$|E
30|$|In {{our case}} of medial clavicular fracture, {{arriving}} at the correct <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> challenging, {{partly due to the}} low incidence and partly because the <b>diagnosis</b> can <b>be</b> confused with sternoclavicular dislocation.|$|R
40|$|Hypertrophic pyloric {{stenosis}} {{is brought}} to attention by its characteristic non-bilious vomiting. In a patient with pure esophageal atresia and a feeding gastrostomy, the symptoms were modified and the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> delayed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Committee for Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) of the Japan Society for Oriental Medicine started {{compiling}} Evidence Reports of Kampo Treatment (EKAT) in 2007. EKAT is {{a compilation}} of structured abstracts of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), along with comments by a third party reviewer. As of 31 December, 2012, there were 378 RCTs of Kampo medicines in Japan. The primary research question {{of this study is}} "How frequently <b>is</b> Kampo <b>diagnosis</b> used in RCTs of Kampo medicines?" The secondary research question is "When <b>is</b> Kampo <b>diagnosis</b> used in RCTs?" MATERIALS AND METHODS: The structured abstract (SA) of each RCT article was reviewed to examine how Kampo <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> used in RCTs, especially how Kampo <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> used in the randomization process. RESULTS: Kampo <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> used before randomization in 27 RCTs (7. 1 %), after randomization in 31 RCTs (8. 2 %), and not used in 320 RCTs (84. 7 %). Before randomization, Kampo <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> used as a criterion for inclusion in 10 RCTs, criterion for exclusion in 9 RCTs, and criteria for both inclusion and exclusion in 2 RCTs. Kampo formulas were determined according to Kampo diagnosis in 7 RCTs. After randomization, subgroup analyses according to Kampo <b>diagnosis</b> <b>were</b> done in 27 RCTs, and grade of disease severity at Kampo <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> used for analysis as an endpoint in 4 RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: Kampo <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> used before randomization only in approximately 15 % of RCTs, and the number of RCT articles using Kampo <b>diagnosis</b> after randomization <b>was</b> almost the same as that before randomization. Further studies to determine the good RCTs conforming to CONSORT requirements and good systematic reviews conforming to PRISMA requirements are needed to clarify the significance of Kampo diagnosis...|$|R
5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} cause is viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common. Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected. Testing to confirm the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> typically not needed.|$|E
5|$|Gout may be {{diagnosed}} and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic acute arthritis {{of the base}} of the great toe (known as podagra). Synovial fluid analysis should be done, however, if the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> in doubt. X-rays, while useful for identifying chronic gout, have little utility in acute attacks.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E
30|$|In {{our patient}} the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made at laparoscopy, however on {{reviewing}} the scans the <b>diagnosis</b> could have <b>been</b> made earlier and possible problems anticipated.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the clinical manifestations at diagnosis and during follow-up {{in patients with}} 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome to better define {{the natural history of}} the disease. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective and prospective multicenter study was conducted with 228 patients {{in the context of the}} Italian Network for Primary Immunodeficiencies. Clinical <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed by cytogenetic or molecular analysis. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 112 males and 116 females; median age at <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> 4 months (range 0 to 36 years 10 months). The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made before 2 years of age in 71...|$|R

5|$|In adults, the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{supported}} {{by the absence of}} classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn.|$|E
5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{suspected}} of having DVT may be assessed using a clinical prediction rule such as the Wells score. A D-dimer test may {{also be used to}} assist with excluding the diagnosis (because of its high sensitivity) or to signal a need for further testing. <b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> most commonly done with ultrasound of the suspected veins.|$|E
40|$|Pyloric {{duplication}} is {{the rarest}} duplication in gastrointestinal tract. Only seven {{cases have been}} reported {{so far in the}} English literature. In most cases pre-operative <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> not made. We present such a case in a 9 -day-old baby, presenting with non-bilious vomiting since birth. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made pre-operatively by ultrasonography, which is a good investigation for pre-operative <b>diagnosis.</b> The case <b>was</b> operated successfully without opening the pyloric canal...|$|R
30|$|Discussion: The 22 x 22 mms resected ovary {{contained}} an intact 5 x 7 mms cystic tumor. The pathological <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> mature cystic teratoma with component of brain tissue.
