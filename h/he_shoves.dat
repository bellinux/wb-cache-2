500|$|As Scully {{calls for}} a {{forensic}} team to come out there immediately, she hears something in the house. She goes for her gun in the dresser drawer, but finds it missing. As the creature comes up the stairs, a bloodied Big Mike grabs Scully and tells her to get out, that [...] "it's coming" [...] for her. <b>He</b> <b>shoves</b> Scully in the closet, and fights with the creature. Meanwhile, Mulder confronts Gogolak about marking the Klines for death by giving them the tacky windmill. Mulder says the creature is a Tulpa, a Tibetan thoughtform, that Gogolak conjured to assure compliance with the HOA rules. Mulder arrests him, handcuffs him to a mailbox, and goes to find Scully. Cuffed to the mailbox, Gogolak begs for help, knowing the creature is coming. The creature attacks Gogolak and, as he dies, it disintegrates into dirt. Scully comes outside too late to see the creature, the remnants of which are at Mulder's feet.|$|E
500|$|William Wellman's The Public Enemy (1931), {{released}} by Warner Brothers, features another career-defining performance, this time James Cagney as Tom Powers. The film {{is similar to}} the template set in Little Caesar in that it follows Powers from his rise to his eventual fall in the world of crime. The film was partially based on the real life of Chicago gangster Dion O'Banion. Cagney's character is contrasted with his puritanical brother who wants him to go straight; their mother {{is at the center of}} the conflict. Tom Powers is egotistical, amoral, heartless, ruthless, and extremely violent. The best-remembered scene in the picture is referred to as the [...] "grapefruit scene": when Cagney's girlfriend (Mae Clarke) angers him during breakfast, <b>he</b> <b>shoves</b> half a grapefruit in her face. Instead of scenes from the film, its trailer contained a voiceover warning of the picture's intensity and showed a gun being fired directly at the camera.|$|E
2500|$|Johnny Cage parodies the [...] "here's Johnny" [...] {{scene as}} part of his {{fatality}} in Mortal Kombat X where <b>he</b> <b>shoves</b> his hands behind the opponent in which he then says the line by peeping his face through the opened torso.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shoved</b> {{the tiller}} hard {{over and the}} boat, {{swerving}} sharply, vanished from the coast.|$|R
60|$|And {{with a stick}} <b>he</b> <b>shoved</b> {{the flaming}} brush closer in around the scout's legs.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shoved</b> out his case. Old man Craye helped {{himself in}} a sort of dazed way.|$|R
2500|$|Leporello tells Don Giovanni that he (Giovanni) {{is leading}} a rotten life; Don Giovanni reacts angrily. They hear a woman (Donna Elvira) singing of having been {{abandoned}} by her lover, on whom she is seeking revenge ("" [...] â€“ [...] "Ah, who could ever tell me"). Don Giovanni starts to flirt with her, {{but it turns out}} he is the former lover she is seeking. The two recognize each other and she reproaches him bitterly. <b>He</b> <b>shoves</b> Leporello forward, ordering him to tell Donna Elvira the truth about him, and then hurries away.|$|E
60|$|The thing, you see, is that Jeeves is so dashed competent. You {{can spot}} it {{even in the}} way <b>he</b> <b>shoves</b> studs into a shirt.|$|E
60|$|With that <b>he</b> <b>shoves</b> his segar in {{his mouth}} and moves across the street, {{stepping}} fast. But Tobin sticks close to one side of him and me at the other.|$|E
60|$|With that <b>he</b> <b>shoved</b> {{the canoe}} {{off into the}} stream, and {{paddling}} was resumed with redoubled vigour.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>shoved</b> the {{motionless}} form {{under the}} piece of furniture and covered it with the loose bagging.|$|R
60|$|He {{opened the}} blinds. The window itself was locked, but {{bringing}} out his pocketknife <b>he</b> <b>shoved</b> back the catch.|$|R
60|$|CENTURION (scandalised) Silence! Have {{some sense}} of your situation. Is this the way for martyrs to behave? (To Spintho, who is quaking and loitering) I know what YOU'LL be at that dinner. You'll be the emetic. (<b>He</b> <b>shoves</b> him rudely along).|$|E
60|$|To begin with, {{everybody}} sits sideways {{along the}} middle of the boat, all facing the starboard. They do not attempt to row. One man does all the work with one scull. This scull he puts down through the water till it touches the bed of the ocean, and then <b>he</b> <b>shoves.</b>|$|E
60|$|My {{stipulation}} {{is easily}} defensible. When a mere reader or lecturer has appeared 3 or 4 {{times in a}} town of Hartford's size, {{he is a good}} deal more than likely to get a very unpleasant snub if <b>he</b> <b>shoves</b> himself forward about once or twice more. Therefore I long ago made up my mind that whenever I again appeared here, it should be only in a minor capacity and not as a chief attraction.|$|E
60|$|And he put {{the little}} book between the teeth that held his pipe. Then <b>he</b> <b>shoved</b> off the tie and leaped.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shoved</b> a {{hand into}} the big pocket of his {{mackinaw}} jacket {{and pulled out a}} dingy leather-bound volume of venerable appearance.|$|R
60|$|Cranly still {{frowned at}} the stout student below him. Then, with a snort of disgust, <b>he</b> <b>shoved</b> him violently down the steps.|$|R
6000|$|BELLO: You {{will make}} the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the {{different}} rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all, when they come here {{the night before the}} wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points) For that lot. Trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (<b>He</b> <b>shoves</b> his arm in a bidder's face) Here wet the deck and wipe it round! ...|$|E
6000|$|The player uses a cue {{that is like}} a broom-handle with a quarter-moon of wood {{fastened}} {{to the end of}} it. With this <b>he</b> <b>shoves</b> wooden disks the size of a saucer--he gives the disk a vigorous shove and sends it fifteen or twenty feet along the deck and lands it in one of the squares if he can. If it stays there till the inning is played out, it will count as many points in the game as the figure in the square it has stopped in represents. The adversary plays to knock that disk out and leave his own in its place--particularly if it rests upon the 9 or 10 or some other of the high numbers; but if it rests in the [...] "10off" [...] he backs it up--lands his disk behind it a foot or two, to make it difficult for its owner to knock it out of that damaging place and improve his record. When the inning is played out it may be found that each adversary has placed his four disks where they count; it may be found that some of them are touching chalk lines and not counting; and very often it will be found {{that there has been a}} general wreckage, and that not a disk has been left within the diagram. Anyway, the result is recorded, whatever it is, and the game goes on. The game is 100 points, and it takes from twenty minutes to forty to play it, according to luck and the condition of the sea. It is an exciting game, and the crowd of spectators furnish abundance of applause for fortunate shots and plenty of laughter for the other kind. It is a game of skill, but at the same time the uneasy motion of the ship is constantly interfering with skill; this makes it a chancy game, and the element of luck comes largely in.|$|E

60|$|With {{a violent}} action <b>he</b> <b>shoved</b> {{the little man}} out into the hall. Then turning to Lane he pointed with shaking hand to the door.|$|R

5000|$|The {{president}} of the judo club at Uchihama Academy. His real name is unknown. He is very rough and lacks flexibility.

50|$|Arnout and Victor are {{the sons}} of a very wealthy man and like to make trouble. Arnout is trying to steal an LP album, but gets caught by the store clerk. <b>He</b> <b>shoves</b> the LP album into Simon's hands {{to stay out of}} trouble and it seems to work. Eventually, Simon steals the LP album for the boys. Outside, they {{get to know each other}} better.|$|E

Crowding together on a couch near her bedroom, her lesbian bodyguard duo perform a make out session, but he is uninterested. She insults his manhood and he reacts by groping her.

50|$|During this, Reilly surreptitiously appropriates the commlock. Hoping {{to redeem}} himself by freeing the hostages, he dashes {{back to the}} Eagle. After opening the hatch, <b>he</b> <b>shoves</b> both doctor and patient to safety outside, then confronts the rock with his drawn weapon. In self-defence, the rock immobilises the {{geologist}} with the green ray. It then uses the orange beam, and Reilly crumples {{to the floor in}} cardiac arrest.|$|E
