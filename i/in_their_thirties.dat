5|$|The signatories {{came from}} a variety of social backgrounds. Four had been born to Lithuanian noble families: Donatas Malinauskas, Stanisław Narutowicz, Jonas Smilgevičius, and Mykolas Biržiška. The other 16 were the {{children}} of farmers. The eldest of the signatories was Jonas Basanavičius, who was 67 at the time, and the youngest Kazimieras Bizauskas, who was 25. Of the remainder, three were in their fifties, six were in their forties, eight were <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thirties,</b> and one was in his twenties. All, with the exception of Saliamonas Banaitis, had completed tertiary education. In 1926 he enrolled at Kaunas University, but his studies were left unfinished due to his death in 1933. In terms of educational background, the Council was dominated by eight lawyers. The group also included four priests, two agronomists, two financiers, one physician, one economist, and an engineer. The majority of the signatories had received their higher education outside of Lithuania, since at the time Lithuania had no universities - Vilnius University was closed after the January Uprising in 1863. Five graduated from Saint Petersburg University, four from Moscow University, and two from Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} locations have no discs and {{are therefore}} exempt from the risk of disc herniation: the upper two cervical intervertebral spaces, the sacrum, and the coccyx. Most disc herniations occur {{when a person is}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thirties</b> or forties when the nucleus pulposus is still a gelatin-like substance. With age the nucleus pulposus changes ("dries out") and the risk of herniation is greatly reduced. After age 50 or 60, osteoarthritic degeneration (spondylosis) or spinal stenosis are more likely causes of low back pain or leg pain.|$|E

This generation had been veterans of student protests against authoritarian rule, and advocated a conciliatory approach towards North Korea, even at the expense of good relations with the United States. Roh himself was the first South Korean president to be born after the end of Japanese rule in Korea.|$|E

25|$|Over {{ninety percent}} of English women (and adults, in general) entered {{marriage}} in this era at {{an average age of}} about 25–26 years for the bride and 27–28 years for the groom. Among the nobility and gentry, the average was around 19-21 for brides and 24-26 for grooms. Many city and townswomen married for the first time <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thirties</b> and forties and it was not unusual for orphaned young women to delay marriage until the late twenties or early thirties to help support their younger siblings, and roughly a fourth of all English brides were pregnant at their weddings.|$|E
25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found that men have more positive life events <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thirties</b> and that women have more positive life events in their twenties. This finding suggests that the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E
25|$|From their survey data, Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen {{noted that}} {{the average length of}} {{involvement}} in the Satanic milieu was seven years. A Satanist's involvement in the movement tends to peak in the early twenties and drops off sharply <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thirties.</b> A small proportion retain their allegiance to the religion into their elder years. When asked about their political views, the largest proportion of Satanists identified as apolitical or non-aligned, while only a small percentage identified as conservative despite the conservative views of prominent Satanists like LaVey and Marilyn Manson. A small minority of Satanists expressed support for the far right; conversely, over two-thirds expressed negative or extremely negative views about Nazism and Neo-Nazism.|$|E

25|$|The {{deck and}} command crew (hypēresia) was {{headed by the}} helmsman, the kybernētēs, who was always an {{experienced}} seaman and was often the actual commander of the vessel.

Other officers were the bow lookout (prōreus or prōratēs), the boatswain (keleustēs), the quartermaster (pentēkontarchos), the shipwright (naupēgos), the piper (aulētēs) who gave the rowers' rhythm and two superintendents (toicharchoi), in charge of the rowers {{on each side of the}} ship. What constituted these sailors' experience was a combination of superior rowing skill (physical stamina and/or consistency in hitting with a full stroke) and previous battle experience. The sailors were likely <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thirties</b> and forties. In addition, there were ten sailors handling the masts and the sails.|$|E

Patton, Jr. Patton, had taken most of his staff to the European Theater of Operations (ETOUSA), so Patch replaced them with members of his IV Corps staff. All of the officers Patch had brought {{with him on the}} plane were transferred to Seventh Army, along with the G1, Lieutenant Colonel William H. Craig.

25|$|PGA Tour players {{compete for}} two {{player of the}} year awards. The PGA Player of the Year award dates back to 1948 and is awarded by the PGA of America. Since 1982 the winner has been {{selected}} using a points system with points awarded for wins, money list position and scoring average. The PGA Tour Player of the Year award, also known as the Jack Nicklaus Trophy, is administered by the PGA Tour and was introduced in 1990; the recipient is selected by the tour players by ballot, although the results are not released other than to say who has won. More often than not the same player wins both awards; in fact, as seen in the table below, the PGA and PGA Tour Players of the Year have been the same every year from 1992 through 2016. The Rookie of the Year award was also introduced in 1990. Players are eligible in their first season of PGA Tour membership if they competed in less than seven events from any prior season. Several of the winners had a good deal of international success before their PGA Tour rookie season, and some have been <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thirties</b> when they won the award. In March 2012, a new award, the PGA Tour Courage Award, was introduced in replacement of the defunct Comeback Player of the Year award.|$|E

Field, two {{single women}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thirties,</b> {{expressed}} their frustrations with the Ludys' book in Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Colón, an English professor at Wheaton College; and Field, a former English professor at Wayland Baptist University, criticize Leslie Ludy's {{account of her}} own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that [...] "the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God" [...] and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Colón and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states [...] "the more delay'd, delighted." [...] Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.|$|E
500|$|Digging {{began the}} next day with a trench [...] wide by [...] long, running roughly north-south. A layer of modern {{building}} debris was removed before the level of the former monastery was reached. Two parallel human leg bones were discovered about [...] from {{the north end of the}} trench at a depth of about , indicating an undisturbed burial. The bones were covered temporarily to protect them while excavations continued further along the trench. A second, parallel trench was dug next day to the south-west. Over the following days, evidence of medieval walls and rooms was uncovered, allowing the archaeologists to pinpoint the area of the friary. It became clear that the bones found on the first day lay inside the east part of the church, possibly the choir, where Richard was said to have been buried. On 31 August, the University of Leicester applied for a licence from the Ministry of Justice to permit the exhumation of up to six sets of human remains. To narrow the search, it was planned that only the remains of men <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thirties,</b> buried within the church, would be exhumed.|$|E

Melinda Newman, writing for HitFix {{described it}} as NSFW, highly stylized and a reclaim of the singer's sexuality. Whitney Phanuef of the same website praised the clip as the best on Beyoncé, further highlighting its [...] "unforgettable song/video combination" [...] accompanied with eroticism and Beyoncé's post-child sexuality. Melissa Locker, writing for Time stated that the singer went [...] "properly XXX" [...] for the [...] "hot" [...] clip and added {{that it would make}} viewers think differently about the word [...] "peaches". Edwin Ortiz of Complex felt that during the various wardrobe changes, each outfit was better than the previous. Ashley Lee from The Hollywood Reporter classified the visual as [...] "ornate" [...] and opined that Beyoncé portrayed an aristocrat daydreaming about affection. Similarly, Michael Zelenko of The Fader described her character as an aristocrat [...] "in desperate need of physical attention" [...] and noted similarities with the film True Lies in the strip scene. John Boone from E! Online praised the overall sexiness of the video and the singer's look in various scenes. Hailing the video [...] "steamy", Dan Reilly of Spin noted the variety of revealing outfits worn by Beyoncé and concluded [...] "here's no nudity, but the video certainly comes close". Writing on behalf of Vanity Fair, Michelle Collins stated in her review, [...] "If you're a fan of gorgeously choreographed burlesque routines, as well as women <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thirties</b> who defy the logic of cellulite, 'Partition' is a good starting off point in your journey through Beyoncé's 'Beyoncé.'"
