5|$|Morales {{has been}} praised for {{significantly}} reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia {{and has been}} internationally decorated with various awards. His supporters have lauded him {{as a champion of}} indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism. Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> him of failing to live up to many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> him of being excessively radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of coca contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E

5|$|Corruption is rife at all levels; Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2005 named Chad (tied with Bangladesh) as {{the most}} corrupt country in the world. Chad's ranking on the index has {{improved}} only marginally in recent years. Since its first inclusion on the index in 2004, Chad's best score has been 2/10 for 2011. Critics of President Déby <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> him of cronyism and tribalism.|$|E
50|$|Amnesty International <b>has</b> <b>accused</b> the Mauritania {{legal system}} of {{functioning}} {{with a complete}} disregard of legal procedure, fair trial, or humane imprisonment. Amnesty International also <b>has</b> <b>accused</b> the Mauritanian government of an institutionalized and continuous use of torture for decades.|$|R
50|$|Déby {{repeatedly}} <b>has</b> <b>accused</b> Sudan {{of hiring}} mercenaries to overthrow his government. Sudan has denied the accusation, {{and in turn}} <b>has</b> <b>accused</b> Chad of supporting fighters in its volatile Darfur region, where Arab militias and African rebels have fought for nearly three years.|$|R

5|$|Critics have derided {{the novel}} for being {{derivative}} of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Some <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> Brooks of lifting the entire plot {{and many of}} his characters directly from Lord of the Rings; others have praised its execution despite the lack of originality.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{with the}} European Union in 2014 have {{increased}} both unions to pressure post-Soviet states {{to join their}} integration unions. Both sides <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> each other of carving spheres of influence. Members of the union, especially Russia have tried to diversify their trade by signing economic agreements with China, Iran and Turkey. Trade with North and South Korea has also risen.|$|E
5|$|The Quartet's fourth member, the United Nations, {{does not}} {{maintain}} such a list, however, the United Nations has made repeated calls for Hezbollah to disarm and accused {{the group of}} destabilizing the region and causing harm to Lebanese civilians.

5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria that had not been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E
5|$|Editorials by AlterNet, The Montreal Gazette, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The New York Times <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> Wilders of {{hypocrisy}} given that, in their view, Wilders {{has called for}} the ban of {{the sale of the}} Quran while simultaneously arguing for his own personal freedom of speech. In a speech during a Dutch parliamentary debate, Wilders elaborated that he calls for the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence. Ideally, he would prefer to see nearly all such laws abolished. As such, he supports a European-wide constitutional protection of freedom of speech like that which exists in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E

5|$|McNallen is a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Heathen and wider Pagan community. His espousal of right-wing ethnonationalist ideas and his insistence that Heathenry should be reserved for those of Northern European ancestry has resulted in accusations of racism from both Pagans and the mainstream media. Conversely, many on the extreme right of the Heathen movement <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> him of being a race traitor for his opposition to Neo-Nazism and refusal to endorse white supremacism.|$|E
5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, several parties, {{including}} the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the British Heart Foundation, the City of New York, and the Spanish government, {{have argued that}} Burger King has contributed to obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors in Western nations by producing products that contain large amounts of salt, fat, trans-fat and calories. After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002, the company introduced several large, over-sized products including its European BK XXL line, the British Angus burger six-pack, the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line. These new offerings, and others like them, have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats in these items. Many consumer groups <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of failing to provide healthier alternatives.|$|E

5|$|The US media's {{links to}} Thảo {{have been the}} source of {{historical}} debate. The journalists' reporting of Diệm's authoritarian rule, military failures, and attacks on Buddhists shifted American public opinion and put pressure on Washington to withdraw support for the Ngô family and seek a change of leadership. William Prochnau felt that the fall of Diệm was the biggest influence of the media on American foreign policy in over six decades. Thảo and Phạm Xuân Ẩn had {{been the source of}} much of the media's information. Conservative revisionist historians <b>have</b> <b>accused</b> the media of bringing down Diệm by publishing reports that, according to them, were based on false data disseminated by communist propagandists to unfairly malign Diệm's rule, which they claim was effective and fair towards the Buddhist majority.|$|E
