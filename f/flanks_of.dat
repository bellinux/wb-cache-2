5|$|The {{most recent}} {{evidence}} of volcanic activity at Mount Hood consists of fumaroles near Crater Rock and hot springs on the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Isolated {{ridges of}} lava and {{hydrothermally}} altered rock, {{especially in the}} area of Sherman Crater, are exposed between glaciers on the upper <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the volcano; the lower flanks are steep and heavily vegetated. Volcanic rocks of Mount Baker and Black Buttes rest on a foundation of non-volcanic rocks.|$|E
5|$|Several rock {{prominences}} {{exist on}} the lower <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> Adams. The Spearhead is an abrupt rocky prominence {{near the bottom of}} Battlement Ridge. Burnt Rock, The Hump, and The Bumper are three smaller rocky prominences at or below the tree line on the west side.|$|E

50|$|The east <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> {{the church}} {{encompasses}} the five arches of the Loggia dei Mercanti (1513), designed by Bernardino da Carona. The west <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the church abuts the Chiostro Maggiore.|$|R
5|$|Sulfur {{deposits}} {{generated from}} hydrothermal alteration are found on Cerro Tuzgle. They are mostly {{associated with the}} Azufre synthem and were previously mined on the southern, eastern and western <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the volcano. The mines are now abandoned. Arsenic {{is also found in}} the groundwater and presumably comes from Tuzgle.|$|E
5|$|The suburb's {{main road}} is South Road, which at its eastern (Glen) end winds around the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> hills before joining with Princes Street and Dunedin's central {{business}} district. A slip road connects South Road with State Highway 1 {{at the foot}} of these hills, just above Carisbrook.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of stalemate, Philip finally {{advanced}} into Boeotia {{in an attempt to}} march on Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and blocking the road near Chaeronea, was the allied Greek army, similar in size and occupying a strong position. Details of the ensuing battle are scarce, but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the allied line, which then dissolved into a rout.|$|E
30|$|Many {{ruptures}} {{around the}} Yoshioka and landslides {{on the southern}} <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> Eboshidake form a band from Nigori-gawa to the south <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> Eboshidake, which {{is referred to as}} the South Aso (Aso-S) rupture band (Fig.  10).|$|R
50|$|The Pilgerbach {{rises in}} the nature park of the Habichtswald near Kassel. The spring is on the eastern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the 464.8 m-high Benberg hill and the {{northern}} <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the 460 m-high Bilstein hill, ca. 1.5 km northwest of Besse.|$|R
50|$|Maikammer lies at {{elevations}} from 120 to 300 m at {{the foot}} of the Kalmit, the highest mountain in the Palatine Forest (673 m), in a landscape dominated by vineyards. Other high ground within the boundaries of the parish includes the north <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Schafkopf (617 m), the Rotsohlberg (607 m), the north <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Stotz (603 m), the northeast <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Breitenberg (545 m), the Flachkopf (498 m) and the Wetterkreuzberg (401 m).|$|R
5|$|As {{regards the}} line of battle, we are given a little {{information}} by Ammianus. He reports that the right <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> each line, front and reserve, were held by two auxilia regiments and {{the centre of the}} reserve line was held by the Primani legion. A possible order of battle that fits the available evidence is shown in the diagram of the battle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} day of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 2, 1863) Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee {{attempted}} to capitalize on his first day's success. He launched the Army of Northern Virginia in multiple attacks on the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. The assaults were unsuccessful, and resulted in heavy casualties for both sides.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions {{would likely}} {{continue}} {{for a period}} of time, followed by years of decreasing secondary activity. The solidifying lava would occasionally collapse portions of the volcano to create pyroclastic flows. Rubble on the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the volcano and in valleys would occasionally be released to form debris flows. Major construction would be needed to repair the community of Squamish and Highway 99.|$|E
50|$|The Subachoque Formation {{is found}} at its type {{locality}} {{in the western}} <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the synclinal of Subachoque and in the western <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the synclinal of Guasca. The deposition of the Subachoque Formation postdates the main reverse movement of the Bogotá Fault.|$|R
50|$|Before 1660, this {{building}} to the Northeast <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Cathedral entrance housed the canons and the rector or the cathedral, while the bishop lived in a palace at the southwest <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the church. This building was joined via a loggia to the cathedral.|$|R

5|$|Once given {{freedom of}} action, Manstein {{intended}} to utilise his forces {{to make a}} series of counterstrokes into the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet armoured formations, {{with the goal of}} destroying them while retaking Kharkov and Kursk. The II SS Panzer Corps had arrived from France in January 1943, refitted and up to near full strength. Armoured units from the 1st Panzer Army of Army Group A had pulled out of the Caucasus and further strengthened Manstein's forces.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range shield {{were formed}} mainly during the Early Pleistocene mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago. These {{secondary}} vents are monogenetic in nature, meaning each cone was only active {{for a single}} eruption sequence before becoming extinct. The duration of volcanic activity at these cones can last from hours to years. Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range are small cinder cones situated at the summit and <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the shield volcano.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim force, now {{numbering}} around 700, {{was stationed}} {{on the slopes}} of Uhud, facing Medina with the rear being protected by the towering mount itself. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of the Muslim camp. This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} the Muslim camp. Protecting the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} in southeastern Laos was unlike any yet {{seen in the}} Vietnam War, since the PAVN abandoned its old hit-and-run tactics and launched a conventional counterattack. The PAVN first launched massed infantry attacks supported by armor and heavy artillery to crush ARVN positions on the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the main advance. Coordinated anti-aircraft fire made tactical air support and resupply difficult and costly, with 108 helicopters shot down and 618 others damaged.|$|E
5|$|The <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> {{the city}} were further {{protected}} in the 17th and 18th century, {{with the construction of}} the Santa Margherita Lines, Cottonera Lines and Fort Ricasoli on the Grand Harbour side, and Fort Manoel and Fort Tigné on the Marsamxett side. Further proposals, including construction of fortifications on Corradino and Ta' Xbiex, were also made but were never implemented.|$|E
5|$|The meltwater {{from the}} glaciers drains {{primarily}} to the Cauca River and Magdalena River via the western and eastern <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the volcano, respectively. Runoff from these glaciers and those on the surrounding volcanoes {{is a source of}} fresh water for forty surrounding towns, and Colombian scientists and government officials are concerned about the towns' water supply should the glaciers melt completely.|$|E

5|$|The {{rock that}} makes up Gareloi Island and its volcano is {{estimated}} to be of Pleistocene age. Several factors contribute to this inference, mainly the presence of glaciers and edifice failure (landslide) debris. The rock, which comprises dissected lava flows and pyroclastic masses, has been shaped by glacial retreat that began around 10,000 years past and fleshed out newly formed rocks. Other landslides have been generated on the north and east <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the volcano.|$|E
5|$|These Precambrian igneous and {{metamorphic}} rocks underlie {{most of the}} state, and are exposed in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso. Sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> a rifted continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time.|$|E
5|$|Through 7 August, American {{troops had}} {{continued}} to press south near Vire, on the right flank of the German attack. The 116th Panzer Division—which was supposed to advance in this sector—was actually driven back. In the afternoon, the 1st SS and 116th Panzer Divisions made renewed attacks, but the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the Mortain positions had been sealed off, allowing the American VII Corps to contain the German advance.|$|E
