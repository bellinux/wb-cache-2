40|$|It {{remains unknown}} how <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> {{connections}} affect {{the performance of}} the sewer system, since the assessment of serviceability is mainly based {{on the state of the}} main sewer system. Further insight into the contribution of <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> connections to the overall level of service provided can aid to target investments to parts of the system where it is most effective. To this end, techniques from the reliability theory were applied to a commercial sewer maintenance database to quantify the impact of <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> connections on the serviceability of sewer systems. Analysis of the data showed that the failures follow a Poisson distribution. A comparison of the derived failure rate with values obtained from a different study revealed that the blockage rate of <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> connections is an order of magnitude greater than the failure rate of the dominant mechanism of main sewer systems, thereby making the impact of <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> connections on the serviceability of sewer systems substantial.

40|$|This {{communication}} {{is dealing with}} separate sewer overflows from pumping stations. It relies on the processing of data recorded during 3 years on 42 pumping in the urban community of Nantes (France). These data enable to {{make the difference between}} overflows caused by infiltration/inflow, and overflows caused by pump failures, as well as pointing out differences in the behaviour of different pumping stations in different hydrological years. Infiltration seems to have an effect on overflows, at least as an increasing factor during winter period. Two kinds of action are possible for controlling overflows caused by of extraneous water : 1) fixing misconnections of runoff water from <b>house</b> <b>laterals</b> and 2) sealing leaky sewers. A methodology is proposed for evaluating the efficiency of these two actions. It is based on a two-step elimination of infiltration and inflow on experimental catchments, together with a proper modelling of the different components of the flow conveyed by the sewer systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{anterior}} part of {{the sewer}} system consists {{of a system of}} gully pots and <b>lateral</b> (<b>house)</b> connections that drain to main sewers. The total length of <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> connections can be similar to the total length of the sewers they drain to. In addition, there are 7 million gully pots with corresponding lateral connections in the Netherlands alone. Considering the potential consequences of a <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> connection blockage, proper functioning of these system components is essential. Analysis of literature on main sewer infrastructure strongly related to <b>lateral</b> (<b>house)</b> connections indicate these components to be more susceptible to shared failure mechanisms. Both incorrect use by citizens and the structural condition seem to influence the blockage propensity. Furthermore, recent research has revealed gully pot blockages to make larger contributions to flooding in public spaces than intense storm events and main sewer blockages. Gully pots are equipped with a sand trap to prevent solids from being transported to the downstream water infrastructure. The continuous trapping of solids may eventually impair the hydraulic performance. Lack of knowledge on the condition of the anterior part of a sewer system has led to the prevalence of reactive strategies, where activities are undertaken after the consequences of an operational failure becomes apparent. Next to being more costly, these strategies expose citizens to the consequences of a failure such as tangible damages and health risks. Alternatively, proactive strategies are characterised by activities that are undertaken before a failure occurs. Preserving the functionality of <b>lateral</b> (<b>house)</b> connections and gully pots, given the available resources, calls for knowledge on the effectiveness of proactive strategies and information on blockage prone components to balance proactive and reactive activities. To this end, the general objective of this thesis is to provide a methodology that supports the optimisation of management strategies for the anterior {{part of the}} sewer system.

40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> connections {{has a direct}} impact on sewer serviceability. Despite the potential consequences of a blockage, these components are generally maintained with a reactive approach. As inspection data on the condition of <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> connections are scarce, this study adopts a statistical procedure to support proactive strategies by analysing spatial blockage patterns to identify system parts with higher blockage incidences. First, a Monte Carlo simulation test provides insight into whether the spatial variation of the blockage likelihood is significant. This justifies the identification of explanatory factors by means of a bootstrapped generalised additive model. Application of the procedure to two databases containing 10  years of <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> connection blockage data, revealed factors such as building age, sewer system type and ground settlement rate to explain spatial differences in the blockage likelihood. Furthermore, a likelihood ratio test demonstrated that the addition of a spatial smoother improved model performance. This smoother was able to account for additional spatial variation caused by explaining factors for which no data were available. The procedure provides key information for inspection and rehabilitation strategies by taking into account the model performance in assessing the trade-off between costs and benefits in terms of serviceability. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} fuzzy model to classify the working environment in poultry farms. For this purpose, air temperature, relative humidity, noise level, and ammonia concentration were measured in a broiler <b>house</b> with <b>lateral</b> positive-pressure ventilation. Work days consisting of 8 hours were simulated and the results provide support for classifying the level of comfort under different thermal, noise and gas concentration conditions. Therefore, three input variables were used: temperature-humidity index (THI), noise level (dB) and ammonia concentration (ppm), and the output variable was the work environment classification (WEC). Sixty rules were defined based on combinations of THI, noise level and ammonia concentration and each result {{is a function of the}} combination of input data. Experimental data was used to test the application of the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is promising for determining the worker well-being level, and as an aid in making decisions regarding the control of the work environment in order to reduce or eliminate sources considered stressful to humans...|$|R
40|$|This {{project set}} out to {{investigate}} the behaviour of a pole frame house subjected to a lateral wind load. The behaviour of poles embedded in the ground was examined. The existing theoretical methods for determining lateral load capacity of an embedded pole were reviewed, and three common methods of pole embedment were tested at different depths to gauge the response of poles and types of pole embedment to a lateral load. The most suitable embedment method {{was used in the}} foundation for a full-scale model pole house, which was constructed and tested at various stages during the construction to examine the response of a pole <b>house</b> to <b>lateral</b> wind load. The full scale testing was also used to monitor the effect of the various structural components on the overall stiffuess of the house. The results from the full scale tests were used to calibrate a computer model of a pole house which could then be used to predict the behaviour of different configurations of pole house construction without the need for further expensive full scale tests...|$|R

40|$|How {{representations}} of visual objects are maintained across changes in viewpoint {{is a central}} issue in visual perception. Whether neural processes underlying view-invariant recognition involve distinct subregions within extrastriate visual cortex for distinct categories of visual objects remains unresolved. We used event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} in 16 healthy volunteers to map visual cortical areas responding to a large set (156) of exemplars from 3 object categories (faces, houses, and chairs), each repeated once after a variable time lag (3 - 7 intervening stimuli). Exemplars were repeated with the same viewpoint (but different retinal size) or with different viewpoint and size. The task was kept constant across object categories (judging items as "young" vs. "old"). We identified object-selective adaptation effects by comparing neural responses to the first presentation versus repetition of each individual exemplar. We found that exemplar-specific adaptation effects partly overlapped with regions showing category-selective responses (as identified using a separate localizer scan). These included the lateral fusiform gyrus (FG) for faces, parahippocampal gyrus for <b>houses,</b> and <b>lateral</b> occipital complex (LOC) for chairs. In face-selective fusiform gyrus (FG), adaptation effects occurred only for faces repeated with the same viewpoint, but not with a different viewpoint, confirming previous studies using faces only. By contrast, a region in right medial FG, adjacent to but nonoverlapping with the more lateral and face-selective FG, showed repetition effects for faces {{and to a lesser extent}} for other objects, regardless of changes in viewpoint or in retinal image-size. Category- and viewpoint-independent repetition effects were also found in bilateral LOC. Our results reveal a common neural substrate in bilateral LOC and right medial FG underlying view-invariant and category-independent recognition for multiple object identities, with only a relative preference for faces in medial FG but no selectivity in LOC...|$|R
50|$|The first Institute for the Blind was {{established}} by the Order of the Chain (Danish: Kjædeordenen)) on 10 June 1811 on Kastelsvej in Østerbro in 1867-58: Known as the Royal Institute for the Blind, it was ceded to the Danish State when it was completed. The building {{was one of the}} first civilian brick buildings to be constructed outside Copenhagen's old East Rampart when the city's fortifications were decommissioned in the 1850s. It was built next to the Institute for the Deaf which had already been completed on the glacis in front of Kastellet in 1838. The Institute for the Deaf had been built as an arrowhead-shaped revelin which could easily be converted into a defensive structure in the event of a hostile attack. Ferdinand Meldahl was charged with the design of the building. Construction began in 1957 and was completed in 1858. The three-winged complex had room for 60 students, 30 boys and 30 girls, each <b>housed</b> in their <b>lateral</b> wing. The main wing contained various workshops and activity rooms. The institution opened in 1858 with 25 students and with J. Moldenhawer as its first principal.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea of the}} Sub-Medieval House in Wales {{was first}} {{developed}} by Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan {{in their study of}} the Vernacular architecture of Monmouthshire, which was published between 1951 and 1954. Fox and Raglan recognised that around 1550 a great change occurred in Welsh House building. While the earlier Medieval traditions of constructing with crucks and timber framing continued, many new features start to appear in domestic architecture. Chimneys start to be inserted into the halls of houses instead of the open fireplaces and chimney stacks may either be built on the gable ends of <b>houses</b> or as <b>lateral</b> chimneys on the side walls. At the same time timber framed and stone houses start to be built with one and even more storeys. Box framing starts to supplant the older timber framing with crucks and in order to gain more floor space at the upper levels these floors were jettied out from the building line. Fox and Raglan considered that in Monmouthshire, the building of Sub-Medieval houses continued until around 1620. In the later part of the 16th century, sub-medieval houses continued to be built in parallel with often grander houses showing Renaissance style or influences.An excellent example of a Sub Medieval house is Llancaeach-Fawr at Gelligaer in Glamorgan. John Newman comments that in contrast with other buildings of the period it is a delight to find one so nearly perfectly preserved. It is of three storeys and largely of a single build period. It was built by either Richard ap Lewis or his son David ap Richard (Prichard), who was resident here in the 1530s. The windows emphasise the importance of the first floor rooms.|$|R
40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{of single}} bay double storey house (5. 1 m x 4. 5 m x 3. 9 m) was constructed using precast shear wall panel and cast-in situ wet connection at Construction Research Institute of Malaysia (CREAM), Malaysia. This type of building was designed using BS 8110 {{which did not}} have any provision for seismic loading and no detailing of its connection. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the global seismic behaviour of non-ductile double storey <b>house</b> under quasi-static <b>lateral</b> cyclic loading. This research work involves two main phases. The first phase includes design of double storey residential house, the construction of a full-scale prototype of double-storey residential house using precast wall panel, experimental set-up and calibration of instruments and testing of the specimen. The second phase includes the modeling of prototype using Ruaumoko programming. Two actuators were attached to the shear wall to simulate the lateral cyclic loading. Fourteen (14) linear potentiometers and twenty six (26) strain gauges were used to measure lateral displacement of precast wall panels and strain in steel and concrete. The maximum strength capacity of WALL 1 is 244. 27 kN with lateral displacement of 18 mm. A lot of cracks were observed at wet connections between wall and column and wall-beam interfaces. The building was started to loss its strength (strength degradation) at 0. 5 % drift and became unstable at 0. 7 % drift where the biggest opening of crack with 16. 10 mm was observed at wall-column interface. By using three chosen earthquake excitation, the mode shape, natural period and natural frequency are determined, followed by nodal displacement and positional drift were compared. All of the earthquakes have a similar value of force and the maximum values of these forces are axial forces, 442. 2 kN, moment, 419. 3 kNm and shear force, 301. 6 kN. In general, this type of building can only survive under low magnitude of earthquake loading and long distantearthquakes centered in Sumatra...|$|R
40|$|Fat, oil {{and grease}} (FOG) {{deposits}} {{are one of the}} leading causes of sewer system blockages, thereby increasing the risks of undesired and polluting flooding and sewer overflows. FOG accumulates throughout the entire sewer network; e. g., in public sewer pipes and <b>lateral</b> <b>house</b> connections it reduces the available discharge capacity, and in pump sumps it increases the risk of pump failures. Previous studies primarily focused on FOG deposits occurring in parts of sewer systems downstream of Food Service Establishments (FSE). It is thought, however, that domestic FOG disposal is also an important contributor to FOG deposits, and therefore warrants further investigation. Consequently, the objective of this research was to investigate the relationship between domestic FOG disposal patterns and the occurrence of FOG deposits in sewer systems. By considering both the household scale and the scale of catchments, it was possible to study the influence of individual and population disposal patterns. The first part of this study focused on the influence of individual disposal patterns; samples of FOG deposits were collected from clogged building drainage systems and questionnaires were conducted to reveal information about the household’s cooking and disposal habits. Only three out of the eleven households showed a link between the cooking fats and oils used and the FOG deposits collected, as their fatty acid profiles displayed similarities. The second part of this study focused on the influence of population disposal patterns on the occurrence of FOG deposits, by studying the severe accumulation of FOG at pumping stations in relation to catchment demographics and sewer system characteristics. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) procedures were used to model the probability of {{the presence or absence of}} FOG in pump sumps. The model revealed that severe accumulation of FOG in pump sumps was negatively correlated to the average income of inhabitants attached to the catchment, suggesting that individuals within an income-group shared FOG disposal patterns. Furthermore, FSE density and kinetic energy of wastewater per unit of volume per day were found to be important factors correlated with the occurrence of FOG deposits. The results provide important insights into factors that may influence the accumulation of FOG. Further research is required to obtain insights in how particular diets, cleaning habits and FOG disposal patterns may influence the accumulation of FOG.
