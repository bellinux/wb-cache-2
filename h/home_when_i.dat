Mr. Welles told me he never should have married in the first place; that it interfered with his freedom in his way of life.|$|E

But I have a family who have sacrificed everything for me, and I would like to pay them back somehow. And more than that, I have a child, a 15-month-old son {{and he is a}} child I would like to be close to, like any mother. I would like to bring up my son to be a good man. That is now my objective." ...|$|E
2500|$|King {{related in}} detail his primary {{inspiration}} for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction Danse Macabre (1981), in a chapter titled [...] "An Annoying Autobiographical Pause". King compares his uncle's successfully dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization {{of what he}} wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an H. P. Lovecraft collection of short stories he remembers as The Lurker in the Shadows, that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes & Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, [...] "I knew that I'd found <b>home</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> read that book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O no! I should lose so {{much time}} in going to and fro, and besides I like to be among the people. I've no face to go and preach {{resignation}} to those poor things in their smoky air and comfortless <b>homes,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come straight from every luxury myself. There are many things quite lawful for other men, which a clergyman must forego if he would do any good in a manufacturing population like this.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it ain’t," [...] said Billy, {{taking this}} as {{permission}} {{to join the}} group; [...] "I helped a drunken man <b>home</b> once <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was only ten years old, an’ <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was only—" ...|$|R
2500|$|So notorious {{did their}} {{activities}} become that <b>I</b> learned <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first went away from <b>home</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{had to give}} my address as [...] "Cosby," [...] I {{should be ready to}} say, [...] "Yes, they make it up there." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "She was {{the ideal}} mother", Billingsley {{said of her}} {{character}} in 1997 in TV Guide. [...] "Some people think she was weakish, but I don't. She was the love in that family. She {{set a good example}} for what a wife could be. I had two boys at <b>home</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did the show. I think the character became kind of like me and vice versa. I've never known where one started and where one stopped." [...] As for the idealized TV family on Leave It to Beaver, which continues in reruns on cable {{more than half a century}} after its debut, Billingsley had her own explanation for the Cleavers' enduring appeal. [...] "Good grief," [...] she told TV Guide, [...] "I think everybody would like a family like that. Wouldn't it be nice if you came home from school and there was Mom standing there with her little apron and cookies waiting?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Many viewers {{were upset}} by Lexa's {{betrayal}} of Clarke, resulting in debates about why {{she may have}} done it, and Andy Swift of TVLine's stating, [...] "I'm pretty sure I speak for Clarke, and all the angry viewers watching from <b>home,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> say, 'Lexa, please meet a fiery death. ASAP.'" [...] Mariya Karimjee of Vulture viewed [...] "the hurt and confusion that washed across Eliza Taylor's face" [...] during the betrayal as [...] "one {{of the most powerful}} performances" [...] she had seen on the show and said the heavy, emotional struggle came from both characters, with Clarke realizing [...] "Lexa is the only person who understands her." [...] Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club stated that having the characters reunite after the betrayal, [...] "allows for the show to dig into one of its most complex and compelling relationships. Clarke and Lexa are a tangle of emotions and motivations. [...] They share a connection on an emotional level, a romantic level, and they recognize the burden of responsibility that they each have taken on." [...] Fowle felt [...] "Clarke's relative forgiveness of Lexa makes sense {{within the context of the}} war of her people, and the larger political conflict at hand. When she kneels before Lexa , it's loyalty informed by weeks of patient storytelling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Out of your anxiety,' grinned the dwarf. 'Yes, I know that--out of your anxiety for my death. I shall come <b>home</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> please, I tell you. I shall come <b>home</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> please, and go when I please. I'll be a Will o' the Wisp, now here, now there, dancing {{about you}} always, {{starting}} {{up when you}} least expect me, and keeping you {{in a constant state}} of restlessness and irritation. Will you begone?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he went <b>home.</b> And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{was only}} {{a week in the}} convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard, where his people came from. O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{allow you}} to speak thus. I knew your trials at <b>home</b> <b>when</b> first <b>I</b> wished you to be my son's wife, and my opinion is unchanged, except by my {{increased}} wish to have the first claim to you.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Smith {{was quoted}} as saying, [...] "I started <b>Home</b> Improvement <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was 7, and the show ended <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was 16. I never {{had the chance to}} decide what I wanted to do with my life. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> was 16, I knew that I didn't want to act anymore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if I {{could have}} thought that this place would be your <b>home</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am gone, {{it would have made}} me very happy;--very happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps to-morrow the King {{will come}} and let me go <b>home.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> do, mamma must find a better Nelly than the naughty, wilful one who ran away." ...|$|E
6000|$|Leeches are not effective, really. Dr. <b>Home,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{mentioned}} it to [...] him yesterday, said he would bleed him till he fainted if he had [...] charge of him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said I, not {{understanding}} {{what she was}} talking about. [...] "I am sure he will be buried somewhere near his <b>home,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> go back his grave {{will be one of the}} first places I will visit." ...|$|R
5000|$|The flames also radiate an {{unbearable}} {{amount of}} heat. During even the hot summers, {{he has never}} felt that hot before. [...] "(Since the plant opened) I found myself unable to cool down at <b>home,</b> even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> turned on two electric fans in full swing".|$|R
6000|$|... "At my age, Anna, {{and with}} my means, it would be unbecoming to remain at <b>home,</b> <b>when,</b> if <b>I</b> may so express it, 'human nature is abroad.' I go to quicken my sympathies, to open my heart to my kind, and to avoid the cruel regrets that {{tortured}} the death-bed of my father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father has}} been passing kind to me. He {{gave me a}} <b>home</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was homeless, {{but it is not}} fitting that I should {{trespass}} any longer upon his hospitality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite. I {{was sent}} <b>home</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was seven, and they flicked {{it out of}} me with a wet towel at Harrow. Public schools don't {{encourage}} any-thing that isn't quite English." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jud. And, to {{make all}} sure, I am ordered to be from <b>home.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> come back again, I shall knock at your door, with, [...] Speak, brother, speak; [...] [Singing. [...] Is the deed done? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I had to {{go right}} past the big oak {{in order to get}} <b>home,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was there the most {{sensible}} thing I could do was to stop and have a chat with President Crow, for I wanted to tell him how well I'd served out young Mr. Fox.|$|R
6000|$|It {{goes without}} saying that I soon made him acquainted with all which had taken place from the time Hiram Griffin entered our <b>home,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> spoke of the {{possibility}} that we Minute Boys might succeed in releasing Archie from his imprisonment, he said emphatically, as if the matter admitted of no argument: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Betts, don't cry. I shall come <b>home</b> again. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> do I hope I {{shall be}} {{in time to}} {{celebrate}} another event, this time with you as the heroine. Good-bye. Goodbye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better. If I {{were living in}} a town my whole time would be taken up in looking after you. I fully {{expected}} you would have been <b>home</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> returned from the Woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Elsie, you are unusually sharp this morning; but I {{really do}} wish {{to know if}} Winklemann has been seen, because he had left <b>home</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> passed his house, and I want him to hunt with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] said Rufus quietly. [...] "But {{when a man}} hasn't taken liberties, there don't {{seem much}} to be said. Sally was at the <b>Home,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> last saw you--and nobody told me I should find her in this room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had never}} seen Miriam before. Her arrival was unexpected, and I was absent from <b>home</b> <b>when</b> she came. <b>I</b> {{returned}} in the evening, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw her first she was standing under the chandelier in the drawing room. Talk about spirits! For five seconds I thought I had seen one.|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} between <b>when</b> <b>I</b> practice at <b>home,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> actually play in an exposed situation {{seem to be}} a mountain I can sometimes climb and sometimes not… for some unknown reason it’ll be okay 1  day and not the next… I meditate and I exercise a lot, I look after myself. I don’t drink too much. I don’t smoke… but I can’t control the performance situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I wrote a line home, mother, as you {{too well}} know, to say I had 'listed under another name, and I went abroad.

So on, from year to year, through a service of ten years, till I began to get older, and to ask myself why should I ever write." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is my <b>home,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am here," [...] he said. [...] "Most of us {{sleep at}} the stables where our mules are put up; but I {{like having a}} place to myself, and my mate looks after the mules." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{should think}} I was unhappy. For months I've dreaded going <b>home.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> saw my house as I walked along I almost turned sick. You don't know how fervently I've wished that I'd got {{killed in the}} war. I can't go on.|$|E
6000|$|He sent {{instantly}} for his servant, {{and then}} penned this telegram to Lady Montfort: [...] "My visit {{here will be}} short. I am to see you immediately.

60|$|It {{is true that}} I dressed the Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court in a plug-hat, but, let's see, {{that was}} twenty-five years ago.
