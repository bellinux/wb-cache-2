30|$|While the {{significance}} of business performance is addressed to organizational effectiveness, in a broader concept, there are two indicators explaining business performance including financial performance (sales growth, profitability, earning per share) and operational performance (market share, new product, product quality, marketing effectiveness and value added) (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986). In an study performed on firm performance, perceived performance is defined as an indicator including growth, firm profitability and market share in which firm growth and profitability are the essential parts of a firm’s performance and those are measured to evaluate the competitiveness of the firm (Soininen, Martikainen, Puumalainen, & Kyläheiko, 2012). Another study explored business performance indicators as sales growth, customer growth, profit growth and working capital growth (Ismail, 2012). While performance would be divided onto financial and non-financial performance where financial performance is financial efficiency and profit measures and non-financial performance includes customer satisfaction, sales <b>growth,</b> and <b>employee’s</b> <b>growth</b> and market share, SMEs often investigate their growth via turnover growth and employment growth (Sidik, 2012).|$|R

Tasked {{with protecting}} {{the city from}} terrorist attacks, public health crises, natural disasters, and responding to the city’s 21,000-plus daily 911 emergency calls, Huberman developed the Operations Center within OEMC to help city services conduct a coordinated response to disaster scenarios and established Chicago {{as a leader in}} emergency preparedness. While at OEMC, Huberman greatly expanded the blue-light camera system throughout the city, which he had launched as a ranking police officer, to further boost the crime-fighting capacity in some of the city’s high-crime areas. He also initiated the city’s Traffic Management Authority, replacing sworn officers with civilian employees to manage high-traffic areas, thereby freeing needed police resources for law enforcement duties. Huberman supplemented the Traffic Management Authority with additional programs aimed at relieving congestion on busy urban streets, such as a “quick-tow” system, street sensors, smart signal timing and message boards. While at OEMC, Huberman also implemented a Performance Management system as a method of improving the organizational efficiency and outcomes of the agency.
