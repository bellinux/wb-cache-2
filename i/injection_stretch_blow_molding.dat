40|$|Abstract. Liquid-Driven <b>Stretch</b> <b>Blow</b> <b>Molding</b> {{is a new}} and {{innovative}} method to produce PET bottles [1]. In the well-established <b>Stretch</b> <b>Blow</b> <b>Molding</b> (SBM) process, preforms are biaxially deformed by pressurized air into a cavity. The resulting bottles are transferred to a separate machine, where the desired product is filled in. In contrast to that, Liquid-Driven <b>Stretch</b> <b>Blow</b> <b>Molding</b> is characterized by employing the liquid product to deform the material. The former separated blowing and filling steps are thus combined to a single forming stage leading to numerous advantages in energy consumption, cycle time and machine footprint. In this paper, a numerical simulation of the new process is presented. An additional challenge compared to SBM simulations is thereby the consideration {{of the interaction between}} liquid and preform. The load application cannot be solely represented by the pressure because the influx behavior as well as gravity and inertia forces influence the preform deformation. A smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approach is applied to the simulation to incorporate the additional effects. The process model is evaluated by prototype experiments. In addition, a feasibility study shows the applicability of a rotary forming system to the new process...|$|R

40|$|<b>Stretch</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> is {{the process}} of choice for the {{production}} of PET containers, for the food and beverage industry as well as the pharmaceutical sector. The <b>stretch</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process involves three stages, the reheat stage where previously injection molded preforms are heated to desired forming temperature distribution, followed by the forming and the solidifcation stages. The process is a high volume process with costly tooling for both the preform and the container. The design of the tooling, via virtual technologies is preferable so as to minimize costly tooling reworks. Industry has readily accepted the use of finite element technologies in the prediction of the <b>stretch</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process. This acceptabce is now generating large amounts of information that are invaluable for future designs. The challenge is now to structure and make use of this information in an efficient way as possible. A design database structure has been set up for information representation from past designs, including a design, preform and bottle databases. Mathematical methodology has been established to represent preform design. The design database and a series of user-defined heuristic design rules for <b>stretch</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molded</b> containers are used to extract unknown input needed in the design methodology. The heuristic knowledge represents the different product characteristics based on mechanical requirements.

For such applications, determination of dielectric properties of PET preform of a given geometry is essential. This article describes a novel approach of measuring the dielectric properties of PET preforms at microwave frequencies instead of the common experimental procedures used for such measurements.

The overall temperature of the preform was changed by controlling the reheat temperature of the preform; all the other process variables and preform dimensions were kept constant. Performance of the PET bottles for differing preform reheat temperatures was measured experimentally in terms of top-load strength, burst pressure resistance, environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR), and thermal stability.

40|$|International audienceInitial heating {{conditions}} and temperature effects {{have an important}} influence during the <b>injection</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process of PET preforms. The paper provides a simplified modeling of the infrared (IR) flux provided by the IR lamps and the convection heat transfer with air, for the finite element simulation of the heating of PET samples. This modeling enables fast thermal simulations in industrial context. First, a complete 2 D simulation of the air convection around a PET sheet sample is conducted using ANSYS/FLUENT to compute the local convection heat transfer coefficient. The distribution of this coefficient along the PET wall is then interpolated by a best linear fit function of the wall position to provide the boundary condition of the convection heat transfer thereafter. This boundary condition, coupled with the calculation of the infrared flux absorbed by the PET sheet sample, allows a 3 D calculation of the time evolution of the sample temperature. This calculation is validated by comparing the experimental temperature distribution of the PET sheet obtained from an IR camera with the numerical results of the simulation. Second, {{we focus on the}} modeling of the heating of a cylindrical PET preforms by IR lamps. In our approach, the IR heating flux is calculated using the spectral and surfaceto-surface radiation laws adapted to the sample geometry. The air convection effect around the preform is modeled using the heat transfer coefficient identified from the 2 D plane sheet case. It is applied on the boundaries of a simpler model in Comsol where only the preform is meshed.

40|$|Abstract The {{packaging}} {{of liquid}} products is conventionally realized by using two production stages, {{which are the}} <b>stretch</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> and the filling. In the <b>stretch</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process, hot polyethylene terephthalate (PET) preforms are inflated by pressurized air into a cavity to form plastic bottles. In a follow-up process, these packages are filled by a separate machine with the desired liquid product. In contrast to that, liquid-forming combines the blowing and filling stages by directly using the liquid product to form a plastic bottle. Through this substitution, two main challenges arise. Firstly, there are significant inertia effects through the liquid mass, leading to additional reaction forces and a spatially inhomogeneous pressure distribution inside the preform. Secondly, the heat transfer between preform and fluid is drastically increased. Because of this cooling effect, a specific combination of forming speed as well as initial preform and liquid temperatures is necessary to avoid thermally induced preform rupture. This {{is based on the}} fact that the formability of PET rapidly declines below its glass transition temperature (Tg). Consequently, a process control requires the knowledge of how the process parameters influence the preform cooling. In this paper, a numerical simulation of the liquid-forming process (LF) is introduced including the preform cooling during forming. In addition, the strain-dependent self-heating effect of PET is implemented. Process experiments under different parameter combinations are conducted using simplified bottle geometry. Through a comparison of the results from experiments and from simulation, the influence of process parameters on the temperature drop and thus on thermally induced failure is determined. In this way, process understanding and control are increased...|$|R
25|$|Such {{copolymers}} are advantageous {{for certain}} molding applications, such as thermoforming, {{which is used}} for example to make tray or blister packaging from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet. On the other hand, crystallization is important in other applications where mechanical and dimensional stability are important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, diethylene glycol (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely.

The method is based on coupling an optimization algorithm and finite element (FE) simulations carried out using LS-DYNA.

Interrupted tensile tests followed by quenching demonstrates that strain hardening is not correlated to prefect crystallisation.
