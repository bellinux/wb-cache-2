500|$|At age 11, Bell {{became a}} vegetarian. In an {{interview}} with PETA, Bell stated, [...] "I have always been an animal lover. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time disassociating the animals I cuddled with—dogs and cats, for example—from the animals on my plate, and I never really cared for the taste of meat. I always loved my Brussels sprouts!" [...] By 2012 Bell became vegan with her husband after watching the documentary Forks Over Knives. During her time in Michigan, Bell fostered animals from Michigan Humane Society and she now supports the San Diego-based Helen Woodward Animal Center. Bell often attends fund raisers for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting animals. She has a Welsh Corgi-Chow Chow mix named Lola, a Welsh Corgi-Chihuahua mix named Shakey, and a black Labrador Retriever named Sadie, who was 11 {{years old when she}} was rescued from Hurricane Katrina and adopted by Bell in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Baldelli had {{to adjust}} to {{professional}} baseball. Says Baldelli, [...] "In Princeton, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time with {{all parts of the}} game…I didn't know how to play the game. Coming out of high school, I'd just come {{up to the plate and}} swing as hard as I could every time and try to smoke the ball. I didn't know about hitting mechanics, breaking pitches or reading pitchers." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{subject has}} been changed, and we'll write Beatrice di Tenda [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time persuading Romani, but persuade him I did, {{and with good}} reasons. Knowing that the subject pleases you, as you told me the evening {{when you saw the}} ballet ... He is a man of good will, and I want him to show it also in wanting to prepare at least the first act for me swiftly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know now," [...] Mr. Sabin said, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> task before me. They shall <b>have</b> me for <b>a</b> {{friend or}} an enemy. I {{can still make}} myself felt as either. You have nothing more to say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a poor man; {{considering}} my large family, a {{very poor}} man. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> between eight and nine hundred a year, and when {{my father and mother}} are both gone <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> nearly as much more; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> nine children, and as I must keep up something of <b>a</b> position, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time of it sometimes, I can tell you." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> {{time talking}} about Norm. It's like he's too close to me, but I don't think he's changed over the years. They moved him from being an {{accountant}} to painter and decorator, but that was basically for some storylines. He's still the same Norm. I think he's the toughest to write for because he's not really anything. He's just funny. George Wendt ...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{within a}} month, Bellini {{had changed his}} mind and he was writing to Pasta stating that [...] "the subject has been changed, and we'll write Beatrice di Tenda. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time persuading Romani, but persuade him I did, and with good reasons. Knowing that the subject pleases you, as you told me the evening when you saw the ballet. He is a man of good will, and I want him to show it also in wanting to prepare at least the first act for me swiftly".|$|E
2500|$|... "It was in {{the charge}} I took the eagle off the enemy; he and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> contest for it; he made a thrust at my groin I parried it off and cut him down through the head. After this a lancer came at me; I threw the lance off my right side, and cut him through the chin upwards through the teeth. Next, a foot soldier fired at me, then charged me with his bayonet, which I also had the good luck to parry, and I cut him down through the head; thus ended the contest." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{says one}} of his earlier works [...] "was {{intensely}} personal about a love affair I had. It was terrible, I knew it. It was not until he started writing in a more [...] "structured narrative environment" [...] that he [...] "began to find my voice... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time finishing scripts. My problem was finding certain character narrative concerns. Once I finished scripts, I almost instantly made a living. Not only made a living, but got them made. From the time I finished them to {{the time they were}} getting made, making progress on the trail, that all happened pretty quickly.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with author Greg Rhodes, Rohr, who wasn't a baseball fan when the project began, stated: [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time understanding {{the people who come}} and stare at this place with tears in their eyes; a woman actually hugged the ticket booth and kissed it". The field is also used regularly by teams in various levels of play. Moeller High School's Varsity Baseball team plays its home games at Crosley.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, dear friends. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> task {{to offer}} you. It {{is a great}} {{sacrifice}} for you light loving Fairies to dwell through the long winter in the dark, cold earth, watching over the flower roots, to keep them free from the little grubs and worms that seek to harm them. But in the sunny Spring when they bloom again, their love and gratitude will give you happy homes among their bright leaves.|$|R
5000|$|Jackson told Billboard magazine, [...] "Everybody {{kept telling}} me, 'You {{need to come}} out with a {{positive}} love song.' I've <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of sad ballads, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time writing those love songs because there's a tendency to get real sappy with them so they're not real. That's the way most of them come off to me. I wanted to write one that was realistic, what I call a realistic approach to a positive love song." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were three}} letters and four legal papers. Like Nicholas Weaver's statement, all were badly written, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> job to {{decipher}} even {{a portion of}} the manuscript.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} say so," [...] cried Jock. [...] "That woman is worse for him {{than six months}} of east wind. I declare <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> matter to get myself to go to Church there the next day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{taught you}} to stalk the deer, and spear the boar, not to hunt your fellow-creatures, my lord. But I forgive you, {{for it was}} well done, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> run to escape," [...] he said, still laughing.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> such <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> day at {{the office}} yesterday, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not time to write to you before I left. So I write to-day.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} on Cyclingnews.com on 20 December 2006, Jeanson said that although she could race again from mid-July 2007, she [...] "won't race ever again." [...] She said she had [...] "changed so much this past year that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time imagining who I was before." [...] She finally admitted to doping to a French CBC journalist. [...] Her coach André Aubut and doctor Maurice Duquette were banned for life by the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport in 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Debnath {{felt that}} the character's offscreen exit in which Kelly [...] "seems {{something}} very unlike the character". Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy wrote that Kelly's exit was [...] "a somewhat unlikely farewell for Lauren Socha's loveable loud-mouth". Simon Cocks of MSN also reacted unfavourably to the method in which Kelly was written out, describing it as a [...] "lowlight" [...] of the episode explaining: [...] "The explanation of Kelly's whereabouts is necessary, but still feels odd and forced. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time believing she'd really decide to go to Africa to defuse bombs".|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{outburst}} rather astonished me, {{as you can}} think. 'Well,' said I, 'other people don't think {{quite so}} much of me as you seem to do, Mr. Pinner. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> enough fight to get this berth, and I am very glad to have it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'On that {{occasion}}, Kit,' said Mr Brass, 'on {{that occasion}} that I have just alluded to, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> battle with Mr Quilp (for Mr Quilp {{is a very}} hard man) to obtain them the indulgence they had. It might have cost me a client. But suffering virtue inspired me, and I prevailed.' ...|$|E
60|$|This day we had supper {{over before}} sunset. Romer showed no effects from his long, hard ride. First {{he wanted to}} cook, then he fooled around the fire, bothering Isbel. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time to manage him. He wanted to be {{eternally}} active. He teased and begged to go hunting--then he compromised on target practice. R.C. and I, however, were too tired, and we preferred to rest beside the camp-fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "My father, Monsieur," [...] she continued, [...] "died {{three months}} ago, in England, whither he <b>had</b> emigrated when <b>I</b> {{was a mere}} child, leaving my poor mother to {{struggle}} along for a livelihood as best she could. My mother died last year, Monsieur, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>hard</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> life; and now it seems that my father made a fortune in England and left it all to me." ...|$|R
60|$|And now, {{my dearest}} Georgy, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said all <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to say before}} I go out for <b>a</b> little air. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very <b>hard</b> day yesterday, and am tired.|$|R
6000|$|Lister laughed. [...] "They're frankly drunk! <b>A</b> pretty <b>hard</b> crowd, but Brown and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> handled <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> crowd before. In fact, <b>I</b> reckon Cartwright <b>has</b> got {{the proper}} {{men for the}} job." ...|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[Shrinks {{away from}} him, half-frightened.] What's that--Swedish? I don't know it. [Then as if seeking {{relief from the}} tension in a voluble chatter.] Gee, I had an awful trip coming here. I'm all in. I had to sit up in the dirty coach all night--couldn't get no sleep, hardly--and then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> job finding this place. I never been in New York before, you know, and-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By my soul! Nigel," [...] cried Sir Oliver, {{waving a}} great boiled ham over his head, [...] "I have come by {{something}} which I may eat with my truffles! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> fight for it, for {{there were three}} of them with their mouths open and the knives in their hands, all sitting agape round the table, when I rushed in upon them. How say you, Sir William, will you not try the smack of the famed Spanish swine, though we have but the brook water to wash it down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Last night wasn't {{particular}} bad, ratin' {{with some}} other nights lately. There wasn't much doin'. But, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> knock. Yesterday when we started in {{with a bunch of}} cattle I sent one of my cowboys, Danny Mains, along ahead, carryin' money I hed to pay off hands an' my bills, an' I wanted thet money to get in town before dark. Wal, Danny was held up. I don't distrust the lad. There's been strange Greasers in town lately, an' mebbe they knew about the money comin'.|$|E

5000|$|... "John-John McIntyre is the {{smallest}} seventh grader in the world. Even fifth graders can see over his head. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time believing he and me are both thirteen. He is Maleeka's color, but ever since second grade he's been teasing me about being too black. At first, there doesn't {{seem to be a}} reason why John-John might be teasing Maleeka. Perhaps he's jealous because Maleeka is a tall, cute, smart young lady even if she doesn't quite realize it yet, she's rather gorgeous too. And perhaps he's also jealous of her perfect relationship with Caleb.|$|R
6000|$|... "Holley, I reckon you see--clearer 'n me," [...] said Bostil, plaintively. [...] "'Pears as if <b>I</b> never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> knock before. Fer my nerve's broke. I can't hope.... Lucy's gone! ... Ain't there anythin' {{to do but}} wait?" ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{knelt on}} the rock <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> {{contraction}} of my throat, and then all my muscles set tight and rigid. I pulled the trigger of my automatic once, twice. It was wonderful how closely the two bullets followed each other, as we {{could tell by the}} almost simultaneous puffs of dust rising from under the beast's nose. She must have been showered and stung with gravel, for she bounded off to the left and disappeared in the cedars. I had missed, but the shots had served to a better end than if I had killed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't tell you. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> life in England and, on the whole, {{was glad}} to get away. Perhaps it's a homing instinct, like the pigeon's, and perhaps it's sentiment. We came out because nobody wanted us and have made {{ourselves}} pretty comfortable. America's our model {{and we have no}} use for English patronage, but every now and then the pull comes and we long to go back, though we wouldn't like to stop there. It's illogical, but if there was trouble in Europe and the Old Country needed help, we'd all go across." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{lost her}} when I {{was a little}} older than you are, and for years had to {{struggle}} on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on. Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be good. But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, luckily, {{we are not}} in France, where I {{am afraid}} <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time of it. My dear Charlotte, have you {{rendered}} me that delightful service?" [...] And Felix bent toward her as if some one had been presenting him.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, really,' cried Hans, 'it is {{very good}} of you to ask, very good indeed. I am afraid <b>I</b> <b>had</b> rather <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time of it, but now the spring <b>has</b> come, and <b>I</b> am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Cale told The San Diego Union-Tribune in his 1990 {{interview}} about Clapton's version:I thought: 'Well, that won't go anywhere'. ... A year later, they started playing it on every radio station, including in my hometown. The first time I {{heard it on}} my car radio I just drove {{off to the side}} of the road. Because I'd never heard anything of my own on the radio before...All record companies want big-selling records, and my music is a little too raw for commercial success. People are familiar with my songs, especially through Eric Clapton. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time drawing <b>a</b> crowd, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> songwriter. I've never sold a lot of records; my music's gotten much more famous than me.|$|R
