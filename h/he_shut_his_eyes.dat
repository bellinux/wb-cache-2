60|$|Bill {{looked at}} the butter and then 'e {{looked at the}} ten shillings on the table, and at last <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>'is</b> <b>eyes</b> and gulped it down and {{put the money in}} 'is pocket.|$|R
60|$|Love is proverbially blind. The {{argument}} {{was more than}} sufficient. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> metaphorically, and rushed upon his fate.|$|E
60|$|Shere Khan's ears lay {{flat back}} on his head, and <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> for the blazing branch was very near.|$|E
60|$|His hands moulded ample {{curves of}} air. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "’Picked {{it up on}} a book-stall,’ he ses; then <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>’is</b> <b>eyes</b> an’ said <b>his</b> piece wonderful. It made {{me quite}} queer to listen to ’im. ’That’s how I feel,’ ses he, when he’d finished. ’Just {{strength}} enough to get to bed. Lend a hand, Bill, an’ go an’ fetch the doctor.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Jim said he hadn't been asleep; <b>he</b> just <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> so <b>he</b> {{could listen}} better.|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s bad," [...] said Mr. Tredgold, sympathetically. [...] "Has <b>he</b> tried <b>shutting</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and {{counting}} sheep jumping over a stile?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Again <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and the watchers {{thought that}} all was done, till of a sudden once more he opened them and added in broken tones-- ...|$|E
60|$|The frown slowly {{left the}} visage of Jack Brace. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> smiled benignly, and {{delivered}} {{a series of}} heavy puffs from the starboard side of his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|Dicky Weed didn't answer 'im. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{tight and}} then 'e jumps {{up all of}} a sudden. [...] "I've got it!" [...] he says. [...] "Where's that bag?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rupert said he didn't mind, {{and then}} <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>'is</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and pretended to}} be asleep. His idea was to wait till George was asleep and then pinch 'is clothes; {{consequently}} 'is feelings when 'e opened one eye and saw George getting into bed with 'is clothes on won't bear thinking about. He laid awake for hours, and three times that night George, who was a very heavy sleeper, woke up and found Rupert busy tucking him in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suddenly he ceased all motion; he {{crouched}} upon the ground; {{he made no}} sound; <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> mouth; <b>he</b> partly <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> but they were fixed upon me immovably, and they were green as emerald.|$|R
6000|$|... "The old taste, {{not a bit}} changed," [...] <b>he</b> murmured, <b>shutting</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "Brings {{back the}} old ships, and the old messmates, and the old times, and Old England." ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly he did {{a simple}} thing, but so uncharacteristic that it moved her. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> It {{was as if he}} had said: 'All right! I'm dead to the world!' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and lay {{so still}} that Mrs. Frost trusted that he slept; {{but when his}} father came in, they were open, and Lord Ormersfield, bending over him, hoped he was in less pain.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very well,' said Mr Clinton. 'You {{can take}} a 'orse to the well but you can't make 'im drink.' When it came to his turn {{to look through the}} pane of glass behind which was the body, <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Many {{times did}} {{the face of}} Martin flush and pale as he listened. A vision of Paradise had been opened before him, but he felt that <b>he</b> must <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Three-quarters of a yard," [...] Bruno {{replied with}} perfect solemnity. [...] "And I'm a little sorry too," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>shutting</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{so as not}} to see that he was smiling.|$|R
6000|$|The real Griffin {{settled down}} in the little square before the church and gazed earnestly at his {{sculptured}} likeness. For a long time he looked at it. First he put his head on one side, and then he {{put it on the}} other; then <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> right <b>eye</b> and gazed with his left, after which <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> left <b>eye</b> and gazed with his right. Then he moved a little to one side and looked at the image, then he moved the other way. After a while he said to the Minor Canon, who had been standing by all this time: ...|$|R
60|$|A {{feeling of}} horror came over {{him for a}} moment, but that seemed to give him strength, for he {{instantly}} grasped his revolver. Hoping, however that they might pass without observing him, <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and lay quite still.|$|E
6000|$|Graham {{struggled}} into {{a sitting}} position. He wiped a rheumy tear {{from his face}} with a lean hand. [...] "Many years!" [...] he repeated. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> tight, opened them, and sat looking about him from one unfamiliar thing to another.|$|E
6000|$|Nod wriggled closer {{into his}} jacket. [...] "Trouble not, Queen of Munza," [...] he said softly. [...] "I shouldn't {{have time to}} use them now." [...] <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> again, and all his pain seemed to be {{floating}} away in sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... '"We want {{in so many}} {{different}} ways to be," [...] he began again. [...] "This magnificent butterfly finds a little heap of dirt and sits still on it; but man he will never on his heap of mud keep still. He want to be so, and again he want to be so. [...] ." [...] He moved his hand up, then down. [...] "He wants to be a saint, and {{he wants to be a}} devil--and every time <b>he</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>he</b> sees himself as a very fine fellow--so fine as he can never be. [...] . In a dream. [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, sir, for myself," [...] {{replied the}} Counsellor, [...] "I am Paulus Pleydell, an {{advocate}} at the Scottish bar; and for you, {{it is not}} easy to say distinctly who you are at present, but I trust in a short time to hail you by the title of Henry Bertram, Esq., representative of one of the oldest families in Scotland, and heir of Tailzie and provision to the estate of Ellangowan. Ay," [...] continued <b>he,</b> <b>shutting</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and speaking to himself, [...] "we must pass over his father, and serve him heir to his grandfather Lewis, the entailer; the only wise man of his family, that I ever heard of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{you must}} drag me thither,' <b>he</b> groaned, and <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as though with faintness, and doubtless he was {{somewhat}} faint.|$|R
60|$|A two-masted vessel {{came up the}} channel. The {{sweep of}} her slanted green hull, {{outlined}} by curling foam, and her high, shining canvas were beautiful, but Kit hardly glanced at her. He was exhausted, and leaning against the bulwarks, <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ann flung {{herself into}} Jimmy's arms, {{and he held}} her tight. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Even {{as he waited for}} the end the thought flashed through his mind that, if he must die, this was the manner of death which he would prefer.|$|E
60|$|After all {{why should}} the man care? He wasn't paid to care, and why expect it? In this world people couldn't look for affection unless they paid for it. It might be {{different}} in the next--he didn't know--couldn't tell! And again <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "So he did, and Harold {{was with}} him {{backwards}} and forwards all the day. But <b>he</b> can't <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and open <b>his</b> mouth, and see what God will send him, as a wise and prudent man should do. He is always for bargaining, and no Prime Minister likes that." ...|$|R
6000|$|S. [...] "We {{will allow}} them at least the honour which we do to the wild boar, who rushes {{fiercely}} through thorns and brambles upon the dogs, not to be turned aside by spears or tree-trunks, and indeed charges forward the more valiantly the more tightly <b>he</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> That praise we can bestow on him, but, I fear, no higher one. It is expedient, nevertheless, {{to have such a}} temperament as it is to have a good memory, or a loud voice, or a straight nose unlike mine; only, like other animal passions, it must be restrained and regulated by reason and the law of right, so as to employ itself only on such matters and to such a degree as they prescribe." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} opens with vocalist Davey Havok finding a note, {{possibly}} written by Miss Murder. The note features the three black rabbits symbol {{featured on the}} cover of Decemberunderground. Havok appears at his desk singing the song, while the band members are shown performing the song in a large room. Havok then appears on a balcony, rallying a chanting crowd below, and unfolds large posters of the band members themselves. During the bridge of the song, black rabbits surround Havok's desk. After he looks down the balcony, the crowd has disappeared and instead sees Miss Murder staring back at him. He returns to his desk where Miss Murder approaches. She places her hand on <b>his</b> shoulder, then <b>he</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> implying <b>his</b> death. The video ends with the black rabbit watching the murder.|$|R
