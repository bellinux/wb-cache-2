5|$|From 2009, the Swedish economy <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the}} world's fastest {{recovering}} economies {{with high}} competitiveness. Sweden was noted for having proved to overcome the crisis {{better than any other}} developed countries, and this was highlighted by the Government as a force in the run-up to 2010 general election. As Sweden <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010. This was the first time ever that the Moderate Party was re-eleted after completing a full first term.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, public {{attention}} in the United States was drawn to prosperity theology through the influence of prominent televangelists such as Jim Bakker.

40|$|Introverts {{are less}} likely to <b>emerge</b> <b>as</b> leaders than extraverts, however the {{existing}} literature provides little explanation as to why. To investigate the potential cause of this trait-based difference in emergent leadership, we measured trait extraversion in a sample of 184 business students and studied their leadership-related behavior in an unstructured group task. We drew from a model of forecasted affect to hypothesize that introverts {{would be less likely to}} <b>emerge</b> <b>as</b> leaders based on their belief that engaging in the necessary extraverted behavior would be unpleasant/unenjoyable (i. e. they would forecast higher levels of negative affect compared to extraverts). Consistent with this, we found that introverts were less likely to <b>emerge</b> <b>as</b> leaders, and that forecasted negative affect fully accounted for the relationship between extraversion and peer-rated emergent leadership. We therefore argue that introverts fail to <b>emerge</b> <b>as</b> leaders as often as extraverts because they engage in higher levels of forecasted negative affect and that these forecasts impede their emergent leadership potential...|$|R

5|$|In {{the middle}} of this period, through a process of conquest, {{consolidation}} and treaty, the boundaries of Scotland were gradually extended from a small area under direct control of the kings of Alba in the east, to almost its modern borders. For most of the Medieval era the monarchy and court was itinerant, with Scone and Dunfermline acting as important centres and later Roxburgh, Stirling and Perth, before Edinburgh <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> the political capital in the fourteenth century. Largely as a result of Viking raids from about 800, Iona declined as a religious centre. Despite royal attempts to establish a new religious centre at Dunkeld, it was St. Andrews on the east coast, close to the heartland of Pictish settlement, that <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> the most important religious focus of the kingdom.|$|E
