40|$|Using {{a measure}} of default {{likelihood}} based on an option pricing method, we pro-vide evidence that Fed policy actions affect the financial distress of commercial banks. When the Fed increases (decreases) interest rates, the measure of default likelihood increases (decreases). We show that when the Fed uses a tight money policy, the increase in default likelihood is more pronounced for banks that have less capital, have greater financial leverage, are smaller, have fewer growth op-portunities, and have lower asset quality. Additionally, the effects on bank default likelihood are more pronounced when the Fed’s policy signals less concern about economic growth, as indicated by its bias toward further tightening, and {{when there is a}} market expectation of higher short-term market rates in the future.

PICV P 2 strain causes a mild febrile reaction in guinea pigs, while P 18 causes severe disease with clinical and pathological features reminiscent of Lassa hemorrhagic fever in humans. The envelope glycoproteins (GPC) of P 2 and P 18 viruses differ at positions 119, 140, and 164, all localized to the receptor-binding G 1 subunit.

Despite its pivotal role, Rubisco is an inefficient enzyme {{and thus}} is a key target for directed evolution. Rubisco biogenesis depends on auxiliary factors, including the GroEL/ES-type chaperonin for folding and the chaperone RbcX for assembly.

40|$|Calmodulin is a two-domain {{signaling}} {{protein that}} becomes activated upon binding cooperatively {{two pairs of}} calcium ions, leading to large-scale conformational changes that expose its binding site. Despite significant advances in understanding the structural biology of calmodulin functions, the mechanistic details of the conformational transition between closed and open states have remained unclear. To investigate this transition, we used a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on the Ca(2 +) -saturated <b>E</b> <b>140</b> Q C-terminal domain variant. Using chemical shift restraints in replica-averaged metadynamics simulations, we obtained a high-resolution structural ensemble consisting of two conformational states and validated such an ensemble against three independent experimental data sets, namely, interproton nuclear Overhauser enhancements, (15) N order parameters, and chemical shift differences between the exchanging states. Through {{a detailed analysis of}} this structural ensemble and of the corresponding statistical weights, we characterized a calcium-mediated conformational transition whereby the coordination of Ca(2 +) by just one oxygen of the bidentate ligand <b>E</b> <b>140</b> triggers a concerted movement of the two EF-hands that exposes the target binding site.
