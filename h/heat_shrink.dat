50|$|Another Out of {{autoclave}} {{method for}} achieving external compression on prepreg based composite parts {{is through the}} use of <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape. This method, however, does not achieve the high quality of RTM or autoclave processes because without the autoclave or a closed mold, the part must be cured in a non-pressurized oven. These compression tapes are typically made from polyester (PET) film. <b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape is applied to a composite part prior to the heating, or curing cycle. When heated, the tape will shrink in the linear (machine direction). <b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape works best on parts that are cylindrical or semi-circular in cross section, as this allows the tape to exert even compaction forces on the part surface.

5000|$|Flying models borrow {{construction}} techniques from full-sized aircraft {{although the}} use of metal is limited.

Regardless of the underlying structure, it is then skinned and subsequently doped to provide a smooth sealed surface. For light models, tissue paper is used. After it is applied, the paper is sprayed with a mist of water, which causes the paper to shrink when it dries. For larger models (usually powered and radio controlled) heat-curing or <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> covering plastic films or heat-shrinkable synthetic fabrics are applied to the model then heated using a hand held hair dryer, laundry iron or heat gun to tighten the material and adhere to the frame.

50|$|Low smoke zero halogen cable {{considerably}} {{reduces the}} amount of toxic and corrosive gas emitted during combustion. When burned, a low-smoke zero halogen cable emits a less optically dense smoke that releases at a lower rate. During a fire, a low-smoke cable is desirable because it reduces the amount and density of the smoke, which makes exiting a space easier for occupants as well as increases the safety of firefighting operations. This type of material is typically used in poorly ventilated areas such as aircraft, rail cars, tanks, subsea and offshore installations, submarines or ships. It is also used extensively in the rail industry, wherever high voltage or track signal wires must be run into and through underground tunnel systems. The nuclear industry is another area where LSZH cables have been and {{will be used in}} the future. Major cable manufacturers have been producing LSZH cables for nuclear facilities since the early 1990s. Construction of new nuclear plants will almost certainly involve extensive use of LSZH cable. This will reduce the chance of toxic gasses accumulating in those areas where personnel are working and the lack of corrosive gasses where there are computer controlled systems will reduce the possibility of wires being damaged by fire resulting in a short circuit fault.. Since the 1970s, the wire and cable industry has been using low-smoke, low-halogen materials in a number of applications. The introduction of a thermoplastic LSZH extended its use to accessories such as <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tubing, labelling and fixtures. The objective was to create a wire and cable jacketing system that was not only flame retardant but also did not generate dense, obscuring smoke and less toxic or corrosive gases. In the military field its introduction was accelerated after 1982 following the dense black smoke emitted from HMS Sheffield after being hit by an exocet missile in Falkland’s war. Several fires, such as the King’s Cross fire in London that killed 31 people in London’s underground in 1987, increased the awareness of the contribution that wire and cable jacketing makes in a fire. As a result there has been an increased use of LSZH cables. With an increase in {{the amount of}} cable found in residential, commercial and industrial applications in recent years, there is a greater fuel load {{in the event of a}} fire and LSZH systems have a major role to play in protecting the public.|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of two dimensional stagnation flow of an incompressible micro polar fluid with heat transfer characteristics towards a <b>heated</b> <b>shrinking</b> sheet is analyzed analytically. The main goal {{of this paper is}} to find the analytic solutions using a powerful technique namely the Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) for the velocity and the temperature distributions and to study the steady mixed convection in two-dimensional stagnation flows of a micro polar fluid around a vertical shrinking sheet. The governing equations of motion together with the associated boundary conditions are first reduced to a set of self-similar nonlinear ordinary differential equations using a similarity transformation and are then solved by the HAM. Some important features of the flow and heat transfer for the different values of the governing parameters are analyzed, discussed and presented through tables and graphs. The heat transfer from the sheet to the fluid decreases with an increase in the shrinking rate. Micro polar fluids exhibit a reduction in shear stresses and heat transfer rate as compared to Newtonian fluids, which may be beneficial in flow and thermal control of polymeric processing...|$|R
5000|$|The final panel {{fabrication}} process, after {{achieving the}} correct surface contour, {{is some kind}} of edge treatment, such as flanging (sheet metal) or wire edging. This finishes and strengthens the edge. Typically, there is {{too much or too little}} metal in the flange, which pulls the panel out of shape after the flange is turned—so it must be stretched or shrunk to correct the surface shape. This is most easily done using Eckold shrinking and stretching, but can be done using <b>heat</b> <b>shrinking</b> or cold shrinking, by tucking and beating the tucked metal into itself, or by using a cold shrinking hammer and dolly. Stretching or shrinking the flange requires a correct profile hammer and dolly. The hammer and dolly must match the desired flange shape at the point of contact through the flange, (known as ringing the dolly) with the hammer. A lot of shrinking or stretching work hardens the flange and can cause cracks and tears. While these can be welded, it is much better to anneal the metal before this happens to restore its workability.|$|R
