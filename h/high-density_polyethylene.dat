40|$|ABSTRACT. Bimodal <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> with {{different}} comonomer type and content were synthesized by poly-merization of ethylene using Ziegler-Natta catalyst. Their structure and properties were studied using GPC, NMR, DSC and tensile test. It {{was found that}} ethylene/ 1 -hexene copolymer exhibits higher tensile strength and elongation at break than that of ethylene / 1 -butylene copolymer with similar comonomer content. The molecular weight decreases as the comonomer con-tent of the polymer increases. Short chain branching affects the crystallinity and thus the morphology and consequently the mechanical properties of the corresponding bimodal <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylenes.</b> After SSA treated, the multiple endothermic peaks were observed.

25|$|Most {{commercial}} polypropylene is isotactic and has {{an intermediate}} level of crystallinity between that of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (HDPE).

25|$|Regarding the {{organization}} of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The example given, paraffin wax, {{is a member of}} a family of hydrocarbon molecules of differing chain lengths, with <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> at the long-chain end of the series. <b>High-density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> can be a strong material: when the hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, the resulting fibers rival the strength of steel. The covalent bonds in this material form extended structures, but do not form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from Cross-linked polyethylene, to rigid thermosetting resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids, to vitreous carbon, diamond-like carbons, and ultimately to diamond itself. As this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and network covalent solids.|$|E
40|$|Medium to <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> (PE) for {{pressure}} pipe service are characterised by high ductility and high resistance to low speed crack growth, but extruded PE pipelines tested under gas pressurisation can sustain axial "brittle" crack propagation {{at high speeds}} (100 - 300 ms- 1). The High Speed Double Torsion test method has been developed to measure crack resistance under stable, high speed, steady state conditions. As the pipe tests indicate, resistance to a high speed crack in PE is even lower than conventional Charpy impact tests would suggest...|$|R

25|$|PEX is a medium- to <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> {{containing}} cross-link bonds {{introduced into}} the polymer structure, changing the thermoplastic into a thermoset. The high-temperature properties of the polymer are improved, its flow is reduced, and its chemical resistance is enhanced. PEX is used in some potable-water plumbing systems because tubes made of the material can be expanded to fit over a metal nipple and it will slowly return to its original shape, forming a permanent, water-tight connection.|$|E
25|$|Many modern hoopers {{make their}} own hoops out of {{polyvinyl}} chloride, polyethylene, <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylene,</b> or polypropylene tubing. The size {{and the weight of}} the hoop affects style of the hooper. Heavier, larger hoops are more often used for slow hooping and body tricks while lighter, thinner tubing is used for quick hand tricks. These hoops may be covered in a fabric or plastic tape to ease the amount of work in keeping a hoop twirling around the dancer, and can be very colourful. Some use glow-in-the dark, patterned, or sparkling tape, and others are produced with clear tubing and filled with plastic balls, glitter, or even water to produce visual or audio effects when used.|$|E
25|$|UHMWPE is {{polyethylene}} with {{a molecular}} weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The {{high molecular weight}} makes it a very tough material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (for example, 0.930–0.935nbsp&g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, and butchers' chopping boards. It is commonly used {{for the construction of}} articular portions of implants used for hip and knee replacements. As fiber, it competes with aramid in bulletproof vests.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we report on}} the {{microstructural}} and the mechanical characteristics of high density polyethylene (HDPE) -clay nanocomposites, with particular attention to the creep behaviour. The samples were prepared through melt compounding, using two <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> with different melt flow rate (MFR), two different organo-modified clays, and changing the relative amount of a polyethylene grafted with maleic anhydride (PEgMA) compatibilizer. The intercalation process is more effective as the matrix melt viscosity decreases (higher MFR), while the clay interlamellar spacing increases as the compatibilizer amount increases. The relative stiffness of the nanocomposites increases with the addition of clay, with a limited enhancement of the relative yield stress. The better intercalation obtained by the addition of the compatibilizer is not accompanied by a concurrent improvement of the tensile mechanical properties. The creep resistance is enhanced by the introduction of clay, with an appreciable dependence on both the polyethylene and the clay type...|$|R

Thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) materials based on synthesized reactive polyethylenes and GTR as well as ethylene-propylene-diene rubber, EPDM were prepared by dynamic vulcanization of the rubber phase inside thermoplastic (polyethylene) matrix and their phase structure, and main properties have been studied using DSC and mechanical testing.

25|$|Plastic {{products}} are printed with numbers 1–7 {{depending on the}} type of resin. Type 1 (polyethylene terephthalate) is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type 2 (<b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylene)</b> is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, hula hoops, credit cards, wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density polyethylene) is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is polypropylene and makes up syrup bottles, straws, Tupperware, and some automotive parts. Type 6 is polystyrene and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, and sunglasses. Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.|$|E
500|$|A {{deck crane}} {{was used for}} the {{construction}} of the main span of the bridge. A specially designed crane of 45tonne capacity was used to erect the pylons of the bridge. The structural steel used in the bridge weighs about 13,200 tonnes. The pylons, which are [...] in height, are designed as free standing portals. They are provided with two cross portal members, one at the bottom and another at the top, below the pylon head. The deck is connected to the end piers by bolts embedded in the chambers of the piers. Pylons made of [...] steel boxes of riveted construction were raised on the two side spans of the bridge; one set is on the Calcutta side and the other is on the Howrah side. The six pylons on the Calcutta side of the bridge were installed using 75 MT and 50 MT cranes, while on the Howrah end, a single 50 MT crane was used. Anchorage of the pylon with the base of piers was effected through Dywidag rods, duly anchored in the piers. Cables were erected from the four pylon heads with the help of 32 MT hoist frames. The hoist frames were mounted on top of each pylon. Sheave blocks, winches and snatch blocks were used to facilitate the lifting, and cables inside the pylons were stressed with jacks. Pressure grouting was performed to fill the voids between the wire and the <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (HDPE) tubes.

40|$|For linear homopolymers {{the linear}} {{viscoelastic}} {{predictions of the}} double reptation model are compared to those of a recent, more detailed model, the “dual constraint model” and to experimental data for monodisperse, bidisperse, and polydisperse polystyrene melts from several laboratories. A mapping procedure is developed that links the empirical parameter K of the double reptation model to the molecular parameter τ e of the dual constraint model, thereby allowing the parameter K {{to be related to}} molecular characteristics such as the monomeric friction coefficient ζ. Once K (or τ e) are determined from data for monodisperse polymers, the double reptation model predicts that for fixed weight-average molecular weight M w, the zero-shear viscosity η 0 increases slightly with increasing polydispersity M w /M n for log normal distributions, while for the dual constraint model η 0 is almost independent of M w /M n. Experimental data for polystyrenes show no increase (or even a slight decrease) in η 0 with increasing M w /M n at fixed M w, indicating a deficiency in the double reptation model. The dual constraint theory is also applied to hydrogenated polybutadienes and commercial <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylenes,</b> where we believe {{it can be used to}} indicate the presence of long side branches, which are difficult to detect by other analytic methods...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{blown film}} resins for the {{production}} of films that exhibit the toughness properties of LLDPE with the stiffness and tensile characteristics of HDPE has historically been difficult to achieve for both resin producers and film converters. Resin producers have attempted to push the density higher for LLDPE film resins and lower for HDPE film resins. Separately, film producers are continuously searching for the same hybrid film through blending low, linear low, medium and <b>high-density</b> <b>polyethylenes.</b> Producing successful film blends for heavy-duty applications with densities over 0. 918 g/cc usually results in a high performance LLDPE film resin blended with low levels of a MDPE or HDPE. As the level of MDPE or HDPE increases, loss of critical toughness properties such as machine direction tear (MD tear) and dart impact strength is observed. There now exists a novel method of producing films that possess a full density range between 0. 918 g/cc and 0. 938 g/cc. This approach is based on the utilization of a new family of lower density, high molecular weight medium density (HMW-MDPE) film resins. Blending a HMW-HDPE with a resin density of 0. 938 g/cc with high performance LLDPE film resins, films can be fabricated over a wide range of densities without the loss of tear and impact properties. These blends can be produced at thin or thick gauge on either high stalk or conventional blown film equipment...|$|R
