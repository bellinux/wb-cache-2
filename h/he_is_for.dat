5|$|NASCAR, {{and stock}} car racing in general, {{has its roots}} in bootlegging during Prohibition. Junior Johnson was one of many bootleggers {{who took part in the}} sport during the 1950s, equally well known for his arrest in 1955 for {{operating}} his father's moonshine still as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> his racing success. He ended up spending a year in an Ohio prison, but soon returned to the sport before retiring as a driver in 1966.|$|E

In his hometown - the castle town Hagi in western Japan - he is still remembered as a mystical and energetic hero, who put all his efforts into opening the way to modernization, westernization and reforms, not only in military matters but in political and social matters as well.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with the School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California in 2010, Chao expressed his opinions about topics such as the effects of economic globalization on social inequality. He explained how he believes that the global market is causing social inequality, and how issues in education and immigration are connected to this. In this interview he expressed a worry that mafias are the greatest threat to democracy and that this is already evident in certain places, like Russia and Mexico. He stated that this is one reason that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> the legalization of drugs such as Marijuana - he explained that mafias are making capital off of the distribution of illegal drugs which gives them more economic power, thus making it easier for them to potentially overthrow governments.|$|E
25|$|After Matei secured {{his throne}} in 1633, Elena turned to {{cultural}} endeavors, {{one of the}} principal sponsors and promoters of early Romanian literature. Udriște, a Logethete of the court in 1632, partook directly in her experiment. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> instance credited with having helped the princely couple set up three printing presses, at Câmpulung, Dealu Monastery, and Băile Govora. As Logothete, he directed the Chancellery, which issued some 1,300 documents during his tenure, all of them surviving. His correspondence attests links with intellectuals of various faiths: the Orthodox Gavrilo Rajić, Macarios Zaim, Peter Mogila, and Meletios Sirigos; and the Catholic Rafael Levaković, with whom he discussed the Nicene Creed. He also had oratorical duels with Constantin Cantacuzino, with bishops Varlaam Moțoc and Ștefan I, as well as with his sister the Princess.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E

2500|$|Obviously, such a {{character}} discrepancy {{can create a}} problem for productions of the play. As {{an example of one}} way in which productions can resolve the problem, in Act 1, Scene 1 of the 1981 BBC Shakespeare adaptation, Montague is not present in either the persona of Salisbury or that of John Neville. As such, his first two lines, [...] "Good brother, as thou lov'st and honour'st arms,/Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus" [...] (ll.117–118), are reassigned to Clarence and altered to [...] "Set it on your head good father/If thou lov'st and honour'st arms,/Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus." [...] Montague's second line, [...] "And I unto the sea from when I came" [...] (l.210), is entirely absent. As {{a character}}, Montague is then introduced in Act 1, Scene 2, played by Michael Byrne (as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the production). His first line in this scene however, [...] "But I have reasons strong and forcible" [...] (l.3) is reassigned to Clarence. Later, when York is giving his men instructions, his order to Montague, [...] "Brother, thou shalt to London presently" [...] (l.36) is changed to [...] "Cousin, thou shalt to London presently", and York's reiteration of the order [...] "My brother Montague shall post to London" [...] (l.54) is changed to [...] "Hast you to London my cousin Montague." [...] Additionally, Montague's [...] "Brother, I go, I'll win them, fear it not" [...] (l.60) is changed to [...] "Cousin, I go, I'll win them, fear it not." [...] This all serves to establish a single figure who is York's cousin and Warwick's brother (i.e. John Neville).|$|E
