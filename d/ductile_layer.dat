40|$|Previous {{studies of}} glacial^isostatic {{adjustment}} have usually considered earth models with a purely elastic lithosphere. A possibly signi¢cant deviation from this assumption {{is the presence}} of a ductile crustal layer embedded in an otherwise elastic lithosphere. Such a layer has been suggested for various continental regions on the basis of seismic and tectonic evidence. The present study investigates the implications of a ductile crustal layer for the interpretation of glacial^isostatic adjustment using a layered, incompressible Maxwell viscoelastic earth model and a simpli¢ed representation of the Fennoscandian glaciation. The relaxation-time and amplitude spectra show that, besides the conventional buoyancy mode M 0 also present in earth models with a purely elastic lithosphere, the <b>ductile</b> <b>layer</b> supports a slowly decaying mode MC, which is capable of modifying the deformation markedly. Thus, measures of the absolute deformation such as the stress clearly re£ect the presence of the <b>ductile</b> <b>layer.</b> In contrast to this are measures of the relative deformation such as the vertical displacement rate and the rate of gravity change. To a good approximation, these rates are inversely proportional to the relaxation time of the more quickly decaying mode M 0, and are, therefore, less a¡ected by the <b>ductile</b> <b>layer.</b> Taken together, the present study suggests that, provided a ductile crustal layer exists, its presence should be accounted for in interpretations of the glacial^isostatic adjustment following the Fennoscandian or smaller glaciations. Key words: crustal deformation, glacial rebound, lithospheric £exure, viscoelasticity. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLocalized or {{distributed}} deformations in {{continental lithosphere}} {{are supposed to}} be triggered by rheological contrasts, and particularly by brittle-ductile coupling. A plane-strain 2 D finite-element model is used to investigate the mechanical role of a <b>ductile</b> <b>layer</b> in defining the transition from localized to distributed fracturing in a brittle layer. The coupling is performed through the shortening of a Von Mises elasto-visco-plastic layer rimed by two ductile layers. By increasing the viscosity of the ductile layers by only one order of magnitude, the fracturing mode in the brittle layer evolves from localized (few faults) to distributed (numerous faults), defining a viscosity-dependent fracturing mode. This brittle-ductile coupling {{can be explained by the}} viscous resistance of the <b>ductile</b> <b>layer</b> to fault motion, which limits the maximum displacement rate along any fault connected to the ductile interface. An increase of the viscosity will thus make necessary new faults nucleation to accommodate the boundary shortening rate...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for flexural modulus of laminated composites derived from the analysis of a flexural-section composed of several <b>ductile</b> and brittle <b>layers</b> of different moduli. The derivation {{is based on the}} assumption that the tension and compression zones of the laminated composite are symmetrical with respect to the neutral axis and thus, half of the section is needed to analyze for complete derivation of flexural modulus of the whole section. This composed of two <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> of higher moduli providing in both tension and compression zones to maintain the equilibrium conditions during flexure. The formulation shows that the flexural modulus of the entire section of laminated composites obtained by this method is equal to the modulus of <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> plus a factor of the difference of modulus of <b>ductile</b> and brittle <b>layers.</b> It is concluded that this factor is different from the usual one which is obtained under uniaxial loadings. Despite the fragile nature of brittle layers of the composite, it has been found that the inclusion of two <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> into the laminated cementitious composites makes it fully ductile material owing to the synergetic action between the layers of two components...|$|R

The results indicate that in laminated composites, void nucleation and growth ahead of the cracks occur at a much faster rate due to evolution of much higher stress values at the interface region. For delaminating crack cases, the fracture behavior is strongly influenced by the delamination length. The resistance of the <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> to crack extension can be significantly reduced by short delamination lengths...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{structures}} of three deep seismic profiles {{in the continental}} margin in the northern South China Sea are calculated, their "thermal" lithospheric thicknesses are evaluated based on the basalt dry solidus, and their rheological structures are evaluated with linear frictional failure criterion and power-law creep equation. "Thermal" lithosphere is about 90 km in thickness in shelf area, and thins toward the slope, lowers to 60 - 65 km in the lower slope, ocean crust and Xisha Trough. In the mid-west of the studied area, the lithospheric rheological structure in shelf area and Xisha Islands is of four layers: brittle, ductile, brittle and ductile. Because of uprising of heat mantle and thinning of crust and lithosphere in Xisha Trough, {{the bottom of the}} upper brittle layer is only buried at 16 km. In the eastern area, the bottom of the upper brittle layer in the north is buried at 20 km or so, while in lower slope and ocean crust, the rheological structure is of two layers of brittle and ductile, and crust and uppermost mantle form one whole brittle layer whose bottom is buried at 30 - 32 km. Analyses show that the characteristics of rheological structure accord with the seismic result observed. The character of rheological stratification implies that before the extension of the continent margin, there likely was a <b>ductile</b> <b>layer</b> in mid-lower crust. The influence of the existence of <b>ductile</b> <b>layer</b> to the evolution of the continent margin and the different extensions of <b>ductile</b> <b>layer</b> and brittle layer should not be overlooked.

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} coupling between brittle and <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> {{in the continental}} lithosphere produces rheological contrasts, which are supposed to trigger localized or distributed mode of faulting. A plane-strain 2 D finite-element model is used to highlight the mechanical role of the brittle­ductile coupling in defining the patterns of fracturing. The coupling is performed through the shortening of a Von Mises elastoviscoplastic layer rimmed by two <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> behaving as Newtonian incompressible fluids. By varying the viscosity of the <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> or the amount of softening in the brittle layer, the fracturing mode evolves from localized to distributed. The mechanics of brittle­ductile coupling is explained by the limitation of the fault displacement rate imposed by both brittle and ductile rheologies. On these bases, an analytical approach is presented in order to estimate the maximum velocity along each fault permitted by both brittle and ductile media. This velocity is then compared to the velocity required by the boundary shortening rate. If the velocity in the fault is not large enough, {{the development of new}} faults is necessary. From this analysis, we define four fracturing modes in a brittle­ductile media: the localized mode with the onset of a few large faults, the distributed mode with very dense fault patterns, and finally, the ductile-control mode and the brittle-control mode, where the number of faults increases with an increase in the ductile viscosity and a decrease in the brittle softening respectivel...|$|R

For Cu/Fe and Fe/Cu multilayers, the Cu layers accommodate the majority of plastic deformation, and the geometry constraints imposed by Fe layers exaggerates the bulging in the Cu layers. However, the existence of <b>ductile</b> Cu <b>layers</b> does not improve the overall ductility of Cu/Fe and Fe/Cu multilayers. Cracking in the Fe layers directly lead to the failure of the multilayer micropillars, although the Cu layers have very good ductility.

50|$|Strength {{envelopes}} {{indicate that}} the rheological structure of the lithosphere underneath the foreland and the orogen are very different. The foreland basin typically shows a thermal and rheological structure similar to a rifted continental margin with three brittle <b>layers</b> above three <b>ductile</b> <b>layers.</b> The temperature underneath the orogen is much higher and thus greatly weakens the lithosphere. According to Zhou et al. (2003), “under compressional stress the lithosphere beneath the mountain range becomes ductile almost entirely, except a thin (about 6 km in the center) brittle layer near the surface and perhaps a thin brittle layer in the uppermost mantle.” This lithospheric weakening underneath the orogenic belt may in part cause the regional lithospheric flexure behavior.|$|R
40|$|Inferences from {{analogue}} models support lithospheric folding as {{the primary}} response to large-scale shortening manifested in the present day topography of Iberia. This process was active from the late Oligocene-early Miocene during the Alpine orogeny and was probably enhanced by reactivation of inherited Variscan faults. The modeling results confirm the dependence of fold wavelength on convergence rate and hence {{the strength of the}} layers of the lithosphere such that fold wavelength is longest for fast convergence rates favoring whole lithosphere folding. Folding is associated with the formation of dominantly pop-up type mountain ranges in the brittle crust and thickening of the <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> in the synforms of the buckle folds by flow. The mountain ranges are represented by upper crustal pop-ups forming the main topographic relief. The wavelengths of the topographic uplifts, both, in model and nature suggest mechanical decoupling between crust and mantle. Moreover, our modeling results suggest that buckling in Iberia took place under rheological conditions where the lithospheric mantle is stronger than the lower crust. The presence of an indenter, inducing oblique shortening in response to the opening of the King's Trough in the north western corner of the Atlantic Iberian margin controls the spacing and obliquity of structures. This leads to the transfer of the deformation from the moving walls towards the inner part of the model, creating oblique structures in both brittle and <b>ductile</b> <b>layers.</b> The effect of the indenter, together with an increase on the convergence rate produced more complex brittle structures. These results show close similarities to observations on the general shape and distribution of mountain ranges and basins in Iberia, including the Spanish Central System and Toledo Mountains.

The main results highlight the presence of two seismogenic volumes characterized by markedly different stress patterns. The two volumes are separated by a layer where the seismic strain release shows a significant decrease. Previous studies postulated the existence, {{at about the same}} depth, of a <b>ductile</b> <b>layer</b> allowing the spreading of the Mount Vesuvius edifice. We interpreted the difference in the stress pattern within the two volumes as the effect of a mechanical decoupling caused by the aforementioned <b>ductile</b> <b>layer.</b> The stress pattern in the top volume is dominated by a reverse faulting style, which agrees with the hypothesis of a seismicity driven by the spreading process. This agrees also with the persistent character of the seismicity located within this volume. Conversely, the stress field determined for the deep volume is consistent with a background regional field locally perturbed by the effects of the topography and of heterogeneities in the volcanic structure. Since the seismicity of the deep volume shows an intermittent behavior and has shown to be linked to geochemical variations in the fumaroles of the volcano, we hypothesize that it results from the effect of fluid injection episodes, possibly of magmatic origin, perturbing the pore pressure within the hydrothermal system...|$|E

The rate-independent version of the Gurson model that accounts for microvoid nucleation, growth and coalescence is employed to represent the behaviour of the metal layer. The competition between two different ductile failure mechanisms, namely, far-field triaxiality-induced cavitation and classical near-tip void coalescence, is investigated in detail for different extents of mode mixity.

50|$|The {{behavior}} of chevron folds are effectively {{controlled by the}} characteristics of the stratigraphy under deformation. Ideally, beds should alternate between high competence and low competence. The stability of chevron folding stringently requires regular thickness in the high-competence layers; conversely, regularity in low competence layers has been found to have very little effect on stability. The length of the bed and the thickness of competent beds further determines the structural stability. A 1:10 ratio between the thickness of competent beds and the length appears to be the threshold required for the formation of chevron folds. Smaller ratios require too much flow in the more <b>ductile</b> <b>layers.</b> Given high length to thickness and low high-competency to low-competency thickness ratios, irregularities in the thickness of the high-competence beds can be accommodated.

A Lennard-Jones-type potential is employed to describe the nonlinear dynamic interaction of each macroscopic-size particle with its nearest-neighbors. Crack initiation and propagation is investigated for materials with different Young’s modulus, tensile strength and varying ductility.

The models deformed in free and boundary-controlled gravity spreading conditions that simulate the development of wide rift-type and core complex-type structures. In models, the development of structures mainly depends on boundary velocity and therefore on bulk strain rate. Wide rifts are of tilted block-type at high strain rate and of horst- and graben-type at low strain rate. The development of metamorphic core complex-type structures is enhanced by low strain rates and by the presence of weak heterogeneities within the ductile crust.

Here we investigate continental deformation by solving the fully coupled energy, momentum and continuum equations. We show that this approach produces unexpected feedback processes, leading to a significantly weaker dynamic strength evolution. In our model, stress localization focused on the brittle-ductile transition leads to the spontaneous development of mid-crustal detachment faults immediately above the strongest crustal layer. We also find that an additional decoupling layer forms between the lower crust and mantle. Our results explain the development of decoupling layers that are observed to accommodate hundreds of kilometres of horizontal motions during continental deformation...|$|R
40|$|Lithospheric-scale {{analogue}} {{models are}} used to analyse the parameters controlling the typical evolution of deformation during continental narrow rifting, characterized by early activation of large boundary faults and basin subsidence, followed by localization of tectonic activity in internal faults at the rift axis. Integration of current and previous experiments shows that the evolution of deformation, in particular the amount of extension needed for the abandonment of boundary faults and migration of deformation to in-rift faults, is dependent on at least five boundary conditions: (i) thickness of brittle layers (including syn-rift sediments); (ii) thickness of ductile layers; (iii) extension rate; (iv) width of the weak zone localizing extension; and (v) rift obliquity {{with respect to the}} extension direction. An increase in the amount of extension corresponding to the inward migration of faulting (i. e., a longer phase of slip on boundary faults) is observed for (a) an increase in the thickness of both brittle and <b>ductile</b> crustal <b>layers</b> and syn-rift sediment accumulation, (b) a decrease in extension rate and width of the weak zone, and (c) a decrease in rift obliquity. A unified account of these correlations is presented, based on the hypothesis that fault migration occurs when boundary faults can no longer accommodate the imposed bulk extension, leading to time-space variations of internal strain and strain rate (and consequently stress) in the <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> which overcome the total resistance of brittle layers to thoroughgoing faulting...|$|R
40|$|Analogue {{models were}} {{employed}} to investigate continental collision addressing the roles of (1) a suture zone separating different crustal blocks, (2) mid-crustal weak layers and (3) mantle strengths. These models confirmed that low-amplitude lithospheric and crustal buckling is the primary response to shortening with a wavelength mainly controlled by the strong upper crust and/or lithospheric mantle. With increasing shortening, bivergent thrusts formed across the brittle layers (equivalent to upper crust) at inflection points of the buckles while <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> (lower crust and mantle) continued being folded. The resulting geometries displayed pop-ups and pop-downs above the boundaries (sutures) between blocks. Further shortening led to wider, thrust-bounded deformation zones (∑-belts) {{in front of the}} stronger blocks identified as "effective indenters". During shortening upward extrusion into ∑-belts allowed exhumation of deep material. Weak layers enhanced strain localisation.

40|$|International audienceWe {{have used}} {{existing}} apparatus, {{in the experimental}} modelling laboratory at Geosciences-Rennes, to investigate whether flat-lying detachment faults can appear and persist {{at the base of}} a layer of ductile evaporite, during the development of a thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belt. Possible applications are to fold belts in Southern Tunisia or in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Our experimental models consisted primarily of quartz sand, which failed according to a linear Coulomb envelope. The angle of internal friction was about 40 and the cohesion was about 10 Pa. In the absence of fluid flow, models consisting of pure sand responded to horizontal shortening by forming Coulomb wedges, in which deformation propagated sequentially, away from an advancing piston. To simulate fluid flow through pore space in nature, we drove compressed air upward through the models, from an underlying reservoir. As in previously published experimental work, the resulting Darcy flow and seepage forces reduced the apical angle of the thrust wedge and facilitated basal detachment. More complex models included a layer of ductile silicone putty, which simulated an evaporite in nature. The viscosity of the silicone (about 104 Pa s) set the time scale for the experiments. We studied two configurations, in which the maximal overpressure was either beneath a single <b>ductile</b> <b>layer,</b> or between two such layers. In both configurations, as maximal overpressure approached lithostatic values, so detachment faults appeared and persisted at the bases of the ductile layers, even though some ductile deformation occurred simultaneously within these layers. For models where maximal overpressure was between two ductile layers, detachment occurred at the base of the upper <b>ductile</b> <b>layer.</b> As for models of pure sand, the overpressure and detachments led to smaller apical angles for the Coulomb wedges and to larger spacing between thrust faults and hanging-wall anticlines. In the experiments, the location and efficiency of detachments appeared to depend strongly on local variations in thickness and possibly in permeability of the overburden. On comparing our models with structures in Southern Tunisia or in the Gulf of Mexico, we find strong similarities, which lead us to suspect that detachment is indeed possible {{at the base of a}}n evaporite sequence in nature. This conclusion has strong implications, not only for the understanding of petroleum systems, but also for better management of petroleum production from sedimentary basins...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSeveral compressional contexts, such {{as those}} {{involving}} juvenile or thickened crust, {{are expected to be}} associated with rather hot lithospheres whose mechanical behaviour remains poorly documented. In this paper, we present a series of analogue models dedicated to compression of lithospheres characterized by a thin upper brittle crust overlying a weak ductile crust and a ductile sub-Moho mantle. The models show that (1) deformation is controlled by the <b>ductile</b> <b>layers</b> that undergo distributed thickening, (2) thrust systems are limited to the upper brittle crust, (3) thrusting induces burial and stacking of upper crust pop-downs. The overall deformation patterns can be basically interpreted in terms of pop-down thrusting of the brittle crust and pure-shear type ductile flow of crust and mantle. Moreover, the models show that the sinking of supracrustal units does not require inverse density profiles but can be simply driven by compression. Model deformation patterns are consistent with those shared by many ancient belts, including not only Archaean granite–greenstone belts, but also more generally Paleoproterozoic ones. They provide also insights on deformation modes that may characterize modern thickened and abnormally hot domains like High Plateaus...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{conceptual}} growth {{models for}} faults in layered sequences suggest that faults first localise in strong, and brittle, layers and are later linked in weak, and <b>ductile,</b> <b>layers.</b> We use the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for modelling {{the growth of}} a normal fault in a brittle/ductile multilayer sequence. The modelling reveals that faults in brittle/ductile sequences at low confining pressure and high strength contrast localise first as Mode I fractures in the brittle layers. Low amplitude monoclinal folding prior to failure is accommodated by ductile flow in the weak layers. The initially vertically segmented fault arrays are later linked via shallow dipping faults in the weak layers. Faults localise, therefore, as geometrically and kinematically coherent arrays of fault segments in which abandoned fault tips or splays are a product of the strain localisation process and do not necessarily indicate linkage of initially isolated faults. The modelling suggests that fault tip lines in layered sequences are more advanced in the strong layers compared to weak layers, where the difference in propagation distance is most likely related to strength and/or ductility contrast. Layer dependent variations in fault propagation rates generate fringed rather than smooth fault tip lines in multilayers...|$|R
