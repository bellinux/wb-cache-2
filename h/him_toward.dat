5|$|Ahidjo {{stepped down}} on 4 November 1982 and left power to his {{constitutional}} successor, Paul Biya. However, Ahidjo remained {{in control of}} the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed coup d'état nudged <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> the leadership style of his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{busy with}} The Gates of Hell, Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an {{opportunity}} to create a historical monument for the town of Calais. For a monument to French author Honoré de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met {{with varying degrees of}} disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> fame.|$|E
5|$|Even before Haywood {{first became}} an {{official}} with the Western Federation of Miners, {{he was convinced that}} the system under which working people toiled was unjust. He described the execution of the Haymarket leaders in 1887 as a turning point in his life, predisposing <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> membership in the largest organization of the day, the Knights of Labor. Haywood had watched men die in unsafe mine tunnels, and had marched with Kelly's Army. He had suffered a serious hand injury in the mines, and found that his only support came from other miners. When Haywood listened to Ed Boyce of the WFM addressing a group of miners in 1896, he discovered radical unionism and welcomed it.|$|E

5|$|In a {{twist on}} The Mansion of Happiness, McLoughlin Brothers and Parker Brothers {{released}} several {{games in the}} late 1880s based on the then-popular Algeresque rags to riches theme. Games such as Game of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded, Messenger Boy, Game of the Telegraph Boy, and The Office Boy allowed players to emulate the successful capitalist. Players began these games as company underlings, newbies, or gofers, and, with luck, won {{the game with a}} seat in the President's Office (rather than a seat in Heaven, as in The Mansion of Happiness) or as Head of the Firm. In Parker Brothers' The Office Boy, spaces designating carelessness, inattentiveness, and dishonesty sent the player back on the track while spaces designating capability, earnestness, and honesty advanced <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> the goal. Such games reflected the belief that the enterprising American– regardless of his background, humble or privileged– would be rewarded under the American capitalist system, and insinuated that success was equated with increased social status via the accumulation of wealth.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead {{were largely}} {{inactive}} following their 1997–1998 tour; after its end, their only public performance in 1998 {{was at an}} Amnesty International concert in Paris. Yorke later said that during that period the band came close to splitting up, {{and that he had}} developed severe depression. In early 1999, Radiohead began work on a follow-up to OK Computer. Although the album's success meant there was no longer any pressure or a deadline from their record label, tension during this period was high. Band members all had different visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke experienced writer's block, influencing <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> a more abstract, fragmented form of songwriting. Radiohead secluded themselves with producer Nigel Godrich in studios in Paris, Copenhagen, and Gloucester, and in their newly completed studio in Oxford. Eventually, all the members agreed on a new musical direction, redefining their instrumental roles. After nearly 18 months, Radiohead's recording sessions were completed in April 2000.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald's {{visits to}} Long Island's south shore and his {{experience}} attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsbys setting. Today, {{there are a}} number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party. Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success. Like Nick in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich. In many ways, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> everything he despised.|$|E
5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E

25|$|In 1914 Marshak and {{his wife}} worked with {{children}} of Jewish refugees in Voronezh. The death of Marshak's young daughter in 1915 directed <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> children's literature. In 1920 he moved to Ekaterinodar (now Krasnodar) to head the province's orphanages {{and it was there}} that he and a group of enthusiasts, including Elena Vasilieva, organized Children's town that included a children's theater, library, and studios. For this theater, he co-wrote plays that later became the book Theater for Children.|$|E
25|$|In October 1885, Freud went to Paris on a {{fellowship}} {{to study with}} Jean-Martin Charcot, a renowned neurologist who was conducting scientific research into hypnosis.

Charcot specialized {{in the study of}} hysteria and susceptibility to hypnosis, which he frequently demonstrated with patients on stage in front of an audience.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, Norris {{made his}} acting {{debut in the}} Dean Martin film The Wrecking Crew. At a martial arts {{demonstration}} in Long Beach, Norris met the martial artist Bruce Lee. In 1972, he acted as Lee's nemesis in the movie Way of the Dragon (titled Return of the Dragon in its U.S. distribution), which is widely credited with launching <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> stardom. In Asia, Norris is still known primarily for this role. In 1974, McQueen encouraged him to begin acting classes at MGM.|$|E
25|$|Nationalism and {{the rise}} of the Know Nothing Party or American Party was a feature of Louisiana {{politics}} in the 1850s. Whig newspapers tried to discredit Hébert by starting rumors of his allegiance with the Know Nothings. He still appointed some Whigs to minor offices and some Know Nothings to lucrative posts. He was considered very independent in his appointments and many Democrats were disenchanted with <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> the end of his administration. Hébert was mentioned as a possible candidate for the U. S. Senate, but John Slidell was not vulnerable to an intraparty challenge.|$|E
25|$|Dolphy {{was born}} in Los Angeles to Eric Allan Dolphy, Sr. and Sadie Dolphy, who immigrated to the United States from Panama. He picked up the {{clarinet}} {{at the age of}} six, and {{in less than a month}} was playing in the school's orchestra. He also learned the oboe in junior high school, though he never recorded on the instrument. Hearing Fats Waller, Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins led <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> jazz, and he picked up the saxophone and flute while in high school. His father built a studio for Eric in their backyard, and Eric often had friends come by to jam; recordings with Clifford Brown from this studio document this early time.|$|E

25|$|Smith's {{interest}} in novel forms of entertainment led <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> early experiments with motion picture film, and in 1897 he began making short films on the St. Ann's Well grounds. By {{the time of}} Smith's foray into filmmaking, Bayley had had wide experience in comic acting for pantomime and revues, and Smith drew extensively on her knowledge of visual humor and audience tastes. She played lead roles in many of his most significant films, including Hanging out the Clothes (1897), Santa Claus (1898), Cinderella (1898), The Kiss in the Tunnel (1899), As Seen Through the Telescope (1900), Let Me Dream Again (1900), Dorothy's Dream (1900), and Mary Jane's Mishap (1903). Bayley also appeared in some of Smith's 1906 and 1908 tests of the color-film process Kinemacolor.|$|E
25|$|As Australian number 8 Steve Tuynman {{took the}} ball {{from the back of}} the scrum, he searched for Nick Farr-Jones, utilising the blind under Alan Jones' command. Farr-Jones {{occupied}} Campese opposite winger and passed the ball to him, allowing Campese to run along the left wing. At the start of his run, Campese ran past Butler, who was unable to make the defending tackle. But Campese's run was not over yet, he swerved past the Welsh fullback, and executed a wonderful sidestep to get past the Welsh inside center. Campese's sidestep led <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> a group of defenders, so he then offloaded to Simon Poidevin, who quickly passed the ball to Michael Lynagh who scored an easy try under the post. Australia won 28–9 in one of their greatest victories at the time.|$|E
