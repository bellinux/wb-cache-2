5|$|Some golden jackals carry {{diseases}} and parasites harmful to human health. These include rabies, and Donovan's Leishmania that is harmless to jackals but may cause leishmaniasis in people. Jackals in southwestern Tajikistan can carry up to 16 species of parasitic cestodes (flatworm), roundworms, and acanthocephalans (thorny-headed worms), these being: Sparganum mansoni, Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, Taenia hydatigena, T.pisiformis, Taenia ovis, Hydatigera taeniaeformis, Dipylidium caninum, Mesocestoides lineatus, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Dioctophyma renale, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, <b>Dracunculus</b> medinensis, Filariata and Macracanthorhynchus catulinum. Jackals infected with <b>Dracunculus</b> medinensis can infect {{bodies of water}} with their eggs, which cause dracunculiasis in people who drink from them. Jackals may also play a large part in spreading coenurosis in sheep and cattle, and canine distemper in dogs. In Tajikistan, jackals carry at least 12 tick species (which include Ixodes, Rhipicephalus turanicus, R. leporis, R. rossicus, R. sanguineus, R. pumilio, R. schulzei, Hyalomma anatolicum, H. scupense and H. asiaticum), four flea species (Pulex irritans, Xenopsylla nesokiae, Ctenocephanlides canis and C. felis), and one species of louse (Trichodectes canis).|$|E

25|$|<b>Dracunculus</b> medinensis, a {{parasitic}} worm which causes the disease dracunculiasis, is now close to eradication thanks to efforts {{led by the}} Carter Center.|$|E
2500|$|Copepods also host <b>Dracunculus</b> medinensis, the Guinea worm {{nematode}} {{that causes}} dracunculiasis disease in humans. [...] This disease may {{be close to}} being eradicated through efforts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.|$|E
2500|$|In humans, {{the only}} known cause is <b>Dracunculus</b> medinensis. The worm is about one to two {{millimeters}} wide, and an adult female is 60 to 100 centimeters long (males are much shorter at [...] ). Outside of humans, the young form can survive up to three weeks, during which they must be eaten by water fleas to continue to develop. The larva inside water fleas may survive up to four months. Thus, {{in order for the}} disease to remain in an area, it must occur each year in humans. A diagnosis of the disease can usually be made based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015 {{there were}} 22 {{reported}} cases of the disease while in 2016 there were 25. This is down from an estimated 3.5 million cases in 1986. In 2016 the disease occurred in three countries, all in Africa, down from 20 countries in the 1980s. It will likely be the first parasitic disease to be globally eradicated. Guinea worm disease has been known since ancient times. It is mentioned in the Egyptian medical Ebers Papyrus, dating from 1550BC. The name dracunculiasis {{is derived from the}} Latin [...] "affliction with little dragons", while the name [...] "guinea worm" [...] appeared after Europeans saw the disease on the Guinea coast of West Africa in the 17th century. Other <b>Dracunculus</b> species are known to infect various mammals, but do not appear to infect humans. Dracunculiasis is classified as a neglected tropical disease. Because dogs may also become infected, the eradication program is monitoring and treating dogs as well.|$|E
2500|$|Helminths are {{transmitted}} to the final host in several ways. The most common infection is through ingestion of contaminated vegetables, drinking water, and raw or undercooked meat. Contaminated food may contain eggs of nematodes such as Ascaris, Enterobius, [...] and Trichuris; cestodes such as Taenia, Hymenolepis, and Echinococcus; and treamtodes such as Fasciola. Raw or undercooked meats are the major sources of Taenia (pork, beef and venison), Trichinella (pork and bear), Diphyllobothrium (fish), Clonorchis (fish), and Paragonimus (crustaceans). Schistosomes and nematodes such as hookworms (Ancylostoma and Necator) and Strongyloides can penetrate the skin directly. Finally, Wuchereria, Onchocerca, and <b>Dracunculus</b> {{are transmitted}} by mosquitoes and flies. In the developing world, the use of contaminated water is a major risk factor for infection. Infection can also take place through the practice of geophagy, which is not uncommon in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Soil is eaten, for example, by children or pregnant women to counteract a real or perceived deficiency of minerals in their diet.|$|E
50|$|The species <b>Dracunculus</b> medinensis which infects humans, {{requires}} a human host to reproduce. Thus {{the elimination of}} human infection {{will lead to the}} extinction of <b>Dracunculus</b> medinensis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dracunculus</b> vulgaris is {{a species}} of aroid in the genus <b>Dracunculus</b> and is known {{variously}} as the common <b>dracunculus,</b> dragon arum, the black arum, the voodoo lily, the snake lily, the stink lily, the black dragon, the black lily, dragonwort, and ragons. In Greece, part of its native range, the plant is called drakondia, the long spadix being viewed as a small dragon hiding in the spathe.|$|E

50|$|Dracunculiasis, {{also called}} Guinea worm disease, is a painful and {{disabling}} parasitic disease {{caused by a}} worm, <b>Dracunculus</b> medinensis.

50|$|All {{three species}} look {{extremely}} similar. However, in P. cisternarum {{the eyes are}} tiny, while P. <b>dracunculus</b> and P. sanguijuela lack eyes altogether.

50|$|<b>Dracunculus</b> is a genus of spiruroid {{nematode}} parasites in {{the family}} Dracunculidae. Some species infest humans and alter their hosts’ behaviour {{in a way that}} supports the worm’s reproductive cycle. <b>Dracunculus</b> causes a blister to form on the host, often on the foot or lower leg, causing severe pain and a boiling sensation. This will cause the human host to dip the affected area in water to soothe the pain which will cause the blister to burst, allowing reproductive larvae into the water where they can await the next host to infect.|$|E
