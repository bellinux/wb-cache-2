5|$|Equipping the Salt Wells Pilot Plant {{involved}} its own challenges. Some facilities {{had to be}} fabricated for the purpose. Some <b>items</b> <b>were</b> hard to locate, {{while others}} were in short supply in the wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where <b>items</b> <b>were</b> made who designated them for use by Project Camel. Groves felt that his fears about excessive safety were realized: reinforced concrete, blast proof doors and electrical shielding drove up costs. In the end, after 115 days, the first explosives were melted, mixed and poured on 25 July 1945.|$|E

5000|$|... 'A' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> very {{important}} for an organization. Because of the high value of these 'A' items, frequent value analysis is required. In addition to that, an organization needs to choose an appropriate order pattern (e.g. ‘Just- in- time’) to avoid excess capacity. 'B' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> important, but of course less important than 'A' items and more important than 'C' items. Therefore, 'B' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> intergroup <b>items.</b> 'C' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> marginally important.|$|R

5|$|Luxury <b>items</b> <b>were</b> in {{high demand}} among the {{increasingly}} prosperous nobility, {{and to a lesser}} degree among the wealthy town merchants. Brick and stone residential buildings became common, but only in cities. The mature Gothic style was represented not only in architecture, but also in sacral wooden sculpture.

5|$|When {{exploiting}} distant {{food sources}} found in clearings, grey jays were observed temporarily concentrating their caches in an arboreal site {{along the edge}} of a black spruce forest in interior Alaska.
