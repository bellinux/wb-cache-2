60|$|Then, {{without giving}} us any further {{opportunity}} of speaking, Bausi rose, {{and followed by}} Imbozwi and his councillors, marched off into his big hut. We too, were marched off, this time under a <b>double</b> guard <b>commanded</b> by someone whom I had not seen before. At {{the gate of the}} kraal we halted and asked for the arms that had been taken from us. No answer was given; only the soldiers put their hands upon our shoulders and thrust us along.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, the <b>Command</b> <b>doubled</b> as NATO, Commander-in-Chief United Kingdom Air Forces (UKAIR). UKAIR was {{fell under}} NATO's Allied Command Europe in Mons in Belgium. In case {{of war with}} the Warsaw Pact the command would have {{commanded}} all Royal Air Force units in the United Kingdom {{as well as the}} US Air Force's Third Air Force based at RAF Mildenhall with its subordinate wings and squadrons. Reinforcements coming from the continental United States, as well as units transitioning to other European fronts, would have also come under UKAIR.|$|R
50|$|In 1849 Changarnier {{received}} the grand cross of the Legion of Honour. An avowed enemy of republican institutions, {{he held a}} unique position in upholding {{the power of the}} president; but in January 1851 he opposed Louis Napoleon's policy, was in consequence deprived of his <b>double</b> <b>command,</b> and at the coup d'état in December was arrested and sent to Mazas, until his banishment from France by the decree of January 9, 1852.|$|E
5000|$|According to Jewish law, a {{dead person}} must be quickly buried and burial {{requires}} covering in earth. This law is derived from Devarim (Deuteronomy) 21:23 [...] "Bury, you will bury him the same day; for the (unburied body) is a curse to God" [...] the <b>double</b> <b>command</b> to bury causing a positive commandment to entomb in the earth and a negative commandment forbidding leaving an unburied body. The legal text Shulchan Aruch brings a case example explaining that even {{if a person is}} known to have drowned in a closed body of water such as a small pond where there can be certainty that the victim had not somehow survived, the family does not begin ritual mourning and remains in extended state of most intense mourning aninut until either the body is found or after an exhaustive search despairs of recovering and burying the body. This shows that the body is considered unburied when underwater; as shiva mourning normally only begins after burial. B'resheit(Genesis) 3:19 states [...] "With the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, until you return to the ground, from (dust) you were taken and you are dust, and to dust you will return." [...] From this we see that the only proper treatment of a dead body is to physically cover it with earth once land is available for the crew to bury the body, rather than to leave the body at sea or some other fate such as cremation.|$|E
30|$|The {{operation}} of storage {{needs to be}} done based on a plan, and sometimes in combination with the picking process when the warehouse is working under <b>double</b> <b>command</b> operation. The estimation of average traveling time for multi-aisle AS/RS [59], sequencing the storage and picking in AS/RS system [60], scheduling the equipment in AS/RS system [61] and sequencing of storage and re-storage process [58] is among the published works in this field.|$|E
50|$|Three {{weeks after}} {{returning}} to Hawaii with his brigade, Healy was recalled to Vietnam to command the 5th Special Forces Group, and also to mend {{the reputation of the}} Green Berets, after the widely publicized murder of a <b>double</b> agent. Healy <b>commanded</b> the 5th Special Forces group for nearly twenty months before returning to the United States in March, 1971. For his prompt return and lengthy service, Healy was honored with the Distinguished Service Medal, his first of two. Healy was next assigned as Chief of the Pacific Division and Deputy Director of Operations Directorate. He was then promoted to Brigadier General and assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A N-heptane spray from a GDI {{multi-hole}} injector {{operated in}} ambient air at fixed conditions and with <b>double</b> injection <b>commands</b> is studied with different experimental techniques {{to better understand}} the spray behaviors, focusing the analysis on the effect of different dwell times between the two pulses. Results from spray photographic analysis, fuel injected quantity, droplet velocity and sizing by Phase Doppler Anemometry are presented and compared. The peculiarities and usefulness of a complementary application of the different techniques is illustrated. The two spray pulses have the same time length, so that the first spray evolves in a nearly quiescent and clean ambient, while the second, nominally identical to the first one, evolves in its trailing edge. The direct comparison allows an immediate perception of the differences among the two sprays, at the different dwell times, where the shorter tested, 160 microseconds, was chosen as the one that shows the first appreciable effect with {{at least one of the}} used techniques; the differences are clearly evident in the PDA results, sufficiently visible from the injection rate, not appreciable in the imaging at short distance. The effect of the longer dwell times becomes more evident and is illustrate...|$|R
5000|$|After awakening, he escapes the {{hospital}} following {{an attack by}} Cipher's XOF strike force and is extracted by Ocelot. Given the code name Venom Snake, the <b>double</b> takes <b>command</b> of the Diamond Dogs mercenary unit along with the new Mother Base constructed near Seychelles. Snake then engages {{in a series of}} missions in Afghanistan and Central Africa as he seeks revenge for his lost comrades and pursues the Cipher organization. Along the way he recruits several individuals into his army, including companions such as the sniper Quiet and the canine D-Dog. Snake ultimately comes face to face with Skull Face, the man who plotted the original Mother Base's destruction. Throughout the course of the story clues to Venom Snake's true identity are gradually revealed, starting with the presence of his roommate Ishmael in the Cypriot hospital. When Snake asks Ishmael's identity, the bandaged patient simply replies [...] "you're talking to yourself." [...] Later on, a DNA test is conducted on the child mercenary leader Eli, a suspected product of the Les Enfants Terribles cloning project (and ultimately revealed to be a young Liquid Snake), turns out negative when Eli's DNA is compared with Snake's.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} complex {{structures}} of ethnic mobility in Filipino American writer Carlos Bulosan's America Is in the Heart. The protagonist Carlos's active {{pursuit of a}} national ideal {{during the course of}} his journey is enhanced by the structure of feelings produced in the intimate encounters between the colonizers and colonized. I draw upon Ann Laura Stoler's conceptualization of “tense and tender tie” and Sara Ahmed's exposition of politics of emotion to analyze the complex ways in which these intimate encounters help suture the gaps and contradictions between the peril of the Filipino migrant worker in a racist society that sees him as hypersexual, beast-like, and unfit for assimilation, and his steadfast faith in the Nation. This subtle biopolitical governance of the U. S. imperialism over the colonial/migrant bodies assures the <b>double</b> <b>command</b> of the empire which includes the colonized in the form of exclusion, or excludes in the form of inclusion and renders the trace of governance invisible. Bulosan's text seeks to expose the racism and injustice of the nation, but the force of resistance is often compromised by the biopolitical governance of empire. This imperial “haunting” characterizes Filipino American literary tradition at its seminal stage, and remains an important subject of reflection in subsequent Filipino American literary intervention...|$|E
500|$|The VRS {{successfully}} recaptured Derventa {{and pushed}} the HVO and the HV north, capturing several towns in the process. In {{the second phase of}} the offensive, the VRS reached the Sava River, the border with Croatia, and destroyed a bridgehead held by the HV and the HVO at Bosanski Brod. The offensive involved more than 60,000 troops and resulted in heavy casualties for all sides, especially the HVO. The Croatian National Defence Council commissioned a report into the loss of Bosanska Posavina and blamed internal conflicts, a <b>double</b> chain of <b>command</b> and ineffective counterintelligence for the defeat. The outcome later caused speculation that it was the result of a political arrangement between Serb and Croatian leaders to secure a land trade, though a Central Intelligence Agency analysis rejected such allegations.|$|R
50|$|The {{requirements}} for the VBTP-MR VBCI included an ELBIT remote control turret, equipped with a Mk44 Bushmaster II cannon and a 7.62mm machine gun; {{it should also be}} able fire anti-tank guided missiles. This turret, capable of 360 degree swivel and elevation / depression of -15 to +60 degrees, was chosen by the Brazilian Army on a selection made from among four companies. It is expected to manufactured in Brazil. The firing system has a laser rangefinder, vision and fire control by day/night thermal vision, <b>double</b> shot of <b>command</b> (commander and gunner of the car, with precedence for the later), automatic target tracking system, and hunter killer smoke launchers. A significant aspect of this vehicle is that the turret is equipped with weapons sights and it is stabilized in two axes, allowing firing on the move with very high probability of hit within the first shot. Future needs will determine what kind of instruments will equip the turret, possibly after the vehicle enters service.|$|R
50|$|Another {{struggling}} Eastern Conference foe {{would find}} a point off of the Wizards when the Chicago Fire came calling on another rainy Kansas City Saturday night. The club followed their 2010 script perfectly as they outshot the Fire 18-8 (10-6 on net) while holding a <b>commanding</b> <b>double</b> digit corner kick advantage 11-1 but as {{in many of the}} earlier games the Wizards simply could not get the ball around Chicago goal keeper Andrew Dykstra who ended the match with eight saves. Julio Martínez put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute and former US International and Chicagoland native Brian McBride doubled the lead straight out of halftime. Davy Arnaud would have a goal called back and several KC shots hit woodwork before Kei Kamara pulled one back only two minutes after the lead was doubled. Much of the second half would be played in the Wizards final third but the equalizer wouldn't come until Kamara tapped in a deflected shot from Teal Bunbury in the 89th minute, despite increased pressure the homeside would not find a magical stoppage time winner and was forced to live with splitting the points.|$|R
50|$|Montagu {{enlisted in}} the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1938. Because of his legal {{background}} he was reassigned to specialized study. From there {{he was assigned to}} the Royal Navy's Humberside headquarters at Hull as an assistant staff officer in intelligence. Montagu served in the Naval Intelligence Division of the British Admiralty, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander RNVR. He was the Naval Representative on the XX Committee, which oversaw the running of <b>double</b> agents. While <b>Commanding</b> Officer of NID 17M, Squadron Leader Charles Cholmondely, RAFVR and he conceived Operation Mincemeat, a major deception plan against the Germans during the war. Montagu had {{the idea of having a}} dead British soldier wash ashore with false information on the plans for the invasion of Sardinia, as opposed to Sicily, where the invasion really would occur. Carefully picking a location where he knew pro-Nazi villagers would loyally turn over the drowned man's briefcase, Montagu also manufactured an entire life history and even a living fiancée for the mythical young serviceman, whose body was that of a homeless Welshman who had died from eating rat poison.|$|R
