40|$|Drugs {{have rarely}} been {{considered}} as a possible cause of acute pancreatitis in clinical practice. Here, we have investigated various risk factors for this disease, and in particular drugs, within a nation-wide, case-control surveillance network for studies on drug-induced diseases. We have described and evaluated this case-control network and its quality assurance and control procedures and we present the distribution of etiologies of acute pancreatitis in Sweden. We also document {{the extent to which}} drugs, diseases, smoking and alcohol are risk factors for acute pancreatitis. This study was a population-based, case-control study encompassing 1. 4 million inhabitants aged 20 - 85 from four areas in Sweden conducted between January 1, 1995 and May 31, 1998. The patients were hospitalized in departments of surgery for their first episode of acute pancreatitis and had no previous history of known bile stone disease. Control subjects were recruited continuously in a random fashion from the general study population. Information was obtained from medical records and through telephone interviews. Overall, there were 2, 453 potential patients and 2, 245 potential controls among whom 779 and 2, 128, respectively, were eligible for inclusion. 462 patients and 1, 781 controls were ultimately included in the study. The expert evaluators found evidence for biliary stones in 50 % of the patients and for alcohol use in 23 %, but in 29 % neither of these factors was present. In all, other factors (e. g., drugs) {{may have contributed to the}} development of acute pancreatitis in 52 % of the cases. A multivariable analysis, defining exposure as any use within 30 days of admission to the hospital, revealed that the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for H 2 antagonists was 2. 4 (95 % CI 1. 2 - 4. 8), for proton pump inhibitors 2. 1 (1. 2 - 3. 4), for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs derived from acetic acid 2. 3 (1. 3 - 4. 0) and for antibacterial agents designed for systemic use 1. 9 (1. 1 - 3. 2). Inflammatory bowel disease exhibited an OR of 3. 4 (1. 5 - 7. 9), while the corresponding value for other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including ulcer, 1. 5 (1. 1 - 1. 9). Smoking was significantly associated with acute pancreatitis OR 1. 7 (1. 2 - 2. 1) and for those smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day, the OR was 4. 0 (2. 2 - 7. 5). Alcohol in moderate amounts did not reach statistical significance, but for those drinking more than 420 g of alcohol each week the OR was 4. 1 (2. 2 - 7. 5). Six percent of the patients and three percent of the control subjects had prevalent diabetes. Eleven percent of the patients and seven percent of the controls had a BMI > 30. The relative risk for a hospital stay exceeding 14 days or for treatment in an intensive care unit was 2. 5 (1. 1 - 5. 4) for patients with a BMI > 30, compared to those with a BMI of 20 - 25. Among antidiabetic drugs, only the use of glibenclamide increased the risk for acute pancreatitis, demonstrating an adjusted OR of 2. 5 (1. 1 - 5. 9). Current use of H 2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors had an adjusted OR of 4. 9 (1. 6 - 15. 0) and 3. 2 (1. 4 - 7. 4), respectively. For both of these groups, the OR values were higher for patients taking one DDD/day or more than for those taking lower daily doses, but the confidence limits were broad. We found that presence of gastritis and/or gastro esophageal reflux disease, within the 12 months preceding hospitalization had an increased adjusted OR of 1. 9 (1. 2 - 3. 0). Inflammatory bowel disease was also significantly associated with acute pancreatitis, with an adjusted OR of 5. 1 (2. 0 - 13. 0) We found variations among the monitors. One deviated significantly from the others. This monitors data were excluded. Seven monitors participated from the start, of this study, 5 of whom interviewed both patients and control subjects, while 2 interviewed controls only. Seven monitors were added during the course of the study, 3 interviewing patients and controls and 4 interviewing only controls. Differences between these <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>monitors</b> had little impact on the observed odds ratios. A pronounced enhancement of the sensitivity of the monitors was observed with time but had little impact on the odds ratios. Intensive training of interviewers in the beginning of a study is of importance for their sensitivity over time...|$|E

In addition to characterizing the emergence <b>of</b> <b>monitoring</b> activity {{in the presence of}} numerous potential activist investors,we also develop some comparative statics. Some of these comparative statics are counterintuitive from the perspective of models that fail to endogenize both security market structure and investor activism.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the response of}} Lazuli Bunting (Passerina amoena) to fire in Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) woodland at Camp Williams, Utah, during 1993 – 1998. Overall, Lazuli Bunting abundance on the study area increased significantly during the 2 years after a stand-replacing wildfire, which covered 800 ha of Gambel oak woodland. This increase suggested that Lazuli Buntings respond positively to fire. However, a comparison of pre- and post-fire abundance of Lazuli Bunting for 2 <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>monitoring</b> plots with different fire histories showed that abundance was significantly greater during the post-fire period for both burned and unburned plots. When we examined our data at a spatial scale appropriate to Lazuli Bunting, we found that post-fire increases observed on unburned plots were limited to plots {{in close proximity to}} the burned area. A comparison of pre- and post-fire abundance of Lazuli Bunting for 3 <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>monitoring</b> plots located at various distances from the burned area revealed that post-fire abundance was similar only for plots within the fire boundary and for those ≤ 1000 m from the fire boundary; plots located 3 ̆e 1000 m from the fire boundary had fewer individuals per plot post-fire. However, prefire Lazuli Bunting abundance was similar among all 3 categories. This differential, spatially scaled response of Lazuli Bunting to fire at the landscape level may support a hierarchical view of habitat selection...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} optimal configuration <b>of</b> the <b>monitoring</b> units in a hierarchical distributed monitoring system. A hierarchical distributed <b>monitoring</b> system consists <b>of</b> a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>monitoring</b> units which are grouped and distributed onto the physical network. The architecture lends itself to parallel processing, reducing the complexity <b>of</b> distributed <b>monitoring</b> caused by factors such as collection and processing of the large quantities <b>of</b> <b>monitoring</b> data. Furthermore, the topology-specific partitioning <b>of</b> the <b>monitoring</b> units allow complex, topology-specific events to be monitored and evaluated in a natural and efficient way. The optimal configuration problem is concerned with finding an optimal hierarchical partition <b>of</b> the <b>monitoring</b> units such that the total processing cost is the minimum. It is a NP-complete problem. In this paper, we study the heuristics for obtaining near-optimal <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>monitoring</b> units. Simulation <b>of</b> heuristic algorithms for mesh and hypercube networks are presented. The results suggest further system topology specific heuristics. Although the paper is targeted at distributed monitoring, {{we believe that the}} results can also be applied to other hierarchical control problems in distributed computing.

40|$|Incorporating spatial {{covariance}} into clustering {{has previously}} been considered for functional data to identify <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> functions which are similar across space.

Directed networks present additional challenges in terms of estimating spatial covariance due to their complex structure. Although suitable river network covariance models have been proposed for use with stream distance, where distance is computed along the stream network, these models have not been extended for contexts where the data are functional, {{as is often the case}} with environmental data. The paper develops a method of calculating spatial covariance between functions from sites along a river network and applies the measure as a weight within functional hierarchical clustering.
