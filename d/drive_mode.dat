25|$|The {{tachograph}} was {{a device}} that monitors speed and driving and rest times. One {{of the way to}} record the information is the old method using a paper chart (analogue tachograph). The chart recorder is an electromechanical device that records an electrical or mechanical input trend onto a piece of paper (the chart). Chart recorders may record several inputs using different color pens and may record onto strip charts or circular charts. The tachograph is a device fitted to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver's activity selected from a choice of modes. The <b>drive</b> <b>mode</b> is activated automatically when the vehicle is in motion.|$|E

25|$|The game removes {{some of the}} {{gameplay}} system features used in {{the prior}} game: the Guard Attack, the Critical Counter, the Clash System, {{as well as the}} dynamic, zooming camera. In their place, three new features have been added. The first of the three is the new EX Mode, which convert each character's super moves into more powerful versions that allows one bar from the player's power gauge for EX Special Moves and two bars from the player's power gauge for EX Super Special Moves. Another new feature is the Hyper <b>Drive</b> <b>mode,</b> which gives the player unlimited use of Drive Cancels for a while once the Hyper Drive Gauge has been maxed, and the last new feature confirmed for the game is the Drive Cancel, which opens up new combo possibilities. The game also marks the return of the multi-bar power gauge that was introduced in The King of Fighters '97. In addition to standard and EX Desperation Moves, a new class of Desperation Move called Neo Max is included in the game and require that three stocks of gauge be exchanged to perform one, making it similar to Hidden Super Desperation Moves from The King of Fighters 2002 and Leader Super Special Moves from The King of Fighters 2003. These can also be cancelled from standard Desperation Moves, making them similar to the Dream Cancels from The King of Fighters XI.|$|E

500|$|According to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) definitions, the Volt is a plug-in hybrid vehicle, {{due to the}} {{combination}} of an internal combustion engine and two electric motors, along with a battery that can accept off-board energy. The Volt operates as a purely electric vehicle for the first [...] in charge-depleting mode. When the battery capacity drops below a pre-established threshold from full charge, the vehicle enters charge-sustaining mode, and the Volt's control system will select the most optimally efficient <b>drive</b> <b>mode</b> to improve performance and boost high-speed efficiency.|$|E
500|$|The {{drivetrain}} {{permits the}} Volt {{to operate as}} a pure battery electric vehicle until its battery capacity has been depleted to a defined level, at which time it commences to operate as a series hybrid design where the gasoline engine drives the generator, which keeps the battery at minimum level charge and provides power to the electric motors. The full charge of the battery is replenished only by loading it on the electrical grid. While in this series mode at higher speeds and loads, (typically above [...] at light to moderate loads) the gasoline engine can engage mechanically to the output from the transmission and assist both electric motors in driving the wheels, {{in which case the}} Volt operates as a power-split or series-parallel hybrid. After its all-electric range has been depleted, at speeds between , the Volt is programmed to select the most efficient <b>drive</b> <b>mode,</b> which improves performance and boosts high-speed efficiency by 10 to 15 percent.|$|E

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) typically feature special options of <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> {{that can affect}} the hybrid energy source management system, for example, electric vehicle (EV) mode (that draws fully on battery) and charge sustaining (CS) mode (that utilizes internal combustion engine to charge battery while propelling the vehicle). This paper studies an optimization problem to enable the driver to select the appropriate <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> for fuel minimization. We develop optimization algorithms that optimize the decisions of <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> based on trip information, and integrated with path planning to find an optimal path, considering intermediate filling and charging stations.

40|$|The ISAC RFQ cavity {{nominally}} {{operates at}} a frequency of 35 MHz. It can operate in either self-excited or <b>driven</b> <b>mode.</b> In the self-excited mode, the RFQ cavity itself {{is one of}} the frequency-determining elements. In the <b>driven</b> <b>mode,</b> the frequency is slaved to an external stabilized, digitally synthesized frequency source. In order to achieve glitchless transitions between the two modes, the RFQ frequency source is buffered by a phase-locked loop. When operating in the <b>driven</b> <b>mode,</b> RF switches in the loop configure the loop to lock to the external direct digital synthesizer. Reconfiguration of the RF switches in the self-excited mode turns the phase-locked loop into an oscillator whose frequency is determined by the phase shift of the RFQ cavity. The overdamping characteristic of the phase-locked loop prevents sudden transitions in either frequency or phase during switching between operating modes. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{both the}} control design used to stabilize a small rover on two wheels as a mobile inverted pendulum, {{as well as}} the steering design used to achieve a series of unique stable driving modes. Additionally, the rover is assessed as an educational platform for use in teaching various STEM topics at both the high school and undergraduate university levels. The vehicle, termed BeagleRover, uses four DC motors and four servo motors to independently steer each wheel and achieve a total of six different driving modes, four of which are inherently stable four-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> while two are unstable two-wheel <b>drives</b> <b>modes.</b> Two of the four stable <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> implement Ackermann steering geometry to reduce side slip when driving around a turn. Experimental results using measurements from an onboard gyroscope suggest that side slip is indeed reduced by this method. Stability in the two unstable <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> is achieved through classical control methods including lead and lag control. Complementary filtering of gyroscope and accelerometer measurements is used to derive accurate body position data for use in feedback. In support of current STEM education trends, this thesis provides a detailed solution set to the steering, control and filtering problems for potential use in STEM course material...|$|R

40|$|MHD {{stability}} of NBI heated plasmas and impacts of MHD modes on plasma confinement are intensively {{studied in the}} Large Helical Device (LHD). Three characteristic MHD instabilities were observed, that is, (1) pressure <b>driven</b> <b>modes</b> excited in the plasma edge, (2) pressure <b>driven</b> <b>mode</b> in the plasma core, and (3) Alfvén eigenmodes (AEs) driven by energetic ions. MHD mode excited in the edge region accompanies multiple satellites, and is called Edge Harmonic Modes (EHMs). EHM sometimes has a bursting character. The bursting EHM transiently decreases the stored energy by about 15 percents. In the plasma core region, m= 2 /n= 1 pressure <b>driven</b> <b>mode</b> is typically destabilized. The mode often induces internal collapse in the higher beta regime more than 1 percent. The internal collapse appreciably affects the global confinement. Energetic ion driven AEs are often detected in NBI-heated LHD plasmas. Particular AE with the frequency 8 - 10 times larger than TAE-frequency was detected in high beta plasmas more than 2 percent. The AE {{may be related to}} helicity-induced AE. Excitation of these three types of MHD instabilities and their impacts on plasma confinement are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{interactions}} between parametrically and directly <b>driven</b> vibration <b>modes</b> of a clamped-clamped beam resonator are studied. An integrated piezoelectric transducer {{is used for}} direct and parametric excitation. First, the parametric amplification and oscillation of a single mode are analyzed by the power and phase dependence below and above the threshold for parametric oscillation. Then, the motion of a parametrically <b>driven</b> <b>mode</b> is detected by the induced change in resonance frequency in another mode of the same resonator. The resonance frequency shift {{is the result of}} the nonlinear coupling between the modes by the displacement-induced tension in the beam. These nonlinear modal interactions result in the quadratic relation between the resonance frequency of one mode and the amplitude of another mode. The amplitude of a parametrically oscillating mode depends on the square root of the pump frequency. Combining these dependencies yields a linear relation between the resonance frequency of the directly <b>driven</b> <b>mode</b> and the frequency of the parametrically oscillating mode.
