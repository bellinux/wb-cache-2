2500|$|Similarly, {{by using}} {{modified}} case gauges, {{it is possible}} to measure precisely the distance from a bullet ogive to the start of rifling in a particular rifle for a given bottleneck cartridge. [...] Maximum accuracy for a rifle is often found to occur for only one particular fixed distance from the start of rifling in a bore to a datum line on a bullet ogive. [...] Measuring the overall cartridge length does not permit setting such fixed distances accurately, as different bullets from different manufacturers will often have a different ogive shape. [...] It is only by measuring from a fixed diameter point on a bullet ogive to the start of a bore's rifling that a proper spacing can be determined to maximize accuracy. [...] A modified case gauge can provide the means by which to achieve an <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>accuracy</b> with precision handloads.|$|E

5000|$|At {{that time}} there was a great debate taking place in Bomber Command over the use of [...] "pathfinders", {{specialized}} aircraft and crews that would find the targets and use flares to mark them for attack. The same technique had first been used during the Blitz by the Germans, notably by the specialist Kampfgeschwader 100, but its effectiveness had been severely curtailed by British jamming efforts. Nevertheless, the concept had enough backing that a small force of Mosquitoes had been organized to operate as a pathfinder force, using normal optical sighting.
