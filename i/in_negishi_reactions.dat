30|$|The salt {{effect is}} always a {{research}} area of interest in chemical synthesis and separation. More recently, the remarkable role of halide salt additives <b>in</b> the <b>Negishi</b> <b>reaction</b> involving aryl zinc reagents has been reported (McCann and Organ 2014). It is ranked {{as one of the}} world’s top ten science and technology improvements in 2014 by Chemical & Engineering News. In our previous work, a positive effect of inorganic salts has been found for the synthesis of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane (Yin et al. 2015), and intensive studies have been carried out to explore the salt effect of various types of inorganic salt on the formation of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane (Yin et al. 2015). The results shows that higher yields of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane can be obtained in reaction solution by using the Cl−-based salts with smaller cation radius. It can be concluded that the enhancement in the yield of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane is attributed to hydration which can decrease the water activity. Though these investigations covered important aspects of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane synthesis, there is still something to be further explored, since the increase in the acid value by the addition of Cl−-based salts is still very remarkable compared to that observed for sulfuric acid alone. In addition, the presence of Cl−-based salts and the HCl formed may cause corrosion (Bao 2007). Therefore, in the present work we investigated the influence of organic salts on 1, 3, 5 -trioxane synthesis by batch reaction and continuous production experiments. In addition, UV–visible spectroscopy and vapor–liquid equilibrium experiments were also performed {{for the first time to}} investigate the mechanisms that control the effects of organic salts on the yield of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane in the reaction solution and in the distillate from the reaction.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects on}} {{reactions}} of catalytically-capable trace metal impurities were investigated {{in the context}} of two separate reports of iron-catalysed Suzuki reactions. In both cases, the reported reactions were found to irreproducible and the likelihood of palladium contamination was discussed. In one of the cases, it was found that as little as 0. 0001 mol% of Pd(OAc) 2 could account for the observed activity. As a result of pressure from our group and others, both papers were retracted. The importance of testing for trace impurities and of conducting blank reactions is discussed. The roles of l, 2 -bis(diphenylphosphino) benzene (dpbz) and l, 3 -bis(diphenylphosphino) propane (dppp) ligands <b>in</b> the Fe-catalysed <b>Negishi</b> and Suzuki <b>reactions</b> were investigated through a structure/reactivity study. A series of modified dppp and dpbz analogues were prepared and characterised and some of their key structural differences analysed. The ligand library was then investigated in both the Fe-catalysed Suzuki and <b>Negishi</b> <b>reactions.</b> Despite the broad range of structurally-related but significantly different phosphine ligands tested, nearly all were shown to perform well in both of the test-bed reactions. Reasons for the unprecedented high activity of this class of catalysts are discussed and the importance of pre- forming iron complexes before their application to catalysis is highlighted. In parallel with a full kinetic study and the isolation of potential reactive intermediates conducted by other group members, the mechanism of the Fe-catalysed <b>Negishi</b> <b>reaction</b> was investigated. Kinetic analysis identified Fe(l) as the most likely lowest oxidation state in the catalytic cycle and efforts were made to isolate Fe(l) intermediates. A series of Fe(l) complexes had been isolated by other group members and these were tested in a range of representative <b>Negishi</b> <b>reactions.</b> An Fe(l) bromide complex was identified as a likely on-cycle intermediate and the implications of this in catalysis are discussed. The use of boron/zinc transmetallation for the generation of nucleophiles in Fe-catalysed coupling reactions was investigated. It was found that under forcing conditions, the aryl transfer reaction could be made to proceed without the need for additional catalysts. The mechanism of boron/zinc transmetallation was investigated using llB NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. It was demonstrated that {{the degree to which the}} alkyl groups from the zinc transferred to the boron was far higher than was previously thought and that the addition of stabilising solvents or ligands could dramatically alter the positions of the equilibria in transmetallation reactions.

50|$|Transmetalation {{is often}} used as {{a step in the}} {{catalytic}} cycles of cross-coupling reactions. Some of the cross-coupling reactions that include a transmetalation step are Stille cross-coupling, Suzuki cross-coupling, Sonogashira cross-coupling, and Negishi cross-coupling. The most useful cross-coupling catalysts tend to be ones that contain palladium. Cross-coupling reactions have the general form of R′-X + M-R → R′-R + M-X and are used to form C-C bonds. R and R′ can be any carbon fragment. The identity of the metal, M, depends on which cross-coupling reaction is being used. Stille reactions use tin, Suzuki reactions use boron, Sonogashira reactions use copper, and <b>Negishi</b> <b>reactions</b> use zinc. The transmetalation step in palladium catalyzed reactions involve the addition of an R-M compound to produce an R′-Pd-R compound. Cross-coupling reactions have a wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry including the area of medicinal chemistry. The Stille reaction has been used to make an antitumor agent, (±)-epi-jatrophone; the Suzuki reaction has been used to make an antitumor agent, oximidine II; the Sonogashira reaction has been used to make an anticancer drug, eniluracil; and the <b>Negishi</b> <b>reaction</b> has been used to make the carotenoid β-carotene via a transmetalation cascade.|$|R

The method requires no additive (such as LiX) {{or use of}} a polar co-solvent (such as THF/DMI) and reactions proceed in THF solvent alone.

Subsequent investigation into diarylzinc as reagents <b>in</b> <b>Negishi</b> cross-coupling have shown they transmetalate directly without the use of halide additive in THF alone producing arylzinc halide as a resting state.
