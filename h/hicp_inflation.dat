In example, at the April 2014 assessment: Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus with HICP values respectively 2.2, 1.8 and 1.4 percentage points below the eurozone average, were all found to have suffered from exceptional factors, and hence concluded to be outliers, causing the reference limit instead to be calculated based on the HICP values from the three states with the 4th to 6th lowest HICP values in EU.|$|E

This study analyses whether the accuracy of forecasts of aggregate euro area inflation can be improved by aggregating forecasts of subindices of the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) as opposed to forecasting the aggregate HICP directly. The analysis includes univariate and multivariate linear time series models and distinguishes between different forecast horizons, <b>HICP</b> components and <b>inflation</b> measures. Various model selection procedures are employed to select models for the aggregate and the disaggregate components.

40|$|The {{period of}} {{extraordinary}} volatility in euro area headline inflation starting in 2007 {{raised the question}} whether forecast combination methods {{can be used to}} hedge against bad forecast performance of single models during such periods and provide more robust forecasts. We investigate this issue for forecasts from a range of short-term forecasting models. Our analysis shows that there is considerable variation of the relative performance of the different models over time. To take that into account we suggest employing performance-based forecast combination methods, in particular one with more weight on the recent forecast performance. We compare such an approach with equal forecast combination that has been found to outperform more sophisticated forecast combination methods in the past, and investigate whether it can improve forecast accuracy over the single best model. The time-varying weights assign weights to the economic interpretations of the forecast stemming from different models. We also include a number of benchmark models in our analysis. The combination methods are evaluated for <b>HICP</b> headline <b>inflation</b> and <b>HICP</b> excluding food and energy. We investigate how forecast accuracy of the combination methods differs between pre-crisis times, the period after the global financial crisis and the full evaluation period including the global financial crisis with its extraordinary volatility in inflation.

Most importantly, however, while the country retained the Icelandic kronur, it was unable to lift the capital controls recently introduced in the turmoil of the economic crisis. Introduction of the euro, a far stronger currency, would allow the country to lift these capital controls and achieve an increased inward flow of foreign economic capital, which ultimately would ensure higher and more stable economic growth.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro as a noncash currency in 1999 and in cash form in 2002 went smoothly thanks to professional preparation and efficient changeover. Nevertheless, in all EU Member States, and, as expected, mainly in the countries of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the euro prompted discussions in which the people expressed their fears and hopes, developed social ideas about the “new unit ” and formed expectations about changes in the economic situation for the individual and the nation. Of particular interest were the price changes caused by the currency changeover or attributable to the euro. While the statistically measured inflation rates (e. g. the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, HICP) were and still are relatively low throughout the EMU, the inflation “perceived ” by the general public has been much higher. In the euro area the gap between the <b>HICP</b> and perceived <b>inflation</b> continues to be significant.

50|$|The ECB {{publishes a}} Convergence Report {{at least every}} two years to check how well the EU members {{aspiring}} for euro adoption comply with the criteria. The first full convergence report was published in November 1996, and concluded that only 3 out of 15 EU member states (Denmark, Luxembourg and Ireland) were completely compliant with the criteria {{at that point in}} time. As a majority of states were not in compliance, the Council decided to delay the introduction of the euro by two years to 1 January 1999. In March 1998 a more positive second convergence report concluded that 11 out of 12 applying countries were prepared for the electronic introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, with only Greece failing to qualify by the deadline. Subsequent convergence reports have so far resulted in an additional 8 EU member states complying with all criteria and adopting the euro (Greece, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). The latest convergence report was published in June 2014, and checked for compliance in the reference year from May 2012 - April 2014, where Lithuania managed to fully comply - thus becoming the next 19th eurozone member. As the reference values for <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> and long-term interest rates change on a monthly basis, any member state with a euro derogation has the right to ask the ECB for an updated compliance check, whenever they believe they have met all both economic and legal convergence criteria.

In example, Ireland was found to be an interest rate outlier not qualifying for the reference value calculation in the assessment month March 2012, when it was measured to have a long-term interest rate average being 4.71 percentage points above the eurozone average - while at the same time having no complete access to the financial lending markets. When Ireland was assessed again in April 2013, it was, however, deemed no longer to be an outlier, due to posting a long-term interest rate average only 1.59 percentage points above the eurozone average - while also having regained complete access to the financial lending markets for the last 1.5 month of the assessment period. A final relevant example appeared in April 2014, when Portugal likewise was found not to be an interest rate outlier, due to posting a long-term interest rate average being 2.89 percentage points above the eurozone average - while having regained complete access to the financial lending markets for the last 12 months of the assessment period.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the Bank’s spring projections, the growth of activity in the euro area {{in the first half of}} 2006 has been stronger than previously predicted and oil prices, after rising further during the summer, have fallen to a level hovering around 60 dollars since October 2006. In Belgium, economic activity recorded a considerable increase in vitality in late 2005 and early 2006, with quarterly GDP growth reaching 0. 9 p. c. in the first quarter and 0. 7 p. c. in the second quarter. The rate of GDP growth may have dipped slightly in the second half of the year, maintaining a sound course more in line with the potential for growth in the medium term. In all, real GDP growth is expected to increase from 1. 5 p. c. in 2005 to 3 p. c. in 2006. The projected figure for 2007 is 2. 1 p. c. Apart from the robust support of foreign demand, the improvement in 2006 had its origins largely within the economy, in household expenditure on consumption and housing and in business investment. The same factors are expected to operate in 2007, although the effect will be more moderate. Since the cyclical movements in activity are largely absorbed by productivity, the 1 p. c. rate of net job creation achieved in 2005 will probably be maintained for the ensuing two years. Altogether, around 43, 000 net additional jobs will be created each year from 2005 to 2007. However, taking account of the rapid growth of the labour force since 2005, the harmonised unemployment rate will only fall slightly during the period covered by the forecasts, to average 8. 3 p. c. in 2007 against 8. 4 p. c. in 2005 and 8. 5 p. c. in 2006. Estimated on the basis of the <b>HICP,</b> total <b>inflation</b> – which had averaged 2. 5 p. c. in 2005 – is predicted to fall to 2. 3 p. c. in 2006 and 1. 9 p. c. in 2007, as a result of the projected easing of energy prices. In contrast, the underlying trend in inflation is expected to maintain the gradual rise which began in mid 2005, increasing from 1. 5 p. c. in 2005 to an average of 1. 9 p. c. in 2007. For that year, the introduction on 1 July 2007 of the general packaging levy and the increase in excise duty on tobacco, included in the 2007 budget, will push inflation up by 0. 2 point. Unit labour costs are projected to increase by 0. 7 p. c. in 2006 and 1. 2 p. c. in 2007, following an average annual increase of 0. 5 p. c. in the two preceding years, these fluctuations reflecting the cyclical movements in productivity. Hourly labour costs should maintain their annual rate of increase of 2. p. c. in 2006 and 2007, comparable to that of the two preceding years. Taking account of the latest information, public finances should end the year 2006 more or less in balance. For 2007, the forecasts indicate a deficit of 0. 4 p. c. of GDP, despite a further decline in interest charges – although the fall is admittedly not as steep as in previous years – and the reduction in local authority investment expenditure which is normal in the year following the local elections. The adverse movement in the budget balance is due largely to the non-recurring measures taken into account in the estimate, the impact of which will be less than in 2006. In addition, public revenues are also expected to contract in relation to GDP, since labour incomes – which are taxed relatively heavily – are growing more slowly than GDP. In 2006 and 2007 the public debt will continue to diminish steadily. Belgium, macroeconomic projections, Eurosystem...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{projections}} published in December 2006, the international environment has remained buoyant. GDP {{growth in the}} euro area, which proved stronger than previously expected over the last months, should keep going at a solid pace in 2007. In Belgium, economic activity has been particularly strong in 2006. It should slow down slightly in 2007 and 2008, {{to return to a}} rhythm more in line with potential. Overall, real GDP growth is projected to decline from 3 p. c. in 2006, the highest rate for six years, to 2. 5 p. c. in 2007. It is expected to be 2. 2 p. c. in 2008. Over the whole period covered by {{the projections}}, growth should turn out to be more balanced than in 2006, backed by both foreign demand and domestic demand. In particular, although slowing down somewhat in comparison with the vigorous expansion recorded in 2006, private consumption and business investment should expand in line with still supportive demand, income and labour market conditions over the period 2007 - 2008. Actually, the rate of employment growth appears to be more sustained than in previous upturns. Following an increase of 46, 000 units in 2006, domestic employment should grow by another 115, 000 jobs or so over the period 2007 - 2008. With a cumulative decline of 60, 000 jobless, the highest number over a two-year period since 1999 - 2000, the harmonised unemployment rate is projected to fall from 8. 2 p. c. in 2006 to 7. 2 p. c. in 2008, prolonging a downward movement that begun in 2006. Estimated {{on the basis of the}} <b>HICP,</b> overall <b>inflation</b> is forecast to fall markedly, from 2. 3 p. c. in 2006 to 1. 6 p. c. in 2007 and 1. 8 p. c. in 2008. This drop can be explained by the moderating influence exerted by the energy component of the index, stemming from some appeasement of the oil price evolution and from the downward impact of the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets in Brussels and Wallonia, as well as the new method of recording these energy prices in the consumer price index. The underlying trend in inflation is expected to rise moderately, from 1. 6 p. c. in 2006 to 1. 9 p. c. in 2007, before falling back to 1. 7 p. c. in 2008. The slight acceleration in 2007 is almost exclusively due to increases in excise duties on tobacco and the levy on packaging. Reflecting the slowdown in labour productivity alone, as a result of the net rise in employment, unit labour costs in the private sector are projected to increase somewhat, rising from 1. 1 p. c. in 2006 to 1. 6 p. c. in 2007 and 2008. Moreover, the growth in hourly labour costs is expected to dip slightly from the 2006 level, coming down from 2. 7 p. c. to 2. 4 p. c. in 2007 and 2. 6 p. c. in 2008. For both of these years, the cumulative increase corresponds to the 5 p. c. target set in the central wage-bargaining agreement, in the absence of information on the outcome of the wage negotiations being conducted in the various joint committees at sectoral level. After showing a surplus of 0. 2 p. c. of GDP in 2006, general government accounts are likely to show a slight deficit, of 0. 1 p. c. of GDP this year and 0. 2 p. c. in 2008. Interest charges should continue to drop and tax revenues are expected to benefit from the promising economic outlook, but these elements are more than entirely offset by the disappearance of the favourable impact of nonrecurrent factors, as well as by a deterioration of the structural primary balance in 2007. The public debt ratio will continue to fall gradually, coming down by some 6 percentage points of GDP over the two years of the forecasting period, to reach 82. 7 p. c. of GDP in 2008.

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the Bank’s spring projections, the growth of activity and employment has proved robust in the euro area and in Belgium {{in the first half of}} 2007. However, the external environment has become more uncertain, owing to the financial market turmoil, the appreciation of the euro and the rising cost of energy and agricultural raw materials. Maintaining its 2006 momentum, economic activity in Belgium remained buoyant during the first half of 2007, expanding at a rate of 0. 7 p. c. per quarter. GDP growth dropped to 0. 4 p. c. in the third quarter, confirming the hitherto moderate fall in the synthetic indicator of business confidence. The slower rate of expansion looks set to continue in the fourth quarter and in the first part of 2008. Overall, real GDP growth is projected to decelerate from 2. 9 p. c. in 2006 to 2. 6 p. c. in 2007 and 1. 9 p. c. in 2008. The vigour of the Belgian economy at the beginning of 2007 was due mainly to the boost from domestic demand. In particular, firms and households were still resolutely increasing their fixed capital investment at the time, as they had in the preceding years, while private consumption was expanding significantly. These two factors are expected to weaken at the end of the year and in 2008. Supported by the robust activity pace, net job creations increased in the first half of 2007. Employment is projected to grow by 1. 6 p. c. in 2007 and 1 p. c. in 2008, representing net cumulative growth of almost 115, 000 jobs in the two years. Taking account of the expected movement in the labour force, the decline in the unemployment rate which began in April 2006 should continue, bringing that rate down from an average of 8. 3 p. c. in 2006 to 7. 7 p. c. in 2007 and 7. 3 p. c. in 2008. Estimated on the basis of the <b>HICP,</b> overall <b>inflation</b> should fall from 2. 3 p. c. in 2006 to 1. 8 p. c. in 2007, before rising to 2. 9 p. c. in 2008. This profile mainly reflects the movements in energy prices. The underlying inflation rate is projected to increase slightly in 2007, rising from 1. 6 p. c. in the previous year to 1. 9 p. c.; it should remain at that level in 2008. The rise in 2007 is due solely to the movement in prices of processed food. Conversely, inflation is expected to remain subdued in the case of non-energy industrial products and services, being held down by the appreciation of the euro, global competition and the generally moderate movement in wages over the recent years. Reflecting modest growth in labour productivity, which stems from the marked expansion of employment in 2007 and the cyclical slowdown in activity in 2008, the rise in unit labour costs in the private sector is forecast to accelerate, from 1. 4 p. c. in 2006 to 2. 2 p. c. in 2007 and 2. 1 p. c. in 2008. Hourly labour costs are projected to rise by 2. 8 p. c. in 2007 and 3 p. c. in 2008, an increase comparable to the 2006 figure. According to the latest data, public finances should end the year 2007 with a deficit of 0. 1 p. c. of GDP. In 2008, the deficit is expected to rise to 0. 3 p. c. of GDP. In 2007, public finances are benefiting from the favourable economic conditions and the further decline in interest charges. However, the positive impact of these factors is likely to be considerably outweighed by the disappearance of non-recurring factors. In 2008, the budget deficit will grow, despite a further fall in interest charges. In 2007 and 2008, the public debt will maintain its downward trend, falling by around 3 p. c. of GDP per annum. By the end of 2008, the debt ratio is forecast to reach 82. 1 p. c. Belgium, macroeconomic projections, Eurosystem...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the performance of VAR and ARIMA models to forecast Austrian <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation.</b> Additionally, we investigate whether disaggregate modelling of five subcomponents of inflation is superior to specifications of headline <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation.</b> Our modelling procedure is to find adequate VAR and ARIMA specifications that minimise the 12 months out-of-sample forecasting error. The main findings are twofold. First, VAR models outperform the ARIMA models in terms of forecasting accuracy over the longer pro- jection horizon (8 to 12 months ahead). Second, a disaggregated ap- proach improves forecasting accuracy substantially for ARIMA mod- els. In case of the VAR approach the superiority of modelling the five subcomponents instead of just considering headline <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> is demonstrated only over the longer period (10 to 12 months ahead).

40|$|In this speech, Stephen Nickell, {{member of}} the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee looks at two issues: first, the {{impending}} switch to targeting the <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> rate and, second, {{the implications of the}} steady rise in household debt. The key conclusion on the first issue is that a switch to an HICP target of 2 % today should have little or no impact on the current stance of monetary policy despite the large gap between RPIX and <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation.</b> On the second issue, he dismisses the arguement that interest rates should be set above the level required to hit the inflation target in order to discourage further household debt accumulation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some evidence}} on observed dispersion in <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> {{rates in the}} Euro area. Our descriptive exercise shows {{there is still a}} remarkable dispersion of <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> rates across euro area countries. In a decomposition (based on subindices corresponding to the COICOP) of this dispersion, we are able to see that most of it originates in the non-traded categories of the HICP. This suggests that the main source of dispersion in countries ’ headline inflation rates is in those components of the HICP where non-traded goods (services, regulated and administered prices) are more intensely represented. Then, determinants of inflation differentials are examined employing dynamic panel data techniques for quarterly and yearly data and for various definition of the Euro area in 1999 – 2008. Output gaps, a measure for price level convergence and oil price index were important. In addition, some determinants which were found significant in previous studies (for example exchange rate for example in Honohan and Lane 2003, 2004 or ECB, 2003) did not seem {{to have an impact on}} inflation in our extended time span. The dispersion of <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> has increased recently due to three waves o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{find that}} {{regional}} inflation dispersion has not markedly increased {{since the start}} of EMU, although it is somewhat higher than in other monetary unions (US and Germany), and that the distribution of member states ’ rates of inflation around the euro area <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> rate is characterised by a few outliers. In addition, an analysis based on economic weights suggests that roughly 60 percent of euro area consumer spending experiences an inflation rate that is within a range of 0. 5 percentage points of the euro area <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> rate. This suggests that in the first three years {{since the start of}} EMU regional inflation dispersion has not posed problems for the adoption of the single monetary policy for the majority of member states...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{evidence}} on the statistical features of observed dispersion in <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> rates in the Euro area. Our descriptive exercise shows {{that there is still}} a remarkable dispersion of <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> rates across the member countries and the dispersion of <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> is expected to increase in the coming years as the new EU member states will join the Euro area. We find that most of dispersion originates in the non-traded categories of the HICP. This suggests that the main source of dispersion in countries ' headline inflation rates is in those components of the HICP where non-traded goods (services, (public) goods with regulated and administered prices) are more intensely represented. We then examine the determinants of inflation differentials in a panel of the states of the Euro area in 1999 [...] 2007 using alternative classifications of this group and three different datasets. The evidence presented shows that output gaps and a proxy for price level convergence were statistically significant. On the other hand, some determinants that were found significant in previous studies (for example Honohan and Lane 2003, 2004) did not have impact on inflation in our expanded time span (e. g. exchange rate movements) ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{issues are}} considered, first the {{impending}} switch to targeting the <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> rate and second {{the implications of}} the steady rise in household debt. The following is a summary of the discussion, starting with the switch to HICP targeting. 1. In the longer run, thanks to differences in computational methods and the absence of the housing depreciation and council tax elements, the <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> rate is likely, on average, to be around 0. 8 pp lower than the RPI(X) inflation rate. In the short run, the gap between the two rates is highly volatile. 2. The long-run stance of monetary policy should be gauged by the real interest rate. Since the switch from an RPIX target to an HICP target should have no long-run real impact on the economy, the long-run stance of monetary policy will be unaffected. 3. If the HICP target is set at 2. 0 %, this is equivalent, in the long run, to a switch from an RPIX target of 2. 5 % to an RPIX target of 2. 8 %, because the long-run gap is 0. 8 pp. Since the long-run real interest rate is unaffected by the switch, the long-run nominal interest rate will be 0. 3 pp higher after the switch...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new core {{inflation}} index for the euro area, which is obtained by ‘cleaning ’ monthly inflation from short-run volatility, idiosyncratic dynamics and measurement errors. Our methodology {{is based on}} Forni et al. 2000 and 2002 and consists in exploiting information contained in a large panel of time series to obtain a satisfactory degree of smoothing without using backword looking filters, which induce a time delay in the signal. For this reason our core inflation index leads the <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> index monitored by the European Central Bank by about six months and is an excellent predictor of the HICP index at horizons of six months and longer...|$|E
40|$|We find strong econometric {{support for}} {{a break in the}} {{relationship}} between perceived and <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation</b> in the euro area, triggered by the introduction of euro notes and coins in January 2002. The break is fairly homogeneous across individuals with different socio-economic characteristics. We found no support for the thesis according to which perceptions are systematically formed by frequently purchased products. A similar break is found when national CPIs instead of HICPs are used as benchmarks. The role of the non-inclusion of owner-occupied housing in the HICP was negligible. Therefore the credibility of the HICP per se is not at stake. inflation, perceived inflation, panel unit roots tests...|$|E
40|$|Against the {{difficult}} background of analysing aggregated {{data in this}} paper core inflation in the euro area is estimated {{by means of the}} structural vector autoregressive approach. We demonstrate that the HICP sometimes seems to be a misleading indicator for monetary policy in the euro area. We furthermore compare our core inflation measure to the wide-spread "ex food and energy" measure, often referred to by the ECB. In addition we provide evidence that our measure is a coincident indicator of <b>HICP</b> <b>inflation.</b> Assessing the robustness of our core inflation measure we carefully conclude that it seems to be quite reliable.
