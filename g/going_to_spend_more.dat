50|$|After his {{retirement}} as a player, {{he remained in}} the game as a coach for almost two decades. He was offered a coaching job with the Yankees in 1936, and started his new position by instructing his replacement (DiMaggio) on the nuances of Yankee Stadium's outfield. He coached for the Yankees through 1944, for the St. Louis Browns in 1947 and for the Boston Red Sox (1948-1952). When he announced {{his retirement}} from the Boston coaching staff in March 1953, {{he said that he}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time with family and his Kentucky farm. He returned to coaching for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1954.|$|E
5000|$|Lincoln {{wrote of}} that November 19, 1963, {{conversation}} {{just three days}} before Kennedy's assassination: As Mr. Kennedy sat in the rocker in my office, his head resting on its back he placed his left leg across his right knee. He rocked slightly as he talked. In a slow pensive voice he said to me, 'You know if I am re-elected in sixty-four, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> and more time toward making government service an honorable career. I would like to tailor the executive and legislative branches of government {{so that they can}} keep up with the tremendous strides and progress being made in other fields ... I am going to advocate changing some of the outmoded rules and regulations in the Congress, such as the seniority rule. To do this I will need as a running mate in sixty-four a man who believes as I do.' ... I was fascinated by this conversation and wrote it down verbatim in my diary. Now I asked, ... 'Who is your choice as a running-mate?' He looked straight ahead, and without hesitating he replied, 'At this time I am thinking about Governor Terry Sanford of North Carolina. But it will not be Lyndon.' ...|$|E

John created {{the first line of}} Grado headphones, building them at a workbench with his wife, Loretta, in the early half of the 1990s. At the time, John and his family lived {{on the top floor of}} Grado's Brooklyn building as well. Due to the company not advertising, John would travel to audio shows around the world to spread the word. When he had established a sizable distributor list throughout multiple countries, he completely stopped <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shows <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time with his family.|$|R
40|$|After {{only a few}} hours, we {{release a}} new version Why? Because {{we thought we were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> much <b>more</b> time in {{developing}} a new cool feature: /api/task now allows you to remove tasks where the user has participated. This new feature works like /newtasks but it completely removes out of the game the PYBOSSA schedulers. This is for those developers that want to have full control about how their users interact with the tasks. You can find more information about this new feature here. Also, this version adds pagination to /api/favorites endpoint. Enjoy...|$|R
50|$|The qualities {{designed}} {{into the}} Salmons for {{their role as}} fleet submarines made them well suited for the war they found themselves fighting, but some shortcomings came up that were not apparent prior to the war. It came to be realized that the boats were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> a lot <b>more</b> time on the surface than what had been previously acknowledged. Thus the large bulk of the conning tower fairwater became a liability. It was too easily spotted by keen-eyed Japanese lookouts using their excellent binoculars. It was found that portions of the fairwater plating could be cut away both fore and aft of the bridge, greatly reducing the silhouette. This also had the desirable effect of creating mounting locations for 20mm Oerlikon autocannons, which were useful against aircraft and small surface targets.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that educational experiences lead to positive outcomes {{for reasons other than}} gains in cognitive abilities. Specifically, non-cognitive skills (i. e. personality traits) may change as a result of educational experiences (Heckman et al., 2010). To date, the idea that educational experiences contribute to changes in personality traits has received very little empirical support. The current study examines the relationship between educational experiences and personality trait development in a large German sample across four waves beginning in high school and throughout college. Findings suggest that personality traits in high school predict the type of educational experiences students have in college. Secondly, a number of educational experiences are associated with changes in personality traits. For example, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> class and <b>spending</b> <b>more</b> time on one???s homework is associated with increases in conscientiousness while having fewer stressful experiences are associated with decreases in neuroticism. Similarly, changes in educational experiences are associated with changes in personality traits, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between educational experiences and personality traits. Finally, a series of auto-regressive and auto-regressive latent trajectory (ALT) models found evidence that educational experiences can lead to changes in personality traits and vice-versa. Overall, this study suggests that educational contexts are important for the development of personality traits. Viewed in this light, one learns more in school than just class material...|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Straight Edge" [...] {{was written}} by MacKaye for his band, Minor Threat and was {{released}} in 1981 on Minor Threat's self-titled EP. It was a song that described his personal life free of the drugs and the self-destructive idea of [...] "sex as a conquest" [...] which served {{as a part of}} the [...] "sex, drugs and rock'n roll" [...] banner originating as a rebellion in the 1960s - smoking, drinking, and drug use. The song came about through MacKaye witnessing his friends abusing alcohol/drugs and acting recklessly. He decided early on that it was not the lifestyle for him, having never fit in with it. MacKaye's main goal was to fight against the people around him who abused substances. His decision to abstain from substances began to influence youth culture as Minor Threat gained popularity through numerous live shows and sales of their EP. Although to MacKaye the song did not represent a philosophy or a movement, over time people adopted the philosophy of the song and many bands began to label themselves straight edge, founding the straight edge movement. Although straight edge is not explicitly supportive of vegetarianism, MacKaye has stated that he is a vegetarian because he regards it as a logical progression of his views. He follows a strict vegan diet. In interviews especially in his later life, MacKaye has often become annoyed with questions about being the founding father of a movement he never intended to start. [...] "I'm credited because I coined a phrase and wrote a song about it. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> any <b>more</b> energy than I already have explaining that. From the very beginning I've tried to say that this is not my opinion. That whole thing just makes me realize I don't have any control over what people think of me. And I don't really give a fuck. I think that the idea of straight edge, the song that I wrote, and the way people have related it, there's some people who have abused it, they've allowed their fundamentalism to interfere with the real message, which in my mind, was that people should be allowed to live their lives the way they want to. It was just the title of a song that I wrote but certainly never intended to start a movement." ...|$|R
