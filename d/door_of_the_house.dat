5|$|In Pittsburgh, two FBI agents, Angus Stedman (Lawrence LeJohn) and James Leeds (Kevin McClatchy), are {{observing a}} house when Leeds falls asleep. When he awakes, he discovers that the front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is open. The two agents {{investigate}} and stumble upon a {{room filled with}} dead bodies. Suddenly, a man wielding an axe and possessing a third eye murders both agents with {{a blow to the}} head.|$|E
5|$|The first flames {{were spotted}} at 6:00pm, under the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords, by {{the wife of}} one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the {{curtains}} and wood panels, and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace initially panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did not call for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, {{at the other end of}} the palace complex.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by {{the front}} <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{that appear to be}} human. Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels on the balls of its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house {{in order to get to}} Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Florence Griswold <b>House</b> in Old Lyme, Connecticut was a {{boarding}} house run by Florence Griswold, where American Impressionist artists lived and painted - often directly on <b>the</b> walls and <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> building {{is now part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Florence Griswold Museum.|$|R
60|$|There {{was now a}} rush against <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> people sent up {{a hoarse}} cry. At this instant the lieutenant-governor's daughter, whom he had {{supposed}} to be in a place of safety, ran into the room and threw her arms around him. She had returned by a private entrance.|$|R

5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving the back <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{with a box of}} dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E
25|$|In many traditions, {{the front}} <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is opened at this point. Psalms 79:6-7 is recited in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi traditions, plus Lamentations 3:66 among Ashkenazim.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} the fifth cup {{has come to}} be seen as a celebration of future redemption. Today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for Elijah. During the seder, the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is opened and Elijah is invited in. Traditionally, the cup is viewed as Elijah’s and is used for no other purpose.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} years staircases were added inside <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> A number <b>of</b> Granada tower blocks dominate the skyline around the set. These are usually obscured through careful camera angles.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> {{were usually}} {{oriented}} to the direction {{where the sun}} rises and never faced towards the west, which {{can be explained by}} the values and belief systems these people have.|$|R

500|$|His {{first major}} case was [...] "The Case of the Hooded Man". On 9 October 1912, {{the driver of}} a horse-drawn {{carriage}} noticed a crouching man near the front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of Countess Flora Sztaray in Eastbourne. Sztaray was known to possess large amounts of valuable jewellery and {{to be married to}} a rich Hungarian nobleman, and assuming that the crouching man was a burglar the driver immediately called the police. Inspector Arthur Walls was sent to investigate, and ordered the man to come down. The man fired two shots, the first of which struck and killed Walls.|$|E
500|$|A poorly {{conceived}} and executed naval expedition against Spain {{under the leadership}} of Buckingham went badly, and the House of Commons began proceedings for the impeachment of the duke. In May 1626, Charles nominated Buckingham as Chancellor of Cambridge University in a show of support, and had two members who had spoken against Buckingham – Dudley Digges and Sir John Eliot – arrested at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> The Commons was outraged by the imprisonment of two of their members, and after about a week in custody, both were released. On 12 June 1626, the Commons launched a direct protestation attacking Buckingham, stating, ...|$|E
500|$|On 9 October 1912, {{the driver}} of a horse-drawn {{carriage}} noticed a man crouching near the front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of Countess Flora Sztaray, located on South Cliff Avenue in Eastbourne. Sztaray was known to possess large amounts of valuable jewellery and {{to be married to}} a rich Hungarian nobleman. The driver, who was Sztaray's coachman, informed Sztaray of the man's presence, whereupon Sztaray telephoned the police. Inspector Arthur Walls was sent to investigate. When Walls arrived on the scene, he observed a man lying on the portico above the front door. Walls called out, [...] "Now then, my man, you just come down." [...] The man fired two shots, the first of which struck and killed Walls.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} there came a thundering knock, that drove in <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> almost. It was three o'clock, and the company were arriving; and {{presently}} the servant announced Captain Steele and his lady.|$|R

500|$|The next day, Standish {{arranged}} to meet with Pecksuot over a meal in one of Wessagusset's one-room houses. Pecksuot brought with him a third warrior named Wituwamat, Wituwamat's adolescent brother, and several women. Standish had three men of Plymouth and Hobbamock {{with him in the}} house. On an arranged signal, the English shut the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and Standish attacked Pecksuot, stabbing him repeatedly with the man's own knife. [...] Wituwamat and the third warrior were also killed. Leaving the house, Standish ordered two more Massachusett warriors to be put to death. Gathering his men, Standish went outside the walls of Wessagusset in search of Obtakiest, a sachem of the Massachusett tribe. The Englishmen soon encountered Obtakiest with a group of warriors and a skirmish ensued, during which Obtakiest escaped.|$|E
500|$|In {{classical}} Athens, women ideally remained {{apart from}} men. This ideology of separation {{was so strong}} that a party to a lawsuit (Lysias' Against Simon) could claim that his sister and nieces were ashamed to be in the presence of their male relatives as evidence that they were respectable. Some historians have accepted this ideology as an accurate description of how Athenian women lived their lives; W. B. Tyrrell, for example, said: [...] "The outer <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is the boundary for the free women". [...] However, even in antiquity it was recognised that an ideology of separation could not be practiced by many Athenians. In [...] Politics, Aristotle asked: [...] "How is it possible to prevent the wives of the poor from going out of doors?" ...|$|E
500|$|By chance, Johnson {{and three}} of his men, Lieutenant Daniel Toler and Sergeants Love and Miller, were still awake and {{discussing}} tactics. [...] Mexican troops {{had been told that}} the house where Johnson was quartered was one of their targets, yet a lamp burned in the window, signalling that this was the home of a loyalist. [...] Out of an abundance of caution, a group of troops knocked on the door. [...] Before the Texians could open the door, they heard the gunfire from the town square. [...] Toler looked out a window and saw uniformed troops on the porch. [...] Without opening the door, he told the soldiers, in Spanish, that there were no troops there, but he would open the door momentarily. [...] The fighting moved into the street, and soldiers who had been guarding the back <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> rushed around to the front. [...] Johnson, Toler, Love, and Miller dashed out the back door and escaped.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{interior}} <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> has moulded gothic, or ogival, archways, {{decorated with}} fleur-de-lys detailing. The staircase {{is believed to}} either be original to <b>the</b> <b>house</b> or an early 17th-century replacement and features decorative balusters and newel posts with acorn-shaped caps.|$|R

500|$|In {{the same}} year he tried to free Confederate prisoners of war by {{recruiting}} former members of Morgan's Raiders who had escaped to Canada, including John Hunt Morgan's telegrapher George [...] "Lightning" [...] Ellsworth, who {{was a native of}} Canada. On his last day in Chicago, Hines had to avoid discovery by Union soldiers inspecting the home he was hiding in by crawling into a mattress upon which the homeowner's wife lay ill with delirium. The Union soldiers inspected the house he was in, and even checked to see if Hines was the one lying on the bed, but did not discover Hines in the mattress. The soldiers established a guard by the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> As it rained the next day, visitors were encouraged to visit the sick woman. The soldiers never looked at the faces under the umbrellas, and as a result, Hines sneaked {{out of the house and}} left Chicago.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up and looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E
2500|$|A {{monument}} {{raised to}} Ludlow's memory by his widow {{is in the}} church of St Martin in Vevey. Over the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in which he lived was placed the inscription [...] "omne solum forti patria, quia patris". This is a Christianized version of a line by Ovid meaning [...] "to the brave man every land is a fatherland because God his father made it". Ludlow married Elizabeth, daughter of William Thomas, of Wenvoe, Glamorganshire, but left no children.|$|E
25|$|Also on 26 November, the Civil Court {{issued an}} {{injunction}} ordering the PAD {{to leave the}} Suvarnabhumi International Airport immediately.

He forced his way in through the front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and shot two more people on the first floor. During the shooting, Huff {{allegedly}} stated [...] "There's plenty for everyone" [...] or something similar. On the second floor, he fired through the locked door of a bathroom where a couple had taken refuge inside the bathtub; neither person was hit. At least one other victim was injured during the shooting and taken to Harborview Medical Center, {{and at least one}} died at the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|After three years, Neville sees an {{apparently}} uninfected woman, Ruth, in broad daylight, and captures her. After some convincing, Ruth tells him her {{story of how}} {{she and her husband}} survived the pandemic (though her husband was killed two weeks earlier). Neville is puzzled by {{the fact that she is}} upset when he speaks of killing vampires; he thinks that if her story of survival was true, she would have become hardened to the act. He attempts to test whether she is a vampire by exposing her to garlic, which causes her to recoil violently. [...] At night Neville is startled awake and finds Ruth fully clothed at the front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Suspicious, he questions her motives, but relates the trauma of his past, whereupon they comfort each other. Ruth reluctantly allows him to take a blood sample but knocks him unconscious when the sample reveals that she is infected.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time Park saw Kaelin come {{from the back of}} the {{property}} to the front, Park testified that he saw [...] "a tall black man" [...] of Simpson's height and build enter the front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> from the driveway area, after which lights were turned on and Simpson finally answered Park's call. Simpson explained that he had overslept and would be at the front gate soon. Kaelin opened the Ashford gate to let Park drive the limo onto the estate grounds, and Simpson came out of his house through the front door a few minutes later. Both Kaelin and Park helped Simpson put his belongings (which were already outside the front door when Park drove up to the front of Simpson's house) into the trunk of the limo for the ride to the airport. Both Kaelin and Park remarked in their testimony that Simpson looked agitated. But other witnesses, including the ticket clerk at Los Angeles International Airport who checked Simpson onto the plane and a flight attendant, said that Simpson looked and acted perfectly normal. Conflicting testimony such as this was to be a recurring theme throughout the trial.|$|E
