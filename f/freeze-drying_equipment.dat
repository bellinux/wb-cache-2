40|$|In the big vacuum <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{the drying}} rate of {{materials}} is uneven at different positions. This phenomenon {{can be explained}} by the uneven distribution of vapor pressure in chamber during the freeze-drying process. In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to describe the vapor flow in the passageways either between material plates and in the channel between plate groups. The distribution of vapor pressure along flow passageway is given. Two characteristic factors of passageways are defined to express the effects of structural and process parameters on vapor pressure distribution. The affecting factors and their actions are quantitatively discussed in detail. Two examples are calculated and analyzed. The analysis method and the conclusions are useful to estimate the difference of material drying rate at different parts in equipment and to direct the choice of structural and process parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the stability of freeze-dried blackberry pulp. Firstly, both physical and chemical experiments were carried out on blackberry pulp prior to the freeze-drying process. Secondly, the freezing time for the blackberry pulp, three hours, was determined based on Plank’s method with an initial freezing temperature of - 2, 58 °C. Then, experiments with the frozen pulp were conducted in a <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>equipment</b> with three different temperature degrees: 105 °C, 110 °C and 120 °C, and a pressure factor of 1. 15 ± 0, 5 mmHg. As a result, the ideal temperature for the process {{was found to be}} 110 °C at which a product with a final humidity of 2, 5 % ± 0, 2 and excellent characteristics was obtained; varied sensorial methods were applied in order to confirm this. Besides, the adsorption isotherm for the freeze-dried product was drawn and, with both the monolayer and critical humidity data, the stability was calculated by using Labuza’s method which finally determined that the shelflife for freeze -dried blackberry pulp is 18 months...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>equipment</b> used today is {{based largely on}} {{empirical}} knowledge. The freeze-dryers used in product manufacturing have changed little since the mid- 20 th century. A typical pharmaceutical freeze-drying cycle is run as a batch process and is thus, both, time and energy intensive. The equipment design cycle adopted today relies heavily on post-concept tests. This limits the design changes that can be adopted as an outcome of these tests. For example, a single 6 hour drying test run on a production scale dryer may cost up to 1000. Moreover, the associated costs are passed onto the customers. The current work is an attempt at setting up a comprehensive modeling framework that can predict {{the performance of a}} pharmaceutical freeze-dryer in the pre-concept design stage. ^ In order to develop a modeling framework, a low temperature water vapor molecular model that could be used consistently for the temperature range used in a freeze-drying process was first developed. The variable hard sphere (VHS) model was found to predict the temperature dependence of viscosity well. Suitable values of the VHS parameters were determined. At a reference temperature of 273 K, the effective diameter of the water molecule was found to be 5. 78 A 2 ̆ 6 dot;. The value of the viscosity-temperature exponent equal to 1. 0 allows reproducing the viscosity coefficient variation up to a temperature of 373 K within 0. 5...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The main {{directions}} {{of use of}} freeze-dryed products and ingredients are revealed. The analysis of sales markets of freeze-dryed products is provided. It is shown that introduction of innovative production technologies will allow to develop dynamically {{not only to the}} large companies, but also small firms that will create prerequisites for growth of the Russian market of freeze-dryed products. Tendencies of development of the <b>freeze-drying</b> <b>equipment</b> are analysed. Relevance of development of energy saving freeze-dryers is proved The integrated approach to creation of competitive domestic technologies and the equipment for sublimation dehydration of thermolabile products consists in use of the effective combined remedies of a power supply, a process intensification, reduction of specific energy consumption and, as a result, decrease in product cost at achievement of high quality indicators. Advantages of thermoelectric modules as alternative direction to existing vapor-compression and absorbing refrigerating appliances are given. Researches of process of freeze-drying dehydration with use of thermoelectric modules are conducted. It is scientifically confirmed, that the thermoelectric module working at Peltier effect, promotes increase in refrigerating capacity due to use of the principle of the thermal pump. Options of use of thermoelectric modules in designs of dryers are offered. Optimum operating modes and number of modules in section are defined.
