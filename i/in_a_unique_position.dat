40|$|Self-injurious {{behavior}} is often defined as deliberate, repetitive, impulsive, and nonlethal harming of one's body including cutting, scratching, reopening wounds, inse 1 iing objects into the body, and breaking bones (Onacki, 2005).

40|$|Understanding the neurochemical {{basis for}} {{cognitive}} function {{is one of}} the major goals of neuroscience, with a potential impact on the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders. In this review, the focus will be on a biochemical pathway that remains under-recognised in its implications for brain function, even though it can be responsible for moderating the activity of two neurotransmitters fundamentally involved in cognition – glutamate and acetylcholine. Since this pathway – the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism - is induced by immunological activation and stress it also stands <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> to mediate the effects of environmental factors on cognition and behaviour. Targetting the pathway for new drug development could, therefore, be of value not only for the treatment of existing psychiatric conditions, but also for preventing the development of cognitive disorders in response to environmental pressures...|$|R

25|$|Morgan was {{interested}} in evolution throughout his life. He wrote his thesis on the phylogeny of sea spiders (pycnogonids) and wrote four books about evolution. In Evolution and Adaptation (1903), he argued the anti-Darwinist position that selection could never produce wholly new species by acting on slight individual differences. He rejected Darwin's theory of sexual selection and the Neo-Lamarckian theory of the inheritance of acquired characters. Morgan {{was not the only}} scientist attacking natural selection. The period 1875–1925 has been called 'The eclipse of Darwinism'. After discovering many small stable heritable mutations in Drosophila, Morgan gradually changed his mind. The relevance of mutations for evolution is that only characters that are inherited can have an effect in evolution. Since Morgan (1915) 'solved the problem of heredity', he was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> to examine critically Darwin's theory of natural selection.|$|E

This brings forth the need for school environments to be utilized in ways that are conducive to promoting student development. Much of the educational and developmental components embedded within the school system as well as experiences within greatly influence student’s health and well-being. A national statement was made a concerning American children’s education and mental health that is greatly applicable to the Canadian school system. It was stated that schools “must be active partners in the mental health care of our children” because of the “important interplay between emotional health and school success” (Lazarus & Sulkowski, 2011, pp. 15 - 16).

25|$|By November 1951, Watson had {{acquired}} little training in X-ray crystallography, {{by his own}} admission, and thus had not fully understood what Franklin was saying about the structural symmetry of the DNA molecule. Crick, however, knowing the Fourier transforms of Bessel functions that represent the X-ray diffraction patterns of helical structures of atoms, correctly interpreted further one of Franklin's experimental findings as indicating that DNA was {{most likely to be}} a double helix with the two polynucleotide chains running in opposite directions. Crick was thus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> to make this interpretation because he had formerly worked on the X-ray diffraction data for other large molecules that had helical symmetry similar to that of DNA. Franklin, on the other hand, rejected the first molecular model building approach proposed by Crick and Watson: the first DNA model, which in 1952 Watson presented to her and to Wilkins in London, had an obviously incorrect structure with hydrated charged groups {{on the inside of the}} model, rather than on the outside.

This background undoubtedly influenced his strong support for the Protestant, Unionist, opponents of the traditional Liberal policy of Irish Home Rule. He voted against the government in 1911 supporting an amendment which would have excluded any Home Rule Bill from the operation of the Parliament Bill. In April 1912, Cory was the only Liberal MP to vote against the government in the first reading of the Home Rule Bill. He voted against the Bill again on second reading repeated his rebellion on the third reading of the Bill on 7 July 1913.

Determining factors which could exert an influence on the successful achievement of this objective were examined and a theory was developed for future use. It was established that the school could foster change in society through its educational and schooling functions. It is however also true that these changes are not initiated by the school. The school is <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> to accelerate the changes which have already taken place <b>in</b> society through <b>an</b> evolutionary process.

The form of state and education systems. The availability of qualified teachers with <b>a</b> specific and <b>unique</b> combination of invaluable characteristics. The change orientated curriculum. The absence of any of these factors will delay or even wreck the use of the school as a changing agent.

Risk factors for non-communicable disease are modifiable and health professionals are <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> to intervene and influence them. Design Clinical interventions were utilized as part of the Community Interventions for Health programme, a non-randomised, controlled study undertaken in three communities – one each in China, India and Mexico. Methods All clinicians in intervention and control areas of the study were invited to complete surveys. 2280 completed surveys at baseline and 2501 at follow-up. Culturally appropriate interventions to reduce tobacco use, improve dietary intake and increase physical activity were delivered in the intervention areas. Results Clinicians in the intervention group felt more prepared to advise smoking cessation and improvement of diet. They were more likely to test serum cholesterol and blood pressure but less likely to take measurements of height, hip, waist and skinfold thickness. There were more resources available to clinicians in the intervention group and they used counselling more and complementary medicine less than those in the control group. Conclusions Community interventions which have been shown to have <b>a</b> positive effect <b>in</b> the community and workplace also change clinical practice. Relevance to clinical practice Community interventions make clinicians, including nurses, more likely to feel prepared to offer advice and more likely to use counselling.
