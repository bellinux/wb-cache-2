5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the <b>door</b> <b>closes</b> {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E
5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the <b>door</b> <b>closes</b> behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E

[...] Amy kicks at Signora Calvierri's side and disrupts a device that is hiding her true alien form. [...] They begin converting Amy into one of them when Isabella, who has yet to be fully converted, frees Amy and they escape. Isabella hesitates while escaping because she can no longer tolerate direct sunlight and is pulled back inside while the <b>door</b> <b>closes.</b> The Doctor tries to open the door but he gets shocked by electricity and collapses. Isabella is later thrown into a canal by Signora Calvierri and eaten by something that lives underwater.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{wanted the}} musical to appear like a [...] "corny and low-rent production". [...] The ensemble includes 10 actors from ages eight to twelve. [...] Though professionals, the child actors perform with a [...] "realistic lack of polish", {{as they are}} playing non-professional children of Scientologists, performing in a holiday pageant. The chorus portrays Thetans, and the reactive and analytical portions of the mind are depicted by two children who share a conjoined right brain costume. [...] During the Xenu story, the narrator is outfitted in a cardboard robot suit, and the actor portraying Xenu wears a [...] "tacky headdress". [...] Staging, costumes and set design are all made {{to appear to be}} the [...] "earnest work of schoolteachers and supportive parents trying to provide a colorful and cheery atmosphere on a small budget." [...] The stage design includes a [...] "colorful, crayon-colored backdrop of space age-like, semi-circular set pieces." [...] Costumes include white robes, rainbow-striped socks and tinsel halos. [...] Props used to denote locations include [...] "a waving cardboard palm frond for Hawaii, a street sign and cell phones for New York." [...] The musical ends with a tableau vivant, where the audience sees the cast standing {{at the back of the}} theater holding candles and singing cheerfully as a <b>door</b> <b>closes</b> and they are blocked from view.|$|E
500|$|Majora's Mask {{takes place}} {{a few months}} after [...] and begins with Link searching for his {{departed}} fairy, Navi. While riding through a forest in Hyrule on his horse Epona, Link is ambushed by the masked Skull Kid and his fairy accomplices Tatl and Tael, who steal both Epona and his musical instrument, the Ocarina of Time. Link follows them down a dark cave, where he confronts the Skull Kid, who curses him by turning him into a Deku Scrub. Tatl stops Link from going after the Skull Kid as the latter escapes with Tael through a door, but is then separated from them when the <b>door</b> <b>closes</b> behind them. Realizing she needs Link's help to find them, Tatl insists that they work together. Link follows the Skull Kid through the cave into the inside of the Clock Tower in the land of Termina. There, he meets the Happy Mask Salesman, who seemed to have been following him. The salesman offers to help Link heal his curse, in exchange for which he must retrieve both the Ocarina of Time and the Majora's Mask from the Skull Kid. The Skull Kid, having stolen the Majora's Mask from the salesman, became possessed by its overwhelming power and transformed into an uncontrollable fiend who inflicts certain misfortune on others, the worst of which is an impending apocalypse: the moon is now set to collide with the world in approximately three days time.|$|E
500|$|As {{the final}} verse {{of the song}} begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a {{stalking}} cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it {{over her shoulder and}} it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the <b>door</b> <b>closes</b> behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was and looks up at both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, [...] "Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind".|$|E

In addition, young children are vulnerable to injury when they fall against the other (hinged) side of doors and gates, striking projected hinges.

2500|$|All Utricularia are {{carnivorous}} {{and capture}} small organisms {{by means of}} bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in water-saturated soil. The traps can {{range in size from}} 0.2mm to 1.2cm. Aquatic species, such as U.vulgaris (common bladderwort), possess bladders that are usually larger and can feed on more substantial prey such as water fleas (Daphnia), nematodes and even fish fry, mosquito larvae and young tadpoles. Despite their small size, the traps are extremely sophisticated. In the active traps of the aquatic species, prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor. The bladder, when [...] "set", is under negative pressure in relation to its environment so that when the trapdoor is mechanically triggered, the prey, along with the water surrounding it, is sucked into the bladder. Once the bladder is full of water, the <b>door</b> <b>closes</b> again, the whole process taking only ten to fifteen thousandths of a second.|$|E
