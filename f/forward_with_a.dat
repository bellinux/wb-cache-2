5|$|Culverhouse was {{diagnosed}} with cancer in 1992, and died in 1994. His apparent attempt to exclude his wife from his inheritance led to posthumous revelations of extramarital affairs. Ensuing lawsuits caused an ownership crisis that almost required the team to relocate to another city, before the Glazer family stepped <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> purchase offer.|$|E
5|$|In late 2012, Seeley and Norton were {{approached}} {{by more than}} one major network to develop Revival into a television series. The deal fell through when ABC Studios announced they were moving <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different property that dealt with similar themes. A film adaptation was announced in early 2017. It will be co-written by Seeley and produced by Shatterglass Films. Diamond Select Toys has released a minimate toy of Em Cypress.|$|E
5|$|Orlando's father comes <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{piece of}} evidence—his mailbox had been stuffed with {{shredded}} banknotes. That evening, Black and Gerlach visit {{a town meeting}} organised by Edward Petey (Josh Clark), where another of the residents, Bob Birckenbuehl (Terry David Mulligan), accuses Gerlach of knowing more than he is letting on. Gerlach tells the assembly that the killer is from the community.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failed}} trick play, the Hokies' offense started at their 44-yard line. The first Tech {{play of the}} drive was a 15-yard pass from DeShazo to Still for a first down. A three-yard run by Thomas was {{followed}} by a seven-yard reverse by Still for another first down at the Tennessee 29-yard line. On first down, Thomas pushed the Hokies eight yards <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> run up the middle. This was followed by two incomplete passes, bringing up fourth down. Again, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to try to convert the fourth down rather than kick a field goal. Unlike Tech's previous fourth down, however, the try was unsuccessful after DeShazo mishandled the snap and was tackled for a loss. Virginia Tech turned the ball over on downs, and Tennessee's offense returned to the game with 1:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|At about 13:00, Wellesley went <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cavalry escort to reconnoitre the Maratha position. The rest of {{his army}} {{followed}} closely behind apart from a battalion of sepoys left at Naulniah to guard the baggage. In all, Wellesley had 4,500 troops at his disposal plus 5,000 Mysore and Maratha horse and 17 cannon. Aware that the British were nearby, the Maratha chiefs had positioned their army in a strong defensive position along a tongue of land stretching east from Borkardan between the Kailna River and its tributary the Juah. However, Scindia and Berar did not believe Wellesley would attack with his small force and had moved off from {{the area in the}} morning. Command of their army was given to Pohlmann, who had positioned his infantry to the east of the Maratha camp in the plains around the village of Assaye on the southern bank of the Juah.|$|E
5|$|Data-driven, Romney often {{played the}} role of a devil's {{advocate}} during exhaustive analysis of whether to go <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deal. He wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions. He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced R-rated films. Romney served {{on the board of directors}} of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.|$|E

5|$|In January 2006, Marvel {{reclaimed}} {{the film}} {{rights for the}} Hulk character from Universal Pictures after Universal failed to meet a deadline to develop a sequel to director Ang Lee's 2003 film Hulk. Universal retained distribution rights for future Hulk films. Instead of moving <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sequel, Marvel hired Louis Leterrier to direct The Incredible Hulk, a reboot. Leterrier initially turned down the job {{out of respect for}} Lee, but later reconsidered and signed on. The script was written by Zak Penn, who drafted a treatment for the 2003 film. In April 2006, Edward Norton entered negotiations to portray Bruce Banner and rewrite Penn's script, although Penn received sole credit for the screenplay. Production began on July 9, 2007 and filming primarily took place in Toronto, with additional filming in New York City and Rio de Janeiro. The film premiered at the Gibson Amphitheatre on June 8, 2008, and was released on June 13.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April 1918, at El Kefr, Egypt, {{during an}} attack, Rifleman Karanbahadur Rana {{and a few}} other men crept <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Lewis gun under intense fire to engage an enemy machine-gun. No. 1 of the Lewis gun team opened fire but was shot almost immediately, whereupon the rifleman pushed the dead man off the gun, opened fire, knocked out the enemy gun crew and then silenced the fire of the enemy bombers and riflemen in front of him. During the {{remainder}} of the day he did magnificent work and finally assisted with covering fire in the withdrawal, until the enemy were close on him.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, the Erie Railroad fell into debt {{along with its}} competitor, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. On September 16, 1960, the Interstate Commerce Commission {{approved}} the railroads to go <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> merger, creating the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on October 15, 1960. The new railroad lasted only 16 years. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna and several other large railroad companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations had to fight for survival. The station depot at Harriman has been closed and boarded up since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Patrick White (born January 20, 1989) is an American {{ice hockey}} center who is {{currently}} an unrestricted free agent. He most recently played with Lillehammer IK in the GET-ligaen (GET). White previously played in North America for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). Prior to joining the Golden Gophers, he played four seasons of high school hockey in the Minnesota State High School League with the Grand Rapids High School Thunderhawks. Although he was drafted twice by junior ice hockey teams—the Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 2004 and the Tri-City Storm of the United States Hockey League (USHL) in 2005—he chose to play for his high school instead. Described as a skilled <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good wrist shot, White was drafted in the first round, 25th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, before being traded to the Sharks in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Balu plays continual pranks on Geetha, {{during the}} course of which he also falls in love with her. She falls in love with him but circumstances, and their egos, prevent them both from expressing their feelings. One day, Balu pretends to suffer from chest pain, which scares Geetha, causing her to finally admit that she loves him. Later, when Geetha and Ramaiah go to Balu to enquire about his health, Balu, exiting from the bathroom, fails to see that Geetha is there. He tells Ramaiah about the prank he played on her, and that he was only pretending to have chest pain. Angry that she has been deceived by Balu, she begins to {{question}} whether or not his professed love for her is real. Hurt, she brings her friends, who are on a holiday trip to Shimla, to the residence and tries to drive Balu out of the house. When her plan backfires and her friends start supporting Balu, she becomes spiteful and tells her parents to move <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> planned marriage to Sekar (S. A. Ashokan), a relative and an air force pilot.|$|E
5|$|Eight Devils {{players have}} been {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Peter Stastny, who played for the Devils from 1989 to 1993, was inducted in 1998. A center who defected from Czechoslovakia, Stastny {{was one of the}} NHL's top goal scorers in the 1980s. In 2001, Stastny was joined in the Hall of Fame by Devils defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov, {{who was one of the}} first Soviet players in the NHL. Fetisov played for the team in the 1989–90 season and again from 1990 to 1995. Scott Stevens, a Devils defenseman from 1991 to 2004 and long-time team captain, was inducted in 2007 in his first year of eligibility. In December 2014, Stevens returned as head coach for the Devils' defense. Igor Larionov, a <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 15-year career in the NHL who spent the 2003–04 season with the Devils, was inducted in 2008. Two Devils centers were inducted in 2011: Doug Gilmour, who had played for the team from 1996 to 1998, and Joe Nieuwendyk, a member of the club from 2001 to 2003. In 2013, the Hall of Fame again inducted two former Devils players: left wing Brendan Shanahan, who had played for the team from 1987 to 1991 and again for the 2008–09 season, and defenseman Scott Niedermayer, who was a Devil from 1992 to 2004.|$|E

5|$|Ryan held a closed-door {{meeting with}} the Republican Caucus on October 20, where he {{explained}} that he would run for Speaker if he could be guaranteed an overwhelming majority of the Republican caucus would support him. Specifically, Ryan requested an increased threshold for the political maneuver of vacating the Speakership, stated that he would not lessen the amount of time he spends with his family, and requested an official endorsement from the Freedom Caucus, Republican Study Committee, and The Tuesday Group by October 23, before he could make his decision. Immediately after Ryan's announcement, Chaffetz announced that he would be dropping out of the race to support Ryan. The next day, the Freedom Caucus held a vote to determine which of its members would support Ryan; although the exact tally was not revealed, roughly two-thirds of the caucus voted to endorse Ryan. Although this was shy of the 80% vote needed for an official endorsement over Webster, both the caucus leaders and Ryan were satisfied with the result, and Ryan made efforts to move <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> potential Speaker bid.|$|E
5|$|The Milford {{area study}} has been dormant since July 2007 due to {{community}} opposition to DelDOT's proposed alternatives through Lincoln and Milford. After studying various options that included upgrading the current alignment and constructing bypass routes {{to the west and}} east of Milford, DelDOT decided to move <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pair of eastern bypass alternatives in June 2007. Both alternatives head east from US113's current alignment southwest of Lincoln, bypass the village to the south and east, have an interchange with DE 30 and Johnson Road, and meet DE1 at an interchange south of the latter highway's interchange with the south end of DE1Business. On June 15, 2007, DelDOT announced it would move forward with plans to build the bypass despite the majority of the department's advisory group of community representatives opposing the bypass, far below the required 75percent for consensus to have been achieved. On July 1, 2007, in response to DelDOT overriding its advisory group, the Delaware General Assembly passed Senate Bill 155, which prohibited DelDOT from proceeding with the US113 North/South Improvements Project in the Milford and Lincoln areas and directed DelDOT to continue to work to achieve consensus on an acceptable bypass route. Citing a lack of community consensus, DelDOT abandoned its plans for the US113 bypass of Milford in January 2008.|$|E
