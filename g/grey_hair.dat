5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or <b>grey</b> <b>hair</b> {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long <b>grey</b> <b>hair</b> attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E

25|$|The Irish Terrier is {{coloured}} golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten. Dark red {{is often}} mistaken {{as the only}} correct colour, possibly because wheaten coats are often of worse quality.

The method consists of pulling out all the <b>grey</b> <b>hairs</b> in a patient and counting the number removed. Simultaneously, the converted hairs are also snipped at the grey-black junction and counted. After a gap of 3 months, the survey is repeated to {{count the number of}} hairs which have regrowing as <b>grey</b> <b>hairs,</b> the hairs which have become grey and also the hairs which have got converted into black during this period. Such surveys are repeated at 3 months intervals {{over a period of several}} years to see the progress of <b>greying</b> of <b>hair</b> in an individual and to evaluate the effect of various therapeutic procedures...|$|R

Sprout is introduced in Philosopher's Stone, but she plays no active role until Chamber of Secrets, in which she teaches her second year students to work with Mandrake plants. She is responsible for raising the Mandrakes to full maturity, at which point their juice is used to revive the petrified victims of the basilisk.|$|E

Later that year, Cao Pi ended the Eastern Han dynasty and {{established}} the state of Cao Wei with him as its first emperor.

By then, Yu Jin was a pallid-looking {{old man with a}} head full of <b>grey</b> <b>hair.</b> He knelt down, kowtowed and cried when he met Cao Pi. Cao Pi comforted him, told him about Xun Linfu and Mengmingshi, and then commissioned him as General Who Pacifies the Borders (安遠將軍).|$|E
25|$|This theory, in {{particular}} when speculating on radiological weapons, is partly {{based on the}} findings of radioactivity on some of the clothing as well as the bodies being described by relatives as having orange skin and <b>grey</b> <b>hair.</b> However, radioactive dispersal would have affected all of the hikers and equipment instead of just some of it, and the skin and hair discolouration can be explained by a natural process of mummification after three months of exposure to the cold and winds. Furthermore, the initial suppression of files regarding the group's disappearance by Soviet authorities is sometimes mentioned as evidence of a cover-up, but the concealment of information regarding domestic incidents was standard procedure in the USSR and therefore far from peculiar. And by the late 1980s, all Dyatlov files had been released in some manner.|$|E

25|$|Up {{to about}} the 17th century Joseph tends to be {{depicted}} as a man advanced in years, with <b>grey</b> <b>hair,</b> often balding, occasionally frail, a comparatively marginal figure alongside Mary and Jesus if not entirely in the background, passive other than when leading them on their flight to Egypt. Joseph is shown mostly with a beard, not only in keeping with Jewish custom, but also because – although the Gospel accounts do not give his age – later literature tends to present him as an old man {{at the time of}} his wedding to Mary. This depiction arose to allay concerns about both the celibacy of the newly wedded couple, the mention of brothers and sisters of Jesus in the canonical Gospels, and Joseph's other children spoken of in apocryphal literature – concerns discussed very frankly by Jean Gerson for example, who nonetheless favoured showing him as a younger man.|$|E
25|$|Given {{his very}} weak heart, Poirot conceives {{that he must}} end the string of murders by killing Norton. Poirot invites Norton for hot chocolate: at their meeting, he tells Norton what he {{suspects}} and his plan to execute him. Norton, arrogant and self-assured, insists on swapping cups: anticipating this move, Poirot had drugged both cups, knowing {{that he had a}} higher tolerance for a dose that would incapacitate Norton. Poirot moves the sleeping Norton back to his room using the wheelchair: Poirot could walk, one reason he needed a new valet who was unaware of that for this last case. Then, being the same height as Norton, he disguises himself as Norton by removing his wig and false moustache, ruffling up his <b>grey</b> <b>hair,</b> then donning Norton's dressing-gown and walking with a limp. Having Hastings establish that Norton was alive after he left Poirot's room, Poirot shoots Norton, leaves the pistol on the table and locks the room with a duplicate key. Poirot then writes his story, and ceases to take his amyl nitrite heart medicine. He cannot say it was right to commit murder, but on balance he was sure he prevented yet more instigated by Norton. His last wish for Hastings is typical for Poirot, the matchmaker: he suggests that Hastings should pursue Elizabeth Cole.|$|E

The person next to this disciple is assumed to be Judas, whose dark and sinister face mirrors that of the tax collector. It has been speculated [...] first by Vasari [...] that the face on the far right is a self-portrait of Masaccio himself, as Thomas.|$|E

500|$|Xerochrysum 'Golden Bowerbird' is a hybrid, bred by a {{deliberate}} backcross of 'Cockatoo' to 'Dargan Hill Monarch' by Doug McKenzie, who applied for registration with the ACRA in 1980. (It was granted in 1981.) It has much larger flower heads than both parents, yet is a smaller shrub, which reaches [...] high by [...] wide. Denser {{than that of}} other forms, the foliage is covered in fine <b>grey</b> <b>hair.</b> On stalks around [...] above the foliage, the flower heads measure up to [...] in diameter, although larger ones up to 10cm are occasionally seen. They have around 300 bracts per flower head, compared with 80 for 'Dargan Hill Monarch' and 200 in 'Cockatoo', giving them a [...] "doubled" [...] look. It is reported as producing fewer flower heads than 'Princess of Wales'.|$|E
500|$|Gestation {{is nearly}} three months long. The number of cubs born can vary from one to eight, though the common number is three to five. Birth {{takes place in a}} {{sheltered}} place such as thick vegetation. Each cub weighs nearly [...] at birth; the eyes, shut at birth, open in 4to 11 days. Newborn cubs can crawl and spit; they can start walking by two weeks. Their nape, shoulders and back are thickly covered with long bluish <b>grey</b> <b>hair.</b> This downy underlying fur, called a [...] "mantle", gives them a Mohawk-type appearance; this fur is shed as the cheetah grows older. A study noted that this mane gives a cheetah cub the appearance of the honey badger; this could act as a camouflage in both animals. Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable during the first few weeks of their life; mothers keep their cubs hidden in dense vegetation for the first month.|$|E
500|$|Mary was not {{beheaded}} with {{a single}} strike. The first blow missed her neck and struck {{the back of her}} head.

[...] At that moment, the auburn tresses in his hand {{turned out to be a}} wig and the head fell to the ground, revealing that Mary had very short, <b>grey</b> <b>hair.</b> A small dog owned by the queen, a Skye Terrier, is said to have been hiding among her skirts, unseen by the spectators. Following the beheading, it refused to be parted from its owner's body and was covered in her blood, until it was forcibly taken away and washed. Items supposedly worn or carried by Mary at her execution are of doubtful provenance; contemporary accounts state that all her clothing, the block, and everything touched by her blood was burnt in the fireplace of the Great Hall to obstruct relic-hunters.|$|E

500|$|Jenkins's {{descriptions}} of Widmerpool's appearance are unflattering; at school he is painted as [...] "heavily built, [...] thick lips and metal-rimmed spectacles giving {{his face as}} usual an aggrieved expression... he suspected people of trying to worm out of him important information..." [...] A few years later, he is wearing more fashionable spectacles but Jenkins notes that {{he still has a}} curiously fishlike ("piscine") countenance. [...] He has a propensity to put on weight; although barely 30, Widmerpool appears to Jenkins as portly and middle-aged. [...] At the outbreak of war in 1939, in a badly cut army uniform, he resembles a music-hall burlesque of a military officer or else [...] "a railway official of some obscure country". After the war as an MP, his [...] demeanour and shape are [...] "demanding of treatment by political cartoonists". In 1958, meeting Widmerpool (then in his mid-fifties) after some years, Jenkins is shocked by his elderly appearance. His clothes are ill-fitting through weight loss, giving him the look of a scarecrow; his <b>grey</b> <b>hair</b> is sparse and his facial flesh hangs in pouches. The final glimpse of Widmerpool, in his cult milieu, reveals him as a physical wreck, looking aged, desperate and worn out.|$|E
500|$|Alf made no real {{attempt to}} contact John {{again until the}} height of Beatlemania (claiming {{he did not know}} who the Beatles were). He was working as a kitchen porter at the Greyhound Hotel at Hampton Court, in Middlesex, when someone pointed out a {{photograph}} of John Lennon in a newspaper and asked whether he was related to him. Alfred and Charlie visited one of the Beatles' Christmas shows at the Finsbury Park Empire in London. When the Beatles were filming a scene for A Hard Day's Night in the Scala Theatre in Soho in April 1964, Alf walked into Brian Epstein's NEMS office in Argyle Street with a journalist. [...] "I'm John Lennon's father", he explained to the receptionist. When Epstein was informed, he [...] "went into a panic", and immediately sent a car to bring John to NEMS office. Alf was shabbily dressed, with his unkempt, thinning <b>grey</b> <b>hair</b> greased back. He stuck out his hand, but John did not take it, saying [...] "What do you want?". Alf placated John somewhat by saying, [...] "You can't turn your back on your family, no matter what they've done." [...] Their conversation did not last long, as John soon ordered Alf and the journalist out of the NEMS office. The Beatles' personal stories were kept out of the newspapers—by agreement with journalists who were offered exclusive stories in return—but one day John opened a copy of the Daily Express and saw a photo of his father.|$|E
500|$|Basically {{yellowish}} tan or rufous to greyish white, {{the coat}} of the cheetah is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. The upper parts are {{in stark contrast}} to the underbelly, which is completely white. Each spot measures nearly [...] across. Every cheetah has a unique pattern of spots on its coat; hence, this serves as a distinct identity for each individual. Cheetah fur is short and often coarse. Fluffy fur covers the chest and the ventral side. Several colour morphs of the cheetah have been identified, including melanistic and albino forms. Black cheetah have been observed in Kenya and Zambia. In 1877–1878, English zoologist Philip Sclater described two partially albino specimens from South Africa. A ticked (tabby) cheetah was photographed in Kenya in 2012. Juveniles are typically dark with long, loose, blue to <b>grey</b> <b>hair.</b> A short mane, about [...] long, on the neck and the shoulders, is all that remains of the cape in adults. The exceptionally long and muscular tail measures , and ends in a bushy white tuft. While the first two-thirds of the tail are covered in spots, the final part is marked with four to six dark rings or stripes. The arrangement of the terminal stripes of the tail differs among individuals, but the stripe patterns of siblings are very similar. In fact, the tail of an individual will typically resemble its siblings' to a greater extent than it resembles its mother's or any other individual's.|$|E
