5|$|Laws {{should be}} {{relatively}} stable and not changed too often, as with frequently changing laws <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> {{for people to}} keep themselves updated. People {{need to know what}} the law is both for short- and long-term planning.|$|E
5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, {{it can be difficult}} to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult. In some countries, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> {{today to}} {{understand}} the allure of the caloric theory, {{at the time it}} seemed to have some clear advantages. Carnot's successful theory of heat engines had also been based on the caloric assumption, and only later was it proved by Lord Kelvin that Carnot's mathematics were equally valid without assuming a caloric fluid.|$|E
50|$|As {{an example}} in {{applying}} the same logic, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> {{to solve a}} 25-case problem {{than it would be}} to solve an n-case problem, and then apply it to the case where n=25.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to parallelise {{since there}} is no {{guarantee}} the writes do not interact, and many systems are still designed assuming that a hardware cache will coalesce many small writes into larger ones.|$|R
50|$|The {{result is}} that the number of ways for noise to make the {{receiver}} choosea neighbor (hence an error) grows as well. This is a fundamental limitationof block codes, and indeed all codes. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to cause an error toa single neighbor, but the number of neighbors can be large enough so thetotal error probability actually suffers.|$|R
25|$|Soft Mouth Springers {{are taught}} to deliver game with a soft mouth, meaning he does not {{puncture}} it with his teeth. The game should always be fit for the table. If a springer damages the bird, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> mouthed. This is a serious fault, {{but it can be}} difficult to determine whether it may have been genetic or caused by poor training methods. Breeders generally avoid using any springer that is hard mouthed.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} people joining {{organised}} dog sports with their terriers. The obedience training required at a certain level in most dog sports is fairly easy, though the precision and long-lasting drive needed in the higher levels {{may be hard to}} achieve. Many Irish Terriers excel in dog agility, even though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to balance the speed, independence and precision needed in the higher levels. To date there is one Agility Champion in the US, and a handful of Finnish and Swedish Irish terriers compete at the most difficult classes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{forms of}} {{intangible}} performance include status symbols, {{such as a}} corner office, and increased autonomy and freedom. Increased autonomy demonstrates trust in an employee, may decrease occupational stress and improve job satisfaction. A 2010 study found positive relationships between job satisfaction and life satisfaction, happiness at work, positive affect, {{and the absence of}} negative affect which may also be interrelated with work motivation. Since <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for an employee to achieve a similar level of trust in a new organization, increased autonomy may also help improve retention.|$|E
50|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} disables {{species from}} roaming around freely. This can cause many problems, {{but one of}} the major problems is that as habitats become more fragmented <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> for animals to reproduce. This causes the decline in numbers which makes it difficult for any species to thrive. None of these hotspots have more than one-third of their pristine habitat remaining.|$|R

30|$|However, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> {{to actuate}} a larger paper. If {{the size of}} the paper is A 4 size (210 mm Ã— 297 mm), the motion <b>may</b> <b>be</b> slow and small that the {{observer}} can not perceive. Additionally, since each actuator requires about 100 mA for its actuation in current implementation, downsizing, unwiring, and power-saving technology is essential for the deployment from place to place in living space.|$|R
25|$|The wing bar {{is unique}} among living {{whistling}} ducks. When on the ground, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> {{to discern the}} light flanks present {{in many of these}} waterfowl. The fulvous whistling duck (D. bicolor) is the only sympatric whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe, and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly {{rather than the other way}} around. Juvenile D. autumnalis are quite similar to young of the white-faced whistling duck (D. viduata), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides, as their thin white vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a general}} {{distribution}} of the process , <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to solve these dynamic programming equations. The situation simplifies dramatically if the process [...] is stagewise independent, i.e., [...] is (stochastically) independent of [...] for [...] In this case, the corresponding conditional expectations become unconditional expectations, and the function , [...] {{does not depend on}} [...] That is, [...] is the optimal value of the problem ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{less common}} {{preceding}} scene of Moses being {{left in the}} reeds is formally called The Exposition of Moses. [...] In some depictions this {{is shown in the}} distance as a subsidiary scene, and some cycles, mostly illustrating books, show both scenes. [...] In some cases <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to distinguish between the two; usually the Exposition includes Moses' mother and sister, and sometimes his father and other figures.|$|E
50|$|The {{extinction}} debt concept {{may require}} {{revision of the}} value of land for species conservation, as the number of species currently present in a habitat <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> a good measure of the habitat's ability to support species (see carrying capacity) in the future. As extinction debt may last longest near extinction thresholds, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hardest</b> to detect the threat of extinction for species that conservation could benefit the most.|$|R
50|$|Countershading is a {{usually a}} darker {{shade of the}} body color rather than the near-black of {{primitive}} markings on bay duns, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to differentiate between countershading and a dorsal stripe on light-colored horses such as red duns. In such cases, pedigree analysis, DNA testing, studying possible offspring, {{and the presence of}} other primitive markings are used to determine whether a horse is a dun.|$|R
50|$|When practical, it {{is usually}} {{considered}} better for the vehicle going downhill to yield {{the right of way}} by stopping at a wide spot. The reason seems to <b>be</b> that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> for the vehicle going up to get started again. At least in California, it is also the vehicle going downhill that must back up, if it is too late to stop at a wide spot.|$|R
2500|$|Spill {{occurs when}} sound is {{detected}} by a microphone {{not intended to}} pick it up (for example, the vocals being detected by the microphone for the guitar). [...] Spill is often undesirable in popular music recording, as the combined signals during the mix process can cause phase cancellation and may cause difficulty in processing individual tracks. It also causes difficulty in overdubbing, where the spill from the sound being replaced may still be audible on other channels. For sound reinforcement in live shows, mic bleed can make it hard for the sound engineer to control the levels of the different instruments and vocals onstage. For example, if an electric guitarist's loud amplifier is bleeding into the drum and vocal mics, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for the sound engineer to reduce the volume of the guitar in the onstage mix.|$|E
2500|$|Steam engines have {{considerably}} less thermal efficiency than modern diesels, requiring constant maintenance and labour {{to keep them}} operational. Water is required at many points throughout a rail network, making it {{a major problem in}} desert areas, as are found in some regions of the United States, Australia and South Africa. In places where water is available, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard,</b> which can cause [...] "scale" [...] to form, composed mainly of calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide and calcium sulfate. Calcium and magnesium carbonates tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside the surfaces of pipes and heat exchangers. This precipitation is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration. The resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes. In boilers, the deposits impair the flow of heat into the water, reducing the heating efficiency and allowing the metal boiler components to overheat.|$|E
2500|$|Voting for elected {{officials}} {{is important for}} the homeless population to have a [...] "voice" [...] in the democratic process. Equal access to the right to vote is a crucial part of maintaining a democracy. However, in some jurisdictions, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for homeless people to vote, if they do not have identification, a fixed address, or a place to receive mail. Voting enables homeless people to play a part in deciding the direction of their communities by voicing their opinions on local, regional and national issues that are important and relevant to their lives. With each election, low income and homeless individuals vote at a lower rate than people with higher incomes, despite the fact that many policy decisions directly impact people who are economically disadvantaged. Currently, issues such as raising the minimum wage and funding certain social welfare and housing programs are being debated in the U.S. Congress and in communities around the country. In order for the government to represent the people, citizens must voteâ€”especially those who are economically disadvantaged.|$|E
50|$|In the US, {{financial}} transactions begin with mutual identification between the customer {{and the financial}} institution. Although there are many Internet frauds involving fake financial institutions or criminals masquerading as a financial institution (i.e., phishing), the more difficult requirement is for the prospective customer to show acceptable identification to the bank. For basic relationships, a government-issued identification document, such as a passport or driver's license, usually suffices. For foreign nationals, their country's equivalent <b>may</b> <b>be</b> accepted, although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to verify.|$|R
2500|$|Taking {{pictures}} {{of police officers}} in many circumstances was made illegal by a 2015 [...] "Citizens' Security Law" [...] with the stated purpose of protecting police officers and their families from harassment. The law has generated controversy because <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to denounce police brutality. A far more limited version of the law had been in effect for several decades regarding when police work related to terrorism. A person was fined under this law for taking and publishing online a photograph of an illegally parked police car.|$|R
50|$|Organics {{are common}} {{throughout}} the outer solar system, including meteorites, and comets. So when organics are found on Mars, {{the first thing}} to be decided is {{whether or not it is}} biological in origin. If it is related to Earth life, and sufficiently well preserved, this can be detected though search for DNA, RNA, ATP and other key molecules associated with life on Earth. But if it is not related to Earth life, then <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to decide whether it is the result of biological processes.|$|R
2500|$|Roan is a horse coat {{color pattern}} {{characterized}} by an even mixture of colored and white hairs on the body, while the head and [...] "points"â€”lower legs, mane and tailâ€”are mostly solid-colored. [...] Horses with roan coats have white hairs evenly intermingled throughout any other color. The head, legs, mane and tail have fewer scattered white hairs or none at all. The roan pattern is dominantly-inherited, and is found in many horse breeds. [...] While the specific mutation responsible for roan has not been exactly identified, a DNA test can determine zygosity for roan in several breeds. True roan is always present at birth, though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to see until after the foal coat sheds out. The [...] coat may lighten or darken from winter to summer, but unlike the gray coat color, which also begins with intermixed white and colored hairs, roans do not become progressively lighter in color as they age. [...] The silvering effect of mixed white and colored hairs can create coats that look bluish or pinkish.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of whether the Nash equilibria of a game can be computed in polynomial time. Evidence from Nash's original 1951 paper suggests that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to solve a 3 -player game than a 2 -player game, since in the 3 -player case, the resulting probabilities <b>may</b> <b>be</b> irrational. Our main result here is that the problem of solving a game for any constant number of players, is reducible to solving a 4 -player game. This confirms a widely-held belief in the computer science community that no game <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> than bridge...|$|R
50|$|Jumbo {{mortgage}} loans are {{a higher risk}} for lenders, mainly due to their larger size rather than credit quality. This is because if a jumbo mortgage loan defaults, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to sell a luxury residence quickly for full price. Luxury prices are more vulnerable to market highs and lows in some cases. That is one reason lenders prefer {{to have a higher}} down payment from jumbo loan seekers. Jumbo home prices can be more subjective and not as easily sold to a mainstream borrower, therefore many lenders may require two appraisals on a jumbo mortgage loan.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> {{at times}} to bring this thought home to our minds: but it is none the less true because we forget it; {{and if we do}} not choose to bring it home to our own minds, it will be sooner or later brought home to them whether we choose or not.|$|E

50|$|The Innocence Protection Act allows convicted {{individuals}} {{access to}} DNA testing if they meet certain conditions, {{such as the}} possibility that testing could produce new material evidence that would raise a reasonable probability that the individual did not commit the offense. Among other restrictions, it limits new testing to evidence that was not previously tested and generally requires it to be done within 36 months of conviction. All fifty U.S. states have passed statutes related to access to post-conviction DNA testing. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> for inmates to access such testing in some states than others.|$|R

50|$|Maximizing {{the sail}} area can cause more {{difficult}} handling. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to tack a genoa than a jib, since the overlapping area can become tangled with the shrouds and/or mast unless carefully tended during the tack. Genoas are {{very popular in}} some racing classes, since they count only the foretriangle area when calculating foresail size; a genoa allows {{a significant increase in}} actual sail area within the calculated sail area. In boats where sail restrictions are not applicable, genoas of 180% overlap can be found, although those over 150% are not often seen, since the additional area is shadowed by the mainsail when close hauled and generates diminishing returns in terms of power per actual sail area.|$|R
