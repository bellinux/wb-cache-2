40|$|The {{brain is}} our most {{important}} organ and perhaps the least well understood. Our brain is the “command station” for our body. It controls what we think, what we feel and what we do. It {{is the home of}} our emotions and personality. It makes sense of our experiences. But how does the brain work? The truth is that, after decades of research, scientists and doctors are only now beginning to figure out that question. We know that different types of cells in the brain work together to form certain areas which have specialist roles in memory, vision and logical thinking. We also know that hormones and chemicals influence our brain and our emotions and that we are very sensitive to changes in their levels. We know that the different brain areas mature at different stages and are connected by tracts, rather like railway lines, which can sometimes go astray and lead to illnesses. And finally we know that by looking in the blood we can find clues, called biomarkers, which may ultimately help us to understand and predict brain disorders. Through this book we want to help everyone to understand the workings of the brain through pictures and cartoons.

40|$|Like {{the ancient}} critters shown in these pages, Oregon Geology {{falls to the}} inexorable march of time. This will be our final issue in this print-based format. Stay tuned for {{articles}} on Oregon’s fascinating and varied geology in blog and other media outlets. Meanwhile, in this issue enjoy some recent findings from Oregon’s fossil hunters. I {{want to take this}} opportunity to offer recognition and thanks to everyone who has contributed to Oregon Geology throughout its lifespan starting in 1979. The issues contain a treasure trove of factual and historical information about Oregon’s lands, landforms, and geoscientists. Both Oregon Geology and the earlier published Ore Bin are frequently the starting point for me when gathering information for everything from Legislative testimony to classroom presentations. I know I am not the only one, as we still sell hardcopy publications in the Nature of the Northwest Information Center and the online resource gets a fair number of hits. That tells me that although we cannot continue with Oregon Geology in its current format we should continue to offer a venue to distribute geologic and geoscientific information outside of our more formal publications. Suggestions are welcome—just <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>website</b> to submit or give me a call. DOGAMI continues to evolve and change as well. We are constantly responding to environmental changes such as new statewide policies, calls for smaller government, and different demands for our mission and information. Since the last publication of Oregon Geology five years ago we have closed the Grants Pass Field Office, moved the Nature of the Northwest Information Center, and turned our lidar data collection program into a nationally recognized success story. As I gaze into the cloudy crystal ball of our future I see much more collaboration with new state programs such as the Regional Solutions Progra...|$|E
