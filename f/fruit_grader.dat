In this study, a range of experiments was carried out to investigate the quantification of bruises and the prediction of bruising in relation to mechanical handling systems. In order to understand apple bruising, a study of free normal impact between pairs of apples was conducted. There was a 2 / 5 power relationship between contact area and impact energy. The coefficient of restitution varied in a non-linear manner with impact energy, decreasing as impact energy increased. Bruise damage produced by a typical New Zealand-made <b>fruit</b> <b>grader</b> was critically analysed. A large percentage of individual bruises was under 1 cm 2 in area and it was rare to have any bruises above 3 cm 2. The total number of bruises was found to be the best indicator of bruise susceptibility. A new method of predicting such bruises has been developed involving a new term, the Bruise Factor, which was related to bruising sustained during handling operations, allowing for the variation in fruit size, shape and mass. An Instrumented Sphere (IS) was used to characterize impacts on commercial packing lines. It was found that the IS could be used to identify apple-to-apple impacts likely to cause bruising in commercial packing operations, providing care is taken with interpretation of the data. Typical impacts on packing lines were represented by impacts onto a flat steel surface, a rubber pad, a plastic tube, a solid plastic bar, and onto another fruit. Impact tests were conducted on freshly picked Gala, Splendour, Fuji, Braeburn, and Granny Smith apples, all grown in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. Bruise areas produced by impact onto flat steel, rubber, plastic tubing, and a solid plastic bar were found to be linearly correlated with the peak acceleration recorded by an Instrumented Sphere dropped from the same heights. Following fruit-to-fruit impacts, bruising was generally more severe on one of the two apples. When the results of apple-to-apple and IS-to-apple impacts were compared, {{it was found that the}} area of the larger of the two bruises produced in fruit-to-fruit impacts was directly related to the peak acceleration recorded by the IS when it was dropped onto a fruit from the same height. For each variety and each surface the drop height required to produce a critical bruise with a surface area of 1 cm 2 (as measured with the skin removed) was determined. By joining the threshold points on each surface response line, a threshold potential bruise boundary was formed on a velocity change against peak acceleration graph. The boundary curve, which included apple-to-apple impact, was hyperbolic in shape, rather than the linear boundary described in other studies. The implications of the results to the fruit industry are discussed in this study...|$|E

As late as the 1880s, a fruit bunch of seven or more hands was considered a 'first,' meaning that it received the highest going market price. Bunches with six or fewer hands were second or third grade fruit for which growers generally received less money. By the 1890s, shippers such as the Boston Fruit Company were raising the standard 'bunch count' to eight and nine hands, a shift that favored varieties such as the Gros Michel that tended to produce high bunch counts when grown under favorable agroecological conditions. Increasingly, <b>fruit</b> <b>graders</b> discounted and/or rejected seven- and six-hand bunches particularly during seasonal lulls in demand. Fruit bunches with scars, bruises, or other blemishes were also subject to discounting and outright rejection." ...|$|R
