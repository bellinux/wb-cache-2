500|$|Designer Milton Knight {{recalled}} that [...] "audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier Cool World. The premiere audience I saw it with certainly did." [...] The critical {{reaction to the}} film was generally negative. Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "The DJ who was hosting the radio station's free preview of Cool World leaped onto the stage and promised the audience: 'If you liked Roger Rabbit, you'll love Cool World!' He was wrong, but you can't blame him—he hadn't seen the movie. I have, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>now</b> promise {{you that if you}} liked Roger Rabbit, quit while you're ahead." [...] The film was a box-office disappointment. While other film projects followed, Bakshi began to focus more attention on painting.|$|E
500|$|After an {{undisclosed}} financial settlement was agreed Mills left Alfreton {{to return to}} Tamworth, who at this time were in the Conference National, for a second spell as manager on 26 January 2007. He joined with the team 24th in the table and following his appointment he said: [...] "It feels fantastic to be back. It is an amazing football club {{that means a lot}} to me". He was in charge for the home match against Crawley Town the day after his appointment, the visitors winning 1–0 with a 54th minute Mark Wright goal. Mills was unable to keep Tamworth up, the club being relegated to the Conference North with a 22nd-place finish in the Conference National. He stated his determination to get the club back up, saying: [...] "The disappointment will go away because this is a great football club to be at. We all need to stay proud and positive and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>now</b> prepare a squad for the start of next season." [...] Tamworth spent most of 2007–08 in midtable, eventually finishing 15th in the Conference North; the Tamworth Herald claimed it was [...] "among the poorest campaigns in the club's history".|$|E
