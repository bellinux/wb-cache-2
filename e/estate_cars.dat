5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or <b>estate</b> <b>cars</b> or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E

25|$|Front {{suspension}} uses {{a separate}} spring and damper {{with a rubber}} top mount. The rear suspension of the W124 features the Mercedes multi-link axle introduced in 1982 with the Mercedes 190 and which is now standard on many modern cars. <b>Estate</b> <b>cars</b> (and optionally, saloons and coupés) had Citroen-like rear self-leveling suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, gas-filled suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet pressurizing pump. Unlike the traditional Citroën application Mercedes opted for a fixed ride height and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static ride height when parked.|$|E
25|$|Larger, more {{powerful}} vehicles {{are used by}} Road Policing Units, Armed Response Vehicles {{due to the fact}} that they carry out tasks such as pursuing stolen cars, responding to emergencies in a larger area, or carrying a larger amount equipment than an IRV. It is for that reason that many of the vehicles are in estate car (Station wagon) form. These vehicles tend to be Volvo V70 T5's with a 2.4 litre turbocharged petrol engine or Vauxhall Vectras with 2.8 litre V6, or the new Vauxhall Insignia. As with IRVs, diesel engines are becoming more common such as the BMW 5 Series 3.0 litre diesel which are heavily used by the Metropolitan Police Service. As well as <b>estate</b> <b>cars,</b> 4x4 (SUVs) such as Range Rover, Land Rover Discovery (LR3), BMW X5 or Mercedes M class vehicles are used especially for Motorway patrols. Police officers are required to undergo specialised training before being authorised to drive them.|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, most {{statutory}} NHS {{ambulance services}} deploy paid first responders who drive dedicated [...] "Rapid Response Vehicles" [...] (RRVs). These are typically <b>estate</b> <b>cars,</b> MPVs or 4x4s, are liveried with high-visibility ambulance markings, and fitted with blue flashing lights and sirens. These vehicles are generally single-crewed, by a Paramedic. This differs from most ambulances in the UK, which usually have two crew members.|$|E
2500|$|This {{class is}} known as {{supermini}} in the UK, subcompact in North America. [...] Superminis have three, four or five doors, and even as an estate shape. They are designed to seat four passengers comfortably. Current supermini hatchbacks are approximately 3900nbsp&mm long, while saloons and <b>estate</b> <b>cars</b> are around 4200nbsp&mm long. Currently (2013) sedan variants are generally not available in Europe and are marketed {{at a lower price}} than hatchback models in North America.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>estate</b> <b>cars</b> (chassis {{designation}} S124) came in 5- or 7-seat models, the 7-seater {{having a}} rear-facing bench seat that folded flush luggage compartment cover and an optional (in the US until 1994) retractable cargo net. [...] To provide a flat loading {{floor with the}} seat folded down, the T-model's rear seat squab was mounted about [...] higher than in saloons, robbing rear seat passengers of some head room. The S124 estate continued in production alongside the new W210 until the S210 estate launched {{more than a year}} later. A two-door coupé version was also built, with the chassis designation C124.|$|E
