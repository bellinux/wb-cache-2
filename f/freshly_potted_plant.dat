40|$|Flowering or foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> are {{ornamental}} items usually {{grown in}} greenhouses under optimal growing conditions. Cultivation in protected environments allows for rapid growth and high quality characteristics. When plants reach the desired commercial size {{they can be}} transferred to hardening greenhouses or directly sent to the distribution chain. The growing and post-production conditions such as storage and transportation can have very deleterious effects on the ornamental quality of plants. The major post-production disorders are bud and flower abscission in flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> or leaf abscission or yellowing in foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants.</b> On the other hand, the ornamental quality of <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> is extremely important and depends on the number and colour of flowers or leaves, flower, leaf and plant longevity. The presence of flowers on flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> depends on flower longevity and turnover. The colour and size of leaves of foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> is linked to pre- and post-production environmental conditions. The post-production quality losses of flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> can be mainly ascribed to natural flower senescence. This phenomenon is highly regulated by plant hormones such as ethylene and abscisic acid, but the post-production environment can dramatically influence plant hormone equilibrium. Quality losses of foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> are mainly due to leaf senescence usually associated with inadequate acclimatization from the production area to the post-production chain...|$|R
30|$|Three clones ({{referred to}} as A, B and C) of grafted Pinus radiata, {{hereafter}} {{referred to as}} the <b>potted</b> <b>plants,</b> known to be susceptible to the pathogens Phytophthora kernoviae and P. pluvialis, were used in this investigation. The <b>potted</b> <b>plants,</b> supplied from the Radiata Pine Breeding Company Ltd. (Rotorua, New Zealand), were obtained in mid-autumn from the Scion nursery (Rotorua, New Zealand) and were equilibrated for two weeks in a controlled environment cabinet (20 / 15 °C, 70 % relative humidity, 12  h photoperiod, 500  μmol m- 2  sec- 1 light) prior to treatment application. All treatments were applied to one-year-old needles located on the main leader of the <b>potted</b> <b>plants.</b> There were three <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> of each clone for each treatment, such that all treatments were replicated three times, with three experimental units per clone (three clones x three <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> of each clone).|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the demand for <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for interior decoration at various points of sale in Poznan. The results were based on questionnaires filled by clients of three retail sale points with pot plants: flower shop, horticultural centre and building material market in Poznan and its surroundings. Collected information was analysed for a frequency of purchases, amount of money spent on <b>pot</b> <b>plants,</b> place of purchases, occasions for which plant was bought, preferences of buyers and pattern of purchases. Customers purchase plants in various points of sale from 7 to 9 <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> per year, mostly in horticultural centres and in spring. Plants are used for interior decoration and are cultivated for many years, however cut flowers are more often chosen for a gift than <b>pot</b> <b>plants.</b> Whereas a significant part of building material market customers cultivate flowers <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for a short time, and they buy <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for a gift as often as cut flowers. Among plants with flowers Phalaenopsis and Anthurium are selected most frequently, and Zamioculcas and Yucca among plants with decorative foliage. While choosing plants, buyers are guided by the overall appearance and price. ...|$|R
40|$|Reducing indoor {{heat gain}} from the roof into the {{building}} means reducing the cooling energy consumption of air conditioning system hence increase indoor comfort. Apart from its high initial installation cost, green roof is proven {{to be the best}} way in dealing with the issue of indoor heat gain in a building thus contributes in reducing urban heat island effect. Green roof also called eco-roof or vegetated roof is described as a roof that is planted with specific vegetation above a waterproofing membrane. A study in Malaysia suggested that <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> as an alternative to more economic green roof and its potential in dealing with indoor heat gain needs further exploration. <b>Potted</b> <b>plants</b> are plants grown in containers or <b>pots</b> instead of <b>planting</b> them in the ground. This study investigated the potential of <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> as an affordable alternative tool to green roof application in reducing indoor temperature in tropical climate regions. Four similar test cells equipped with data acquisition system were built. Each top of the cell is treated with four different design variables; <b>potted</b> <b>plants,</b> vegetated, non-vegetated 150 mm depth soil layer and a bare top surface. Indoor peak heat value and lowest value were recorded and analyzed. At heat peak hour, <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> managed to reduce a daily average of 8. 7 % indoor heat gain whereas vegetation cell only managed to reduce an average of 7. 9 % indoor heat gain. <b>Potted</b> <b>plants</b> were also found to reduce a daily average of 35. 5 % of total heat transfer amount compared to 28. 5 % in vegetated cell. Based on these results <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> appear to offer an alternative strategy towards reducing indoor temperature. In conclusion, this study suggests that <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> could provide an affordable way especially to urban population in their strategy to deal with the high energy consumption for coolin...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: The {{phenomenon}} {{of global warming}} or climate change has led to many environmental issues including higher atmospheric temperatures, intensive precipitation, increase greenhouse gaseous emission and of course increase indoor discomfort condition. Researchers worldwide collectively agreed that one way of reducing the impact of global warming is by implementing green roof technology which integrates vegetation, growing medium and water proofing membrane {{on top of the}} roof surface. However, none of them have ever studied on how much the <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> on the roof top could contribute to lessen the environmental problems. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> on flat roof on the indoor temperature inside building in Malaysian climate. Approach: This study emphasized on experimental approach of the room with flat roof. Measurements were conducted in two phases i. e., room with <b>potted</b> <b>plant</b> on the roof and room with bare roof. The measurements were conducted on the same room. Results: The experiment showed a promising result whereby the average indoor temperature dropped between 0. 21 and 1. 73 °C had been observed during the measurements, while average indoor surface temperatures difference between roof with <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> and bare roof of 7. 86 °C had been recorded during daytime hour. Conclusion: <b>Potted</b> <b>plants</b> on flat roof had a great potential in reducing the indoor temperature of the room underneath and could contributed to the reduction of energy consumption in building...|$|R
