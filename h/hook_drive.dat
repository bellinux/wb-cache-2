Their application can be found, for example, in machine tools, textile, printing, sewing machines, etc. This mechanical object was used in the design of a sewing machine <b>hook</b> <b>drive.</b> The <b>hook</b> <b>drive</b> is composed by a four-bar linkage and a cam mechanism with radial conjugate cams and an oscillating roller follower. The main aim of the kinematic synthesis was to determine the optimal characteristic parameters of the cam mechanism <b>hook</b> <b>drive.</b> As the criterion for the determining of the most appropriate dimensions, it was chosen the pressure angle course in the proposed mechanical system. Another goal of the computational analysis was the determining of the cam mechanism dynamic behavior and properties, which are expressed in the Hertzian pressure course and estimated rating life of curve roller bearings...|$|E

50|$|A {{tent peg}} (or tent stake) is a spike, usually with a hook or {{hole on the}} top end, {{typically}} made from wood, metal, plastic, or composite material, pushed or driven into the ground for holding a tent to the ground, either directly by attaching to the tent's material, or by connecting to ropes attached to the tent.

5000|$|Ryan Gardner of AbsolutePunk {{awarded the}} album 7/10 stars and stated: [...] "The fun thing about The Cinema is how evident {{it is that}} Antelman and Malpass have so much fun doing it. As {{mentioned}} are songs {{in all areas of}} the spectrum here - the more mellow “Turn It On,” the <b>hook</b> <b>driven</b> “Ghost,” and the most flamboyant pop song with “Weekend.” Even the three part vocal melody on “Punchline” is something I haven’t really heard before. The album feels similar to My Blood Is Full of Airplane but also throws some unexpected segments - the guitar part near the end of “Talking In Your Sleep” - that break from the norm. The experimentation does have some missteps, but there’s still a little something here for everyone - fans of The Cinema’s previous record, Lydia’s Devil, synth-heavy music, and pop music." ...|$|R

5000|$|Reception for {{the song}} was very mixed. Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone said that the song was [...] "annoying", and added that, [...] "wherein Lewis even sings [...] "desperation" [...] just like Men at Work's Colin Hay.

[...] Steve Morse of The Boston Globe {{thought that it was}} one of the band's more [...] "serious" [...] songs.

Hogan <b>hooked</b> his <b>drive</b> into the very deep rough and took three strokes {{to get on the}} fairway: he made a 25 ft putt to save double-bogey, but Fleck's regulation par sealed the upset by three strokes, 69 to 72.|$|R

Cora asks about his wife and children. Sgt. Hook admits to Cora that he made them up as a shield against wives at posts who relentlessly try to fix up bachelors. Cora exclaims that she always suspected the wife and daughters were fictitious. Quito makes a remark in Apache dialect. Sgt. Hook looks affectionately at Quito and says he now needs to learn English, as he hands a delighted Quito the reins and lets the young boy pretend to <b>drive.</b> Sgt. <b>Hook</b> slips an arm around Cora.

Bulla, the only American to make the 36-hole cut, began the final round on Friday afternoon four strokes behind Fallon. At the second hole, he <b>hooked</b> his <b>drive</b> over the parallel 17th fairway and into a railway yard; he finished with a round of even-par 73 and established a clubhouse lead of at even par 292. Burton, setting out just as Bulla was finishing, needed a 72 to win the title and came to the 18th needing a par four. He hit a drive over 300 yd, pitched to 15 ft, then holed the birdie putt for a two-shot win.|$|R

500|$|Utilising both {{conventional}} {{technique and}} audacious shots, Macartney pierced {{the field with}} a variety of cuts, <b>hooks,</b> pulls, <b>drives</b> and glances. He teased the fielders with deliberate deflections through the slips; his late cuts were described by Raymond Robertson-Glasgow as being [...] "so late they are almost posthumous". Macartney's attack helped his partner Bill Woodfull to settle in the difficult conditions. Macartney saved his severest hitting for George Macaulay, a medium pace swing bowler and off spinner whom he regarded as England's most potent bowler. Macartney had asked for and received permission from captain Herbie Collins to target Macaulay's bowling. By the end of the Australian innings, Macaulay had figures of 1/123 and was never to play against Australia again. Macartney's confidence was such that he charged down the pitch to meet the medium pace bowlers, a dangerous tactic on a surface with erratic bounce.|$|R
5000|$|Ballesteros three-putted the 17th to {{fall out}} of contention, but Kite had 12 feet for birdie on 18 to tie Nicklaus. Kite barely missed his putt on the high side to miss a playoff by one shot. Norman, left for dead after his double-bogey on 10, birdied 14, 15 and 16 to pull within one shot of the lead. After <b>hooking</b> his <b>drive</b> way left on 17, Norman made an {{incredible}} shot between two pines to within eight feet. Norman buried the birdie putt, his fourth straight, to tie for the lead. Norman then hit a perfect drive on 18, needing birdie for his first major championship. However, Norman pushed his approach shot into the gallery and subsequently missed his 15 ft par putt to finish one stroke behind. Nicklaus had stormed back, shooting 30 on the back nine, to win his sixth Masters title and became the oldest Masters champion at age 46.|$|R
5000|$|Tenterhooks are hooks in {{a device}} called a tenter. Tenters were {{originally}} large wooden frames which {{were used as}} far back as the 14th century in the process of making woollen cloth. After a piece of cloth was woven, it still contained oil from the fleece and some dirt. A craftsman called a fuller (also called a tucker or waulker) cleaned the woollen cloth in a fulling mill, and then had to dry it carefully or the woollen fabric would shrink. To prevent this shrinkage, the fuller would place the wet cloth on a tenter, and leave it to dry outdoors. The lengths of wet cloth were stretched on the tenter (...) using tenterhooks (<b>hooked</b> nails <b>driven</b> through the wood) all around the perimeter of the frame to which the cloth's edges (selvedges) were fixed, so that as it dried the cloth would retain its shape and size. In some manufacturing areas, entire tenter-fields, larger open spaces full of tenters, were once common.|$|R
25|$|Kapil was a right-arm pace bowler {{noted for}} his graceful action and potent outswinger, and was India's main strike bowler {{for most of}} his career. He also {{developed}} a fine inswinging yorker during the 1980s, which he used very effectively against tail-enders. As a batsman, he was a natural striker of the ball who could <b>hook</b> and <b>drive</b> effectively. A naturally aggressive player, he often helped India in difficult situations by taking the attack to the opposition. Nicknamed The Haryana Hurricane, he represented the Haryana cricket team in domestic cricket. He retired in 1994, holding the world record for the most number of wickets taken in Test cricket, a record subsequently broken by Courtney Walsh in 2000. At the time, he was also India's highest wicket taker in both major forms of cricket, Tests and ODIs. He is the only player in the history of cricket to have taken more than 400 wickets (434 wickets) and scored more than 5,000 runs in Tests, making him one of the greatest all-rounders to have played the game.

Notwithstanding my hurry, I stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world. My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than vision, Miss Isabella's springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the animal, and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could have got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so. While untying the knot round the hook, {{it seemed to me that}} I repeatedly caught the beat of horses' feet galloping at some distance; but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o'clock in the morning.|$|R
