5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E

5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E

5|$|On 29 August, Murray {{commanded}} A Company—which {{consisted of}} <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> hundred men—in a successful attack that captured Mouquet Farm under heavy fire. His men repelled four German counterattacks before he {{ordered them to}} withdraw. He remained in command until the next morning, when he fainted from loss of blood from two wounds he had sustained during the action. Murray was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his service during the action, an event that was published in a supplement of the London Gazette dated 14 November 1916. He was later evacuated to England aboard the hospital ship Asturias, and admitted to the 4th General Hospital, London, where he was to share a ward with Albert Jacka and Percy Black, who were recovering from wounds received at Poziéres and Mouquet Farm respectively. After nearly six weeks of recuperation, {{he returned to the}} 13th Battalion in France on 19 October.|$|E
5|$|Most teleost {{species are}} oviparous, having {{external}} fertilisation with both eggs and sperm being {{released into the}} water for fertilisation. Internal fertilisation occurs in 500 to 600 species of teleosts but is more typical for Chondrichthyes and many tetrapods. This involves the male inseminating the female with an intromittent organ. <b>Fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> in a million of externally fertilised eggs survives to develop into a mature fish, {{but there is a}} much better chance of survival among the offspring of members of about a dozen families which are viviparous. In these, the eggs are fertilised internally and retained in the female during development. Some of these species, like the live-bearing aquarium fish in the Poeciliidae family, are ovoviviparous; each egg has a yolk sac which nourishes the developing embryo, and when this is exhausted, the egg hatches and the larva is expelled into the water column. Other species, like the splitfins in the family Goodeidae, are fully viviparous, with the developing embryo nurtured from the maternal blood supply via a placenta-like structure that develops in the uterus. Oophagy is practised by a few species, such as Nomorhamphus ebrardtii; the mother lays unfertilised eggs on which the developing larvae feed in the uterus, and intrauterine cannibalism has been reported in some halfbeaks.|$|E

5000|$|A {{commonly}} asserted [...] "rule" [...] {{for weight}} gain or loss {{is based on}} the assumption that one pound of human fat tissue contains about 3,500 kilocalories (often simply called calories in the field of nutrition). Thus, eating 500 <b>fewer</b> calories <b>than</b> <b>one</b> needs per day should result in a loss of about a pound per week. Similarly, for every 3500 calories consumed above the amount one needs, a pound will be gained.|$|R

40|$|AbstractHistorically, the {{algorithm}} for completely solving the symmetric tridiagonal eigenvalue {{problem is the}} TQR algorithm. Rational variants of TQR were used when only the complete spectrum of eigenvalues was desired since they {{have the advantage of}} avoiding square roots. Several historical variants of TQR use <b>fewer</b> operations <b>than</b> the <b>one</b> used in LAPACK; however, these variants have known accuracy problems. In this paper a new variant of TQR is developed which is similar to parts of the variant proposed by Sack (1972). This variant has <b>fewer</b> operations <b>than</b> the <b>one</b> in LAPACK, which results in faster timings, and it avoids the accuracy problems of the other historical variants. In addition, it is shown how the eigenvectors can be recovered from the rational algorithms...|$|R
