40|$|This paper aims to {{shed light}} on the {{determinants}} of <b>household</b> labor <b>supply</b> by conducting comparative study and by applying the collective labor supply model. On the basis of data from Generations and Gender Survey (GGS) we tested parametric restrictions imposed by two alternative (unitary and collective) <b>household</b> labor <b>supply</b> models on Georgian, French and Romanian data sets. Our comparison of <b>household</b> labor <b>supply</b> behavior and patterns reveals some similarities, but also several differences across countries. First, the study results suggest that own and partner’s wages, and distribution factors are important determinants of <b>household</b> labor <b>supply</b> in all countries in this study. Second, we found some similarities in the preference structures and in the impact of personal and demographic characteristics on the household behavioral patterns across countries. Third, the study results show that the <b>household</b> labor <b>supply</b> patterns across countries differ substantially. Fourth, we found that collective model is not equally applicable for describing <b>household</b> labor <b>supply</b> in different labor market regimes. For France and Romania, the evidence supports appropriateness of the collective <b>household</b> labor <b>supply</b> model, while in Georgia <b>household</b> labor <b>supply</b> behavior cannot be adequately described by either unitary or collective model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the recent {{audit of the}} utility distribution meters in a petrochemical plant. These meters measure the steam, condensate, natural gas, water, nitrogen and air flows to the different process units within the plant. This audit started {{as an attempt to}} resolve discrepancies between the 650 PSIG steam distribution and <b>supply</b> <b>meters.</b> Theoretically the sum of the 650 PSIG steam flows to the units should have matched the total of the steam supplied to the plant. However, in this plant the monthly totals of the distribution were consistently 15 % - 25 % lower than the <b>supply</b> <b>meter</b> totals. The plant is billed {{on the basis of the}} <b>supply</b> <b>meters.</b> Therefore, these discrepancies represented a significant utility cost, approximately $ 150, 000 a year, that was arbitrarily allocated among the different units. The plant commissioned an audit of the 650 PSIG distribution and <b>supply</b> <b>meters.</b> The purpose of this audit was to: 1. Certify that there were no users not monitored by the existing distribution meters. 2. Verify the operability and accuracy of the meters. Hopefully, the results of the audit would allow the plant to account for at least 90 % of the steam supplied. This accounting was necessary for equitable distribution of utility costs and accurate determination of unit production costs. The project was eventually expanded to include all utility streams. The audit of the following utilities was funded and implemented due to their relatively high unit costs: 650 PSIG steam, 200 PSIG steam, natural gas, and nitrogen. The audit of the other utilities is planned but a schedule has not been established...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} economic growth with unemployment due to labor market rigidities. The economy consists of a firm that maximizes profits, of a government and of two types of households that maximize inter-temporal utility. One <b>household</b> <b>supplies</b> skilled labor at the first labor market, the other <b>household</b> <b>supplies</b> simple labor at the second labor market. The government in the economy raises taxes and uses its revenues to employ labor receiving unemployment benefits, to finance transfers to the household in the second labor market and to finance public spending. We analyze both the version with exogenous growth {{as well as an}} endogenous growth variant, where growth is made endogenous by assuming positive externalities of capital. The exogenous growth model is characterized by global determinacy while it is locally indeterminate. The endogenous growth model can be globally indeterminate with the high balanced growth path being locally indeterminate and the low balanced growth path being locally determinate. We also study how taxation and how the speed of the wage adjustment affect the economy. Economic growth Unemployment Flexicurity...|$|R

The model is estimated using a paneldata set of Dutch couples. The paneldata allow for the inclusion of random effects.
