40|$|The Digital TV {{is already}} {{a part of our}} daily lives. There are {{different}} systems that make possible to bring it to our homes. These systems were developing by the DVB-Project Group. The most important are DVB-T (terrestrial), DVB-C (cable) and DVB-S (satellite). Even so and due to the changing needs of users in the field of communications and entertainment, there are new challenges that the currents standards are not able to satisfy. Therefore becomes necessary to revise the current standards of DVB. One of these new necessities are the mobile entertainment. The large increase in mobile phones and <b>hand-held</b> <b>terminals</b> in the society and the improvements in content distribution raised the need to bring it to these devices. As a result was created the DVB-H, a standard that allows you to download content for mobile devices, allowing greater mobility and a battery saving 90 % if compared with its counterpart in DVB-T. DVB-H is a standard that makes it possible to deliver live broadcast television to <b>hand-held</b> <b>terminals.</b> It is developed from the DVB-T standard, which makes it possible to send DVB-H signals in the DVB-H/T frequency band 470 - 862 MHz.
