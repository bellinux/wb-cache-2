Our objective is to create an interactive edutainment MR framework for users to learn about nature and human beings. MitsuDomoe, an interactive ecosystem simulator of virtual creatures in a petri dish, comprises three species of primitive artificial creatures. MitsuDomoe simulates the predation chain of the virtual creatures in the petri dish, and users can interact with this ecosystem via the petri dish interface. Users can also experience <b>immersive</b> <b>observation</b> by wearing HMD. By combining the MR petri dish and immersive virtual reality (VR) interfaces, we synergistically improve user understanding of the experience...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{calls to}} {{question}} what impact the public {{nature of the}} Finnish breadline has on the levels of stigmatisation, {{in combination with the}} socio and spatial impacts. The effects are concerned predominately with those that use the breadline, but also the general public and those that provide the aid. Areas studied looked at how those using the food aid felt they were perceived by people around them and how it affected behaviour and emotions. Did it have any effect on the local social relations and class and how those with perceived higher status acted in return? Finally how did the queue directly impact the area? The breadline studied was in Kallio, Eastern Helsinki; a mixed area known for being a traditional working class area with a reputation for being slightly rough, but also a trend setting area with low level gentrification. This and other breadlines have been a focus of media interest, generally concerned with how so many people are being forced to turn to it for help in spite of the reputation of solid welfare state. The lines involve a long wait, and hence become very public affairs due to often being in busy, town areas. In comparison the British system of food charity is a more private affair. Provisions are made through the use of food banks with no large queues, which removes the element of public view; would those in need of food aid find this a more acceptable method for help? The main form of research was through the process of <b>immersive</b> <b>observation</b> and observations combined {{with the use of a}} small-scale questionnaire. A thematic analysis revealed several common themes and methods with which users of food aid were able to utilise in order to help deal with some of the stigmatisations and their created societal class. The results led to a conclusion that the use of public space is problematic in terms of welfare aid. Not only does it does it further increase stigmatisation of the people in the line and how they deal with it, but also it directly effects the area. There is further evidence to indicate there is a power struggle for 'ownership' of the area between the general public, those using the breadline but also those that provide it. The area of study has become a home for social friction. In conclusion there are good grounds and supportive evidence, both in practise and from breadline user preference, to favour a different practise of food aid...|$|E

Abstract This thesis represents live and on-going research into the recent literary movement that has been termed ‘the new nature writing’. A focus within this movement has arisen which employs particular alertness to aural soundscapes in wild nature. This focus, which {{for the purposes of the}} thesis I am limiting to the British Isles, appears to be an increasing attempt to harness the human ear and employ it as a tool for ‘seismic’ effect. The method used, which I have termed ecoseismology, works at the intersection of the sensory and the literary; by using deep listening to external soundscapes it aims to achieve an integrative, internal effect through rendering of experience. Ecoseismology is a response to an intense period of ecological and environmental uncertainty. It is guided by <b>immersive</b> <b>observation,</b> often forensic in its closely-heard detail, where ecological particularities and sonorous dimensions of the natural world are sensed and rendered. Ecoseismology sensitises the listener and the reader in order to achieve shifts in scale where awareness moves from the particular, close-up, ‘heard’ and ‘felt’ experience towards thinking about more ecosensitive ways of living on the planet. To locate the spectrum of experience and output encompassed by ecoseismology the thesis exposes its three stages. By applying these stages to nature writings of the last ten years, texts that use or fit the ecoseismic method are identified. At the heart of these stages is the ecoseismic moment: a re-imagining of crisis provoking thought about the wider ecosystem which is intended to be a catalyst for change. The two ‘classic’ otter books which inspired the creative part of the submission, Otter Country, In Search of the Wild Otter, (shortened to Otter Country from here), are measured against ecoseismology. Then Otter Country’s own ecoseismic structure, which entails a quest for increased understanding of an elusive wild mammal, is measured. Alongside the sensory aspects of close encounter in this new otter narrative, issues of wider ecology are triggered, but didactic solutions are not directly sought. Thoughts provoked by this last aspect of Otter Country provide directions for further research: is it more effective to make readers feel, or to urge them to act? How is this movement within the new nature writing spreading to other genres and media, and what forms will it take, what effects will it have...|$|E

40|$|Two primary reasons {{affect the}} {{performance}} of social entrepreneurs: the lack of resources and knowledge. Consequently, business incubators offer tangible and intangible resources to support early stages entrepreneurs. Researchers and practitioners have identified {{advantages and disadvantages of}} design for social innovation. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive evidence of how these practices can be adopted at an operational level, or {{in the early stages of}} social entrepreneurship. The study context is within a Chilean social organisation called Socialab, which supports social entrepreneurship in early-stage development. This research explores the challenges of nascent social entrepreneurs and the potential application of design in this type of enterprise. The data was collected through exploratory research which includes interviews and <b>immersive</b> <b>observations</b> of social entrepreneurs and mentors within Socialab. Initial findings are given as a result of the analysis of the data collected and the review of the existing literature...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{assisted}} {{therapy has}} the potential to transform rehabilitation options available, and to dramatically increase the reach of today's healthcare system. Yet challenges persist in rendering translational application designs that optimize the full potential of technology and create value for the patient and the therapist. In a step towards optimizing value of technologies for practical applications to support very weak patients who might otherwise be unable to participate in traditional therapies, an integrated sensory motor training station was designed and developed. Inspired by recent neuroscientific research findings the goal of the design was to provide concurrent first person perspective <b>immersive</b> action <b>observation</b> of both virtual and real elements for motor and sensory experience; the system incorporates a virtual limb proxy that can be personalized and actuated by the robot and that is accompanied by exercise practice in peripersonal space for a plasticity promoting experience for the hand and arm. The station uses virtual reality and real objects for visual sensory experience, real objects also provide tactile sensory experience, and an exoskeleton upper limb robot provides assistance to patients. For many patients, successful movement and movement intensity required in rehabilitation is not achievable without the robot assistance. The multi-sensory features of the system promote a top-down strategy for training the upper limb (hand and arm) complementing the robot training; the system is ideally targeted for weak patients and those with tactile or proprioception sensory loss and those who are known to benefit from multi-sensory experiences...|$|R
