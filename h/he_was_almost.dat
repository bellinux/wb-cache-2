5|$|During his {{military}} career he had blood vomits, such as before the Battle of Salta; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> {{too ill to}} participate in the battle. It is thought that those vomits originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress, and not in the respiratory system, because the vomits were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. Nothing was revealed in the autopsy.|$|E
5|$|During the 1848 revolution, San Martin left Paris {{and moved}} to Boulogne-sur-Mer, a small city in {{northern}} France. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> blind and had many health problems because of his advanced age, but continued to write letters and {{keep in touch with}} the news from South America. Shortly after receiving the news of the Argentine victory against the Anglo-French blockade, he died, three o'clock on 17 August 1850.|$|E
5|$|He {{then went}} {{through a series of}} jobs, {{including}} employment as a caretaker, a cook for a departmental survey party and as a leading hand at the Canberra incinerator. By 1951 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> crippled with osteoarthritis, and soon after was admitted to the Queanbeyan Private Nursing Home, where he died on 25 August 1972; he was buried with full military honours in the Ex-Servicemen's section of Woden Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not be taken out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of The Old Man and the Sea (1952), Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> killed in two successive plane crashes that left him in pain or ill health for much of his remaining life. Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida, (1930s) and Cuba (1940s and 1950s), and in 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where he killed himself in mid-1961.|$|E
5|$|Without the {{financial}} backing he had enjoyed {{during his time}} in Formula Ford, Webber and his team struggled to find the money to fund their 1997 championship campaign. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> forced to quit halfway through the season, but was able to obtain significant financial and personal support from Australian rugby union legend David Campese, which helped him to complete the year. Mark has since stated {{he has been able}} to pay back the money Campese gave him.|$|E

5|$|Beadle's de jure {{recognition}} of the post-UDI government in 1968 outraged the Wilson administration and drew accusations from the British Prime Minister and others that he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> removed from the Privy Council, but kept his place following Wilson's electoral defeat soon after. Beadle retired in 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences. He died in Johannesburg on 14 December 1980, aged 75.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1920 Bruce {{made many}} {{journeys}} to the Arctic regions, both for scientific and for commercial purposes. His failure to mount any major exploration ventures after the SNAE is usually attributed to {{his lack of}} public relations skills, powerful enemies, and his fervent Scottish nationalism. By 1919 his health was failing, and he experienced several spells in hospital {{before his death in}} 1921, after which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> totally forgotten. In recent years, following the centenary of the Scottish Expedition, efforts have been made to give fuller recognition to his role in the history of scientific polar exploration.|$|E
5|$|Born in Swetes, Antigua, Ambrose came to cricket at a {{relatively}} late age, having preferred basketball in his youth, but quickly made an impression as a fast bowler. Progressing through regional and national teams, he was first chosen for the West Indies in 1988. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> immediately successful and remained in the team {{until his retirement in}} 2000. On many occasions, his bowling was responsible for the West Indies winning matches which seemed lost, particularly in association with Courtney Walsh. Against Australia in 1993, he took seven wickets while conceding a single run; in 1994 he was largely responsible for bowling England out for 46 runs, taking six for 24 (six wickets for 24 runs).|$|E

5|$|Brad Keselowski won {{the pole}} position, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> immediately passed by Tony Stewart {{at the start}} of the race. Many Chase for the Sprint Cup participants, including Jimmie Johnson, Kurt Busch, and Hamlin, were in the top ten for most of the race, although some encountered problems in the closing laps. Stewart was leading the race with two laps remaining but ran out of fuel, giving the lead, and the win, to Bowyer. There were twenty-one lead changes among eight different drivers, as well as eight cautions during the race.|$|E
5|$|But by {{the time}} he {{captured}} the position, the rest of his company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the trench and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able {{to move out of the}} trench, he was hit by a bullet in his head. As he succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's {{first years}} as earl were {{predominantly}} {{concerned with the}} Scottish Wars. He had no personal interest in the region, but the Welsh Marches, where his landed interest lay, were largely pacified at the time, and Scotland presented {{a good opportunity to}} pursue military glory and reward. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> immediately trusted with important military commands on the northern border, and served as warden of Scotland from 1308 to 1309, and as captain of Scotland and the northern marches in 1309. He led an expedition to relieve the castle of Rutherglen in December 1308. The war effort, however, was not pursued with the same intensity by EdwardII as it had been by his father. The new king's neglect of the Scottish Wars allowed Robert the Bruce to regain the initiative in the war.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Gordon won {{the pole}} position, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> immediately passed by Kasey Kahne {{at the start}} of the race. Many Chase for the Sprint Cup participants, including Jimmie Johnson and Carl Edwards encountered problems during the race. Kyle Busch was leading the race with three laps remaining but ran out of fuel, giving the lead, and the win, to Kurt Busch. There were a total of eight cautions during the race and thirteen lead changes among four different drivers during the race.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{followed}} {{his father and}} grandfather, both four-star admirals, into the United States Navy and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. He became a naval aviator and flew ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers. During the Vietnam War, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. While McCain was on a bombing mission over Hanoi in October 1967, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the North Vietnamese. He was {{a prisoner of war}} until 1973. McCain experienced episodes of torture and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer. The wounds that he sustained during war have left him with lifelong physical disabilities.|$|E
5|$|While he was {{the third}} {{president}} of West Georgia College, Boyd increased faculty, degrees, programs, and both undergraduate and graduate enrollment on the campus. Boyd racially integrated the campus in 1963, unprompted by a court order, and oversaw immense construction projects that dramatically expanded the campus to support the increased (and future) enrollment. Hired away {{to serve as the}} University System of Georgia's Vice Chancellor for Academic Development in 1970, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> immediately reassigned to be Georgia Tech's interim president. During his tenure at Georgia Tech from 1971 to 1972, Boyd resolved difficult issues in the attempted takeover of the Engineering Experiment Station by previous Georgia Tech president Arthur G. Hansen and the poor performance of (and corresponding alumni calls to remove) head football coach Bud Carson.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer {{to work as a}} sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's pecking order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit {{for the start of the}} 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|While Cagney was in New York, his brother, who had {{effectively}} {{become his}} agent, angled {{for a substantial}} pay raise and more personal freedom for his brother. The success of The Public Enemy and Blonde Crazy forced Warner Bros.' hand. They eventually offered Cagney a contract for $1000 a week. Cagney's first film upon returning from New York was 1932's Taxi!. The film is notable for not only being {{the first time that}} Cagney danced on screen, but it was also the last time he allowed himself to be shot at with live ammunition (a relatively common occurrence at the time, as blank cartridges and squibs were considered too expensive and hard to find to use in most motion picture filming). He had been shot at in The Public Enemy, but during filming for Taxi!, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> hit.|$|E
5|$|Tolliver was {{slated to}} compete with Tommy Maddox for the backup quarterback spot at Atlanta as {{training}} camp rolled around. Halfway through August, Maddox was released, and Tolliver was made the primary backup behind Chris Chandler. Tolliver played his first NFL game since 1994 on September 7, 1997 against the Carolina Panthers. He completed 7 of 17 passes for 79 yards. After relieving Chandler again the following week, Tolliver was slated to start the next game against the 49ers, in what became his only starting appearance of the season. He was slated to start again against the Denver Broncos, but instead came in late in the game. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> able to lead the Falcons to a comeback victory over the Broncos, completing six of nine passes for 85 yards and a touchdown, but he instead lost to the then-undefeated Broncos as the team remained winless. When Chandler went down with an injury in late October, coach Dan Reeves chose to start Tony Graziani. Shortly afterwards, Tolliver was released by the Falcons. In early November, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac was lost for the season due to a broken collarbone. As a result, the Chiefs signed Tolliver to a two-year contract as the third-string quarterback to replace him. Tolliver finished the season having completed 64 passes in 116 attempts for 677 yards, five touchdowns, and one interception. Only one of the 116 attempts came as a Kansas City quarterback. The 1998 preseason began with Tolliver competing with Pat Barnes for the third-string quarterback job, but this ended when Tolliver was released by the Chiefs in August.|$|E
