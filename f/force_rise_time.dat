40|$|Force–velocity (F–V) {{relationships}} were determined for single frog muscle fibres during {{the rise of}} tetanic contraction. F–V curves obtained using isotonic shortening early in a tetanic contraction were different from those obtained at equivalent times with isovelocity shortening, apparently because changing activation early in the contraction leads, in isovelocity experiments, to changing force and changing series elastic extension. F–V curves obtained with isotonic and with isovelocity shortening are similar if the shortening velocity in the isovelocity trials is corrected for series elastic extension. There is a progressive shift in the scaling of force–velocity curves along the force axis {{during the course of}} the tetanic rise, reflecting increasing fibre activation. The time taken for F–V curves to reach the steady-state position was quite variable, ranging from about 50 ms after the onset of contraction (1 – 3 °C) to well over 100 ms in different fibres. The muscle force at a fixed, moderately high shortening velocity relative to the force at this velocity during the tetanic plateau was taken as a measure of muscle activation. The reference velocity used was 60 % of the maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) at the tetanic plateau. The estimated value of the fractional activation at 40 ms after the onset of contraction was used as a measure of the rate of activation. The rate of rise of isometric tension in different fibres was correlated with the rate of fibre activation and with Vmax during the plateau of the tetanus. Together differences in rate of activation and in Vmax accounted for 60 – 80 % of the fibre-to-fibre variability in the rate of rise of isometric tension, depending on the measure of the <b>force</b> <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> used. There was not a significant correlation between the rate of fibre activation and Vmax. The steady-state F–V characteristics and the rate at which these characteristics are achieved early in contraction are seemingly independent. A simulation study based on F–V properties and series compliance in frog muscle fibres indicates that if muscle activation were instantaneous, the time taken for force to rise to 50 % of the plateau value would be about 60 % shorter than that actually measured from living fibres. Thus about 60 % of the <b>force</b> <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> is a consequence of the time course of activation processes and about 40 % represents time taken to stretch series compliance by activated contractile material...|$|E

40|$|Existing {{microactuator}} limitations prevent {{control of}} small-scale, spin-stabilized vehicles. These applications require actuators insensitive to shock that have {{forces on the}} order of Newtons and millisecond control periods. This research presents batch-fabrication lamination approaches for the realization of large arrays of high-impulse, short-duration gas generator actuators (GGAs), and system implementation approaches to integrate these GGAs into a small-scale, spin-stabilized projectile for the purpose of generating steering forces on the projectile. Electronic packaging and MEMS processing are combined to batch-fabricate millimeter-scale GGAs insensitive to large shocks. Robust, prefabricated thermoplastic and metal films are patterned by laser machining or photolithography, and multilayer devices are assembled by adhesive lamination. The GGAs remained operational after 10, 000 g shocks. Optimized design and propellant selection enables control of the force profile and actuation timing. Rapid <b>force</b> <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> are achieved using appropriately selected solid propellants and specially designed hot-wire igniters that create a larger combustion fronts. By reshaping the combustion profile of the solid propellant, tens of Newtons are generated within milliseconds. In addition to force control, the timing of the force application was controllable to within 1 ms for optimized GGAs. Performance results demonstrate that GGA actuator arrays actuate within appropriate timescales and with enough authority to control a 40 mm projectile with a spin rate of 60 Hz. After actuator characterization, GGAs, control electronics, and power supply are mounted into a 40 mm diameter projectile, and a full flight system was flown to demonstrate divert authority of the GGAs.

40|$|AIM: Peripheral muscle {{dysfunction}} often {{occurs in}} patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The muscle dysfunction may be caused by a loss of force-generating capacity, resulting from a loss of muscle mass, as well as by other alterations in contractile properties of skeletal muscle. METHODS: The maximal isometric voluntary strength and fatigability were determined in hand-grip and quadriceps muscles from nine male COPD patients (FEV(1) 30 - 50 % predicted) and control subjects matched for fat-free mass (FFM), physical activity level and age. Contractile properties and fatigability of the quadriceps muscle were also studied with electrically evoked isometric contractions. RESULTS: The maximal voluntary force (MVC) and fatigability of the handgrip muscle did not differ between the COPD patients and control subjects. Also the MVC of the quadriceps muscle and the rate of <b>force</b> <b>rise,</b> contraction <b>time,</b> force-frequency relationship and fatigability, as determined with electrically evoked contractions, were similar {{in patients with}} COPD and control subjects. CONCLUSION: Skeletal muscle strength, contractile properties and fatigability are preserved in patients with moderate COPD and a normal FFM and activity level. This suggests that skeletal muscle dysfunction does not take place during moderate COPD until cachexia and/or a decline in physical activity occur...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Treadmill animal {{models are}} {{commonly}} used to study effects of exercise on bone. Since mechanical loading induces bone strain, resulting in bone formation, exercise that induces higher strains is likely to cause more bone formation. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} effect of slope and additional load on limb bone strain. METHODS: Horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces on left fore-limb (FL) and hind-limb (HL) of twenty 23 -week old female Wistar rats (weight 279 ± 26 g) were measured for six combinations of SLOPE (- 10 °, 0 °, + 10 °) and LOAD (0 to 23 % of body mass). Peak force (Fmax), rate of <b>force</b> <b>rise</b> (RC), stance <b>time</b> (Tstance) and impulse (Fint) on FLs and HLs were analyzed. RESULTS: For the FL, peak ground reaction forces and rate of <b>force</b> <b>rise</b> were highest when walking downward - 10 ° with load (Fmax = 2. 09 ± 0. 05 N, FLRC = 34 ± 2 N/s) For the HL, ground reaction forces and rate of <b>force</b> <b>rise</b> were highest when walking upward + 10 °, without load (Fmax = 2. 20 ± 0. 05 N, HLRC = 34 ± 1 N/s). Load increased stance time. Without additional load, estimates for the highest FL loading (slope is - 10 °) were larger than for the highest HL loading (slope is + 10 °) relative to level walking. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, walking downward has a higher impact on FL bones, while walking upward is a more optimal HL exercise. Additional load may have a small effect on FL loading...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{present the}} design, {{fabrication}} and characterization of fully soft pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) with low threshold pressures that {{are intended for}} direct cardiac compression (DCC). McKibben type PAMs typically have a threshold pressure of at least lOOkPa and require rigid end fittings which may damage soft tissue and cause local stress concentrations, and thus failure points in the actuator. The actuator design I present is a variant on the McKibben PAM with the following key differences: the nylon mesh {{is embedded in the}} elastomeric tube, and closure {{of the end of the}} tube is achieved without rigid ends. The actuators were tested to investigate the effects of mesh geometry and elastomer material on force output, contraction, and <b>rise</b> <b>time.</b> Lower initial braid angles and softer elastomer materials provided the best <b>force,</b> contraction, and <b>rise</b> times; Up to 50 N of force, 24 % contraction, and response times of 0. 05 s were achieved at 100 kPa. The actuators exhibited low threshold pressures (< 5 kPa) and high rupture pressures (138 kPa - 720 kPa) which suggest safe operation for the DCC application. These results demonstrate that the actuators can achieve <b>forces,</b> displacements, and <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> suitable to assist with cardiac function. by Steven Obiajulu. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Force {{characteristics}} of skeletal muscle of knockout mice lacking creatine (Cr) {{due to a}} deletion of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) were studied in situ. Medial gastrocnemius muscles of anesthetized GAMT-deficient (GAMT-/-) and control (Con) littermates were stimulated at optimum length via the sciatic nerve at different stimulation frequencies (60 - 250 Hz). GAMT-/- mice showed reduced maximal tetanic and twitch force, reduced relative force at 60 Hz, and increased relaxation times. High-intensity fatigue protocols consisting of 30 successive isometric or dynamic contractions showed a strong reduction in force {{at the beginning of}} the series in GAMT-/- mice, followed by a smaller reduction compared with Con littermates toward the end of the series. Cr supplementation for 2 days in GAMT-/- animals (GAMT(Cr) -/-) resulted in normalization to Con values for relaxation times, relative force at lower stimulation frequencies, and relative force during 30 isometric contractions. Force per muscle mass, however, remained decreased. Furthermore,GAMT(Cr) -/- mice showed differences compared with both Con and unsupplemented animals in maximal rates of <b>force</b> <b>rise</b> and relaxation <b>times</b> during the isometric protocol as well as in force during the dynamic protocol. Our results show that the absence of Cr plays a direct role in relaxation times, maximal rate of <b>force</b> <b>rise,</b> and <b>force</b> production during high-intensity fatigue protocols. The lower force per muscle mass, however, is probably caused by other factors; i. e., high intracellular guanidinoacetate concentrations...|$|R

30|$|The right {{panel of}} Fig.  4 shows the {{relationship}} between the amplitude and the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the PI. The vertical axis indicates the magnetic field amplitude of the PI. The horizontal axis indicates the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the PI. The <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> in the speed jump simulations are shorter than those in the density jump simulations. The <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> is determined by the time in which the solar wind discontinuity passes through the effective length of the magnetosphere. The solar wind velocity in the speed jump simulations is higher than that in the density jump simulations. Therefore, the <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> in the speed jump simulations are shorter than those in the density jump simulations. In both the speed jump and density jump simulations, the PI amplitude increases as the PI <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> decreases. This tendency {{is the same as the}} relation between the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> and the amplitude of the DL investigated by Araki et al. (2004). On the other hand, a difference is that the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the PI is shorter than that of the DL. The <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the PI is at most 90 s, while the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the DL is at least 1.5 – 9 min. We can estimate the effective length of the PI from the product of the solar wind velocity and the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> in our simulation results, which is ~ 3.5 Re from the speed jump simulations. This indicates that the effective region of the PI is more localized than that of the DL, which has an effective length of 30 Re. The reason for the short PI <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> is that the dynamo generating the FAC is localized in the dayside magnetosphere. We next discuss the mechanism by which the dynamo generates the magnetic field disturbance on the ground via the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system.|$|R
