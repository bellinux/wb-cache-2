5|$|Once Cloudsgate Citadel {{is back to}} normal, {{the party}} speaks to King Zenith who informs them of Mortamor's doings and how to reach the <b>Dread</b> Realm. Mortamor plans on merging both worlds. The partyâ€™s horse fuses with Pegasus, {{allowing}} the party to fly to the <b>Dread</b> Realm. Several challenges await in the <b>Dread</b> Realm, with one such challenge being the party's strength suddenly and unexpectedly plummeting. With the help of two Supreme Sage brothers, Benjamin and Isaac, the party enters Mortamor's Castle. After solving many puzzles, they {{come face to face}} with Mortamor and defeat him. Isaac reveals that the <b>Dread</b> Realm is falling apart and Pegasus helps them escape. After returning to the Real World, everyone parts ways, with Ashlynn having to return to the Dream World since her Real World self doesn't exist anymore. With Mortamor's link between the Real World and the Dream World severed, the Dream World vanishes, with only Cloudgate Castle being the remaining visible portion in the Real World. It's then shown that Ashlynn is in the castle, taking care of the newly hatched Zenithian Dragon.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} styles of <b>dreads.</b> Solid Coloured <b>Dreads</b> are made from a single coloured fibre. Candycane <b>Dreads</b> are made using two or more colours twisted together to give a candycane effect. Blended <b>Dreads</b> are made from a blend of different colours {{to create a more}} subtle tone. Transitional <b>Dreads</b> start in one colour and end with the tip being another colour. Natural Style <b>Dreads</b> are made from the same synthetic materials but resemble natural dreadlocks.|$|R

5|$|Having {{retired from}} cricket, Ambrose has {{concentrated}} on music, playing with several bands. He played bass guitar with the reggae band Big Bad <b>Dread</b> and the Baldhead; one fellow band member was his former team-mate Richie Richardson. Ambrose was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Nation (KCN) by the Antiguan Barbudan government on 28 February 2014, alongside Richardson and Andy Roberts.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the BBC Three series Being Human {{became popular}} in Britain. It {{featured}} an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol. Another popular vampire-related show is CW's The Vampire Diaries. The continuing {{popularity of the}} vampire theme has been ascribed {{to a combination of}} two factors: the representation of sexuality and the perennial <b>dread</b> of mortality.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with the founder of DBC (<b>Dread</b> Broadcasting Corporation) considered to be the first black owned pirate station in Europe, Leroy Anderson described some of the present day pirate stations as a joke. He did however acknowledge stations that are doing good things and mentioned Genesis FM as an example.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, Fisher {{returned}} to his old post as First Sea Lord; he had been created 1st Baron Fisher in 1909, taking the motto Fear God and <b>dread</b> nought. This, combined with a government moratorium on battleship building, meant a renewed focus on the battlecruiser. Fisher resigned in 1915 following arguments about the Gallipoli Campaign with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas are}} {{reflected}} in the arrangement and composition of the album, which lead to a sound of <b>dread</b> and dissonance. The band used a number of less common instruments to achieve this sound; in addition to the orchestra and choir, Neon Bible features a hurdy-gurdy, mandolin, accordion and pipe organ. Win Butler has said that in conceiving the album he hoped for a more stripped-down sound but the songs demanded further instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Great Aunt Joyce and Uncle Dick - Unseen characters, {{they are}} often {{mentioned}} by Victor and Margaret, as an aging and grim couple and Victor and Margaret <b>dread</b> having {{anything to do with}} them. Great Aunt Joyce is mentioned as having a glass eye and has the habit of knitting bizarre items (such as six-fingered gloves) for Victor. Uncle Dick has a wooden arm; in the final Comic Relief (2001) episode, it transpires that a nurse had mistakenly placed a drip in the false arm for 18 hours after a trip to hospital after trying to remove a kidney stone with a wire coat hanger.|$|E
50|$|Wool <b>dreads</b> give {{a similar}} look to real <b>dreads</b> {{and are very}} soft. Wool can range in many colors that cannot be recreated in {{synthetic}} hair, and therefore they give a certain appeal to cybergoths who tend to coordinate {{with a lot of}} different colors.|$|R

6000|$|He {{insisted on}} their {{staying at a}} {{commercial}} hotel at Savannah. Whenever she went to lie down, which was frequently, he played poker and drank highballs. He tried in his sincerest way to amuse her. He took her to theaters, restaurants, road-houses. He arranged a three days' hunting-trip, with a darky cook. He hired motor-boats and motor-cars and told her every [...] "here's a new one," [...] that he heard. But she <b>dreaded</b> his casual-seeming suggestions that she drink plenty of champagne; <b>dreaded</b> his complaints, whiney as a small boy, [...] "Come now, Unie, show a little fire. I tell you a fellow's got {{a right to expect}} it at this time." [...] She <b>dreaded</b> his frankness of undressing, of shaving; <b>dreaded</b> his occasional irritated protests of [...] "Don't be a finicking, romantic school-miss.

5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} morbid <b>dread.</b> Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect {{may or may not be}} present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.|$|E
5|$|Metroid <b>Dread</b> was a 2D side-scrolling action-adventure {{video game}} by Nintendo, {{intended}} for release on the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It {{was to be}} the next entry in the Metroid series of video games, and a sequel to the 2002 Game Boy Advance title Metroid Fusion. It was first seen in an official internal software list made by Nintendo in 2005 and a reveal at the Electronic Entertainment Expo convention in 2005 and 2006 was anticipated; it was not revealed in either year, and is the only title to date on the list that has not been revealed.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s and 1980s saw {{a wave of}} landbased pirate radio, {{broadcasting}} {{mostly in}} big cities. These included community-focused local stations such as Sunshine Radio in Shropshire and Radio Jackie in south west London. In London pirate stations emerged that, {{for the first time}} in UK radio broadcasting, focused on particular music genres such as Radio Invicta (92.4 FM) Europe's first soul station, started in 1970. Kiss FM (dance), Solar Radio (soul), Raiders FM, Radio Amanda and Radio Floss (rock) and <b>Dread</b> Broadcasting Corporation (reggae).|$|E

60|$|We are on {{a perilous}} margin when we begin to look passively at our future selves, and see our own figures led with dull consent into insipid misdoing and shabby achievement. Poor Lydgate was {{inwardly}} groaning on that margin, and Will was arriving at it. It seemed to him this evening as if the cruelty of his outburst to Rosamond had made an obligation for him, and he <b>dreaded</b> the obligation: he <b>dreaded</b> Lydgate's unsuspecting good-will: he <b>dreaded</b> his own distaste for his spoiled life, which would leave him in motiveless levity.|$|R
5|$|Van der Weyden {{may have}} drawn {{influence}} from Stefan Lochner's c.1435 Last Judgement, {{and a similar}} c.1420 painting now in the Hotel de Ville, Diest, Belgium. Points of reference include Christ raised over a Great DeÃ«sis of saints, apostles and clergy above depictions of the entrance to Heaven and the gates of Hell. In both earlier works Christ perches on a rainbow; in the DeÃ«sis panel he also is above a globe. While these two earlier works are filled with <b>dread</b> and chaos, van der Weyden's panels display the same sorrowful, but self-controlled dignity of his best works. This is most evident {{in the manner in}} which the oversized and dispassionate Christ orchestrates the scene from Heaven.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of Anderson's childhood, the Queales lived at 56 Villa Street, in a house abutting Yeronga Memorial Park. On {{the opposite side of}} the park was Yeronga State School, the school at which Anderson began her formal education. In spite of its reputation as one of the best state schools in Queensland at the time, Yeronga State School rapidly became a site of <b>dread</b> and frustration for Anderson, who suffered from a speech impediment that caused strife for her in the classroom. Anderson's speech impediment (as well as her occasional flirtations with truancy) became such a hindrance to her education that her parents decided that she was to be home-schooled by her mother for a year, while attending weekly speech therapy sessions in the city. In spite of these efforts, Anderson's slight stammer was to stay with her for the rest of her life; several observers commented that the impediment lent her speech a careful and deliberate air. Following her primary school education, Anderson attended high school at Brisbane State High School. Upon graduation, she attended Brisbane Technical College Art School.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the architecture of government columbaria reflects the outlook of the Singaporean nation. The early columbaria were simple, with few aesthetic ornaments, just like early Singaporean housing flats. The later columbaria have more modern designs, with well-designed landscaped environments, and looking similar to contemporary HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats. These columbaria include the Chua Chu Kang Columbarium and the Mandai Columbarium, which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60,000 niches. The designs are more elaborate, and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life. Comparisons have been drawn between the architecture of these columbaria and that of schools and condominiums, and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate the sense of fear and <b>dread</b> traditionally associated with landscapes of death.|$|E

5|$|Notable mainstays in {{the live}} {{experience}} of the sound are MC Sgt Pokes and MC Crazy D from London, and Juakali from Trinidad. Production in a studio environment seems to lend itself to more experimentation. Kode9 has collaborated extensively with the Spaceape, who MCs in a <b>dread</b> poet style. Kevin Martin's experiments with the genre are almost exclusively collaborations with MCs such as Warrior Queen, Flowdan, and Tippa Irie. Skream has also featured Warrior Queen and grime artist JME on his debut album, Skream!. Plastician, {{who was one of}} the first DJ's to mix the sound of grime and dubstep together, has worked with notable grime setup Boy Better Know as well as renowned Grime MC's such as Wiley, Dizzee Rascal and Lethal Bizzle. He has also released tracks with a dubstep foundation and grime verses over the beats. Dubstep artist and label co-owner Sam Shackleton has moved toward productions which fall outside the usual dubstep tempo, and sometimes entirely lack most of the common tropes of the genre.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvencyâ€”not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earthâ€”then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that houseâ€”and, clearly, so insecure elsewhereâ€”that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp <b>dread,</b> the outside world.|$|E
