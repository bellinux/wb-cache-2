5|$|Although France were {{represented}} at the 1900 Summer Olympics, their first official test match <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> till New Year's Day, 1906 against the New Zealand All Blacks in Paris.

In 1913 France faced South Africa's Springboks for the first time; losing 38–5. France also competed at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics, and on both occasions lost to the United States in the gold medal match, Vicky LeDonne scored the winning goal.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal claimed {{their fourth}} Emirates Cup in 2015; the {{competition}} was held on the final weekend of July. The hosts scored seven goals in the tournament – six against Olympique Lyonnais, who later became the first team in the competition's history not to score a goal in either of their matches. Due to the extended schedule of UEFA Euro 2016 and essential pitch reconstruction works at the Emirates Stadium, the Emirates Cup <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> in the pre-season period of the 2016–17 season.|$|E
5|$|Compounding {{the loss}} of men to {{reinforce}} 21st Army Group, on 3 July the 115th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn from the division. The brigade was earmarked for an operation to liberate the Channel Islands and was re-designated Force 135. Ultimately such an operation <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> and the brigade was deployed to mainland Europe. During August, the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division began to disperse. On 15 August, the divisional headquarters ceased commanding any subordinate units {{and by the end}} of the month the division was disbanded.|$|E

Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before it reaches the limiting mass.|$|E

Later in 2008 Jarre performed several concerts {{to celebrate}} the 30th anniversary of Oxygène, in theatres in Europe. Following one such performance at the Royal Albert Hall Jarre met Brian May, who proposed he create a concert in Tenerife for the International Year of Astronomy, but a lack of sponsorship meant that the concert <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{exploration of the}} Tanana Valley and the Tanana River <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> until 1885, but historians believe Russian traders from Nulato and Hudson's Bay Company traders ventured into the lower reaches of the Tanana and possibly the Chena River {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. In 1885, Henry Tureman Allen of the U.S. Army led the {{first recorded}} expedition down the length of the Tanana River, charting the Chena River's mouth along the way.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} de-Stalinization in Czechoslovakia had begun under Antonín Novotný {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the Eastern Bloc. Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the {{completion}} of socialism, and the new constitution, accordingly, adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> until 1967.|$|E

As of 2017 a penalty {{shoot-out}} has been required on only two occasions, in the 2005 and 2006 finals. The competition <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> during the First and Second World Wars, other than in the 1914–15 season, when it was completed, and the 1939–40 season, when it was abandoned during the qualifying rounds.|$|E

In total, 12 tornadoes formed that evening across Kansas and Missouri, of which 11 were weak. However, one of the tornadoes was an EF4, the first such tornado recorded and the first violent tornado since September22, 2006. No one was injured that evening. Farther south, expected activity in Oklahoma and Arkansas <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> as the atmospheric cap held up.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Maryland routed Hopkins {{during the}} regular season, 17–4. That year's Terrapins, led by future Hall of Fame inductee and four-time All-American Frank Urso, are {{considered}} one of the all-time best college lacrosse teams and averaged almost 18goals a game. When the teams met in the championship game, however, the Blue Jays employed a possession game to offset Maryland's offensive firepower, and the first shot on goal <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> until 8:38. At halftime, Johns Hopkins had taken a 5–2 lead. Time expired with the score tied, 9–9, which forced the game into overtime. Urso scored for the Terrapins to take a 10–9 lead and Maryland goalie Bill O'Donnell made several impressive saves to secure the win.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Rose resurfaced with Guns N' Roses at Rock in Rio 3 to {{commence}} the decade-long Chinese Democracy Tour, though {{the majority of}} its scheduled concerts {{over the next two years}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place.</b> A critically panned surprise appearance at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards was followed by an incident in November when a riot erupted at Vancouver's General Motors Place after Rose failed to show up for a scheduled concert. When venue staff announced the cancellation, a riot broke out, resulting in an estimated $100,000 in damages. As the band's line-up continued to evolve, his constant bandmates were guitarist Richard Fortus, bassist Tommy Stinson, and keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Chris Pitman.|$|E
