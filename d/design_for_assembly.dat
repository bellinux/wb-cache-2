50|$|<b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> {{can take}} {{different}} forms. In the 1960s and 1970s various rules and recommendations were proposed {{in order to}} help designers consider assembly problems during the design process. Many of these rules and recommendations were presented together with practical examples showing how assembly difficulty could be improved. However, {{it was not until the}} 1970s that numerical evaluation methods were developed to allow <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> studies to be carried out on existing and proposed designs.|$|E

40|$|Agility is {{the ability}} of a {{manufacturing}} system to produce a variety of products of high quality at low cost. This demands that assembly systems be simple and flexible and product designs be robust and modular. <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> agile <b>assembly</b> is accomplished by concurrent design of products and systems. This paper presents some insights into the benefits of concurrent design of products and assembly systems and offers a methodology <b>for</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> agile <b>assembly.</b> Several rules <b>for</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> agile <b>assembly</b> are proposed. Examples are provided to demonstrate the potential of using these rules...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} Design for Inspection (DFI) should {{complement}} {{and work in}} collaboration with Design for Manufacturability (DFM) and <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>Assembly</b> (DFA) to reduce product manufacturing cost and increase manufacturing practicality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> (DFA) is {{a process}} by which {{products}} are designed with ease of assembly in mind. If a product contains fewer parts it will take less time to assemble, thereby reducing assembly costs. In addition, if the parts are provided with features which {{make it easier to}} grasp, move, orient and insert them, this will also reduce assembly time and assembly costs. The reduction of the number of parts in an assembly has the added benefit of generally reducing the total cost of parts in the assembly. This is usually where the major cost benefits of the application of <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> occur.|$|E
50|$|DFMA {{stands for}} Design for Manufacture and Assembly. DFMA is the {{combination}} of two methodologies; Design for Manufacture, which means the design for ease of manufacture of the parts that will form a product, and <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>Assembly,</b> which means {{the design of the}} product for ease of assembly.|$|E

5000|$|Two notable {{examples}} of good <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> are the Sony Walkman and the Swatch watch. Both {{were designed for}} fully automated assembly. The Walkman line was designed for [...] "vertical assembly", in which parts are inserted in straight-down moves only. The Sony SMART assembly system, used to assemble Walkman-type products, is a robotic system for assembling small devices designed for vertical assembly.|$|E
50|$|The {{technical}} demands were challenging: {{the engine}} {{had to be}} the most powerful, the cleanest and the most efficient in its class. Just 18 months were available between design start and pilot production. With the deployment of world-class software tools, the basic configuration of the engine was soon established — a 3.8 litre twin-turbo V8 — and the use of <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> techniques helped avoid tricky stages in the assembly process.|$|E

50|$|<b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> {{addresses}} {{the combination of}} single parts or components to subassemblies, assemblies, modules, systems, etc., {{that are based on}} a differential design in mechanical engineering terms. An important issue is how the embodied interfaces within a product are designed (mechanical engineering, electrical engineering). Contrary, software or respectively firmware interfaces (software engineering, electrical engineering) are not significant for assembly operations, because these can be easily flash installed within one production step. That is a cost efficient way to enable a wide range of product variants.|$|E
50|$|Design for {{logistics}} covers issues along {{supply chain}} partners (i.e., legally independent firms) but is by its means {{closely related to}} the <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> guidelines. In academic research, design for logistics is tangent to the strategic alliances, supply chain management, and the engineering part of new product development. For example, Sanchez and Mahoney (1996) argued that product modularity (i.e., how physical sub-systems of a product are sub-divided through interfaces; also called product or system architecture), and organizational modularity (i.e., how organisational entities are structured), depend on each other, and Fixson et al. (2005) found that the relationship between product architecture and organisational structure is reciprocal in context of early supplier involvement during the system design or respectively concept phase of the Product development process.|$|E
50|$|Rule based DFM {{analysis}} for deep drawing. Deep drawing {{is a widely}} used cold sheet metal forming process to draw the sheet metal in forming dye of desirable cross-section using mechanical force of the punch. DFM refers to design for manufacturability. DFA refers to <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly.</b> DFMA stands for design for manufacture and assembly. It is a practice for designing the engineering components keeping manufacturing and assembly aspects in mind. DFMA tries to tackle the problems that may come during the manufacturing and assembly {{at the design stage}} itself. Changes in the parts design to remove these problems while keeping the functionality of the parts intact. This is done to reduce the cost of iterations thus making the manufacturing of components more efficient and economical.|$|E

5000|$|Starting in 1977, Geoff Boothroyd, {{supported}} by an NSF grant at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, developed the <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>Assembly</b> method (DFA), {{which could be}} used to estimate the time for manual assembly of a product and the cost of assembling the product on an automatic assembly machine. [...] Recognizing that {{the most important factor in}} reducing assembly costs was the minimization of the number of separate parts in a product, he introduced three simple criteria {{which could be used}} to determine theoretically whether any of the parts in the product could be eliminated or combined with other parts. These criteria, together with tables relating assembly time to various design factors influencing part grasping, orientation and insertion, could be used to estimate total assembly time and to rate the quality of a product design from an assembly viewpoint. For automatic assembly, tables of factors could be used to estimate the cost of automatic feeding and orienting and automatic insertion of the parts on an assembly machine.|$|E
5000|$|The role of {{inspection}} {{in the manufacturing}} process {{is to ensure that}} the manufacturing process is producing components that meet the specification requirements. Inspection does not assure the quality of the product, only a robust and repeatable manufacturing process can achieve this. Therefore, inspection is often considered as an overhead although an extremely important one. Similar to Design for Manufacture (DFM) and <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>Assembly</b> (DFA) (which seek to avoid designs which are difficult to make), the concept of DFI considers measurement capabilities at an early stage in the product development life cycle and uses knowledge of the fundamental principles of metrology to achieve cost reduction. If the inspection method and instruments are considered and selected at the design stage, the likelihood that a tolerance feature cannot be inspected or requires a specialised instrument is substantially reduced. High precision features require specialised manufacturing and metrology, these can have limited availability in the supply chain and therefore often have increased cost. The concept of DFI should complement and work in collaboration with DFM and DFA. There are three key areas when considering DFI, datum selection, tolerances and accessibility, plus general metrology considerations. Getting the most from inspection techniques will help improve quality. [...] It is still difficult for systems designers to build machines that allow finished products to be inspected easily. To do so requires an understanding of the product being manufactured and how inspection tasks can improve the quality control process.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> is {{done during}} the {{detailed}} design phase. A designer first maps a set of design requirements into a set of components or subassemblies that can satisfy the given set of requirements. The components and subassemblies are then examined individually {{to determine whether they}} conform to the principles of <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly.</b> Usually, local changes are performed so that the resultant components/subassemblies are better for assembly. In this paper, we propose to bring the <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> analysis into an even earlier phase [...] that of the conceptual design phase. We argue that by incorporating the <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> analysis at the conceptual design phase, we can achieve a more substantial savings as compared to the savings obtained when the <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> analysis is only performed as late as the detailed design phase. The basic idea is to select a combination of design concepts (previously stored in a library) such that together they can achieve [...] ...|$|E
