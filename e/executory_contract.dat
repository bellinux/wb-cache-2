Such contracts may include labor union contracts, supply or operating contracts (with both vendors and customers), and real estate leases. The standard feature of executory contracts is that each party to the contract has duties remaining under the contract.

40|$|Anyone who {{has been}} paid {{attention}} to developments {{in the world of}} business over the past quarter century can attest to the fact that intellectual property (IP) is a hot commodity. Indeed, in contrast to the companies that emerged out of the Industrial Revolution, the companies that have spawned as part of the so-called “Information Age” attribute much of their value and future prospects to intangible, rather than tangible, assets. Unfortunately, while bankruptcy courts have generally recognized the need to distinguish between tangible and intangible assets, particularly when determining whether a claim is secured or unsecured, they often fail to acknowledge the practical and legal differences between the various forms of IP. Not all forms of IP are created equal. Trade secrets, in particular, present a challenge for the bankruptcy courts because, by definition, they must be “secret. ” Thus, the very act of identifying and attempting to place a value on trade secrets may result in the loss of such rights. A number of recent articles have addressed the treatment of IP assets in bankruptcy proceedings. Typically, these articles focus on two important aspects of bankruptcy law as it relates to intellectual property generally: (1) how to perfect a security interest in intellectual property assets, i. e., “general intangibles” in the parlance of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“the U. C. C 2 ̆ 2.), and (2) the treatment of <b>executory</b> <b>contracts</b> involving intellectual property assets. While both of these issues are important, they are meaningless with respect to trade secrets unless the trade secrets continue to exist after the bankruptcy petition is filed. Thus, rather than jump to a discussion of security interests and <b>executory</b> <b>contracts</b> as they relate to trade secrets, this article begins with a discussion of trade secret law and how various trade secret issues may arise in the bankruptcy context. Because the nature of the relationships in which trade secrets are disclosed is a key aspect of trade secret law, the article then proceeds to explore the interests and objectives of the various players in a bankruptcy proceeding, including the debtor, the trustee, creditors, licensees, and other third parties. The article concludes with a discussion of the interests of the unsecured creditors, employees of the debtor, and the buyer of estate assets...|$|R

Section 4 of the Statute of Frauds 1676 requires that a contract for the sale of land be evidenced by 'some [written] memorandum or note' signed either by the person against whom it is sought to enforce the contract or by that person's agent.

40|$|The {{question}} as to the justification of bankruptcy law remains unanswered. The literature tends to emphasize the conflict and inability to compromise between the different normative outlooks of the insolvency law system. A deeper reflection on the existing theories of bankruptcy law reveals, however, that all theories share the same starting point: All theories share the understanding that efficiency considerations justify the enforcement of contractual bankruptcy arrangements. When the social theories call for increased levels of coercion and redistribution, these theories rely on normative considerations of distributive justice and rehabilitation values. They by no means rely on efficiency grounds. This article presents a new theory of bankruptcy law that challenges this shared starting point. The article joins the economic analysis’ focus on efficiency considerations. It calls for bankruptcy law rules that would maximize the aggregate value of the debtor’s assets {{to his or her}} creditors and equity holders. Yet, the analysis shows that under particular circumstances, efficiency-based considerations can support the coercive avoidance of existing entitlements. Accordingly, I will argue that the role of bankruptcy law is to provide the procedural and substantive framework for severing the debtor’s economic resources from his or her inefficient liabilities. Finally, the analysis shows how the new theoretical framework explains many of the positive legal arrangements of bankruptcy law. First, it explains why courts prefer reorganization plans over liquidation proceedings. Second, it explains the special priority that is afforded by the law to post-petition creditors. Finally, it explains the arrangements regarding <b>executory</b> <b>contracts...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} arises {{as to why}} any party would want to provide notice of anticipatory breach. The reason is that once the performing party is informed of the anticipatory breach, a duty is then created for the performing party to mitigate damages {{as a result of}} the breach. Another situation where anticipatory repudiation can occur is where a party has reason to believe the other party is not going to perform and requests reasonable assurances that the other party will perform (see UCC 2-609(1)). If such reasonable assurances are not given, it will constitute anticipatory repudiation, for which the performing party has various remedies, including termination. However, anticipatory repudiation only applies to a bilateral <b>executory</b> <b>contract</b> with non-performed duties on both sides. Additionally, the repudiation must be unequivocal.|$|E
50|$|General {{bankruptcy}} principles {{hold that}} executory contracts are avoidable in practice, because neither party has fulfilled {{its part of}} the bargain and thus breach by either party only gives rise to expectation damages. Damages awards after commencement of a bankruptcy filing results in claims that take after more senior creditors. They are relegated {{to the status of}} general creditors because while breach would occur after filing of the bankruptcy petition, the contract was entered into before the filing. If a creditor is a general unsecured creditor and there is not enough money, they usually are not paid; so as a matter of practical economics, if the downturn in a company's fortunes which resulted in bankruptcy makes the performance of an <b>executory</b> <b>contract</b> less valuable than its breach, the rational company would breach. There would be no negative monetary consequences of such breach because there would be no money left for the other contract party to take because in practice general unsecured creditors are left with nothing.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{authorisation}} and {{the contract}} of mandate are distinct juristic acts, {{the rules that}} govern the termination of the agent’s authority to bind the principal {{are not necessarily the}} same as those governing the termination of the contractual relationship between the principal and agent. The contract of mandate may be terminated by any of the methods applicable to contracts generally: for example, by performance or by the mutual consent of the parties. An <b>executory</b> <b>contract</b> of mandate may, however, generally be terminated by the unilateral act of either party—revocation by the mandatory (principal) or renunciation by the mandatary (agent)—unless the express or implied terms of the contract dictate otherwise. This rule, which runs contrary to accepted contractual principles, is derived from the common law, where mandate was essentially a gratuitous contract. In modern law, the mandatary is usually remunerated for services rendered; in such cases, at least, it is doubtful whether the contract is freely terminable at either party’s will.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} content and feasibility {{of a set}} of harmonized choice of law rules (HICOL Rules) that would apply in insolvency proceedings. It contemplates a main insolvency proceeding opened in a debtor’s center of main interests (“COMI”) and the existence of (or possibility of opening) one or more non-main (or secondary) proceedings. It also contemplates the possibility that an insolvency representative in a main or non-main proceeding may seek and be granted recognition in another state under the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (codified as Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U. S.) Under HICOL Rules, as to any given issue of insolvency law and as it may relate to any particular asset, the same rule of insolvency law would apply regardless of whether the matter is addressed by the court in a debtor’s main proceeding, in a non-main proceeding, or in another forum. HICOL Rules could accommodate the application in a main proceeding of the insolvency law of a jurisdiction other than the COMI (virtual territorialism) and the application in a non-main proceeding of the insolvency law of the COMI (virtual universalism). The HICOL Rules proposed here would embrace the baseline rule that the insolvency law of the COMI applies to a debtor and its assets, wherever located. However, the HICOL Rules would respect appropriate local interests by applying the insolvency law of another jurisdiction to certain assets located in that jurisdiction. In general, under these HICOL Rules the non-COMI insolvency law would apply only to assets related to an establishment of the debtor located outside the COMI. However, even as to those establishment-related assets, the reorganization or rehabilitation provisions of the COMI insolvency law would apply. Finally, in addition to its focus on establishment-related assets as a general proxy for the identification of local interests, the paper offers some tentative suggestions relating to other issues that comprehensive HICOL Rules should address. These include the additional (and sensitive) issues concerning in rem rights, such as security interests and real property (immovables), setoff, reciprocal (i. e., <b>executory)</b> <b>contracts,</b> and employment contacts...|$|R
40|$|As {{effective}} and efficient bankruptcy proceedings have become increasingly important in recent years, so has {{the need to protect}} intellectual property licenses. The Bankruptcy Code allows the representative of a bankrupt estate, with the court 2 ̆ 7 s approval, to reject <b>executory</b> <b>contracts.</b> Although rejection has taken many forms over the years, its goal is to offer debtors and trustees with a means to maximize the value of the bankrupt estate 2 ̆ 7 s remaining assets. Rejection accomplishes this by treating contracts that contain unfulfilled obligations by both parties as having been breached by the representative of the bankrupt estate. However, the implications of this breach are anything but clear. Contrary to previous cases, the Seventh Circuit, in Sunbeam Products, Inc. v. Chicago American Manufacturing LLC, held that the rejection of a trademark license did not prevent the licensee from further use of the trademark. This decision has created a split among the circuits, primarily with the Fourth Circuit. In 1985, the Fourth Circuit, in Lubrizol Enterprises, Inc. v. Richmond Metal Finishers, Inc., held that rejection gave the representative of the bankrupt estate the right to reclaim licensed intellectual property. Worried that decisions like Lubrizol would have a chilling effect on the intellectual property production and licensing industry, Congress enacted Section 365 (n) of the Bankruptcy Code in 1988, which precludes representatives of bankrupt estates from rejecting intellectual property licenses. Section 365 (n) included copyright and patent licenses, but excluded trademarks until further research could be done. Since the enactment of Section 365 (n), courts have used their equitable powers to prevent representatives of bankrupt estates from rejecting trademark licenses. However, Sunbeam held that courts should not rely on equity when the statutory language provides licensees the same protections. According to Sunbeam, rejection is not tantamount to rescission, but rather treats the executory aspects of the contract as having been breached by the representative of the bankrupt estate. The licensee may continue using the intellectual property, but merely has a prepetition claim for money damages with regards to the breached portions of the contract. This eases the representative of the bankrupt estate 2 ̆ 7 s burden by allowing it to choose not to perform any further obligations, while the licensee may continue using the property it had previously bargained for. This Note discusses the various theories of rejection as they apply to trademarks and other intellectual property. Furthermore, this Note argues that Sunbeam was properly decided and that the Supreme Court should settle what it means to reject trademark license agreements...|$|R

5000|$|Since land {{contracts}} {{can easily}} be written or modified by any seller or buyer; one may come across any variety of repayment plans. Interest only, negative amortizations, short balloons, extremely long amortizations {{just to name a}} few. It is not uncommon for land contracts to go unrecorded. For several reasons, the buyer or seller may decide that the contract is not to be recorded in the register of deeds. This does not make the contract invalid, but it does increase exposure to undesirable side effects. Some states, such as Minnesota, issue contracts without an acceleration clause, which {{in the case of a}} default leaves the seller in a position to either cancel the contract, discharging any principal deficiency, as in the case of deprecation, or to litigate for 18 months or more while letting the buyer, if not a corporation, retain their rights to the property while collection attempts are made, by which time the buyer will often qualify for bankruptcy, making the contract, when lacking said acceleration clause, effectively an installment option, when the buyer has no other lienable assets. In bankruptcy, some regions will interpret it as an <b>executory</b> <b>contract</b> that can be rejected, while others will treat it as a debt to be paid out of the bankruptcy trust. This and a wide variety of other legal ambiguities has led to a trend toward eliminating the use of Land Contracts to remove any incentives, and as a result, the disadvantages that these contracts have compared to the standard note and mortgage, which are more clearly defined in, and regulated by, law.|$|E

40|$|A patent {{licensee}} that declares bankruptcy {{will often}} want to assign its {{rights under the}} license to another party in exchange for much-needed cash. The Bankruptcy Code generally allows debtors to assign <b>executory</b> <b>contracts,</b> including patent licenses, in this way. Indeed, the Code permits debtors to assign a contract even if the contract itself contains a “no-assign” clause, i. e., a clause expressly forbidding assignment. But there is an exception: The Code will defer to certain kinds of otherwise applicable non-bankruptcy law that would normally prevent the contract from being assigned. In particular, the Code will not allow assignment by a debtor-licensee if, outside of the bankruptcy context, the applicable non-bankruptcy law would bar assignment {{regardless of whether the}} contract contained a no-assign clause or not. Two bodies of non-bankruptcy law speak to the assignment of patent licenses. State contract law generally permits assignment unless the license says otherwise, while a longstanding rule of federal common law generally bars assignment unless the license says otherwise. Careful reflection on these two rules reveals that the federal common-law rule is the type of non-bankruptcy rule the Code will defer to, while the state contract law rule is not. Thus, if state contract law governs questions of patent license assignability outside of bankruptcy, then inside bankruptcy the Code will permit assignment by a bankrupt licensee. On the other hand, if federal common law governs those questions outside of bankruptcy, then inside bankruptcy the Code will defer to the federal rule, and will prevent the bankrupt licensee from assigning. Thus, the question of whether a bankrupt licensee can assign a patent license containing a no-assign clause reduces to an Erie question about which body of law applies to patent license assignability issues outside of bankruptcy. Under the Erie doctrine, whether state contract law or federal common law applies to patent license assignability questions outside of bankruptcy depends on one thing only: whether the use of state contract law to decide such questions would pose a “significant conflict” with some federal policy. Everex Systems, Inc. v. Cadtrak Corp., the leading case on this topic, concluded that using state law would significantly reduce the value of the federal patent monopoly, thereby significantly conflicting with federal patent policy, and that federal common law must therefore apply. Other authors have criticized Everex, most forcefully by arguing that Congress has tacitly indicated that there is no federal policy of protecting the value of the patent monopoly against ordinary variations in state contract law. But such arguments ultimately rest on the authors’ particular, and easily assailable, interpretation of Congressional silence on the subject of patent licenses. The present article offers a more fundamental critique of Everex: Even if we assume, as the Everex court did, that protecting the value of the patent monopoly against variations in state contract law is a genuine goal of federal policy, Everex still contains a serious flaw. Everex concluded that applying state contract law to patent license assignability questions (not in the bankruptcy context, but generally) would significantly undermine the patent monopoly overall, because it would mean that, within any bankruptcy, the no-assign clause in a patent license would always be ignored, destroying much of the patent’s value. But the court failed to account for the fact that this insult to the patent’s value occurs only when the licensee happens to be bankrupt. Outside of the bankruptcy context, the Bankruptcy Code does not apply, and no-assign clauses in patent licenses are routinely enforced, whether one is using state contract law or federal common law. Thus, {{from the perspective of the}} would-be innovator—the scientist or R 2 ̆ 6 D director whose behavior the federal patent policy seeks to shape—the ex-ante expected value of the patent may not be significantly reduced by the use of state law as opposed to federal common law. In particular, this ex-ante expected value will not be substantially diminished if the probability is low that the eventual licensee of the patented invention will end up going bankrupt. Everex ignored this empirical element of the Erie analysis—an element that can also be applied in many other, non-patent, settings. In short, the Everex court fell into the trap of imagining that the injury to the patent monopoly in the general case would be of the same magnitude as the injury to the patent monopoly in the case that happened to be before the court that day. It would not, for the simple reason that most patent licensees do not go bankrupt...|$|R
