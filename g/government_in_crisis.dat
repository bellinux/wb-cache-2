40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>government</b> transparency <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> communication <b>in</b> influencing national and/or international public opinions during an enfolding aviation disaster. Using case study research on the 2014 AirAsia QZ 8501 crash, we addressed the research question: How does <b>government</b> transparency <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> communication influence national public opinions? We examined 1, 896 newspaper articles from December 28, 2014 to January 14, 2015. Of these articles, we specifically conducted content analysis on 328 articles published during December 28 - 30, 2014 that cited government organization as their information source. From our content analysis several key themes surfaced to {{shed some light on}} the role of <b>government</b> transparency <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> communication. Based on evidence, we proposed a model of <b>government</b> transparency <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> communication as influenced by government leadership and search and rescue process openness; information quality, search and rescue structure and information and communication technologies use may also moderate the model 2 ̆ 7 s key relationships...|$|R

40|$|Six {{years after}} the {{outbreak}} of the financial crisis that had shaken the global financial system, experts and analysts all over the world continue discussing the effectiveness, scope and adequacy of mechanisms and measures implemented in the meantime, as well as the adequacy of the underlying theoretical concept. A global consent has been reached on ensuring financial stability through the interaction of monetary, fiscal and prudential policy to ensure the necessary macroprudential dimension of regulatory and supervisory frameworks. The USA crisis spilled over to Europe. Strong support of governments to bail out banks quickly resulted in sovereign debt crises in some peripheral EU Member States. Fiscal insolvency of these countries strongly shook the EU and increased doubts in the monetary union survival. The European Union stood united to defend the euro and responded strongly with a new complex and comprehensive financial stability framework. This supranational framework is a counterpart to the global financial stability framework created by the G 20 member countries. Starting from the specific features of the monetary policy whose capacities are determined by euroisation, available instruments and resources for preventive supervisory activities, as well as the role of the <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> management, Montenegro created a framework for maintaining financial stability and prescribed fostering and maintaining financial stability as the main objective of the Central Bank of Montenegro...|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has shattered many illusions, {{one of which}} being that sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are properly treated as arms-length investment institutions subject only to global standards of good governance. In fact, {{in a number of}} East Asian countries SWFs have acted as 'insurers of last resort' for their nation-states underwriting financial stability and social welfare. In this paper, we explain how and why this came to pass, arguing that this role serves to sustain the legitimacy of the nation-state as well as justify the separation of SWF assets from the public interest in current consumption and spending. Focusing upon the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), we suggest that the prospect of recurrent financial crises was an important prompt for its establishment in 1981, reinforced by the experience of many East Asian countries in the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The formal constitution of the GIC, the mechanisms by which its reserves are returned to the <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>crisis,</b> and the role of different sections of the political elite in managing those assets are explained. Referencing the principles of best-practice fund governance and the Santiago Principles underwriting the legitimacy of SWFs, we also consider the governance of the GIC, especially as regards its investment processes. Implications are drawn for the experience of Western countries, particularly the UK and the USA, wherein the failure of their banking systems has put untold pressures on current and future living standards.

40|$|A "redshirts" {{movement}} in Malaysia {{has emerged from}} the politically charged interaction between three key organising principles in Malaysian public life: race, religion and a sixty-year-old <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>crisis.</b> They reflect a confluence of forces unleashed by the critically important election result in 2013, and the subsequent litany of national and international scandals centred on embattled prime minister Najib Razak. The redshirts’ charged political rhetoric is raising concern {{that the threat of}} violent retribution against Malaysia’s Chinese is building to a point where it might not be contained. The redshirts were drawn from around the Malay Peninsula – especially rural settlements established by Malaysia’s Federated Land Development Authority – and from UMNO divisions led by Najib’s supporters. Najib, currently in New York ahead of a planned address to the UN General Assembly, is facing money-laundering investigations in the United States over financial transactions by the indebted national strategic development fund One Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1 MDB. With violent riots threatened over the weekend, Kuala Lumpur has been brought back from the brink of racial and religious violence in a sequence of developments following the decision of the United States to issue a terror alert for Jalan Alor. The US terror alert has provided cover for Malaysia to step back from its flashpoint. Nevertheless, the stage is set for the next instalment in its slowly-unfolding – and ever more dangerous – political crisis. And each time the crisis heats up and cools down again, levels of public trust decline even further. For Australia, the time to engage Malaysia with smart new forms of public and private diplomacy – not only focused on terror and foreign fighters but on social cohesion across the region – has now arrived.  ...|$|E

50|$|Rumors can {{be viewed}} as stories that seem {{rational}} but that are steeped into speculation, in connection with a certain narrative landscape (the vast array of cultural expression circulating within a community or region). In their book, Narrative Landmines: Rumors, Islamist Extremism and the Struggle for Strategic Influence, co-authors Daniel Bernardi, Pauline Hope Cheong, Chris Lundry and Scott W. Ruston coin the term narrative IED to help explain the function and danger of rumors in a strategic communication context. Rumors, as narrative IEDs, are low-cost, low-tech communication weapons that can be used by anyone to disrupt the efforts of communication, civil affairs or outreach campaigns such as those undertaken by <b>governments</b> <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> response situations or militaries in insurgencies. As Bernardi notes, “"Like their explosive cousins, rumors can be created and planted by nearly anybody, require limited resources to utilize, can be deadly for those in its direct path, and can instill fear”.|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{antecedents of}} the public 2 ̆ 7 s {{perception}} of government crisis communication transparency during the 2014 AirAsia QZ 8501 crash, which was characterized by hyper-unknown and hyper-uncertainty. A model of government crisis communication transparency was developed to identify known antecedents. The authors collected and analyzed special issue news reports on the 2014 AirAsia QZ 8501 crash from the detik. com website. There were 328 articles citing government as the information source, which the authors used to construct a framework to guide their media content analysis of these articles. Our findings strongly indicate that openness of the search and rescue process is the most salient antecedent to the media 2 ̆ 7 s positive perceptions of <b>government</b> transparency <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> communication on ongoing search and rescue operations. Other antecedents of importance are management and structure, information quality, government leadership, and ICT use. A revised model of <b>government</b> transparency <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> communication is constructed which {{underscores the importance of}} implementing open government policy to enhance transparent government crisis communication. The research contribution of this paper is this revised model of government transparency that considers the unique context of crisis communication, something the literature has not fully explored...|$|R
