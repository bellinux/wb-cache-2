40|$|A {{regression}} model for predicting L 10 noise levels at roadsides due to {{urban road traffic}} in Hong Kong was developed. It was found that urban traffic noise depends on the logarithmic functions of the <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> (logQ), the number of heavy vehicles (logHV) and the average speed of vehicles (logV). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's studentized method confirmed that the <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> {{and the number of}} heavy vehicles are the most significant factors in urban traffic noise. The {{regression model}} was analyzed using scattering diagrams and compared with the widely used CRTN model. Results show that the regression model would give an accurate prediction in an urban area with tall buildings and a high proportion of heavy vehicles (weight exceeding 1, 525 kg). The statistical frequency distribution of urban traffic noise was obtained based on the noise levels measured in the winter months of 2000. It was found that urban traffic noise is characterized by chi-squared distributions with a degree of freedom of 6 for interrupted traffic flow and with a different dof of 12 for free traffic flow. Two noise sources with the same or different chi-squared distributions can be combined using the method of probability combination. The combined statistical noise parameters L 10, L 50 and L 90 can be calculated from the new distribution...|$|E

Rural roads in Sweden are studied using Poisson and Negative Binominal regression models.

A method is proposed in this paper to predict <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> up to and into the near future, using historical data collected from the Hong Kong Annual Traffic Census (ATC). Two parametric and two non-parametric models have been employed and evaluated in this study. The results show that the non-parametric models (Non-Parametric Regression (NPR) and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood (GML)) were more promising for predicting <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> at the selected ATC station. Further analysis encompassing 87 ATC stations revealed that the NPR is likely to react to unexpected changes more effectively than the GML method, while the GML model performs better under steady <b>traffic</b> <b>flows.</b> Taking into consideration the dynamic nature of the common traffic patterns in Hong Kong and the advantages/disadvantages of the various models, the NPR model is recommended for predicting the <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> in that region.

This studied part of E 18 is located between Karlskoga and Lekhyttan. The alternative design has separated oncoming lanes and a lane design that follows that of the existing road with an addition of two 1, 5 km long overtaking sections. The total length of the road is 15 km and no substantial <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> enter or exit the road along the studied stretch. All analyses were to be based on simulation results of the VTI rural traffic simulation model, RuTSim. AADT along the road has been estimated to 13 280 vehicles for the design horizon year 2025. Two <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> for the simulation were constructed based on this estimate. One of the flows was set to 10. 0 per cent of AADT for passenger cars and 7. 65 per cent of AADT for heavy vehicles in order to correspond to the flow during the design hour.

Researchers attempt to understand the collective behaviors of human movement {{with respect to the}} spatio-temporal distribution in traffic dynamics, from which a gravitational scaling law characterizing the relation between the traffic flow, population and distance has been found. However, most studies focus on the integrated properties of gravitational scaling, neglecting its dynamical evolution during different hours of a day. Investigating the <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> data of Beijing subway network, based on the hop-count distance of passengers, we find that the scaling exponent of the gravitational law is smaller in Beijing subway system compared to that reported in Seoul subway system. This means that traffic demand in Beijing is much stronger and less sensitive to the travel distance. Furthermore, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the scaling exponents in weekdays and weekends. Our findings may help to understand and improve the traffic congestion control in different subway systems...|$|E

40|$|A larger {{amount of}} funding and {{attention}} are going toward highway infrastructure of Ontario for rehabilitation, maintenance and construction projects. These rehabilitation and maintenance activities on highways involve lane closures, which reduce the traffic throughput and cause delays for the road users. The impact of these activities is very important and has led to research into improvements of work zones in Ontario. To prevent the significant cost that these construction delays have on the general public, contractors are required to keep highway lanes open during the peak traffic hours and work at night. However, working at night may reduce {{the quality of the}} work by increasing cold joints and construction joints in the pavement, and may increase the amount of time needed to complete the work. Therefore, finding a balance between the times that the lanes can be closed and the times they should be kept open requires an accurate prediction of the construction work zone throughputs, which can increase the efficiency of the contractor work, save money and reduce the user delay costs. Consequently, this study which has been funded by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) Highway Infrastructure Innovation Funding Program (HIIFP) involves measurement of highway construction work zones throughput of Southern Ontario, to determine the factors affecting the throughput. It has been carried out in partnership with researchers at the University of Toronto. For this study, a manual counting method for collecting throughput data has been employed. This involved data collection of variables such as heavy vehicles which had not been included in previous studies. This provides the visual confirmation of queuing and assists in evaluating the intensity of work activity at the work zones. New generic models for throughput have been developed in this research to better describe current state-of-the practice on Southern Ontario highways. Furthermore, a better functioning highway specific model was developed to calculate the throughput of the MTO Southern Ontario Highway network. In addition to development of these new models, this project involved further development and refinement to a spreadsheet based model SZUDA (Simplified work Zone User Delay Analysis) that uses normal <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> to calculate the resulting queue for that entire hour and approximate user delay cost associated with road user delay. Overall, the thesis describes a methodology for collection of data in work zones. This involved collection of data during 2009 and 2010 Ontario construction season. Furthermore, the data were then used to develop more reliable generic and highway specific models for the MTO. These models can be used to determine when and how work zones should be established. Finally the refined SZUDA model and case studies demonstrate the impact of various work zone configurations on the traveling public...|$|R

The proposed method aims {{to do away with}} the complicated methodologies and excessive adjustment factors which are obstacles in studying and determining the capacity threshold. This problem is especially relevant in Hong Kong, where, due to the complexity of the road geometry, traffic and control conditions makes it is extremely difficult to apply capacity analysis using complicated methodologies. A simplified level-of-service (LOS) methodology is proposed in this paper to carry out capacity analysis on urban roads using data obtained from the ATC which consists of <b>hourly</b> and daily <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> variations.

40|$|Attempts {{to apply}} more {{evidence-based}} methodologies to traffic safety have recently intensified. One such attempt is the Highway Safety Manual (HSM, 2010), which provides crash modification factors (CMFs) {{for a variety}} of roadway treatments. CMFs provide traffic practitioners with the resources to estimate the safety effects of various countermeasures. At the moment, the HSM does not provide CMFs for traffic flow parameters despite the significant differences in the number of crashes on segments with similar geometric parameters and average annual daily traffic (AADT). This study develops CMFs associated with change in <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> conditions for 2008 through 2011 on three similar urban freeway segments in New Jersey using Empirical Bayes (EB) for before-after road safety studies. Specifically, this study focuses on traffic density expressed as level of service (LOS).

This demonstrates that traffic flow parameters have some significant effect on roadway safety, therefore needs to be investigated further and eventually included in the future editions of the HSM...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes three}} essays on Transportation Economics, which studies two important questions in Transportation Economics: first, {{what are the}} effects of public investment in transportation infrastructure and provision of transportation goods? and second, how the market mechanism can improve the provision of transportation goods? Chapter one and two address the first question and chapter three addresses the second question. In the first chapter, using disaggregated data on highway construction projects from the California Department of Transportation from 2001 to 2013 and matching project locations with traffic data, I investigate the effect of highway construction projects on reducing congestion. The average effect of spending per mile of highway on both average speed and the traffic flow for the affected highway segments is positive. The increase in speed for morning and evening peak hours is between 0. 30 - 0. 45 mph, which accounts for 20 thousand saved hours per day. The reduction in travel time alone accounts for a 1. 06 billion benefit over a 30 -year period. This amount is equivalent to 60 {{percent of the total}} project cost and does not include the reduction in vehicle accidents, travel time reliability, and the effect on users of alternative routes. In the second chapter, I empirically investigate the effects of highway lane closure due to construction activity on user cost. I use data from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) on locations and times of lane closures. These data are matched with disaggregated traffic data on hourly traffic speed and flow for each day for most traffic detectors over California highways. I then estimate a fixed effect model of the effects of lane closures on hourly average speed and <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flow.</b> The results show heterogeneous effects of lane closures on different hours of the day. With most closures occurring over night, between 10 p. m. and 4 a. m., I find a reduction in average speed between 4. 5 and 2 mph and an average reduction in the traffic flow of 258 vehicles per hour. I find social costs of lane closures to motorists that are well below the lane late reopening penalties imposed by Caltrans. In the third chapter, I investigate the effect of the SFpark project, a parking experiment on drivers' behavior that was conducted from April 2011 to May 2013 in San Francisco. Using hourly data on occupancy rates of on-street parking, I estimate the responsiveness of commuters to price changes at the block level that vary across locations and time of day. I use a fixed effects model to estimate the elasticity of the occupancy rate with respect to price changes. Moreover, I employ a regression continuity design (RDD) to estimate the effect of different price changes on demand. The elasticities range between - 0. 13 to - 0. 44 and vary by time of day and level of occupancy rate...|$|E

Traditional <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> forecasting methods mainly include linear, nonlinear, neural network, and Time Series Analysis method. However, all of them have some shortcomings. This paper analyzes the existing algorithms on <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> prediction and characteristics of city <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> and proposes a road <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> prediction method based on transfer probability. This method first analyzes the transfer probability of upstream of the target road and then makes the prediction of the <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> at the next time by using the <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> equation. Newton Interior-Point Method is used to obtain the optimal value of parameters. Finally, it uses the proposed model to predict the <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> at the next time. By comparing the existing prediction methods, the proposed model has proven to have good performance. It can fast get the optimal value of parameters faster and has higher prediction accuracy, which can be used to make real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> prediction...|$|R
