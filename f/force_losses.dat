5|$|The {{results of}} the raid are {{difficult}} to judge given the confusion over loss records. It is likely more aircraft were destroyed than listed. The Americans failed to keep a proper record of their losses and it appears the U.S. 8th Air <b>Force</b> <b>losses</b> {{were not included in}} loss totals. When these estimates and figures are added to the losses listed in the table below, {{it is likely that the}} correct figures are 232 destroyed (143 single-engine, 74 twin-engine and 15 four-engine) and 156 damaged (139 single-engine, 12 twin-engine and five four-engine). Researching individual squadron records confirms the destruction of even more USAAF aircraft. This suggests at least a further 16 B-17s, 14 B-24s, eight P-51s, and at least two P-47s were destroyed on top of that total. A total of 290 destroyed and 180 damaged seems a more realistic summation than the conservative figures given by the USAAF, RAF, and RCAF. Including the 15 Allied aircraft shot down and 10 damaged in aerial combat, 305 destroyed and 190 damaged is the sum total of the attack.|$|E

In spite of this there is a progressive reduction in voluntary motor drive, as shown by an increase in the interpolated twitch force as fatigue develops. The aim of this study was to determine whether, by further increasing corticomotor excitability using a paired-pulse rTMS protocol designed to induce I-wave facilitation (iTMS), <b>force</b> <b>loss</b> during a sustained voluntary contraction could be reduced. We designed a cross-over study incorporating a 15 -min period of iTMS (ISI 1. 5 ms; 0. 2 Hz; ∼AMT), following which MEP amplitude (first dorsal interosseous muscle) increased to 194 ± 38 % of baseline (P < 0. 05), compared to a control period of stimulation that did not increase MEP amplitude (single-pulse TMS; 0. 2 Hz; ∼ 1. 2 AMT).

This resulted in a preliminary conclusion that an approximately linear correlation exists between compression set and force decay values for typical fluorosilicone and silicone materials, and that the two materials age at similar rates at low temperatures. Interestingly, because of the observed curvature of the Arrhenius plots available from longer-term, lower temperature accelerated exposures, both materials had faster force decay curves (and correspondingly faster buildup of compression set) at room temperature than anticipated from typical high-temperature exposures. A brief study on heavily filled conducting silicone o-rings resulted in data that deviated from the linear relationship, implying that a degree of caution must be exercised about any general statement relating force decay and compression set...|$|R

Latex and non-latex elastics obtained from GAC, American Orthodontics and Ortho-Organizers were used in a sample size of 10 elastics per group. Static testing involved stretching the elastics three times the internal diameter, while in cyclic testing, the elastics were stretched up to 50 mm to simulate maximum mouth opening. Elastic forces generated were measured using the Instron testing machine and recorded in grams.

5000|$|Even {{after the}} closing of the Inner German border officially in 1952, the border between the sectors of East Berlin and West Berlin {{remained}} considerably more accessible {{than the rest of the}} border because it was administered by all four occupying powers.

The 3.5 million East Germans, called Republikflüchtlinge, who had left by 1961 totalled approximately 20% of the entire East German population. The emigrants tended to be young and well-educated, leading to the brain drain feared by officials in East Germany. Yuri Andropov, then the CPSU director of Relations with Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, decided on 28 August 1958 to write an urgent letter to the Central Committee about the 50% increase in the number of East German intelligentsia among the refugees. Andropov reported that, while the East German leadership stated that they were leaving for economic reasons, testimony from refugees indicated that the reasons were more political than material. He stated, [...] "the flight of the intelligentsia has reached a particularly critical phase." [...] The direct cost of labour <b>force</b> <b>losses</b> has been estimated at $7 billion to $9 billion, with East German party leader Walter Ulbricht later claiming that West Germany owed him $17 billion in compensation, including reparations as well as labour <b>force</b> <b>losses.</b> In addition, the drain of East Germany's young population potentially cost it over 22.5 billion marks in lost educational investment.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether further elevation of γ- cyto actin levels improve or exacerbate the dystrophic phenotype of mdx mice. Methods We transgenically overexpressed γ- cyto actin, specifically in skeletal muscle of mdx mice (mdx -TG), and compared skeletal muscle pathology and force-generating capacity between mdx and mdx -TG mice at different ages. We investigated the mechanism by which γ- cyto actin provides protection from <b>force</b> <b>loss</b> by studying the role of calcium channels and stretch-activated channels in isolated skeletal muscles and muscle fibers. Analysis of variance or independent t -tests were used to detect statistical differences between groups. Results Levels of γ- cyto actin in mdx -TG skeletal muscle were elevated 200 -fold compared to mdx skeletal muscle and incorporated into thin filaments. Overexpression of γ- cyto actin had little effect on most parameters of mdx muscle pathology. However, γ- cyto actin provided statistically significant protection against <b>force</b> <b>loss</b> during eccentric contractions. Store-operated calcium entry across the sarcolemma did not differ between mdx fibers compared to wild-type fibers. Additionally, the omission of extracellular calcium or the addition of streptomycin to block stretch-activated channels did not improve the force-generating capacity of isolated extensor digitorum longus muscles from mdx mice during eccentric contractions.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of three different mouthwashes on the force decay of orthodontic chains. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, elastomeric chains with two different configurations were divided into eight groups (two control and six test groups).

Ten cycles of thermocycling between 5 °C and 55 °C were conducted daily during the test period. In order to reach a 200 -g initial force, seven loop closed chains, and five-loop short chains were selected.
