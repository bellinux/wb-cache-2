5|$|After Foliot's failed {{candidacy}} as bishop, in February 1216 John {{appointed him}} to the benefice of Colwall in Herefordshire, the king having {{the ability to make}} the appointment because Giles de Braose, the Bishop of Hereford, who would normally have made the appointment, had recently died. Also <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> comes Foliot's patronage of Robert Grosseteste, the theologian and future Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|Also dating <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> is Beauchief Abbey, {{which was}} founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that {{it was founded in}} 1183. Samuel Pegge in his History of Beauchief Abbey notes that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, {{who was one of the}} witnesses to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.|$|E
5|$|Americans exact {{movements}} <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> {{through early}} 1917 are unclear.

She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore. However, when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the entire American-Hawaiian fleet, including American, was requisitioned by the , which then returned the ships for operation by American-Hawaiian.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the ill-fated}} 1263 {{expedition}} of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides {{along with the}} Isle of Man, were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland {{a result of the}} 1266 Treaty of Perth. Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and placenames, the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited. The best known find <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> is the Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} {{in what is now}} Pennsylvania since at least 10,000 BC. The first {{settlers}} were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artefacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000BC and 1500AD. Archeological evidence found in the state <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrow, and ornaments.|$|E

5|$|In the 3rd century, {{imperial}} mausolea {{began to}} be built as domed rotundas rather than tumulus structures or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens. Pagan and Christian domed mausolea <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> can be differentiated in that the structures of the buildings also reflect their religious functions. The pagan buildings are typically two story, dimly lit, free-standing structures with a lower crypt area for the remains and an upper area for devotional sacrifice. Christian domed mausolea contain a single well-lit space and are usually attached to a church.|$|E
5|$|Josquin {{probably}} {{remained in}} the service of Louis XII until 1503, when Duke Ercole I of Ferrara hired him for the chapel there. One of the rare mentions of Josquin's personality survives <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> Prior to hiring Josquin, one of Duke Ercole's assistants recommended that he hire Heinrich Isaac instead, since Isaac was easier to get along with, more companionable, was more willing to compose on demand, and would cost significantly less (120 ducats vs. 200). Ercole, however, chose Josquin.|$|E

It was decided that <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> only C-130s would be used for the {{evacuation}} due to their greater maneuverability. There was relatively little difference between the cargo loads of the two aircraft, C-141s had been loaded with up to 316 evacuees while C-130s had been taking off with in excess of 240.|$|E

5|$|Smuts's {{religious}} observance was unsurprising in one who whose moral outlook was based exclusively upon Biblical teachings {{and who was}} destined for a future in the Church. Yet, though religion continued to serve in this central role, his studies at Stellenbosch, with their decidedly scientific bias, led Smuts towards a more critical examination of his faith. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> onwards Smuts was, by gradual degrees, to start {{to move away from}} the uncompromisingly Calvinist outlook within which he had been raised.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Chapel {{was built}} by William de Braose, bishop from 1266 to 1287. It was built {{at the rear of}} the church {{constructed}} by Urban and the old choir area was removed in order to build the chapel. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> on, it seemed as if the cathedral was in a constant state of repair or alterations at a slow pace. After the Lady Chapel had been completed, the two bays of the north choir aisle were rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|The Neolithic age, {{which began}} in the Middle East in about 9500BC, was a time when humans became farmers. This {{agricultural}} revolution embraced the development of monoculture and presented an opportunity for the rapid spread of several species of plant viruses. The divergence and spread of sobemoviruses– southern bean mosaic virus– date <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> The spread of the potyviruses of potatoes, and other fruits and vegetables, began about 6,600 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{substantially}} remodelled in 1684, following Henry Hare's {{marriage to the}} dowager Duchess of Somerset, {{and much of the}} existing south facade dates <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> The facade's central tower with a belvedere is a motif of the English Renaissance of the late 16th/early 17th centuries. Hatfield House, also close to London, had a similar central tower constructed in 1611, as does Blickling Hall in Norfolk, built circa 1616.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower and}} transepts were {{restored}} 1878–80 {{with a short}} spire similar to the original, but slated rather than oak-shingled. This work was done by Roderick Williams. The pulpit dates <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> William Morris, {{on behalf of the}} Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, wrote to the vicar in 1877 asking for a less severe restoration. Unfortunately much had already been destroyed.|$|E
