5|$|After {{learning}} more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt the village and develop it. While he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also to develop the village, partly {{to win in the}} upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha comes to know from Rao that, as a young man, Ravikanth, wishing, as Harsha does now, to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the locals' welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, moved to the city, and went on to acquire much wealth.|$|E
5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E

In January 1908, David was arrested again, this time for {{attending}} a union election meeting held without a police permit. Not quite 16, the boy was held for 18 months in jails in Łódź, Warsaw, and Moscow, before being sentenced to exile in Chelyabinsk, Siberia. While en route to his place of exile, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camp where the authorities were holding him and, after several months hiding in Chelyabinsk and Białystok, managed {{to make his way}} to the United States in 1911 with a ticket sent to him by one of his brothers, who was living in New York City.|$|E

25|$|From one rivalry to the other, it {{had been}} {{simmering}} for some time between Mick Foley and Randy Orton. In June 2003, following an on-air ceremony honoring Foley for his achievements, Orton and Ric Flair attacked him backstage and threw him {{down a flight of}} stairs. In December 2003, Foley returned as the replacement for Steve Austin as Raw co-general manager and gave himself a shot at Orton's Intercontinental Championship, but <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match and would not face Orton even after the champion spat on his face. In January 2004, a furious Austin declared that Foley would be entered in the Royal Rumble match and he expected him to return and wrestle, which he did by eliminating Orton (and himself) from the match. Foley was later joined by The Rock in the feud, and the reformed Rock 'n' Sock Connection challenged Orton, Batista, and Flair to a handicap tag team match at WrestleMania.|$|E
25|$|Foley {{returned}} in June 2003 to referee the Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and Kevin Nash at Bad Blood. On June 23, during a Raw broadcast in Madison Square Garden, he was honored for his achievements {{in the ring}} and presented with the retired WWE Hardcore Championship belt. The evening ended with Foley taking a beating and kicked down stairs by Randy Orton and Ric Flair. In December 2003, Foley returned to replace Steve Austin as co-general manager of Raw. He soon grew tired of the day-to-day travel and left his full-time duties to write and spend time with his family. In the storyline, Foley was afraid to wrestle a match with Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton on the December 15 episode of Raw {{and walked out of}} the match rather than face him, the result of the match was ruled a draw. After Foley walked backstage, Orton confronted him asking why <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match, calling him a coward in the process, before spitting in his face. Foley walked out of the arena afterwards.|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} Block B competing, Rush stated {{that he was willing}} to put his {{differences}} with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. The second block matches started with a battle royal to determine the order of matches. The match included Ángel de Oro, Marco Corleone, Delta, El Felino, El Hijo del Fantasma, Pólvora, Rey Escorpión and Rush with El Felino and Ángel de Oro being the last two men in the ring. In the first round the team of Stuka, Jr. and Pólvora did not get along, playing off the two of them being disqualified from the 2012 Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on the February 3, 2012 Super Viernes show. The dissension made it easy for Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión to win the first match of the tournament. In other first round matches Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero defeating El Hijo del Fantasma and Misterioso, Jr. Rush and El Terrible proved that they could indeed put their differences aside for at least one night as they worked well together to defeat Delta and Ephesto. While the final first round match featured the only all-rudo team in the tournament it did not mean that El Felino and Rey Bucanero got along at all, during the match Rey Bucanero left his former La Peste Negra partner alone in the ring as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arena. The odds were too hard to overcome for Felino and he fell to Ángel de Oro and Psicosis. The first match in the second round saw two members of Los Guerreros del Infierno on opposite sides as Guerreros leader Último Guerrero teamed up with Marco Corleone and Guerrero team member Rey Escorpión teamed with Black Warrior. Initially the two Guerreros members avoided each other, but when they were finally in the ring with each other the fought like they had no allegiance with each other. The closing moments of the match saw Marco Corleone pin not just Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión but also his own teammate Último Guerrero when he got in the way of Corleone's move off the top rope. Guerrero expressed his displeasure at being pinned by his own team mate after the match. If the first second round match saw allegiances put aside for the tournament, the second match saw rivalry put aside for the tournament as Rush and El Terrible once again worked better together than expected as they defeated Ángel de Oro and Psicosis to become the second team in the semifinal match. In the third and final round of the evening Rush's promise to put differences aside and win the tournament turned out to be true as the two defeated Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero to earn the second spot in the tournament finals.|$|E

Near the destination, Parsons pointed a [...]22-caliber {{revolver}} at the driver's neck to rob him. After stealing the driver's taxi, the two were caught in an alley and placed under citizen's arrest by Charles Conant and his brother-in-law Ronald Maske, who were both armed with guns. During trial, Parsons characterized himself as an orphan who stayed out of trouble and testified against Wood. The court did {{not have access to}} Parsons' juvenile record, and was unaware of his parents on the East Coast. Parsons later stated that he provided false testimony against Wood in a plea bargain for a lighter sentence. Wood was convicted and spent 13 years in prison. No visitors came to see Parsons during his five years at Nevada State Prison. In August 1987, Parsons was paroled to a halfway house in Reno. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facility before his release date and fled on a stolen motorcycle.|$|E
