5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} quote, {{from page}} 57 {{of his book}} The Game of Chess (1938) is: In complicated Rook endings the most important rule is one laid down by the author: The Rook's place is behind the passed pawn; behind the enemy pawn in order to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> behind one's own {{in order to support}} its advance.|$|E
25|$|The Ravitch {{technique}} is an invasive surgery that {{was introduced in}} 1949 and developed in the 1950s. It involves creating an incision along the chest through which the cartilage is removed and the sternum detached. A small bar is inserted underneath the sternum to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in the desired position. The bar is left implanted until the cartilage grows back, typically about six months. The bar is subsequently removed in a simple out-patient procedure; this {{technique is}} thus a two-stage procedure.|$|E

500|$|Outliers {{has been}} {{described}} as a form of autobiography, as Gladwell mixes in elements from his own life into the book to give it a more personal touch. Lev Grossman, writing in Time magazine, called Outliers a [...] "more personal book than its predecessors", noting, [...] "If you <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the light, at the right angle, you can read it as a coded autobiography: a successful man trying to figure out his own context, how success happened to him and what it means." [...] He also surmised that Gladwell feels guilty about his success and believes that Christopher Langan should have experienced the same success that he had.|$|E
500|$|The first tryout, in New Haven, Connecticut, {{did not go}} to plan. [...] During {{the first}} act, William Ching, playing Joseph Taylor, Sr., was singing [...] "A Fellow Needs a Girl" [...] when the scenery wall began to collapse, forcing him to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> until the stagehands noticed. [...] Dancer Ray Harrison caught his tap in a track in the stage, tore the ligaments in his knee and was carried from the stage, screaming. [...] Lisa Kirk, the first Emily, fell into the {{orchestra}} while singing [...] "The Gentleman Is a Dope". [...] She was catapulted back onto the stage with no pause in her singing, to great applause by the audience. [...] Sondheim remembered, ...|$|E
500|$|In 1919, H. W. Evans {{recorded}} {{the existence of}} a similar custom which had existed in Solva, Pembrokeshire circa 1840, during his mother's childhood. He stated that this custom entailed the use of what he termed a [...] "Mari Lwyd", furthermore providing a drawing of it using his mother's recollections as a basis, although was unaware of how this costume had been used. According to Evans' description, this Mari Lwyd consisted of a sheet that had been sewn together along two adjacent sides to make a cone, which was then stuffed with hay and decorated with buttons for eyes and harvest gloves for ears, thus resembling an animal's snout. An individual could conceal themselves under the sheet and use a hay fork inserted into the hay to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> A similar custom appears in an account from 1897, in which an entity known as the Bwca Llwyd ("Grey Bogy") was described; it involved an imitation horse's head being made from canvas and stuffed with hay, being carried about using a hay fork on All Hallow's Eve.|$|E

2500|$|Collier's {{dream was}} to not only {{preserve}} Indian culture but also to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{as a model for}} white society. Historian T. H. Watkins comments that this was [...] "rather a lot to ask of a people struggling merely to live on the fringe of civilization that had overwhelmed them; it was even more to ask acceptance of such notions from a Congress that had demonstrated little faith in the belief that white civilization had anything much to learn from the Indians." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Book of Numbers it {{is written}} that God told Moses to make a bronze serpent, Nehushtan, and <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> so that anyone looking at the snake would be healed of their snakebites. In John 3, Jesus refers to the same serpent, saying {{that he must be}} lifted up {{in the same way that}} the serpent was. [...] John of Damascus also {{regarded}} the brazen serpent as an icon. Further, Jesus Christ himself is called the [...] "image of the invisible God" [...] in Colossians 1:15, and is therefore in one sense an icon. As people are also made in God's images, people are also considered to be living icons, and are therefore [...] "censed" [...] along with painted icons during Orthodox prayer services.|$|E
