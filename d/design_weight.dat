40|$|Calibration {{estimation}} is {{a method}} of adjusting the original <b>design</b> <b>weights</b> to improve the survey estimates by using auxiliary information such as the known population total (or mean) of the auxiliary variables. A calibration estimator uses calibrated weights that are determined to minimize a given distance measure to the original <b>design</b> <b>weights</b> while satisfying a set of constraints related to the auxiliary information. In this paper, we propose a new multivariate calibration estimator for the population mean in the stratified sampling design, which incorporates information available {{for more than one}} auxiliary variable. The problem of determining the optimum calibrated weights is formulated as a Mathematical Programming Problem (MPP) that is solved using the Lagrange multiplier technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Multilevel models (MLM) offer complex {{survey data}} analysts a unique {{approach}} to understanding individual and contextual determinants of public health. However, little summarized guidance exists {{with regard to}} fitting MLM in complex survey data with <b>design</b> <b>weights.</b> Simulation work suggests that analysts should scale <b>design</b> <b>weights</b> using two methods and fit the MLM using unweighted and scaled-weighted data. This article examines the performance of scaled-weighted and unweighted analyses {{across a variety of}} MLM and software programs. Methods Using data from the 2005 – 2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN: n = 40, 723) that collected data from children clustered within states, I examine the performance of scaling methods across outcome type (categorical vs. continuous), model type (level- 1, level- 2, or combined), and software (Mplus, MLwiN, and GLLAMM). Results Scaled weighted estimates and standard errors differed slightly from unweighted analyses, agreeing more with each other than with unweighted analyses. However, observed differences were minimal and did not lead to different inferential conclusions. Likewise, results demonstrated minimal differences across software programs, increasing confidence in results and inferential conclusions independent of software choice. Conclusion If including <b>design</b> <b>weights</b> in MLM, analysts should scale the weights and use software that properly includes the scaled weights in the estimation. </p...|$|R

50|$|When Airbus was {{planning}} its new twin-jet A330 {{in the late}} 1980s, Rolls-Royce proposed {{a version of the}} Trent 600 (known as the Trent 680) to power it.

50|$|Although it {{appeared}} that the basic design was able to deliver its promised performance, at that point it was far from a complete <b>design.</b> <b>Weight</b> and fuel consumption were both above the design estimates, the various support systems like fuel and oil pumps were not self-contained, and it remained susceptible to compressor surging. Flader estimated that these problems would require another three years of development to fix.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{operating}} {{to a lower}} <b>design</b> <b>weight</b> {{than the}} earlier A29 specification, Challenger itself proved a challenge for logistics, and required dockyard equipment to ship. As such {{it could not be}} used in amphibious assaults, such as the D-day landings. While easier to transport than its Axis counterparts, they did not suffer the same transport problems in defensive actions in the latter phase of the war.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{inference}} {{techniques are}} only valid if {{the design is}} ignorable. Two approaches that take the design into account are compared using binary logistic regression. The modelbased approach includes relevant design variables as independents and the designbased approach use <b>design</b> <b>weights.</b> The approaches are exemplified using a cross-sectional stratified mail survey, where associations between urinary incontinence and health related variables among women are studied. Stratification variable age is strongly associated with the dependent variable while stratification variable geography is primarily administrative. The final models contain the same variables irrespective of which approach is used, and the design seem to be only slightly informative. The modelbased approach gives more efficient estimates since geography {{is not included in}} the model. But since point estimates differ slightly there is a tradeoff between bias and efficiency, so a designbased approach which includes geography in the <b>design</b> <b>weights</b> might also be advocated. ...|$|R
30|$|In the {{previous}} section, {{we explained the}} theory of multiple-weighted measurements. A key of the proposed approach is to <b>design</b> the <b>weight</b> matrix W so that the decomposition becomes feasible. However, we cannot arbitrarily <b>design</b> the <b>weight</b> matrix because a weight vector is derived from a measurement method. This section describes how to build the weight matrix as an implementation.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{the fixed}} gear didn't save as much weight as {{expected}} and the plane was still 16% over the <b>design</b> <b>weight</b> at 1,630 kg (3,590 lb) empty. Fully loaded the plane was 2,100 kg (4,630 lb) even without armament, which made it underpowered even with the Kestrel V. Drag was also higher than expected. Thus, the plane proved to have very disappointing performance, reaching only 410 km/h (255 mph).|$|E
50|$|Despite the weight-saving efforts, {{as built}} Kako {{was more than}} 900 tons heavier than its <b>design</b> <b>weight.</b> As a result, draft was {{increased}} by more than 1 metre, subsequently reducing top speed, and the height of the belt armour above the waterline. The portholes of the lowest-level crew quarters were near enough to the waterline that they needed to be closed when the ships were at sea, reducing ventilation and making the living spaces less habitable.|$|E
50|$|Reverse thrust mode is {{used only}} for a {{fraction}} of aircraft operating time but affects it greatly in terms of <b>design,</b> <b>weight,</b> maintenance, performance, and cost. Penalties are significant but necessary since it provides stopping force for added safety margins, directional control during landing rolls, and aids in rejected take-offs and ground operations on contaminated runways where normal braking effectiveness is diminished. Airlines consider thrust reverser systems a vital part of reaching a maximum level of aircraft operating safety.|$|E

40|$|If {{the load}} is not {{relieved}} as a structure starts to yield, the induced stress {{is defined as}} primary stress. If the load relaxes, as a structure begins yield the induced stress is defined as secondary stress. In design {{it is not uncommon}} to give more weight to primary stresses than to secondary stresses. However, knowing when this is good design practice and when it is not good design practice represents a problem. In particular, the fuel plates in operating reactors contain both primary stresses and secondary stresses and to properly assess a design there is a need to assign <b>design</b> <b>weights</b> to the stresses. Tests were conducted on reactor fuel plates intended for the Advanced Neutron Source (ANS) to determine the potential of giving different <b>design</b> <b>weights</b> to the primary and secondary stresses. The results of these tests and the conclusion that the stresses should be weighted the same are given in this paper...|$|R
