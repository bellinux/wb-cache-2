Historically, Shas, a Sephardic Haredi party founded by Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef has been the <b>key</b> <b>party</b> among Haredi Sephardic and Mizrahi populations. In 1999, Shas leader Aryeh Deri was convicted of taking $155,000 in bribes while serving as Interior Minister and given a three-year jail sentence in 2000, he was replaced by Eli Yishai. Yishai led the party for over ten years after Deri's imprisonment, leading the party through Knesset elections until 2013.

While many organisations responded, {{the reach of the}} protest was mixed. The Times of India, a national newspaper of India, claimed people appeared divided over the bandh call and internal rivalry among trade associations led to a mixed response, leaving many stores open day-long and others opening for business as usual {{in the second half of}} the day. Even Purti Group, a network of stores owned and operated by Nitin Gadkari were open for business, ignoring the call for bandh.

In the 1910s Carlism was suffering from conflict between the claimant, Don Jaime, and the <b>key</b> <b>party</b> theorist, Juan Vázquez de Mella; the Comín family, though like de Mella assuming somewhat Germanophile positions during the Great War, remained loyal to their king.

2500|$|The Conservatives {{now had a}} clear {{majority}} in the House of Commons and could govern for five years before holding a general election, but Baldwin felt bound by Bonar Law's pledge at the previous election {{that there would be}} no introduction of tariffs without a further election. Thus Baldwin turned towards a degree of protectionism which would remain a <b>key</b> <b>party</b> message during his lifetime. With the country facing growing unemployment in the wake of free trade imports driving down prices and profits, Baldwin decided to call an early general election in December 1923 to seek a mandate to introduce protectionist tariffs which, he hoped, would drive down unemployment and spur an economic recovery. He expected to unite his party but he divided it, for protectionism proved a divisive issue. [...] The election was inconclusive: the Conservatives elected 258 MPs, Labour 191 and the reunited Liberals 159. Whilst the Conservatives retained a plurality in the House of Commons, they had been clearly defeated on the central issue: tariffs. Baldwin remained Prime Minister until the opening session of the new Parliament in January 1924, at which time the government was defeated in a motion of confidence vote. He resigned immediately.|$|E
