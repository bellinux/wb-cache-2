30|$|Recently, {{chemical}} {{food additives}} such as paraben {{have been reported}} to have harmful effects [1, 2]. Despite this, such additives are still used as preservatives <b>in</b> <b>foods,</b> cosmetics, and medical products. Meanwhile, consumer demand to ensure that only safe additives are used is increasing every year. This has led to popular movements to reduce the use of synthetic chemical compounds <b>in</b> <b>foods</b> and cosmetics. Hence, the emergence of materials having less harmful effects and preferably natural material would be highly desirable if their safety to consumers could be guaranteed. Staphylococcus aureus is a major food pathogen. These bacteria live on human skin and infect the body through wounds or foods. They produce several toxins such as enterotoxin-A and -D [3]. These toxins cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Because they grow <b>in</b> <b>foods,</b> it is important to prevent their growth <b>in</b> <b>foods.</b> Research into natural products that can prevent the growth of bacteria <b>in</b> <b>foods</b> has been underway in many laboratories.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe authors {{report on}} {{the current status of}} work on {{residues}} of veterinary medicinal products and, in particular, antimicrobial residues <b>in</b> <b>foods</b> of animal origin. This review focuses on residues of veterinary antimicrobials, antimicrobials used in livestock production, the concept of residues, and antimicrobial residues <b>in</b> <b>foods</b> of animal origin. Only one antimicrobial substance has been approved in the West African Economic and Monetary Union, compared with 16 substances in Benin and 56 in the European Union. The issue of antimicrobial residues <b>in</b> <b>foods</b> of animal origin has rarely been a serious concern in developing countries, in contrast to the situation in Europe. However, while the prevalence of veterinary drug residues <b>in</b> <b>foods</b> of animal origin is less than 1 % in Europe, in some African countries it can be as high as 94 %. Antimicrobial residues <b>in</b> <b>foods</b> of animal origin can cause allergies, cancer, alterations in the intestinal flora, bacterial resistance and the inhibition of fermentation in the dairy industry. The harmonisation of regulations in Africa could reduce the circulation of prohibited antimicrobials and lead to the implementation of a plan for the control and surveillance of residues from veterinary medicinal products <b>in</b> <b>foods</b> of animal origin...|$|R
5|$|Measurement of {{antioxidant}} content <b>in</b> <b>food</b> is not {{a straightforward}} process, as antioxidants collectively are {{a diverse group of}} compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. <b>In</b> <b>food</b> science, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) was once an industry standard for antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives. However, the United States Department of Agriculture withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed to support the free-radical theory or roles for ingested phytochemicals, especially for polyphenols. Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from in vitro experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or biology.|$|E

50|$|Vitamin B6 {{is widely}} {{distributed}} <b>in</b> <b>foods</b> <b>in</b> both its free and bound forms. Cooking, storage, and processing losses of vitamin B6 vary and <b>in</b> some <b>foods</b> {{may be more}} than 50%, depending on the form of vitamin present <b>in</b> the <b>food.</b> Plant foods lose the least during processing, as they contain mostly pyridoxine, which is far more stable than the pyridoxal or pyridoxamine found <b>in</b> animal <b>foods.</b> For example, milk can lose 30-70% of its vitamin B6 content when dried. Vitamin B6 is found in the germ and aleurone layer of grains, and milling results in the reduction of this vitamin in white flour. The heating that occurs before most freezing and canning processes are other methods that may result in the loss of vitamin B6 <b>in</b> <b>foods.</b>|$|R

Numerous members of the German administration were involved in the black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E

5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. <b>In</b> <b>food</b> preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E

For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E
