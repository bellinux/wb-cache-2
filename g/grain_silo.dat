5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, remnant moisture from Rick enhanced a strong cold front over the Great Plains of the United States. Severe thunderstorms occurred over parts of the southern states, with at least three tornadoes touching down in Louisiana. Further north, the complex brought heavy rainfall to the northeast and parts of southern Canada. In Louisiana, the storm system spawned seven tornadoes, two of which were ranked as EF-1. One of these tornadoes damaged more than 10structures, destroyed a <b>grain</b> <b>silo,</b> flipped a tractor trailer and left numerous residents without power. In all, the tornadoes left nearly $1million in losses and injured one person.|$|E

By 1878, the island had 2015 males, of whom almost a quarter were Muslim, in around 800 houses. The place also hosted a company of the Ottoman foot-artillery division, along with an Austrian and French vice-consulate. The island was in the sanjak of Bigha, which seated a General Governor. Around 500 casks of gunpowder, left behind by the Russians in a military storehouse, were still there. The fort accommodated the Turkish military camp, a <b>grain</b> <b>silo</b> and two wells.|$|E

25|$|The film {{opens with}} {{newspaper}} photojournalist Audrey Aimes (Castle) accidentally stumbling upon {{a small town}} (Ludlow, Illinois) which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects {{that the military is}} covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright (Graves), who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that {{there have been a number}} of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby <b>grain</b> <b>silo.</b>|$|E

Several mobile homes were destroyed and many trees were either snapped or completely uprooted. The tornado then moved into Sumter County. In Sumter County, the tornado caused significant damage to homes and mobile homes before it crossed the Tombigbee River and moved into Marengo County. It continued causing significant tree damage as well as destroying several homes and outbuildings along a [...] path in this county. The tornado then entered Perry County, the final portion of the path, where it damaged two outbuildings and a <b>grain</b> <b>silo</b> as well as causing significant tree damage before lifting just north of Uniontown at 8:35p.m. CDT (0135 UTC). The damage in Sumter, Marengo, and Perry Counties was rated EF2.|$|E
500|$|The {{company was}} {{probably}} founded in 1874 (its first {{mention in the}} local address book) as Gebrüder Helfmann, Bauunternehmer by the Kelsterbach-born brothers Philipp and Balthasar Helfmann, a lumber merchant and mechanic respectively, in Bornheim near Frankfurt am Main. While Balthasar focused on the completion of construction contracts, Philipp developed the financing side of the business. Their first major contract was for the University of Giessen in 1878. By the 1880s the company had begun to produce its own construction materials but was still only a regional player. Shortly {{after the death of}} Balthasar, Philipp converted the company into a joint stock corporation, Aktiengesellschaft [...] für Hoch- und Tiefbauten ("Construction and Civil Engineering Corporation", though literally the [...] "Corporation for High - Hoch and Deep - Tief Construction - Bauten). A major development was the contract for the spa project in Bad Orb in 1899, with the corporation not simply erecting buildings but also to provide infrastructure like roads and gardens, to arrange the finances for the project, and to maintain some responsibilities for operating the project after its construction. Also in 1899, another turnkey project, a new <b>grain</b> <b>silo</b> in Genoa, Italy, was both the firm's first international venture and its first project using reinforced concrete. Philipp Helfmann died in the same year, with his son-in-law, Hans Weidmann, taking over as Chief Executive.|$|E

2500|$|The Gallery {{has been}} seen as an attempt to {{encourage}} regeneration in the local area. The architecture has been both praised and criticised, described as [...] "almost flawless" [...] by the RIBA and [...] "extraordinarily good" [...] by Hugh Pearman but also castigated by John Stewart-Young as an [...] "architectural indulgence", an impressive building that lacks consideration of how the wider public will use it.

2500|$|If a {{circular}} building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, {{it can be}} passively cooled by the [...] "dome effect."
