He helped popularize major poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Du Fu, and brought Provençal and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive {{at a time when}} poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.|$|E

In one match, Boycott faced a delivery from Foord which he dispatched to the boundary for four. Foord turned to Parkinson and asked: [...] "Christ almighty, what's this lad's name?"

500|$|She {{personally}} {{taught her}} own children and exposed them to new ideas and inventions. She gave lessons to her younger son, Louis, until he was ten years of age. He said of her in 1968 that she was [...] "a walking encyclopedia. All through her life she stored up knowledge on all sorts of subjects, {{and she had the}} <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> of being able to make it all interesting when she taught it to me. She was completely methodical; we had time-tables for each subject, and I had to do preparation, and so forth. She taught me to enjoy working hard, and to be thorough. She was outspoken and open-minded to a degree quite unusual in members of the Royal Family. And she was also entirely free from prejudice about politics or colour and things of that kind." ...|$|E
500|$|Ravel was not by {{inclination}} a teacher, {{but he gave}} {{lessons to}} a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal {{that it was impossible}} to learn from studying Debussy's music: [...] "Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound." [...] When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they [...] "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> of melody and spontaneity". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from [...] "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto." ...|$|E

The music video was awarded two honors at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards. It collected the awards for Best Group Video and Viewer's Choice. People's Choice Awards recognized [...] "We Are the World" [...] with the Favorite New Song award in 1986. In the same year, the American Music Awards named [...] "We Are the World" [...] "Song of the Year", and honored organizer Harry Belafonte with the Award of Appreciation. Collecting his award, Belafonte thanked Ken Kragen, Quincy Jones, and [...] "the two artists who, without their <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> would not have inspired us in quite {{the same way as}} we were inspired, Mr. Lionel Richie and Mr. Michael Jackson". Following the speech, the majority of USA for Africa reunited on stage, closing the ceremony with [...] "We Are the World".|$|E

Subsequently, to the Encyclical Mense maio,1965, in which he urged the practice of the Holy Rosary, [...] "the prayer so dear to the Virgin and so much recommended by the Supreme Pontiffs," [...] and as reaffirmed in the encyclical Christi Matri, 1966, to implore peace, Pope Paul VI stated in the apostolic Recurrens mensis, October 1969, that the Rosary is a prayer that favors the <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> of peace.|$|E
2500|$|After the Second World War, {{no longer}} a National Socialist, Schelsky became a star of applied sociology, due to his <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> of anticipating social and sociological developments. [...] He {{published}} books on the theory of institutions, on social stratification, on the sociology of family, on the sociology of sexuality, on the sociology of youth, on Industrial Sociology, on the sociology of education, and on the sociology of the university system. [...] In Dortmund, he made the Social Research Centre a West German focus of empirical and theoretical studies, being especially gifted in finding and attracting first class social scientists, e.g. Dieter Claessens, Niklas Luhmann, and many more.|$|E
2500|$|According to Vasari, [...] "Leonardo's {{disposition}} was so lovable that {{he commanded}} everyone's affection". He was [...] "a sparkling conversationalist" [...] who charmed Ludovico il Moro with his wit. Vasari sums him up by saying: [...] "In appearance he was striking and handsome, and his magnificent presence brought {{comfort to the}} most troubled soul; he was so persuasive that he could bend other people to his will. He was physically so strong that he could withstand violence and {{with his right hand}} he could bend the ring of an iron door knocker or a horseshoe as if they were lead. He was so generous that he fed all his friends, rich or poor.... Through his birth Florence received a very <b>great</b> <b>gift,</b> and through his death it sustained an incalculable loss." ...|$|E

2500|$|Boulez {{gave various}} reasons for {{conducting}} {{as much as}} he did. He gave his first concerts for the Domaine Musical because its financial resources were limited: [...] "I told myself that, being much less expensive, I would have a go myself." [...] He also said that the best possible training for a composer was [...] "to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution"—yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose around his conducting commitments. The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: [...] "Boulez became a conductor because he had a <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> for it".|$|E
2500|$|After {{this first}} {{attempted}} takeover, Wontner insured against future bids by issuing new {{shares in the}} group which carried 40 times as many votes each as the normal shares. These special shares were held by Bridget D'Oyly Carte, Wontner and their allies. The financial magazine The Economist found this ploy outrageous: [...] "On grounds of principle, {{it is difficult to}} find condemnation too severe for what the Savoy Hotel board have done. They have taken, without the consent of their shareholders, a valuable property in which the shareholders have an equity and of which the best use is open to dispute. They have made it impossible for the shareholders ... to exert any control in future over the disposition of that property." [...] Nevertheless, Wontner's share structure enabled the board to defeat later takeover bids by Trafalgar House and Trusthouse Forte. [...] During the latter, Charles Forte managed to acquire 69 per cent of the group's shares, but only 42 per cent of the voting rights, and was furious at being outwitted by Wontner, whom he accused of having [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> for supercilious indifference". Having thwarted this final takeover bid, Wontner retired from his executive roles and accepted the position of president of the Savoy group.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{valuable}} asset Butler commanded in New Orleans {{was not his}} army, but his formidable political heritage. Butler was a Jacksonian Democrat in all senses, and a populist and reformer. He had a <b>great</b> <b>gift</b> for identifying with {{the issues of the}} broadest levels of the voters, and turning them to his political advantage. Here the Jacksonian political legacy had come full circle in 47 years, from defending New Orleans from the British, to securing it from secession. Butler's inscription on the base of Jackson’s statue, “The Union Must and Shall be Preserved”, was symbolic of his political identity. The inscription echoed Andrew Jackson's 1830 toast in response to a speech endorsing [...] "nullification", during what was called the Nullification Crisis. Jackson stated, [...] "Our Federal Union! It must be preserved!". This statement defined Jackson's position against any threat to the Union. The spoils system created by the Democratic party was also part of Butler’s political heritage. Butler believed the advantages of political office should be used to the advantage of friends and supporters, and to suppress political opponents. In general, Butler used these political abilities to play the various factions and interests in New Orleans as a virtuoso conductor would inspire an orchestra, to insure his control and reward Union supporters while isolating and marginalizing hostile pro-confederate factions.|$|E
