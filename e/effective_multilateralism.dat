Therefore, reform and restructuring of the United Nations system can alone provide a crucial link in an expanding chain of efforts to refashion international structures, imbuing them with a greater degree of participatory decision-making, so as to make them more representative of contemporary realities. The expansion of the Security Council, in the category of both permanent and non-permanent members, and the inclusion of countries like India as permanent members, would be a first step in the process of making the United Nations a truly representative body.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to study the practices of mediation of the European Union (EU) in order to explore how the understanding of violent conflicts by EU officials is reflected in their ways of responding to them through practices of mediation. In late 2011 the in-house Mediation Support Team of the Union took office as part of implementing the Concept on Strengthening EU Mediation and Dialogue Capacities, adopted by the Council of the European Union in 2009. The group began to develop new practices of in-house mediation support, thereby engaging with the already existing efforts of the Union. This study sets out to trace the emergence of this loosely knitted web of practices - the assemblage of EU mediation - by drawing on the sociology of translation or Actor-NetworkTheory and on concepts of governmentality studies. It builds on the four moments of translation as developed by Michel Callon and refines them {{with the notion of}} political rationality and techne to assess what it is that makes the assemblage relatively durable. This dissertation argues that the seemingly incoherent and to an extent diverging practices of mediation are in fact organized around a reasoning on violent conflict which securitizes conflict. It is challenged by a transformative rationale which is advocated by the Mediation Support Team. However, the common denominator of both concepts is an understanding of how to build peace with sustainable economic development, the eradication of poverty, strong and democratic state institutions and an <b>effective</b> system of <b>multilateralism</b> as its main components. Taken together, this reasoning or political rationality gives rise to a state-centred approach to violent conflict which often plays out at the expense of a detailed conflict assessment as it simplifies the multiple realities and narratives of violent conflict. Two case studies of EU mediation practices in Myanmar and Georgia substantiate this argument. They are assessed through analysing the transcripts of 63 semi-structured interviews and textual artefacts. Moreover, the dissertation discovers an intriguing puzzle pertaining to how the political rationality of the assemblage of mediation is resisting any form of scrutinizing the underlying assumptions of the state-centred understanding of violent conflict. On the one hand, the Mediation Support Team fulfils a supportive role and did not manage to establish itself as an obligatory passage point of the assemblage which would define how to engage in mediation and require all other actors to pass through it. In fact, the codified practices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy authorize the Council of the European Union to determine the Union's foreign policy objectives, including mandating an actor to mediate on behalf of the EU, and calling for all efforts of resolving violent conflicts to be in line with Council policies. Accordingly, European Union Special Representatives or Heads of Delegations engage in those practices that engender a peace process. On the other hand, the study found that the practices of mediation support structure the way of thinking of EU officials on peace and conflict in that they introduce specific concepts such as the transformative approach to violent conflict and blur the boundaries between EU actors and external experts, thereby raising the question whether or not this will challenge the Union's concept of violent conflict in the future...|$|R

The EU was relatively successful in the achievement of its goals and in maintaining external cohesion during the negotiations, but it scored relatively low in its efforts to commit other major players to sign up to the ATT.

Afterwards, it examines how the EU has responded to these hazards in the framework of the Barcelona process and, in particular, the new European Neighbourhood Policy.

For decades Iran has been violating obligations contained in its safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) {{in order to become}} nuclear weapons capable. But what impact does the {{conflict over}} Tehran’s nuclear programme have on the nuclear non-proliferation regime? In three areas there is significant overlap between efforts to find a solution with Iran and broader discussions about strengthening non-proliferation norms, rules and procedures: verification of civilian nuclear programmes, limiting the ability to produce weapons-grade fissile materials, and nuclear fuel supply guarantees. The nuclear dispute with Tehran is likely to have specific effects in each of these fields on the non-proliferation regime’s norms, rules and procedures. The ninth NPT review conference, which will take place from 27 April to 22 May 2015, offers an opportunity to draw lessons from the nuclear conflict and discuss ideas for further strengthening the regime.

40|$|From the introduction]. "Building {{security}} in our neighbourhood" {{is one of}} the three objectives of the European Security Strategy (ESS), the document approved by the European Council in December 2003 that defines the major threats and security objectives of the European Union. Among the three objectives identified - addressing the key threats (terrorism, {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction, regional conflicts, state failure, organised crime), building {{security in}} the neighbourhood, and building an international order based on <b>effective</b> <b>multilateralism</b> - two of them are linked to the EU's neighbourhood. The objective of addressing the key threats only indirectly relates to the areas surrounding the EU. Not all these security challenges coming from the EU's neighbourhood are peculiar to the region; however, the impact of these challenges on EU security, either real of perceived, can be still greater because of geographical proximity. On the other hand, the objective of building security in the neighbourhood is directly related to the areas surrounding the EU. This paper analyses whether the EU can be effective in building security in the Neighbourhood through the policy intiative that was launched specifically to achiece this goal: the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). In particular, the paper analyses whether the ENP is succeeding in meeting the security (sub) objectives laid out in the ESS. Finally some policy recommendations designed to make the ENP more effective in meeting these objectives will be made...|$|E
40|$|Writing {{a thesis}} is like writing a story book, {{this book is}} a story of the 17 -year-old Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM). It serves as a case-study of inter-regionalism, one of the newest {{cooperative}} mechanism in today’s international arena. Among a variety of cooperative frameworks, namely, multilateral global governance, <b>effective</b> <b>multilateralism,</b> regionalism, regionalisation, inter-regionalism is much less explored. This research determines how the rise of inter-regionalism influences the actors in the international arena and vice-versa. The key actors in inter-regionalism and their interaction are explored. Existing studies in the field of inter-regionalism in general and on the ASEM process in particular have been theory-led. There is a significant deficit of empirically-driven research in the field. In order to comprehensively understand inter-regionalism and the ASEM process, this research incorporates a substantial empirical focus. An unprecedented array of primary data is used. A variety of quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods are employed to generate this unique and comprehensive empirical analysis of ASEM. Ultimately, this thesis demonstrates the persistent state-centrism and lack of actorness of regions and regional organisations as independent actors in the ASEM process. Nation-state remains the primary actor in inter-regionalism; yet, they turn to bilateralism when more concrete cooperation or affairs have to be handled. The proliferation of sideline meetings, although as by-product, becomes one of ASEM’s key added-value to international relations. The empirical analysis also finds that inter-regional fora like ASEM offer participants regular information and views updates and promote socialisation among government officials in the official track and among the involved individual from civil society in the unofficial track...|$|E
40|$|The European Security Strategy, {{which was}} adopted in December 2003 by the European Council, serves three functions. Firstly, it {{provides}} a frame of reference both for long-term strategies and for current political problems. Secondly, it is a basis for consultation with major partners on central strategic issues. Thirdly, it leads to concrete follow-up in five areas identified by the European Council: (1) {{proliferation of weapons of}} mass destruction, (2) the fight against terrorism, (3) <b>effective</b> <b>multilateralism</b> with the UN at its core, (4) a strategy towards the region of the Middle East, and (5) a comprehensive policy towards Bosnia-Herzegovina.

On terrorism, as a consequence of the attacks in Madrid, the European Council on 25 and 26 March 2004 agreed on a wide-ranging Declaration reaffirming the EU's determination to systematically confront the terrorist threat. The appointment of an EU counter-terrorism coordinator will help to improve coordination and visibility of EU actions in this field. Progress has been achieved on a number of third pillar directives and regulations (Directive on compensating victims of crime, Regulation on the Schengen Information System, Decision establishing the Visa Information System, Europol and Eurojust agreement) as well as on the prospect of integrating in the Council Secretariat an intelligence capacity on all aspects of the terrorist threat.

40|$|In {{this very}} {{preliminary}} paper, I attempt {{to question whether}} the EU is going beyond the purely civilian Europe through the insight into the institutionalising {{of the use of}} the military. This focus suggests that institutionalising the use of force does not necessarily lead to the diminution of the EU's civilian power. Consequently, I seek to understand the way in which, without alienating its character as a civilian agent, and {{on the basis of its}} own declared responsibilities (i. e. ESS), the EU can contribute to making the global environment safer. To perform this task, I look at further insights: multilateralism, and the EU in its relation to the United States. The second insight centres on certain features of the <b>effective</b> <b>multilateralism</b> of the European Security Strategy, and points out that a network of multilateral mechanisms and institutions promises to provide everyone access to the core global public goods on the availability of which global stability and the security of all states depend. That network commits the EU to civilian action. In fact, since global public goods are universal, they cannot be dispensed by market forces, but very reasonably by the EU as a civilising agency. The third insight looks more directly at the choice of sustaining global order as a duty and a responsibility that the EU should share through multilateral action particularly with the United States in a constant dialogue. The paper argues that in doing this, on the one hand the EU should provide a balance to US unilateralism (a possible task if the United States chooses to make American interests coincide with the global interest), and on the other, should promise to take a lead in the domain of soft power by keeping itself firmly to the role of a civilian Europe...|$|E
40|$|The study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the nature and development {{of the relationship between the}} European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN) in peacekeeping using the case of the peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) between 2003 and 2008. The EU deployment in 2003 of an Interim Emergency Multinational Force (IEMF) in DR Congo represented an important shift in the role of regional organisations, as it was deployed outside its geographical setting for peacekeeping reasons. Furthermore, the co-deployment of EU and UN forces highlighted the changing pattern in peacekeeping, as regional organisations were starting to play an important role in burden sharing with the UN, thereby enhancing the notion of <b>effective</b> <b>multilateralism.</b> However the seemingly positive rhetoric emanating from the EU and UN about the partnership did not necessarily reflect the reality of the relationship. Fundamental to the study are issues concerning the involvement of regional actors outside their geographical spheres. Key questions are raised regarding the motives of regional organisations and the UN. Such questions concern, for instance, the motives behind the UN calling for EU involvement in DR Congo (at the expense of the African Union and nations) and factors that persuaded the EU to answer the call. The dynamics of the EU-UN cooperation are analysed from a political and operational dimension. Key components of the operational cooperation are essentially command and control, logistics and communication. The political cooperation components include the course taken by actors while using the structures set up to aid the partnership and the already existing departments within both organisations that facilitated the initial interaction. Further questions arise concerning cooperation between the UN and EU from the political and operational level. These include questions concerning the informal and formal mechanisms put into place to resolve the divergences between the missions. In addition, perceptions of the recipient people and the neighbouring states are examined in order to assess if this partnership is working or not. The results of the research which entailed a number of interviews and an analysis of primary and secondary data show that the motives of the EU and UN, plus the dynamics of their cooperation can be analysed in a multi-layered paradigm involving the following levels of interaction: i) 	Operational level — MONUC and EUFOR RD Congo, IEMF, EUPOL and EUSEC ii) 	Political level — local and national actors iii) 	Political level — regional and international actors. For instance, from an operational perspective the UN considered EU deployment as suitable especially for the provision of resources. The EU on the other hand viewed the deployment in DR Congo as an opportunity to become a global actor especially in the aftermath of the fallout from the US and its allies’ invasion of Iraq. The local, national and regional viewed the motivation for the involvement of the EU alongside the UN with suspicion. This was mainly based on the fact that key players like Belgium and France had vested interests in the DR Congo. There was dissatisfaction regarding the marginal military role given to the regional and continental powers yet the conflict was in their backyard. The nature of the path of the cooperation, especially from an operational perspective, was not smooth. This can be attributed to the different organisational cultures and motivations between the organisations. The internal dynamics of individual organisations played a role in determining the level of cooperation between the two organisations. In light of the above, the research came to several conclusions which included the fact that, due to the complex motives and differing aims of the actors, cooperation at the political level does not necessarily dovetail with cooperation at the operational level. Although the organisations have set up a system of collaboration through the declarations of 2003 and 2007, it has not been fully utilized. National and organisational interests and organisational culture among others can hinder cooperation. Nevertheless, despite a divide between the political and operational aspects of the missions, actors in the field have found ways of addressing operational problems, though significant issues remain concerning the viability of the methods used to address them in the long run...|$|E
40|$|The 2005 World Summit was {{announced}} as a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity {{to reform the}} United Nations so as to provide it with the institutional and policy tools needed {{to meet the challenges}} and threats to peace and security in contemporary world. But the Summit was also meant to be a crucial test for the EU common foreign policy and for the state of transatlantic relations. As a matter of fact the success of any UN Reform could be hardly envisaged without the capacity of EU Member States to advance common and consensus-gathering positions and without bridging the gap between US and EU strategic visions on multilateralism and global governance. In order to discuss whether in New York an historic occasion has been seized or rather lost, a group of distinguished scholars and high level diplomats was convened in Florence at the joint invitation of IAI, EUI and UNICRI {{in the aftermath of the}} World Summit. This Working Paper reports the debate held at the international conference and offers a first assessment of the main outcomes of the Summit while drawing the future perspectives of the UN reform process. It is submitted that the Summit has fallen short of the historical UN reform the Secretary General had hoped for, but nonetheless it records some positive advancements. This is especially the case of those issues where a transatlantic agreement was reached, such as the decision to establish a Peace Building Commission for post-conflict reconstruction, the establishment of a Human Right Council and of a Democracy Fund to strengthen the countries’ capacity to implement the principles of democracy and the express endorsement of the new guiding concept of “responsibility to protect” the victims of severe violations of human rights. In other fields, achievements have to be measured against the ambiguity of the final text and room is left to further negotiations. For instance, the key concept of “human security”, which have been launched in the Report of the High Level Panel’s on Threats, Challenges and Changes (“A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility”), is endorsed but watered down to some very generic statement and a clear commitment to discuss further the notion in the General Assembly. Similarly, the historic decision to set up a new Human Right Council fails in addressing all the relevant features of the new organ (compositions, status, powers and relationship with existing organs and procedures) which are left to further negotiations in the General Assembly. A final evaluation remains therefore controversial. Lack of progress has to be recorded in core policy areas. In the field of development and environment the outcome document simply restates principles and commitments already affirmed. In the field of peace and security, no significant progresses were made in providing a global framework to combat terrorism nor specific commitments on disarmament and non-proliferation were assumed. In the highly-politicised issue of Security Council Reform, the division among EU member states did not help to reach a compromise solution. However, as a test for the EU capacity to act jointly and effectively on the international level, the World Summit has yielded positive results. The EU member States succeeded in putting their political weight behind a proactive attitude throughout the process, in pursuit of a number of clear objectives. On many issues, Europe may take the lead of the reform process, building on its own experience in promoting a lasting peace, protecting human rights and fostering development. Its commitment to an <b>effective</b> <b>multilateralism</b> attempts to promote a successful global governance without yielding to the temptation of unilateral drifts. No matter how determined and powerful, a single State or group of virtuous States cannot face the threats and challenges of a global world alone. In its endless opposition to unilateralism, multilateralism is mandated by the need for an effective global governance. For many, respect – and maybe with the exception of the field of global economic governance – the UN remains a viable and irreplaceable institution.

In September 2010, the European Council {{discussed}} for {{the first}} time the European Union’s (EU) strategic partnerships, a foreign policy concept that was until then unknown to most people – including EU officials. This discussion was certainly needed in these times of geopolitical upheaval. The global shift of power from the Atlantic to the Pacific forces the EU and its Member States to fundamentally rethink their foreign policy with a strong focus on great and emerging powers; otherwise the EU is at risk of falling into global irrelevance. The 2009 Copenhagen climate conference was just a foretaste of what global irrelevance could mean. The recent events in the Arab world have proved again that Europe is not at ease with contemporary challenges, including in its own neighbourhood. To cope with the coming multipolar world, the EU should invest time and energy in its relationships with great and emerging powers, i. e. in the so-called strategic partnerships, because the more the world becomes globalised and interconnected, the more the EU will be confronted with them – a confrontation that can lead either to cooperation or competition. Given that all international actors need one another if they are to cope with issues as crucial as climate change, nuclear proliferation and sustainable development, cooperation should be privileged over competition. Current events in the Arab world – as important as they are – should not distract the EU from its vital long-term strategic interest: secure a relevant status in the coming multipolar environment dominated by great powers. On the basis of a review of EU documents, official and informal, as well as a certain amount of interviews with European officials, this paper concludes that the EU has today, in 2011, ten strategic partnerships with third countries: Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea and the United States. However, it is not entirely clear what is the exact reasoning behind this list. Some countries (e. g. the US) are considered to be natural partners of the EU, whereas others (e. g. China and Russia) are considered simply to be too big to ignore. As for the other countries on the list, the strategic rationale is far less evident. Their inclusion sometimes seems to be more the result of political and institutional games than of a true strategic reflection, hence leading to an “accidental” list of strategic partners. The objectives that the EU is supposed to pursue globally through its strategic partnerships are left entirely undefined. What are the EU’s global interests and priorities? How can these interests and priorities be pursued? What is the role of the strategic partners (cooperation or competition) in the pursuit of these interests and priorities? The 2003 European Security Strategy remains mute on these fundamental questions, as it says more about how to do things than about what exactly to do. Strategic partnerships thus unfold as instruments empty of meaning and substance, with no clearly defined strategic direction. Strategic partnerships are only strategic in name, for now. A historical overview of documents and debates shows the total absence of strategic rationale behind the elaboration of strategic partnerships since the very beginning, with no definition of the concept or of its fundamental objectives, and an ad hoc selection of partners. This process of a-strategic thinking led to a repetition of past failures as the EU is now facing similar problems as it was ten years ago with the Common Strategies, from which the partnerships derived, namely the difficulty to turn rhetoric into concrete policies of strategic value vis-à-vis our partners. A set of interviews with EU officials and European diplomats confirmed that strategic partnerships are to this day empty of any substance. This paper demonstrates that strategic partnerships are not so strategic when looked at up-close for a variety of reasons, including that 1) not every partner is equally strategic; 2) the EU is not cooperating with its partners on most truly strategic issues; 3) the strategic partnership has no structural or institutional impact on the relationship; 4) or, finally, the EU itself is simply not considered as a strategic partner in many cases. This paper concludes that the recent revival of debates on strategic partnerships is a positive step forward and that a strict implementation of the important conclusions of the 2010 September European Council is now awaited. Overall, this paper recommends reflecting on the EU’s global interests and priorities in search of the EU’s grand strategy. True strategic partnerships, as this paper brands them, could then be regarded as (sub-) strategies of the EU vis-à-vis great and emerging powers. In addition to this general recommendation, this paper makes several recommendations for the EU and its Member States to turn the existing strategic partnerships into true strategic partnerships: • Review the EU’s institutional set-up, in line with the strategic nature of the partnerships, e. g. by establishing a cell dedicated to the strategic partnerships within the EEAS, or by developing the EU delegations in terms of size and composition to reflect the strategic character of the relationship. • Review the EU’s internal arrangements, notably ensuring a greater coordination between the EU and the Member States vis-à-vis strategic partners. • Review the bilateral arrangements between the EU and its strategic partners in order to acknowledge the strategic importance of the relationship, e. g. by establishing comprehensive and effective strategic dialogues as well as sectoral dialogues on security and defence, or by developing a culture of cooperation on strategic issues. • Review the multilateral arrangements, according to the EU’s preference for <b>effective</b> <b>multilateralism,</b> e. g. by boosting coordination and conflict mediation mechanisms within multilateral forums between the EU and its strategic partners...|$|E
40|$|The Secretary General has {{resisted}} United States pressure, but will Australia, asks John Langmore ON 21 MARCH Kofi Annan presented his proposals for immediate UN reform to the General Assembly {{in a report}} entitled In Larger Freedom: Towards Development, Security and Human Rights for All. The title is significant. By focusing on freedom, the Secretary General adopts the rhetorical preoccupation of the Bush Administration. Yet he does so in a uniquely UN way by quoting the Preamble to the UN Charter, which includes as one of objects of organisation promotion of ‘social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. ’ The {{question is whether the}} SG’s report makes more than rhetorical concessions to American pressure. Have the attacks on him from the right-wing lynch mob so weakened him that he has acquiesced to American pressure? The report begins by identifying challenges. It points {{to the fact that the}} ‘sheer imbalance of power in the world is a source of instability’. Declining confidence in the United Nations, it says, ‘is matched by a growing belief in the importance of <b>effective</b> <b>multilateralism.</b> ’ It clearly articulates the challenges of poverty, hunger, disease, injustice, and the crisis caused by abandonment of global norms by the US, UK and Australia in pre-emptively invading Iraq. There is an imperative for collective action: ‘the cause of larger freedom can only be advanced by broad, deep and sustained global cooperation among States. ’ Unilateralism will not work: multilateralism is essential. Focusing first on ‘Freedom from want,’ the report chooses to address the principal concerns of the great majority of member states, rather than American insecurities - though there is a rightly repeated emphasis on the interconnectedness of economic and social development, preventing violent conflict and effectively applying human rights. Annan’s report endorses Investing in Development, the plan by Jeffrey Sachs and a large team, published in January. This blueprint for achieving the Millennium Development Goals concentrates first on what developing countries can do to help themselves, yet recognises that unless external aid is multiplied, most impoverished countries cannot escape the poverty trap. Annan, too, emphasises that those developed countries that have not already done so should establish timetables to grant 0. 7 per cent of national income by 2015, starting with significant increases immediately and reaching 0. 5 by 2009. The Howard government’s modest response to the tsunami offers a flicker of hope that Australia could break out of our mean trajectory of declining aid. But since the tsunami relief is spread out over five years, and half of the amount is a loan, it will only marginally increase Australia’s official development assistance. After all, Australia is one of the wealthiest countries; we have little public debt and a budget surplus. We have the capacity to increase aid now. An increased allocation of one-thousandth of Australia’s national income to aid in each of the next five years would enable us to reach 0. 7 per cent. It is irresponsible to free-ride on the more generous Europeans, especially when we live so much closer to developing countries. The second section, on ‘Freedom from fear’, is the SG’s response to the report of the high-level panel he established to address the post-Iraq global confusions. It looks at the question of whether US hegemony has become the normative influence on global order, or whether the international rule of law continues to provide the framework. Annan embraces the concept of collective security, arguing that this can address the security concerns of all states. Contrary to the current pratce of the US administration, he writes that, ‘We need to ensure that States abide by the security treaties they have signed so that all can continue to reap the benefit. ’ If consensus is not reached on these issues of ‘deadly urgency’ this year, ‘we may not have another chance’. Concretely, this includes revitalising nuclear, biological and chemical weapons treaties. For example: swift negotiation of a fissile material cut-off treaty is essential; the moratorium on nuclear test explosions must be upheld until the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty comes into force; destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles is essential; and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention must be strengthened. He calls for the conclusion of a more comprehensive convention on terrorism before the end of the current session of the General Assembly (though whether this would make a difference depends on whether it is adopted by member states, which the US did not do with other anti-terrorism treaties). Unfortunately Annan strikes a partisan note in suggesting that ‘It is time to set aside debates on so-called “State terrorism”. ’ Of course he is correct in arguing that it cannot be right to deliberately kill and maim civilians. But it is utopian to claim that ‘The use of force is already thoroughly regulated under international law’ when Israel habitually disregards those laws. He makes a more useful suggestion in proposing appointment of a special rapporteur to report on the compatibility of counter-terrorism measures with international human rights law. The Secretary General proposes that the risk and prevalence of war can be reduced by: strengthening resources allocated to mediation; implementing sanctions effectively; improving support for peacekeeping; and establishing an intergovernmental Peacebuilding Commission to engage effectively in sustained recovery after war. He urges the Security Council to adopt a resolution setting out criteria it will use for evaluating the seriousness of threats and proposals for use of military force: ‘the proper purpose of the proposed military action; whether the military option is proportional to the threat at hand; and whether there is a reasonable chance of success. ’ Annan gives resounding support to the rule of law: ‘I believe that decisions should be made in 2005 to help strengthen the rule of law internationally and nationally [...] . I strongly believe that every nation that proclaims the rule of law at home must respect it abroad and that every nation that insists on it abroad must enforce it at home. ’ He urges adoption of the recommendations of the report, A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility, by a committee of which Gareth Evans was one of the chairs. The Secretary General makes practical suggestions for encouraging the rule of law by announcing his intent to establish a Rule of Law Assistance Unit, and encouraging member states to cooperate with the International Criminal Court - despite obsessive US opposition. Means of strengthening the effectiveness of the General Assembly though streamlining the agenda and committee structure are suggested, and that section concludes with a remark that could well be addressed directly at Australia. For our representatives are notable for their condescending, self-righteous speeches about reform and their absence from serious discussion. Annan writes that reform ‘will not happen unless member states take a serious interest in the Assembly at the highest level and insist that their representatives engage in debates with a view to achieving real and positive results. ’ The major issue of institutional reform is enlargement of the Security Council. ‘The Security Council must be broadly representative of the realities of power in today’s world. ’ The two alternatives suggested by the high-level panel are described but the SG gives no indication of which he prefers, saying only that a decision is so important that if consensus is impossible, a majority decision should be taken. Annan makes modest, attractive suggestions for upgrading the work of the UN’s Economic and Social Council by holding annual ministerial assessments of progress towards such goals as the MDGs; convening timely meetings to address crises; and most important, by asserting leadership ‘in driving a global development agenda [...] . to provide direction for the efforts of the various intergovernmental bodies in this area throughout the UN system. ’ He proposes a smaller Human Rights Council, perhaps as one of the principal UN organs, to replace the widely criticised Commission on Human Rights. Additional ways of containing secretariat work loads and improving effectiveness are suggested. Coordination of UN system work at country level is to be strengthened by identification of a resident coordinator. Annan also plans to appoint two dozen leading scientists, policy-making officials and political leaders as a Council of Development Advisors. These recommendations are summarised in a draft decision to be considered by heads of state and government who will meet at the summit at UN headquarters in September. They are faced with vital decisions. The best way we have of influencing what they decide is by attempting to influence our government while it prepares. One small sign of hope is that the Foreign Affairs and Trade Department contributed $ 100, 000 to the costs of the high-level panel on which Kofi Annan relies for many of his proposals. The Secretary General’s report does much more than acquiesce to assertive American unilateralism: will the Howard government? • John Langmore was a director at the UN for seven years from 1997 to 2003.
