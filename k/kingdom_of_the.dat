5|$|Ancient Egypt was {{a civilization}} of ancient Northeastern Africa, {{concentrated}} along the lower {{reaches of the}} Nile River in the place that is now the country Egypt. It is one of six historic civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer). The history of ancient Egypt occurred {{as a series of}} stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Early Bronze Age, the Middle <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Bronze Age and the New <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Late Bronze Age.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Picts {{as it was}} in {{the early}} 8th century, when Bede was writing, was largely the same as the <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scots in the reign of Alexander I (1107–1124).

5|$|By the 7th century, England {{was almost}} entirely divided into kingdoms {{ruled by the}} Anglo-Saxons, {{who had come to}} Britain two hundred years earlier.

Essex, the <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East Saxons, included London and lay between East Anglia and the kingdom of Kent. The earliest Mercian king for whom there is definite historical information is Penda of Mercia, Coenred's paternal grandfather.|$|E
5|$|Dale {{has also}} made several film appearances.

Dale said his script for <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crystal Skull was printed on tin foil so {{it was impossible to}} replicate, {{in order to keep the}} film's plot a secret. He appeared in four films released in 2011: A Little Bit of Heaven, Priest, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, having joined late in the film's production.|$|E

5|$|Eorpwald; also Erpenwald or Earpwald, (reigned from c. 624, assassinated c. 627 or 632), succeeded {{his father}} Rædwald as {{ruler of the}} {{independent}} <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East Angles. Eorpwald {{was a member of}} the East Anglian dynasty known as the Wuffingas, named after the semi-historical king Wuffa.|$|E
5|$|His {{descendants}} became {{de facto}} {{heads of state}} of the Dutch Republic during the 16th to 18th centuries, which was an effectively hereditary role. For {{the last half century}} of its existence, it became an officially hereditary role and thus a monarchy (though maintaining republican pretense) under Prince William IV. His son, Prince William V, was the last stadtholder of the republic, whose own son, King William I, became the first king of the United <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands, which was established on 16 March 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. With the independence of Belgium on 21 July 1831, the Netherlands formally became the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. The current monarch is Willem-Alexander.|$|E
5|$|However most, if not all, {{characteristics}} of the current centralized state of the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands were foreshadowed by {{the accomplishments of the}} Batavian Republic, not least the liberal 1848 Constitution. That constitution restored the central tenets of the democratic Staatsregeling of 1798, under the guise of a Constitutional monarchy, as its author Johan Rudolf Thorbecke acknowledged.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about the <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East Angles has survived.
