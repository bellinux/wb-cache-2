He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation {{is made in the}} light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it. Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the <b>empirical</b> <b>method.</b> Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error.

[...] In a type system with automated type checking a program may prove to run incorrectly yet be safely typed, and produce no compiler errors. Division by zero is an unsafe and incorrect operation, but a type checker running at compile time only doesn't scan for division by zero in most languages, and then it is left as a runtime error. To prove the absence of these more-general-than-types defects, other kinds of formal methods, collectively known as program analyses, are in common use. Alternatively, a sufficiently expressive type system, such as in dependently typed languages, can prevent these kinds of errors (for example, expressing the type of non-zero numbers).

2500|$|Ancient Egypt made {{significant}} advances in astronomy, mathematics and medicine. Their development of geometry {{was a necessary}} outgrowth of surveying to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which was flooded annually by the Nile river. The 3-4-5 right triangle and other rules of geometry were used to build rectilinear structures, and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt was also a center of alchemy research {{for much of the}} Mediterranean. The Edwin Smith papyrus {{is one of the first}} medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain: it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern neuroscience. However, while Egyptian medicine had some effective practices, it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices. Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology, for example, was largely ineffective. Nevertheless, it applies the following components to the treatment of disease: examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, [...] which display strong parallels to the basic <b>empirical</b> <b>method</b> of science and according to G. E. R. Lloyd played a significant role in the development of this methodology. The Ebers papyrus (c. 1550 BC) also contains evidence of traditional empiricism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} pathology, {{including}} the detailed {{examination of the}} body, including dissection and inquiry into specific maladies, dates back to antiquity. [...] Rudimentary understanding of many conditions was present in most early societies and is attested to in {{the records of the}} earliest historical societies, including those of the Middle East, India, and China. By the Hellenic period of ancient Greece, a concerted causal study of disease was underway (see Medicine in ancient Greece), with many notable early physicians (such as Hippocrates, for whom the modern Hippocratic Oath is named) having developed methods of diagnosis and prognosis for a number of diseases.The medical practices of the Romans and those of the Byzantines continued from these Greek roots, but, as with many areas of scientific inquiry, growth in understanding of medicine stagnated some after the Classical Era, but continued to slowly develop throughout numerous cultures. [...] Notably, many advances were made in the medieval era of Islam (see Medicine in medieval Islam), during which numerous texts of complex pathologies were developed, also based on the Greek tradition. Even so, growth in complex understanding of disease mostly languished until knowledge and experimentation again began to proliferate in the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Baroque eras, following the resurgence of the <b>empirical</b> <b>method</b> at new centers of scholarship. [...] By the 17th century, the study of microscopy was underway and examination of tissues had led British Royal Society member Robert Hooke to coin the word [...] "cell", setting the stage for later germ theory.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967 Davidson {{published}} [...] "Truth and Meaning," [...] {{in which}} he argued that any learnable language must be statable in a finite form {{even if it is}} capable of a theoretically infinite number of expressions, as may be assumed that natural human languages are, at least in principle. If it could not be stated in a finite way, it could not be learned through a finite, <b>empirical</b> <b>method</b> such as the way humans learn their languages. It follows that it must be possible to give a theoretical semantics for any natural language that could give the meanings of an infinite number of sentences {{on the basis of a}} finite system of axioms. Following, among others, Rudolf Carnap (Introduction to Semantics, Harvard 1942, 22) Davidson also argued that [...] "giving the meaning of a sentence" [...] was equivalent to stating its truth conditions, so stimulating the modern work on truth-conditional semantics. To sum up, he proposed that it must be possible to distinguish a finite number of distinct grammatical features of a language, and for each of them explain its workings in such a way as to generate trivial (obviously correct) statements of the truth conditions of all the (infinitely many) sentences making use of that feature. Thus, a finite theory of meaning can be given for a natural language; the test of its correctness is that it would generate (if applied to the language in which it was formulated) all the sentences of the form [...] "'p' is true if and only if p" [...] ("'Snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white").

40|$|Evaluation of rock mass {{deformability}} is {{an important}} but very challenging task in the analysis and design of underground structures in rock. Although various <b>empirical</b> (correlation) <b>methods</b> {{have been developed for}} determining the deformation modulus of rock masses, they come in many forms and are scattered in different sources. It is often difficult, time-consuming, or even impossible for a practitioner to find appropriate information to determine the deformation modulus of rock masses for a particular project.

Then a comparative analysis and discussion is carried out on the accuracy and main issues of these methods. Since many of the <b>empirical</b> <b>methods</b> for determining the deformation modulus of rock masses need to use the deformation modulus of intact rock, the various <b>empirical</b> <b>methods</b> for estimating the deformation modulus of intact rock are also reviewed. In addition, this paper highlights the scale effect on rock mass deformability, the effect of confining stress on rock mass deformability, and the anisotropy of rock mass deformability. Overall this paper outlines the key aspects of rock mass deformability and provides the fundamental and essential information required for effective evaluation of rock mass deformability using the <b>empirical</b> <b>methods...</b>|$|R

60|$|Again, the tempers both {{of parents}} and {{children}} are much less liable to be ruffled under this system than under the ordinary system. When instead of letting children experience the painful results which naturally follow from wrong conduct, parents themselves inflict certain other painful results, they produce double mischief. Making, as they do, multiplied family laws; and identifying their own supremacy and dignity with the maintenance of these laws; every transgression is regarded as an offence against themselves, and a cause of anger on their part. And then come the further vexations which result from taking upon themselves, {{in the shape of}} extra labour or cost, those evil consequences which should have been allowed to fall on the wrong-doers. Similarly with the children. Penalties which the necessary reaction of things brings round upon them--penalties which are inflicted by impersonal agency, produce an irritation that is comparatively slight and transient; whereas, penalties voluntarily inflicted by a parent, and afterwards thought of as caused by him or her, produce an irritation both greater and more continued. Just consider how disastrous would be the result if this <b>empirical</b> <b>method</b> were pursued from the beginning. Suppose it were possible for parents to take upon themselves the physical sufferings entailed on their children by ignorance and awkwardness; and that while bearing these evil consequences they visited on their children certain other evil consequences, with the view of teaching them the impropriety of their conduct. Suppose that when a child, who had been forbidden to meddle with the kettle, spilt boiling water on its foot, the mother vicariously assumed the scald and gave a blow in place of it; and similarly in all other cases. Would not the daily mishaps be sources of far more anger than now? Would there not be chronic ill-temper on both sides? Yet an exactly parallel policy is pursued in after-years. A father who beats his boy for carelessly or wilfully breaking a sister's toy, and then himself pays for a new toy, does substantially this same thing--inflicts an artificial penalty on the transgressor, and takes the natural penalty on himself: his own feelings and those of the transgressor being alike needlessly irritated. Did he simply require restitution to be made, he would produce far less heart-burning. If he told the boy that a new toy must be bought at his, the boy's, cost; and that his supply of pocket-money must be withheld to the needful extent; there would be much less disturbance of temper on either side: while in the deprivation afterwards felt, the boy would experience the equitable and salutary consequence. In brief, the system of discipline by natural reactions is less injurious to temper, both because it is perceived to be nothing more than pure justice, and because it in great part substitutes the impersonal agency of Nature for the personal agency of parents.|$|E
