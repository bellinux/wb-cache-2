25|$|Every Datuk is an {{individual}} and therefore his birthday is celebrated by worshippers with a grand feast. In the Northern States (Perlis, Kedah and Penang), worshippers usually slaughter chickens, and sometimes goats as the main dish of the kenduri. It is extremely <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the dishes prepared to be halal, including the slaughtering of animals. Pork is considered unclean and therefore is totally forbidden in a shrine. The meat is later cooked into a curry and offered to the Datuk together with turmeric rice(nasi kunyit), which is traditionally served at feasts in Malay culture. As the majority of worshippers are from the Chinese community, kenduris today also incorporate Chinese dishes and offerings usually presented to deities within the Taoist pantheon of gods.|$|E

500|$|Kemp was {{a critic}} of {{association}} football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Kemp proclaimed: [...] "I think it is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> those young out there—who someday hope to play real football, where you throw it and kick it and run with {{it and put it}} in your hands— a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport." [...] Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his [...] "tongue was firmly planted in cheek" [...] when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccer's main problem is [...] "it doesn't have a quarterback". Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have [...] "changed" [...] his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger, although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a [...] "boring game".|$|E

2500|$|Eucalyptus is {{the most}} common short fibre source for {{pulpwood}} to make pulp. Eucalyptus globulus (in temperate climates) and the hybrid of Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis (in tropical climates) are the most used varieties in papermaking. [...] The fibre length of Eucalyptus is relatively short and uniform with low coarseness compared with other hardwoods commonly used as pulpwood. The fibres are slender, yet relatively thick walled. This gives uniform paper formation and high opacity that are <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> types of fine papers. The low coarseness is important for high quality coated papers. [...] Eucalyptus is suitable for many tissue papers as the short and slender fibres gives a high number of fibres per gram and low coarseness contributes to softness.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the later music—and a few earlier pieces such as Continuum—treats the pulse as a musical atom, a common denominator, a basic unit which cannot be divided any further. Different rhythms appear through multiplications {{of the basic}} pulse, rather than divisions: this is the {{principle}} of African music seized on by Ligeti. It also appears in the music of Philip Glass, Steve Reich and others; and significantly it shares {{much in common with}} the additive rhythms of Balkan folk music, the music of Ligeti’s youth. He described the music of Conlon Nancarrow, with its extremely complex explorations of polyrhythmic complexity, as [...] "the greatest discovery since Webern and Ives ... something great and <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> music history!

By targeting these critical groups, the Commission believed it could best combat poverty overall. [...] However, the focus was criticized by those who would like a focus on other groups—including the elderly, the unemployed, the homeless, and those recently released from prison. The New York Times reported that little new city money was likely to be invested to fight poverty; management reform was the main source of improvements. For example, the Times noted that food stamp administration would be <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> three of the groups targeted by the commission. Food stamps are fully funded by the federal government, so any expansion of their use would be a cost-free reform for the city.|$|E
2500|$|Phosphorus is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> organisms {{because it}} is a {{component}} of DNA and RNA and is involved in cell metabolism as a component of ATP and ADP. [...] Also, phosphorus is not found in large quantities in freshwater systems, limiting photosynthesis in primary producers, making it the main determinant of lentic system production. [...] The phosphorus cycle is complex, but the model outlined below describes the basic pathways. [...] Phosphorus mainly enters a pond or lake through runoff from the watershed or by atmospheric deposition. [...] Upon entering the system, a reactive form of phosphorus is usually taken up by algae and macrophytes, which release a non-reactive phosphorus compound as a byproduct of photosynthesis. [...] This phosphorus can drift downwards and become part of the benthic or profundal sediment, or it can be remineralized to the reactive form by microbes in the water column. [...] Similarly, non-reactive phosphorus in the sediment can be remineralized into the reactive form. [...] Sediments are generally richer in phosphorus than lake water, however, indicating that this nutrient may have a long residency time there before it is remineralized and re-introduced to the system.|$|E
2500|$|Modesty was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> {{except the}} very rich, and most women appear almost entirely covered by rather shapeless clothes, which {{needed to be}} able to {{accommodate}} a full pregnancy. The basic garment in the early Empire comes down to the ankles, with a high round collar and tight sleeves to the wrist. [...] The fringes and cuffs might be decorated with embroidery, with a band around the upper arm as well. [...] In the 10th and 11th century a dress with flared sleeves, eventually very full indeed at the wrist, becomes increasingly popular, before disappearing; working women are shown with the sleeves tied up. [...] In court ladies this may come with a V-collar. Belts were normally worn, possibly with belt-hooks to support the skirt; they may have been cloth more often than leather, and some tasselled sashes are seen. [...] Neck openings were probably often buttoned, which is hard to see in art, and not described in texts, but must have been needed if only for breast-feeding. [...] Straight down, across, or diagonally are the possible options. The plain linen undergarment was, until the 10th century, not designed to be visible. However at this point a standing collar starts to show above the main dress.|$|E

2500|$|The Boondocks {{has been}} a {{frequent}} subject of controversy since its comic-strip debut in 1999, with ABC News noting, [...] "Fans and critics of The Boondocks loved and hated the strip for the same reasons: its cutting-edge humor and unapologetic, sometimes unpopular, views on various issues, including race, politics, {{the war on terrorism}} and the September 11 attacks." [...] Numerous outlets predicted the show would encounter controversy prior to its November 2005 debut, due to its casual use of the word [...] "nigger". According to an article in The Washington Post, references to Rosa Parks were removed from one of the series' first completed episodes within a week of her death. In 2006, the Reverend Al Sharpton protested the first-season episode [...] "Return of the King," [...] for Martin Luther King, Jr.'s character's use of the word [...] "nigga," [...] saying [...] "Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures."

The episode was later awarded a Peabody Award for being [...] "an especially daring episode".|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} resistance to adopting a westernized, mainstream feminist approach to Indigenous rights and self-determination. The most significant criticism of mainstream feminism {{has been its}} marginalization of minorities and lack of racial diversity. White feminists [...] "are extraordinarily reluctant to see themselves in the situation of being oppressors, as they feel {{that this will be}} at the expense of concentrating upon being oppressed." [...] The priority of white women's needs before those of Indigenous women have a historical root, and therefore make Indigenous feminists weary of homogenizing the rights of [...] "women". While Indigenous women may acknowledge that there is overlap in the goals of Indigenous feminists and mainstream feminists, many, like Celeste Liddle (Arrernte) [...] "strongly believe that as Aboriginal women, whilst our fights are related to ongoing feminist struggles within other racially marginalised groups, they are not the same." [...] An argument made by Minnie Grey in her essay, From the Tundra to the Boardroom to Everywhere in Between, about feminism is how it often fails to look beyond female oppression at other issues, such as class, education, and the effects of oppression has on men. [...] "We, as Inuit women, have been striving for such things as equal pay for equal work, equal share of roles {{for the good of the}} family, equal rights to participate in the decision-making processes of our governments, equal rights for the hiring of women at all levels of commerce and science, equal rights in education, and most importantly, equal rights to raise our children in safe, healthy, and positive conditions. This means, among other things, above the poverty line. I look at these aspirations not as women's liberation, but as people's liberation. In fact, we need and love our men, and similarly, we need to liberate them from the concepts that bind them to unbreakable traditional roles that, in turn, keep the status quo intact in many regions of the world."One such example of the need to incorporate uniquely Indigenous perspectives is in the second wave's struggle for wage parity with their male counterparts. Celeste Liddle argues that [...] "for example, whilst equal pay is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> of us, for many years Aboriginal people were historically not paid for their labour at all." [...] Therefore, the second wave's fight for wage equality (among other issues), was perceived to push the rights of Indigenous women to the periphery.|$|E

60|$|Recognition marks during flight {{are very}} <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> birds which congregate in flocks or which migrate together; {{and it is}} {{essential}} that, while being as conspicuous as possible, the marks shall {{not interfere with the}} general protective tints of the species when at rest. Hence they usually consist of well-contrasted markings on the wings and tail, which are concealed during repose but become fully visible when the bird takes flight. Such markings are well seen in our four British species of shrikes, each having quite different white marks on the expanded wings and on the tail feathers; and the same is the case with our three species of Saxicola--the stone-chat, whin-chat, and wheat-ear--which are thus easily recognisable on the wing, especially when seen from above, as they would be by stragglers looking out for their companions. The figures opposite, of the wings of two African species of stone-curlew which are sometimes found in the same districts, well illustrates these specific recognition marks. Though not very greatly different to our eyes, they are no doubt amply so to the sharp vision of the birds themselves.|$|E

Dante's heart, long filled with this, brooding over it in speechless thought and awe, bursts forth at length into [...] "mystic unfathomable song;" [...] and this his Divine Comedy, the most remarkable of all modern Books, is the result.|$|E
