5|$|Although serious {{efforts were}} made to oppose <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws in Nashville as early as 1905, it was not until 1958, with the {{formation}} of the Nashville Christian Leadership Council, that Nashville's African American community would lay the foundation for dismantling racial segregation.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma Territory was {{reported}} in 1892 to be around 85 percent white, 10 percent colored and 5 percent Indian. Oklahoma was awarded statehood in 1907, with a constitution that enshrined racial segregation (<b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws). In 1911 the local school had 555 white students and one black.|$|E
5|$|In New York, Sanders {{encountered}} {{a different form}} of racism. At Montefiore Hospital, where she performed her clinical training, black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses. White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses.

5|$|Congress further {{weakened}} the acts in 1894 by removing a provision against conspiracy. In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes {{was elected president}} after a highly contested election, receiving support from three Southern states {{in exchange for a}} pledge to allow white Democratic governments to rule without federal interference. As president, he refused to enforce federal civil rights protections, allowing states to begin to implement racially discriminatory <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws. A Federal Elections Bill was successfully filibustered in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In March 1955, Claudette Colvin, a black fifteen-year-old schoolgirl in Montgomery, {{refused to}} give up her bus seat to a white man in {{compliance}} with <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws, which were local regulations in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation. King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case; because Colvin was pregnant and unmarried, E. D. Nixon and Clifford Durr decided to wait for a better case to pursue.|$|E

But the truth was, that <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow's</b> wing had healed long ago, and was now as strong as ever; and, as the weeks passed by, and he grew big and fat, a great longing came into his wild heart to fly again-- far, far up into the air and away to the lands where there were forests of trees and brooks of running water.|$|R
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater acceptance in industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for many black workers. During the war, city officials passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private) lunch counters. In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned lunch counter, the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners. No changes in <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> segregation policies at lunch counters resulted, but Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post-war}} Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a {{constitution}} which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883. It passed segregationist <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia {{to include a}} poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor European Americans. Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded {{due to a lack}} of political representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and race {{relations}} in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E

5000|$|According to Jackie Robinson, in 1949 he {{struggled}} with his decision to testify against Robeson to HUAC. Technically, Robinson was not required to testify, but he believed there would be repercussions if he did not. In July 1949, Robinson eventually agreed to testify before HUAC, fearing that declining to do so might negatively and permanently damage not only his career but also the future integration of professional athletics. His testimony was a major media event, with Robinson's carefully worded statement appearing {{on the front page}} of The New York Times the following day. In the statement [...] - [...] prepared with the help of Branch Rickey, who in order to facilitate the testimony, released Robinson from a prior agreement not to make any political statements during his baseball career [...] - [...] Robinson said that Robeson “has a right to his personal views, and if he wants to sound silly when he expresses them in public, that is his business and not mine [...] [...] [...] [...] He’s still a famous ex-athlete and a great singer and actor.” Robinson also stated that [...] "the fact that it is a Communist who denounces injustice in the courts, police brutality, and lynching when it happens doesn't change the truth of his charges," [...] and that racial discrimination is not [...] "a creation of Communist imagination." [...] Robinson left the capital immediately after his testimony to avoid, as the black newspaper New Age pointed out, [...] "being <b>Jim</b> <b>Crowed</b> by Washington's infamous lily-white hotels." ...|$|R
5|$|King {{believed}} that organized, nonviolent {{protest against the}} system of southern segregation known as <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws would lead to extensive {{media coverage of the}} struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by Southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the Civil Rights Movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{politics}} {{had long}} {{played a role}} in Baltimore. As the state of Maryland did not attempt to prevent African Americans from voting through <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws, political coalitions often involved African American community leaders. Theodore McKeldin, who served as mayor from 1943 through 1947 and from 1963 through 1967, {{was one of the first}} political leaders to work with African American community leaders. By 1999, 63% of Baltimore's registered voters were African American, and 90% were registered to the Democratic Party. Baltimore had not elected a Republican mayor since 1963.|$|E
5|$|Racism was {{the main}} target of DuBois's polemics, and he {{strongly}} protested against lynching, <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws, and discrimination in education and employment. His cause included people of color everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in colonies. He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several Pan-African Congresses {{to fight for the}} independence of African colonies from European powers. DuBois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. After World War I, he surveyed the experiences of American black soldiers in France and documented widespread prejudice in the United States military.|$|E
40|$|After {{the passage}} of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, {{advocacy}} of de jure segregation quickly ceased to be an acceptable position within American political discourse. The speed of the political shift left figures who had openly supported de jure segregation with a political problem: how would they explain their former support for a position which had rapidly become not only discarded, but actively disreputable to have held? This study explores the responses to this dilemma through a series of case studies, highlighting different characteristic approaches that various figures took. George Wallace is examined {{as an example of a}} politician who tried [...] although less effusively than is commonly believed [...] to apologize for his former position. Strom Thurmond is examined as an example of a politician who, to the greatest extent possible, took refuge in silence about his former political stances. Robert Bork, whose opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act became infamous during the hearings about his nomination to the Supreme Court, is considered as someone who wrote off his former position as a technical (and therefore reasonable) mistake. The case of Herman Talmadge is used as an example of a politician who took refuge in a thin veneer of technical denials. Political commentator William F. Buckley's inconsistent and evasive answers present yet another strategy. And one politician who refused to accede to the new political consensus, Lester Maddox, is used to explore what happened to those who failed to shift with the times. A final chapter explores the attempts of later self-identified conservatives to grapple with the oft-overlooked roots of the conservative movement's political successes in segregationist ideology and <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow's</b> former supporters...|$|R

5|$|Learned Hand {{remained}} in good {{physical and mental}} condition {{for most of the}} last decade of his life. In 1958, he gave the Holmes Lectures at Harvard Law School. These lectures proved to be Hand's last major critique of judicial activism, a position he had first taken up in 1908 with his attack on the Lochner ruling. They included a controversial attack on the Warren Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which in Hand's opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> segregation laws. His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate, with most deploring the fact that they might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings. Published as The Bill of Rights, the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I examine {{specifically}} {{how and why}} historical {{narratives of}} African American theatre begin with minstrelsy and <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow’s</b> dancing body. Working {{with the process of}} historical production from Michel-Rolph Trouillot’s Silencing the Past, I trace the related emergence of an imagined and Europeanist dancing body alongside the imagined and Black dancing body. I use imagined, following Susan Leigh Foster, because written sources and historical narratives do not facilitate physical or corporeal access. In Early Modern archives, I reveal how European dance masters and philosophers elevated court dancing and noble decorum into the imagined and ideal human. The imagined Europeanist and noble dancing body became the principal historiographic human figure in legitimated dance histories. Concurrently, I show how European travel writing negated imagined Black dancing bodies as inhuman, savage and bestial bodies, disqualifying them as imagined dancing bodies for inclusion in historical narratives. Thus, when scholars go to archived sources, with choreographed ballet and imagined Europeanist dancing bodies as the legitimated carriers of dance history, Thomas Dartmouth Rice and early minstrel performers emerge as the first qualified and documented dancing bodies moving through sub-Saharan repertoires. By further recuperating seventeenth-century, European-language sources on leaping and mock combat, I question the exclusion of airborne and martial repertoires from historical narratives of Black dance from West Africa to the United States. I argue that the process of silencing airborne leaps and staged combat from West African belonging lays the philosophical and historiographic groundwork for originating and containing sub-Saharan influences within plantation and minstrelsy belonging. By revealing where we are, philosophically speaking, in historical narratives of Black dance, and how we got to this point, I propose an extensive re-mapping of sub-Saharan influence through and across the Sahara and Mediterranean, prior to and alongside the trans-Atlantic trade...|$|R
