40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a new collaborative {{approach to the}} collection of <b>representation</b> <b>information</b> to ensure long term access to digital content. <b>Representation</b> <b>information</b> is essential for successful rendering of digital content in the future. Manual collection and maintenance of <b>representation</b> <b>information</b> has so far proven to be highly resource intensive and {{is compounded by the}} massive scale of the challenge, especially for repositories with no format limitations. This solution combats these challenges by drawing upon the wisdom and knowledge of the crowd to identify online sources of <b>representation</b> <b>information,</b> which are then collected, classified, and managed using existing tools. We suggest that nominations can be harvested and preserved by participating established web archives, which themselves could obviously benefit from such extensive collections. This is a low cost, low resource approach to collecting essential <b>representation</b> <b>information</b> of widespread relevance...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} for analyzing {{the similarity of}} dynamical systems is presented with applications {{to the analysis of}} voice. This approach is based on a fuzzy <b>information</b> space <b>representation</b> of the trajectories of the voice signal.

50|$|Necessary to {{fields such}} as Enterprise Information Integration (EII) and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), it is most often used {{regarding}} analysis of disparate data types and data sources, which must be rendered into a uniform <b>information</b> <b>representation,</b> and generally must appear homogenous to the analysis tools—when the data being analyzed is typically heterogeneous and widely varying in size, type, and original representation.|$|E
50|$|Uniform <b>information</b> <b>representation</b> is {{particularly}} important {{in the fields of}} Enterprise Information Integration (EII) and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), where different departments of a large organization may have collected information for different purposes, with different labels and units, until one department realized that data already collected by those other departments could be re-purposed for their own needs—saving the enterprise the effort and cost of re-collecting the same information.|$|E

It provides an abstraction of <b>information</b> <b>representations</b> in different communication channels, unifies access to im-plicit and explicit information, and wires together the logic behind context-sensitive modality switches by a rule-based approach. In this paper, we present the structure and major features of our framework, and show exemplary implementations of interaction modalities with help of M 3 I. ...|$|R

High-speed, circuit-level optical methods are better suited than single-cell physiology {{to detect and}} quantitatively describe spatiotemporal dynamics (such as areal spread of activity) that may be altered in psychiatric disease. These circuit dynamics measures relate to how information propagates rather than to a specific neural code. We propose that depression may depend on changes {{in the ability of}} <b>information</b> <b>representations</b> to organize and percolate through sparsely active networks...|$|R

50|$|Enterprise {{information}} integration (EII) is {{the ability}} to support a unified view of data and information for an entire organization. In a data virtualization application of EII, a process of information integration, using data abstraction to provide a unified interface (known as uniform data access) for viewing all the data within an organization, and a single set of structures and naming conventions (known as uniform <b>information</b> <b>representation)</b> to represent this data; the goal of EII is to get a large set of heterogeneous data sources to appear to a user or system as a single, homogeneous data source.|$|E
40|$|Cognitively {{adequate}} <b>information</b> <b>representations</b> have a {{great potential}} to improve interactions between systems and users. They are able to account for a specific user’s personal understanding, knowledge and preferences. To utilize this capacity for the personalization of services, we need to represent information on a level that corresponds to human cognition. In this paper, we show how to generate such a description {{in the form of}} a conceptual space from an existing landmarks database. We then analyze this process for future automation and generalization...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContext-aware mobile {{computing}} aims at designing applications that automatically adapt their behaviors to the available location {{information and the}} available nearby sensors and devices. This is done {{in order to fulfill}} tasks in a way that suits users' current context best. To achieve this, context representation and manipulation are important issues, so as to establish formal context models. In this paper, basic elements of context-aware systems are described with an emphasis on location <b>information</b> <b>representations.</b> Space models for location-based applications are presented. Considered realistic applications concern intelligent vehicles and pervasive road networks...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} ubiquitous, context aware {{computing}} {{has made the}} problem of choosing how to present information to the user significantly more complex. The designer must consider the level of detail and abstraction determined by the physical form factor, the integration of information from other external and communicated <b>information</b> sources (and <b>representations),</b> {{and the use of}} represented information in collaborative acts and communications. Furthermore, it is a design decision which must be made {{in the context of the}} wider development process. In this paper, we re-evaluate the processes and models with which we can choose <b>information</b> <b>representations,</b> and put forward a framework based on the Resources Model. We consider how this can be done while obtaining leverage from modeling and requirements analysis effort carried out for other parts of the system development...|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{deductive}} languages {{are rooted in}} the principles of deductive reasoning; making inferences based upon current knowledge. The first recommendation to use a clausal form of logic for representing computer programs was made by Cordell Green (1969) at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). This idea can also be linked back to the battle between procedural and declarative <b>information</b> <b>representation</b> in early artificial intelligence systems. Deductive languages and their use in logic programming can also be dated to the same year when Foster and Elcock introduced Absys, the first deductive/logical programming language. Shortly after, the first Prolog system was introduced in 1972 by Colmerauer through collaboration with Robert Kowalski.|$|E
50|$|Programming the Z80 is {{a seminal}} {{programming}} text, written by Rodnay Zaks and {{first published in}} 1979 by Sybex. It is designed as both an educational text to teach programming techniques of elementary to intermediate level using Assembly language, and as a self-contained reference book. Topics specific to the Zilog Z80 microprocessor, such as its internal hardware organisation and instruction set are described in detail. Additionally more general concepts, such as <b>information</b> <b>representation</b> and data structures are also covered. The book is considered an indispensable reference guide by many Z80 programmers. It was also published by Radio Shack with the title How To Program The Z80. A companion volume Z80 Applications written by James W. Coffron was published in 1983 by Sybex.|$|E
5000|$|Information {{models can}} also be {{expressed}} in formalized natural languages, such as Gellish. Gellish has natural language variants such as Gellish Formal English and Gellish Formal Dutch (Gellish Formeel Nederlands), etc. Gellish Formal English is an <b>information</b> <b>representation</b> language or semantic modeling language that is defined in the Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy, which has {{the form of a}} Taxonomy-Ontology (similarly for Dutch). Gellish Formal English is not only suitable to express knowledge, requirements and dictionaries, taxonomies and ontologies, but also information about individual things. All that information is expressed in one language and therefore it can all be integrated, independent of the question whether it is stored in central or distributed or in federated databases. Information models in Gellish Formal English consists of collections of Gellish Formal English expressions, that use natural language terms and formalized phrases. For example, a geographic information model might consist of a number of Gellish Formal English expressions, such as: ...|$|E
