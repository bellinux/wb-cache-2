We are grateful to Dan Ilgen and Bob Wood for commenting and critiquing prior versions of this article and to Elizabeth Morrison for This article reports {{on the development of}} a concept of personal initiative (PI). Personal initiative is a work behavior defined as self-starting and proactive that overcomes barriers to achieve a goal. It is argued that future workplaces will require people to show more PI than before, and that current concepts of performance and organizational behavior are more reactive than desirable. The facets of PI are developed along the lines of goals, information collection, plans, and feedback. Personal initiative enables people to deal with <b>job</b> <b>difficulties</b> more actively, for example, with stressors, unemployment, career changes, or becoming an entrepreneur. High PI changes the work situation of employees and relates to success as an entrepreneur. Personal initiative is seen to sharpen and partly modify the concepts of reciprocal determinism, organizational citizenship behavior, innovation, entrepreneurship, work performance, intrinsic motivation, and self-regulation.

40|$|Nurses are {{the largest}} {{professional}} group within hospitals. The lack of Nursing Job Motivation (NJM) has {{a negative effect on}} {{the health and safety of}} clients. There are issues in work disinterestedness and job dissatisfaction among nurses. This research presents the findings of a study exploring the barriers to NJM among Iranian nurses. This study was situated within the grounded theory method. Participants were 19 Iranian registered nurses working in some hospitals in Tabriz and Hamadan in Iran. Through data analysis, several main themes emerged to describe the factors that hindered NJM. Nurses in this study identified <b>job</b> <b>difficulty,</b> powerlessness and lack of authority, low income, harassment and violence to them, lack of support for nurses, centralized management, physician-centred culture in hospitals, lack of facilities and lack of a clear nursing job description. Job motivation is essential for enhancing nurses` role, strengthening the professional image, improving the healthcare system, increasing the quality of caring and the individual and community health. To maximize primary health care effectiveness, health workers especially nurses must be motivated. It can be facilitated by eliminating barriers to job motivation...|$|E

Main Topics : Variables A large proportion of the data were gathered by means of a postal questionnaire, using conventional self-report measures, often in Likert-type format. However, in addition, respondents were asked to provide open-ended descriptions of concrete stressful incidents which were subjected to content analysis. Finally, in an effort to obtain consensual validation of some of the self-report data, information was obtained from colleagues of the respondents who were familiar with their jobs. Measures of stress included role stress, frustration stress (Likert format), <b>job</b> <b>difficulty</b> characteristics (open-ended).

A sample of patients with MS completed the MSQ-Job, WHODAS 2. 0 and MSQOL- 54 respectively for work difficulties, disability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) evaluation. K-means Cluster Analysis was used to divide the sample in three groups {{on the basis of}} HRQoL and disability. ANOVA test was performed to compare the response pattern between these groups. The cut-off score was defined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses for MSQ-Job total and count of MSQ-Job items scores ≥ 3 : a score value corresponding to the maximum of the sensitivity-to-specificity ratio was chosen as the cut-off. Out of 180 patients enrolled, twenty were clustered in the higher severity group. The area under the ROC curve was 0. 845 for the MSQ-Job total and 0. 859 for the count of MSQ-Job items scores ≥ 3 while the cut-off score was 15. 8 for MSQ-Job total and 8 for count of items scored ≥ 3.
