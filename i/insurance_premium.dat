5|$|While health <b>{{insurance}}</b> <b>premium</b> {{costs have}} moderated, {{some of this}} is because of insurance policies that have a higher deductible, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums that shift costs from insurers to patients. In addition, many employees are choosing to combine a health savings account with higher deductible plans, making the impact of the ACA difficult to determine precisely.|$|E
5|$|Scuba diving {{fatalities}} have a {{major financial}} impact by way of lost income, lost business, <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} the subsidy given to a family {{to cover the cost}} of a premium is {{calculated}} using a formula that includes the family's income relative to the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of the federal poverty level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. The difference between the family's maximum contribution to health insurance premiums and the cost of the health <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is paid for by the federal government.|$|E

40|$|Housing price jump {{risk and}} the {{subprime}} crisis have drawn {{more attention to}} the precise estimation of mortgage <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> This study derives the pricing formula for mortgage <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> by assuming that the housing price process follows the jump diffusion process, capturing important characteristics of abnormal shock events. This assumption is consistent with the empirical observation of the U. S. monthly national average new home returns from 1986 to 2008. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of price jump risk on mortgage <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> from shock frequency of the abnormal events, abnormal mean and volatility of jump size, and normal volatility. Empirical results indicate that the abnormal volatility of jump size has the most significant impact on mortgage <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> Copyright (c) The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2009. ...|$|R

The combination of tax breaks for premiums and the health savings account as well as a tax subsidy to pay for the catastrophic <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> of lower income individuals has boosted the popularity of these plans. By April 2007, some 4.5 million Americans were enrolled in HSAs; more than a fourth of those were previously uninsured.|$|E
25|$|In many states, {{the price}} of title {{insurance}} is regulated by a state insurance commission. In these states, the rate for the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> cannot be controlled by the industry. Unlike other forms of insurance (such as life, medical, or home owners), title insurance is not paid for annually, as it has one payment for the term of the policy, which is in effect until the property is resold or refinanced.|$|E
25|$|Occupational {{safety and}} health {{practice}} vary among nations with different approaches to legislation, regulation, enforcement, and incentives for compliance.

A third group of EU member states has experimented with using workplace accident <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> discounts for companies or organisations with strong OSH records.|$|E

25|$|When the tea {{clippers}} {{arrived in}} China in 1870, {{they found a}} big {{increase in the number}} of steamers, which were in high demand. The rate of freight to London that was given to steamers was nearly twice that paid to the sailing ships. Additionally, the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> for a cargo of tea in a steamer was substantially less than for a sailing vessel. So successful were the steamers using the Suez Canal that, in 1871, 45 were built in Clyde shipyards alone for Far Eastern trade.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{farmers are}} a major {{beneficiary}} of crop subsidies and other agricultural programs. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture data, from 1995 to 2012 the U.S. federal government paid over $39 billion in wheat subsidies, through direct payments (2003–present) and production flexibility contracts (1996-2002), deficiency payments, crop <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> subsidies, price support payments (including loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, and certificates), counter-cyclical programs, market loss assistance, and other wheat programs. In 2012, wheat was the third most-subsidized crop, after corn and soybeans. Wheat farmers received $1.1 billion in subsidies in 2012.|$|E
25|$|In February 2006, President George W. Bush {{signed into}} law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related {{conforming}} amendments act. The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, {{as well as a}} number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund.|$|E

The premium increased to over $120 {{a month in}} 2016 but only for those not on Social Security in 2015. A new income-based premium surtax schema has been in effect since 2007, wherein Part B premiums are higher for beneficiaries with incomes exceeding $85,000 for individuals or $170,000 for married couples. Depending {{on the extent to}} which beneficiary earnings exceed the base income, these higher Part B premiums are $139.90, $199.80, $259.70, or $319.70 for 2012, with the highest premium paid by individuals earning more than $214,000, or married couples earning more than $428,000.|$|E
25|$|In some states, the {{regulated}} premium charge {{does not include}} part of the underwriting costs necessary for the process. In those states, title insurers may also charge search or abstracting fees for searching the public records, or examination fees to compensate them for the title examination. These fees are usually not regulated and in those cases may sometimes be negotiated. In some states, regulation requires that the title insurer base its policy on the opinion of an attorney. The attorney's fees are not regulated. They are also {{not part of the}} title <b>insurance</b> <b>premium,</b> though the title insurer may include those fees within its invoice as a convenience to the attorney rendering the opinion. Similarly, fees for closing a sale or mortgage transaction are not regulated in most states though the charge for closing may appear in the invoice disclosing the total charges for the transaction.|$|E
25|$|NHTSA has {{produced}} models and guidance {{on the economic}} burden of traffic crashes on employers. Because public and private employers in the U.S. generally subsidize at least a portion of health <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> costs for employees and their dependents, employers bear some {{of the costs of}} crashes involving employees and families away from work in addition to at-work crashes. Employers are also liable for damages awarded in the courts for crashes for which employees are found to be at fault. In 1998-2000, motor vehicle crash injuries occurring on and off the job were estimated to cost employers nearly US $60 billion annually. On average, a fatality occurring on the job cost a business over $500,000 USD in direct and liability costs, and each nonfatal injury cost nearly $74,000 USDs. For on- and off-the-job crashes combined, the study estimated the cost of non-use of safety belts at more than $6 billion each year, and the cost of alcohol-related crashes at more than $9 billion each year.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{the motor}} carrier {{industry}} has experienced: (1) the sharp decline of vehicle (tractor) re-sale values, and (2) the substantial increase of vehicle <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> This study examines how motor carriers should adjust their vehicle replacement policies when dramatic changes of vehicle re-sale values and <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> are observed. The study first develops {{a model of}} vehicle replacement optimization, and then solves the model by using the actual data obtained from a motor carrier. Intensive sensitivity analyses are performed to examine how the optimal solution {{is affected by the}} changes of vehicle re-sale values and <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums,</b> so that carriers can obtain normative policy implications. The results imply that: (1) carriers should use longer replacement cycles (extend the duration of vehicle use) when re-sale values decline, and (2) carriers' vehicle replacement policies should not be affected by the fluctuations of <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> unless the fluctuations are substantial. ...|$|R
