Recently, we reported on dry-spinning of a partially acetylated softwood kraft lignin to produce carbon fibers with superior properties, but the thermo-oxidative stabilization step required {{a long time}} due to a slow heating rate needed to prevent the fibers from being heated too rapidly and sticking to each other.

Amorphous polymer nanofibers, such as polystyrene (PS) and its co-polymers tend to lose their fiber morphology during processing at temperatures above their glass transition temperature (T-g) typically bound to happen in nanocomposite/structural composite applications. As an answer to this problem, incorporation of the crosslinking agents, phthalic anhydride (PA) and tributylamine (TBA), into the electrospinning polymer solution functionalized by glycidylmethacrylate (GMA) copolymerization, namely P(St-co-GMA), is demonstrated. Despite {{the presence of the}} crosslinker molecules, the electrospinning polymer solution is stable and its viscosity remains unaffected below 60 degrees C. Crosslinking reaction stands-by and can be thermally stimulated during post-processing of the electrospun P(St-co-GMA) /PA-TBA fiber mat at intermediate temperatures (below the T-g). This strategy enables the preservation of the nanofiber morphology during subsequent high temperature processing. The crosslinking event leads to an increase in T-g of the base polymer by 30 degrees C depending on degree of crosslinking. Crosslinked nanofibers are able to maintain their nanofibrous morphology above the T-g and upon exposure to organic solvents.
