60|$|Fost. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> {{that there}} was none but a company of poor, simple, ignorant people that came to hear me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Since {{you choose}} to degrade yourself,' <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>Again</b> the flash came over her face, the yellow lights {{concentrated}} in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{really feel}} quite {{confident}} that nothing external can affect you?' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> {{in a voice}} rendered uncertain by his agitation.|$|E
6000|$|While they rested, Bailey {{kept his}} eyes on their {{backward}} trail, watching for his partner, Rivers. [...] "It's about time Jim showed up," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> once <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Edie,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> {{beginning}} <b>again</b> more boldly, {{and taking}} her little gloved hand almost unresistingly in his; 'Edie, {{you know my}} secret. I love you. Can you love me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{were to do}} such a very ridiculous thing,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> {{stopping}} <b>again</b> presently, {{and leaning}} against the chimney-piece, 'it could only be in the most inviolable confidence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Seeing {{that the}} strangers were gazing on him so earnestly, Kwytoffle {{thought they were}} frightened; so <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> in a big voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish to ask you, sir," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "whether or no {{you believe}} that {{vaccination}} is a prophylactic against smallpox." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --I see, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> {{with new}} pleasure. Moses and the promised land. We gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O'Molloy.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{can stop}} me," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> {{reverting}} <b>again</b> to English {{as he turned}} and addressed Betty, [...] "from killing you as my wife was killed by white man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not for that," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> busy <b>again</b> {{with the}} sail stops; [...] "nor St. Chrysostom's, were he {{to come here}} and vouch for it. It is too damned improbable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{ashamed of}} this childishness," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> turning <b>again</b> to Captain Jekyl; [...] "if it excites your ridicule, sir, {{let it be}} at least a proof of my sincerity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, so long!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> and, {{before the}} {{astonished}} maiden could resist, placed a huge arm about {{her neck and}} kissed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Two hundred years," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> {{with the}} figure of a great gulf opening very slowly in his mind; and then, [...] "Oh, but--!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My bride is here," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>again</b> drawing me to him, [...] "because my equal is here, and my likeness. Jane, {{will you}} marry me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The deferential Nepaulese did {{not wait}} to be asked. [...] "Salaam, sahib," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> bowing <b>again</b> very low till his {{forehead}} almost touched the ground. [...] "You are Eulopean doctor, sahib?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank God!' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> as <b>again</b> <b>he</b> leant {{back in his}} chair; {{and when}} she raised her eyes again, he sat with his hands clasped, and a look of heavenly felicity on his face, raised upwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "I kep' thinking," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> trying <b>again,</b> [...] "I kep' thinking--after all--I been {{cross to}} you and a fool about things--about them cards, Ann; but"--his voice shook to pieces--"we 'ave been 'appy, Ann ... some'ow ... togever." ...|$|R
6000|$|MacIan stood rolling {{those great}} blue Gaelic eyes that contrasted with his dark hair. [...] "It {{is the voice}} of God," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> and again.|$|E
6000|$|But {{he was not}} to be put {{off with}} the seagull. [...] "Miss Beatrice," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "are you going out walking next Sunday afternoon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No: I am fond of myrtle.' Seeing {{that she}} did not take kindly to the idea, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> 'Why do you object to my having that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, maybe I'd better hedge on the bet," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> {{laughing}} <b>again.</b> [...] "You {{have more}} in you than I suspect. You sure fooled me when you stood for the sheep-dip. But, come on, I'll take you anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{received}} the cup. [...] "Yes, and here too." [...] After which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>again</b> till, first pouring in milk to cool it, he had drunk his tea down. [...] "That's not literally true, you know. I HAVE been in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{may well}} say Dear me!' rejoined Mrs Wilfer, {{in a deep}} tone. Upon which {{encouragement}} <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it <b>again,</b> though scarcely with the success he had expected; for the scornful lady then remarked, with extreme bitterness: 'You said that before.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-night, Lady Harcourt," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>again</b> essaying to {{take her}} hand. This and his other {{customary}} greeting was all that he had yet spoken to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Missie," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "is {{there any}} answer? I must be going. I {{want to get}} back {{in time to see the}} Boers take Pretoria." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Plantation liquor?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>again</b> {{assuming}} a stupid air, {{to a black}} sergeant who was with them. [...] "First-rate stuff, and only fifteen cents a glass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{offered him}} a house and money, but he wanted neither, for he loved his little cottage and had no need of gold, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Think <b>again,</b> little maids, and find {{something}} he will like," [...] said the King, looking at Betty.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>said</b> to him, [...] "Feed my lambs." [...] 16 <b>He</b> <b>said</b> to him <b>again</b> {{a second}} time, [...] "Simon, son of Jonah, {{do you love}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grizel, I {{have come}} back." [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> {{it to the}} night, and bowed his head. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> it with head accompaniment to Grizel's lighted window. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> it {{to himself as he}} reached the door. <b>He</b> never <b>said</b> it <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'What's the matter?' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> {{when she}} was quieter. But she only pressed her face further into his shoulder, in pain, like a child that cannot tell.|$|E
6000|$|... "A soul, you know," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> {{and looked}} at the Sea Lady with the air of a man who is {{handling}} a difficult matter with skilful care.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm back," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "I've had a beastly time. By God! I came steerage. I've {{got nothing}} but what I stand up in, and that bag." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{brother-in-law}} {{is staying}} at an hotel--the Eastern Hotel," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> becoming sombre <b>again.</b> [...] "I haven't {{the slightest idea}} where it is." ...|$|R
25|$|According to {{her ex-husband}} Khan, after the global alert {{for her was}} issued, Siddiqui went into hiding and worked for al-Qaeda. During her disappearance, Khan <b>said</b> <b>he</b> saw her at Islamabad airport in April 2003 as she disembarked from a flight with their son; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> helped Inter-Services Intelligence {{identify}} her. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>again</b> saw her two years later, in a Karachi traffic jam. Khan, who unsuccessfully sought custody of his son Ahmed and {{said most of the}} claims of Siddiqui's family in the Pakistani media relating to her and their children were one-sided and mostly false.|$|R
60|$|So I <b>said</b> it <b>again,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> his <b>again,</b> and I <b>said</b> mine <b>again,</b> {{and then}} he did, and then I did, {{and then he}} did, and we kept on doing it, and doing it, and I never had such a good time, and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> the same. In my opinion there isn't {{anything}} that is as killing {{as one of those}} dear old ripe pensioners {{if you know how to}} snatch it out in a kind of a fresh sort of original way.|$|R
