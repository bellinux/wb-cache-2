40|$|We give an {{overview}} of mathematical music theory {{as it has been}} developed in the past twenty years. The present theory includes a formal language for musical and musicological objects and relations. This language is built upon topos theory and its logic. Various models of musical phenomena have been developed. They include <b>harmony</b> (<b>function</b> theory, cadences, and modulations), classical counterpoint (Fux rules), rhythm, motif theory, and the theory of musical performance. Most of these models have also been implemented and evaluated in computer applications. Some models have been tested empirically in neuro-musicology and the cognitive science of music. The mathematical nature of this modeling process canonically embedds the given historical music theories in a variety of fictitious theories and thereby enables a qualification of historical reality against potential variants. As a result, the historical realizations often turn out {{to be some kind of}} “best possible world ” and thus reveals a type of “anthropic principle” in music. These models use different types of mathematical approaches, such as—for instance—enumeration combinatorics, group and module theory, algebraic geometry and topology, vector fields and numerical solutions of differential equations, Grothendieck topologies, topos theory, and statistics. The results lead to good simulations of classical results of music and performance theory. There is a number of classifiaction theorems of determined categories of musical structures. The overview concludes by a discussion of mathematical and musicological challenges which issue from the investigation of music by mathematics, including the project of “Grand Unification ” of harmony and counterpoint and the classification of musical performance. ...|$|E
40|$|In proposing {{constraint}} ranking Prince and Smolensky (1993 / 2004) {{depart from}} OT’s predecessor Harmonic Grammar (HG; Smolensky and Legendre 2006). In HG optimality is defined numerically as maximal Harmony, which is calculated as {{the sum of}} a candidate’s weighted constraint scores. OT’s use of ranking rather than weighting is sometimes justified {{in terms of its}} restrictiveness: weighted interaction is claimed to be too powerful for HG to function as a realistic model of human language (Prince and Smolensky 1993 / 2004 : 236; 1997 : 1608, Legendre et al. 2006 b). In this talk, I present results of several ongoing collaborative research projects on HG. I will discuss the following points: (1) i. HG is (perhaps surprisingly) restrictive, due to inherent limitations on the types of languages that can be generated by an optimization system (Bhatt et al. 2007; Pater et al. 2007) ii. HG is compatible with a simple correctly convergent gradual learning algorithm, the Perceptron algorithm of Rosenblatt (1958) (Boersma and Pater 2007; Pater 2007 a; see Jäger 2006, Soderstrom et al. 2006 for precedents). iii. To deal with variation, HG can be implemented with noise, as in stochastic OT (Boersma 1998; Boersma and Hayes 2001). Testing shows that noisy HG+Perceptron is robust, unlike stochastic OT+GLA (Boersma and Pater 2007). iv. Gradual learning yields Harmony values that reflect frequency distributions. A problem for the HG account of gradient well-formedness (Keller 2006; Legendre et al. 2006 a) raised by Boersma (2004) can be resolved with a revised HG acceptability metric (Coetzee and Pater 2007). 1 Weighted optimization Given a linguistic representation R, its scores on a set of constraints ({C 1 (R), C 2 (R), C 3 (R), [...] .

Both Part I and Part II focus on Debussy's use of tonality and harmony. The earliest efforts to analyze Debussy's harmony resulted in static labeling of chord types, description of simple modal usage, examination of cadential technique, and the like. The extent of his renunciation of classical tonality was not fully grasped until the 1950 s, when studies by Reti, Salzer and Mueller {{paved the way for}} a more dynamic under-standing {{of the ways in which}} the composer suppressed, evaded, suspended and rarefied the relationship of his pitch materials to a central tone. The problem remains of defining Debussy's attitude toward tonality [...] tonality in the broad sense [...] in a positive way. The analyses in Part II attempt to show that Debussy's piano compositions are logical tonal structures exhibiting a variety of symmetrical and developmental dispositions of tonalities; the interrelationships of the tonalities are seen as providing a basis for the analytical perception of Debussy's music. The pieces analyzed range from an early work in which <b>harmony</b> <b>functions</b> within classical tonality in a traditional manner to a late work in which tonal, modal, ambiguous and non-tonal elements mix and fuse in a unique synthesis and integration of musical thought...|$|R

Employees who are the resources of knowledge and experiences which are determinant in obtaining a privileged status fororganizations: New issues related to involving the most competent employees in organization, causing them to stay within theorganization, motivating and training them, meeting their expectations and rendering the harmony between the organization andemployees in question, have come into prominence. Herein, organization climate and organizational commitment are the notionsto be evaluated in this sense. Organization climate which refers to environmental conditions in which the works are carried out; is defined as anenvironment which human behaviors and relations forms by individual and environmental characteristics within the organization. Organization climate is {{the perceptions of the}} employees towards the organizational conditions. Provision of a perceptionoverlapping with expectations affects employees’ morale and feelings and thereby it plays a significant role in providing a strongculture ensuring commitment to organization, by rendering a positive atmosphere for employees. It is required that organizational culture has been demystified and has made its connection with organization climate so as tocause the organization climate understanding to be adopted and to involve it into administrative progress as a determinant inmaking decision. In this way, the role of the organization culture in the literature is dimensioned. Organization culture which is values, approaches, beliefs, norms and expectations that are shared by members of organizationand changed in time, is a phenomenon that has irrational dimensions concerning human and provides a behavioral guide whichhelps a collective integration of individuals. Assisting with organizations operating in a dynamic environment so as to conform tothe changing conditions of environment and expectation thereof provides external harmony {{which is one of the}} basic functions. Therewithal, it fulfills internal <b>harmony</b> <b>function</b> by guiding employees in what way they are required to behave and what theyneed to do. Surely, organization culture takes place in much deeper parts of human psychology in comparison to organizational climatesince it is related to beliefs and values that have been infused into them. It differentiates from the organization culture byreflecting organizational interpretations not assumptions, values and philosophies. But thereby, –the abovementioned andrequired to be perceived- integration may be observed. Second one of above indicated notions, organizational commitment may be defined as employee’s confidence to adopt theobjectives and values of the organization and willingness degree to struggle in favor of organization. Organizational commitment is an integral composing of desires of employees to maintain taking part in organization and to give intensive efforts fororganization along with confidence in objectives and values of organization. There are some factors influencing the organizational commitment. Psychological agreement, labor expectation and personalspecifications are treated in this context. At the same time, it is designated that there are also some organizational factorsinvolving organization culture aforementioned as it is beneficial to be focused on along with organizational culture. In this work, it is aimed to put forward guiding outcomes over the relationship between the two notions in question – withinthe framework of the fact that is needed to be administered in the light of providing organizational effectiveness of employeesand their relationship with the organization. Dealing with the relationship between the organizational commitment andorganization culture, it is intended to contribute to the works related to the subject and satisfy the expectations of implementers. In this work, notions at issue are firstly treated theoretically in a manner to provide a semantic perspective. Notions searchedin literature are brought forward in a manner to reflect the essence of the subject by utilizing the basic sources. Relationship witheach other has been dealt with in a manner to clarify the findings of the employees’ implementations. It is considered that organization climate and organizational commitment is significant subjects and academic organizationswhich observes the work human relations reflecting directly on operating results, are beneficial for the implementation. SelcukUniversity academic personnel are targeted for the implementation. In this regard, academicians studying in the Selcuk Universitycompose the main components of the work. Academic personnel servicing in vocational schools in provincials and four years-colleges in the downtowns are excludedfrom the work since they make efforts to provide the student with the vocational and educational and training experiences not tofocus on academic studies and they could be restrictive for the work. Along with such rationales 750 academic personnel whoserves in just twelve faculties within the sixteen faculties has been involved in the work together with Selcuk University. Within the scope of the work, questionnaire method has been used in collecting the data. Therefore, questionnaire draft hasbeen prepared in conformity with the objectives of the work and taking into consideration the respective literature and previousworks on this subject. Draft has been compared with the objectives and assumptions of the work. Later, it is requested from therespective specialist academicians and operation managers to share their opinions regarding the questionnaire. At the end of theprocess, some questions and explanations were rearranged and the questionnaire was finalized. The questionnaire consists ofaggregate eight questions. For majority of the questions, five point Likert Scale is utilized. The questionnaire was reformed as a form and delivered to the academicians manually. 440 questionnaires of 750 returnedback. (Return is: % 59.) Data was coded and analyzed though SPSS 11. 5 version packaged software. Findings obtained weregathered and evaluated in a manner to form a base for manifesting the outcomes which contribute to the theorists andimplementers.
