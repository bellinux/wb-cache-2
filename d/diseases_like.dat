5|$|About 18% {{of the men}} and 30% of {{the women}} in Kolkata are obese—the {{majority}} of them belonging to the non-poor strata of society. In 2005, Kolkata had the highest percentage (55%) among the surveyed cities of anaemic woman, while 20% of the men in Kolkata were anaemic. <b>Diseases</b> <b>like</b> diabetes, asthma, goitre and other thyroid disorders were found in large numbers of people. Tropical <b>diseases</b> <b>like</b> malaria, dengue and chikungunya are prevalent in Kolkata, though their incidence is decreasing. Kolkata is one of the districts in India with a high number of people with AIDS; it has been designated a district prone to high risk.|$|E
5|$|Generally, Manasa is worshiped {{without an}} image. A {{branch of a}} tree, an earthen pot or an earthen snake image is worshiped as the goddess, though images of Manasa are worshipped too. She is worshiped for {{protection}} from and cure of snake bites and infectious <b>diseases</b> <b>like</b> smallpox and chicken pox.|$|E
5|$|However, black {{wildebeest}} {{can also}} affect human beings negatively. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal <b>diseases</b> <b>like</b> rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E

5|$|In December 2014, Allen {{committed}} $100million {{to create}} the Allen Institute for Cell Science in Seattle. The institute is investigating and creating a virtual model of cells {{in the hope of}} bringing forth treatment of different <b>diseases.</b> <b>Like</b> the institutes before it, all data generated and tools developed will be made publicly available online.|$|E
5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} <b>diseases</b> <b>like</b> {{atopic dermatitis}} (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It {{remains to be seen whether}} selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E

5|$|Several <b>diseases,</b> <b>like</b> Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} {{simply because}} their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem with}} the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. It should be noted, however, that MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets.|$|E
5|$|The {{wildebeest}} {{benefit the}} ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta. They are economically important {{for human beings}} as they are a major tourist attraction. They also provide important products like leather to humans. The wildebeest, however, can also {{have a negative impact}} on humans. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal <b>diseases</b> <b>like</b> rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne <b>diseases</b> <b>like</b> blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E

5|$|Fiji's native birdlife {{has been}} badly {{affected}} by agriculture, deforestation and introduced pests like rats and mongooses. Although Important Bird Areas {{have been established}} on Taveuni and the forest east of Vanua Levu, conservation problems persist. The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man-made landscapes; it is neither a ground nor hole nester, so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle mynas. Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity. The potential introduction of other species, such as snakes, or <b>diseases</b> <b>like</b> avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and <b>diseases</b> <b>like</b> chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
5|$|Medieval Islamic science had {{practical}} purposes {{as well as}} the goal of understanding. For example, astronomy was useful for determining the Qibla, the direction in which to pray, botany had practical application in agriculture, as in the works of Ibn Bassāl and Ibn al-'Awwam, and geography enabled Abu Zayd al-Balkhi to make accurate maps. Islamic mathematicians such as al-Khwarizmi, Avicenna and Jamshid al-Kashi developed methods in algebra, geometry and trigonometry. Islamic doctors described <b>diseases</b> <b>like</b> smallpox and measles and challenged classical Greek medical theory. Al-Biruni, Avicenna and others described the preparation of hundreds of drugs made from medicinal plants and chemical compounds. Islamic physicists studied optics and mechanics (as well as astronomy) and criticised Aristotle's view of motion.|$|E

5000|$|Defining an {{epizootic}} can be subjective; it {{is based}} upon the number of new cases in a given animal population, during a given period, and must be judged to be a rate that substantially exceeds what is expected based on recent experience (i.e. a sharp elevation in the incidence rate). Because {{it is based}} on what is [...] "expected" [...] or thought normal, a few cases of a very rare <b>disease</b> (<b>like</b> a TSE outbreak in a cervid population) might be classified as an [...] "epizootic", while many cases of a common <b>disease</b> (<b>like</b> lymphocystis in esocids) would not.|$|R

5|$|Of note, the atrophic {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoids}} {{are not always}} a disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative <b>diseases</b> <b>like</b> psoriasis makes use of this property. SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances {{have shown that the}} former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, do seem to play an important role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.|$|E
25|$|A dozen {{inflammatory}} {{diseases of}} the immune system can attribute some risk to the haplotype. Some disease like coeliac disease primarily associate with certain genes. While other <b>diseases,</b> <b>like</b> type 1 diabetes may have several, highly different, genes that attribute risk. Still other <b>diseases,</b> <b>like</b> myasthenia gravis have undetermined linkage to the haplotype.|$|E
