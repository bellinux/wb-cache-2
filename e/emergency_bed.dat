The data collected by the <b>emergency</b> <b>bed</b> service provides a unique London-wide perspective of the hospital service and the recent changes observed are examined in this paper. When the <b>emergency</b> <b>bed</b> service fails to arrange for the admission of a patient after trying at least four hospitals the case is medically refereed.

The evaluation found that {{a wide range of}} projects resulted in improved quality of life for participants and considerable savings, as well as better local working relationships. •	Twenty-nine local authorities were involved as pilot sites, working with health and voluntary sector partners to develop services, with funding of £ 60 m •	Those projects developed ranged from low level services, such as lunch-clubs, to more formal preventive initiatives, such as hospital discharge and rapid response services •	Over {{a quarter of a million}} people (264, 637) used one or more of these services •	The reduction in hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>bed</b> days resulted in considerable savings, to the extent that for every extra £ 1 spent on the POPP services, there has been approximately a £ 1. 20 additional benefit in savings on <b>emergency</b> <b>bed</b> days.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine whether}} {{there are too many}} {{hospital}} beds in London. DESIGN [...] Analysis of data from the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, Mental Health Enquiry, health service indicators, and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Bed</b> Service. SETTING [...] England, London, and inner London. RESULTS [...] Hospital admission rates for acute plus geriatric services for London residents were very similar to the national values in all age groups. In the special case considered in the Tomlinson report [...] acute services in inner London [...] the admission rate was 22 % above the value for England. However, the admission rate of inner deprived Londoners was 9 % below that of comparable areas outside London. For psychiatry, admission rates in London roughly equalled those in comparable areas. When special health authorities were excluded, in 1990 - 1 there were 4 % more acute plus geriatric beds available per resident in London than in England. Bed provision has been reduced more rapidly in London than nationally. Extrapolating the trend of bed closures forward indicates that beds (all and acute) per resident in London are now at about the national average. Data from the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Bed</b> Service indicate that the pressure on available hospital beds in London has been increasing since 1985. CONCLUSIONS [...] Data regarding bed provision and utilisation for all specialties by London residents do not provide a case for reducing the total hospital bed stock in London at a rate faster than elsewhere. Bed closures should take account of London's relatively poorer social and primary health care circumstances, longer hospital waiting lists, poorer provision of residential homes, and evidence from the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Bed</b> Service of increasing pressure on beds. Higher average costs in London, some unavoidable, are forcing hospital beds to be closed at a faster rate in London than nationally...|$|E

The prediction errors or residuals from this model were then used as input to a neural network. These methods represent a novel approach to the problem of e±cient bed resource management for hospitals. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper on}} the London <b>Emergency</b> <b>Bed</b> Service (EBS) shows that the {{historical}} reasons for the service the EBS provides have parallels in the present pattern of use. The underlying theme {{throughout the history of}} EBS has been an effort to improve health care services by making it easier for general practitioners to secure emergency admissions for their patients. Procedures instigated in the late 1940 s and early 1950 s (medical referee procedure and 'red ' and'yellow' warnings) are still in use, although reasons for use to-day differ slightly from the original ones. Present data support the fact that for many general practitioners securing emergency admission for their patients is still a difficult, time-consuming process. Looking to the future, many general practitioners also expect that, with the decrease in acute bed provision in London, the role of EBS in making efficient use of scarce resources will achieve greater prominence...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{some models}} {{that attempt to}} forecast the number of occupied beds due to emergency admissions each day in an acute general hospital. Hospital bed managers have two conflicting demands: they must not only ensure that at all times they have sufficient empty beds to cope with possible emergency admissions but they must fill as many empty beds as possible with people on the waiting list. This model is important as it could help balance these two conflicting demands. The research is {{based on data from}} a district general and a postgraduate teaching hospital in South East London. Several tests indicate that <b>emergency</b> <b>bed</b> occupancy may have a nonlinear underlying data generating process. Therefore, both linear models and nonlinear models have been fitted to the data. At horizons up to 14 days, it was found that there was no statistically significant difference in the errors from the linear and nonlinear models.

40|$|DIRECT {{admission}} of patients from {{home is the}} predominant method of admission to geriatric medical units. Admission may take place {{as the result of}} a telephone consultation with the general practitioner or, in less urgent cases, following a domiciliary assessment visit by a member of the medical staff of the unit. However, in recent years the pattern of referral to hospitals in Belfast has changed. This has been brought about by the simultaneous development of general practitioner deputizing services and the <b>emergency</b> <b>bed</b> service. As a result, many more elderly patients are admitted from the casualty department without direct contact between the family doctor and the hospital medical staff. As it has been the custom for general medical units to accept all medical admissions from the casualty department, this has resulted in a change in the pattern of admission to both the geriatric medical and general medical units. To take account of this change in referral pattern it was decided to start a system of direct admissions from the casualty department to the geriatric medical unit of the Belfast City Hospital. This paper describes the results of the firs...|$|E
40|$|Community matrons are a {{relatively}} new government initiative aimed at case managing people with long-term conditions {{to reduce the number}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>bed</b> days used in hospitals. Although there have been extensive evaluations of similar case management projects, to date there has been little evaluation of the community matron's role and the perceptions patients have of this new service. One of the main Government agendas for care is to deliver a high quality service driven by the needs of the service users (DH, 2000). In order to drive this agenda, care is to deliver a high quality service driven by the needs of the service users (DH, 2000). In order to drive this agenda, it is important that the views and perceptions of people on the receiving end of the services are heard, valued and appropriate actions taken. This two part evaluative report sets out to explore how people with long-term conditions perceive the impact of community matrons and the differences this new service may have had on their lives.

40|$|AbstractCommunity matrons, {{specialist}} nurses {{trained in}} the management of long-term conditions working alongside primary care teams and social service staff, have {{played an important role in}} the new enhanced approach to community services (care closer to home) in England. The underpinning proposition is that timely proactive care inputs might prevent some acute exacerbations or reduce the severity of the acute exacerbation, and proper community-based interventions are expected to reduce 5 % of acute bed days. The community matrons intervention aims to increase patient and carer knowledge of their condition, increase patient confidence in their ability to manage their own health, and work with patients and carers to ensure they have an emergency plan that identifies impending deterioration and initiates a planned course of action or treatment to prevent a health crisis and thereby reduce emergency admissions to hospital. To encourage a systematic approach to case selection, the “Patient At Risk of Rehospitalization” or PARR tool has been developed and is recommended in national policy guidance. During 2003, the Department of Health in England established pilot sites in nine primary care organizations for the North American Evercare model, which showed no significant effect on rates of emergency admission, <b>emergency</b> <b>bed</b> days used or mortality, although patient experience of the service was positive and satisfaction levels high. Although the empirical evidence for the application of a case management approach to patients with long-term conditions is weak, the policy concept of strengthening community care for this large group of people has been compelling. The PARR tool may be fundamentally flawed because patients classified at risk of readmission may not necessarily benefit from case management. Further work is required to investigate the issue of optimum patient selection for case management, perhaps based on the potentially more clinically relevant construct of frailty...|$|E
40|$|The {{ambulance}} offload delay {{problem is}} a well-known result of overcrowding and congestion in emergency departments. Offload delay refers to the situation where area hospitals are unable to accept patients from regional ambulances {{in a timely manner}} due to lack of staff and bed capacity. The problem of offload delays is not a simple issue to resolve and has caused severe problems to the emergency medical services (EMS) providers, emergency department (ED) staff, and most importantly patients that are transferred to hospitals by ambulance. Except for several reports on the problem, not much research has been done on the subject. Almost all research to date has focused on either EMS or ED planning and operation and as far as we are aware there are no models which have considered the coordination of these units. We propose an analytical model which will allow us to analyze and explore the ambulance offload delay problem. We use queuing theory to construct a system representing the interaction of EMS and ED, and model the behavior of the system as a continuous time Markov chain. The matrix geometric method will be used to numerically compute various system performance measures under different conditions. We analyze the effect of adding more <b>emergency</b> <b>beds</b> in the ED, adding more ambulances, and reducing the ED patient length of stay, on various system performance measures such as the average number of ambulances in offload delay, average time in offload delay, and ambulance and bed utilization. We will show that adding more beds to the ED or reducing ED patient length of stay will {{have a positive impact on}} system performance and in particular will decrease the average number of ambulances experiencing offload delay and the average time in offload delay. Also, it will be shown that increasing the number of ambulances will have a negative impact on offload delays and increases the average number of ambulances in offload delay. However, other system performance measures are improved by adding more ambulances to the system. Finally, we will show the tradeoffs between adding more <b>emergency</b> <b>beds,</b> adding more ambulances, and reducing ED patient length of stay. We conclude that the hospital is the bottleneck in the system and in order to reduce ambulance offload delays, either hospital capacity has to be increased or ED patient length of stay is to be reduced...|$|R
