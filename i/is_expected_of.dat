5|$|The AWS has {{a mind of}} its own {{at times}} and reaches peak {{performance}} with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just what <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E

The planned renovations include replacing many of the old post railings and putting in plexiglass so it is easier for small children and wheelchair-bound guests to see the animals. The boardwalk will be lowered in some spots to provide up-close encounters with the animals. The cheetah and white rhino exhibits will be reconfigured, allowing for a new hippo exhibit between them.|$|E

When Ondine once again finds Palemon and realises how he has betrayed her, Tirrenio exacts a terrible revenge with his fellow Undines by causing death and destruction for all Palemon's guests.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} of rolling stock in Montreal went beyond just adopting the MP 59 car from Paris. North American cities building subway systems in the 1960s and 1970s (Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Atlanta) were in search of modern rolling stock that not only best fitted their needs but also encompassed a change in industrial design {{that focused on the}} aesthetics and performances. The Montreal trains are now among the oldest North American subway trains in service - the Canadian Vickers MR-63 dating back to the system's opening in 1966 - but extended longevity <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> rolling stock operated under fully sheltered conditions.|$|E

25|$|The {{focus on}} {{outcomes}} creates a clear expectation of {{what needs to}} be accomplished {{by the end of the}} course. Students will understand what <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> them and teachers will know what they need to teach during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of {{what needs to be}} accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress. Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the serious}} {{consequences}} that plagiarism has for students, {{there has been}} a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism. This is especially important when students move to a new institution that may have a different view of the concept when compared with the view previously developed by the student. Indeed, given the seriousness of plagiarism accusations for a student's future, the pedagogy of plagiarism education may need to be considered ahead of the pedagogy of the discipline being studied. The need for plagiarism education extends to academic staff, who may not completely understand what <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> their students or the consequences of misconduct.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Cashdan {{proposed}} that mate strategies among both genders differ {{depending on how}} much parental investment <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> the male, and provided research support for her hypotheses. When men expect to have to provide a high level of parental investment, they will attempt to attract women by emphasising their ability to invest. In addition, men who expect to invest {{will be more likely to}} highlight their chastity and fidelity than men who expect not to invest. Men with the expectation of low parental investment will flaunt their sexuality to women. The author argues the fact the research supports the idea that men expecting to invest emphasise their chastity and fidelity, which is a high cost strategy (because it lowers reproductive opportunities), suggests that that type of behaviour must be beneficial, or the behaviour would not have been selected.|$|E

25|$|The Army and the Navy are {{regionally}} organized, with central, national {{headquarters in}} Mexico City and subordinate, regional headquarters. Historically, this {{has proven to}} be effective, as the military's main deployments have been domestic. Troops are stationed throughout the country to serve as a continuing presence of authority and to allow for an immediate critical response. Dispersion by regional military zones has facilitated local recruitment of non-commissioned officers (Army sergeants, Navy petty officers) and enlisted men and women, allowing them to be stationed near family during their military service, an important cultural consideration. On the other hand, mobility <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> commissioned officers, moving from assignment to assignment and to the military center, in Mexico City, giving them much experience, and, historically, preventing any senior officer from remaining too long in one place and developing a personal power base through local allegiances, and so becoming too powerful as a warlord.|$|E
25|$|Formal dances {{are held}} twice {{annually}} at Trinity. The Saints Ball is held {{annually in the}} fall semester around November at St. Hilda's College, and the Conversat ball is held at Trinity College in the Winter semester. Traditionally, the Saint's Ball was hosted by Women of College in their residence, while Conversat was hosted by Men of College in theirs. While the residences have been desegregated since 2005, the tradition remains that the Women of College ask the men (or other women) to Saints, and the men ask the women (or other men) to Conversat. At Saints, the Women of College are responsible for buying their date's ticket and drinks for the night, and at Conversat, the same <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> the Men of College. When someone {{has been asked to}} either Saints or Conversat, it is considered in poor taste to refuse them without a prior engagement.|$|E
25|$|Yom Kippur is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} day of the Jewish year-cycle and fasting as a means of repentance <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> every Jewish man or woman above the age of bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah respectively. This is the only fast day mentioned in the Torah (Leviticus 23:26-32). It is so important to fast on this day, that only those who would be put in mortal danger by fasting are exempt, such as the ill or frail (endangering a life is against a core principle of Judaism). Those that do eat on this day are encouraged to eat as little as possible at a time and to avoid a full meal. For some, fasting on Yom Kippur {{is considered}} more important than the prayers of this holy day. If one fasts, even if one is at home in bed, one is considered as having participated in the full religious service.|$|E

25|$|The Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, is {{the highest}} {{authority}} in the Sikhism, {{it is seen as}} the 11th and eternal Guru. It serves as a guide to Sikhs on how to live positive lives, and details what behavior <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> all Sikhs. It is seemingly silent on the subject of homosexuality; however, married life is encouraged time and time again in Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Whenever marriage is mentioned, it is always in reference to a man and a woman. Some Sikhs believe that Guru Granth Sahib Ji is the complete guide to life, and if a marriage between two of the same sexes is not mentioned, it is therefore not right. The counterargument to this is that man and woman are only mentioned in this way to give light to the relationship of the soul and the soul force as being one. This denies gender and sex as an issue. Thus, Sikhism is more concerned with ones attainment of enlightenment rather than habitual desires such as sexuality. True love is attained through the Guru and no man speaks on behalf of the Guru as the Granth is open to interpretation and misrepresentation.|$|E

500|$|Response to MOBA's {{opening and}} {{continued}} success is, for some, evocative {{of the way}} art is treated in society. MOBA works {{have been described as}} [...] "unintentionally hilarious", similar to the atrocious films of Ed Wood. Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often laugh out loud at displays. In Gullible's Travels, Cash Peters [...] contrasted this behavior with what <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> patrons at galleries such as Southern California's Getty Museum; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the {{inspiration}} behind the remix, Hayden Thorpe from Wild Beasts group told The Guardian: [...] "The unlikeness of this match was perhaps what compelled {{us to take}} it on. Gaga in many ways {{is the epitome of}} what we are not. She is the butcher to our butter knife. The essential thrill is always to keep eluding what <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> us and what we expect of ourselves." [...] The last of the remix to be released was The Weeknd's take on [...] "Marry the Night" [...] which featured Illangelo, thus earning him a co-producer credit on it.|$|E
500|$|Praising its story, Pereira {{claimed that}} it is [...] "a more {{personal}} story than the other GOW games, but one that still features the series' signature trademarks", and {{also said that the}} sex mini-game is [...] "arguably the most over-the-top of the bunch". Nelson stated {{that it is}} [...] "a game that upholds the standard of quality in gameplay, storytelling and sheer wow factor of the series, while also– like [...] before it– blurring the lines between portable and console experiences with its amazing presentation." [...] Juba said that it [...] "doesn’t have any mind-blowing moments", but [...] "this isn’t an optional side-story; Ghost of Sparta is a must-play for God of War fans." [...] GameTrailers said it has a [...] "pretty cool story" [...] that will [...] "definitely feel familiar". Parkin, however, stated the [...] "game's primary problem...is in its in-built focus" [...] and that the series [...] "is principally concerned with endlessly upping the ante." [...] He also claimed that the developers have [...] " [...] away the sense of wonder" [...] that <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> a God of War game and stated [...] "the remaining components struggle to carry the experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Thunderball was {{generally}} well {{received by the}} critics; Francis Iles, writing in The Guardian wrote that it [...] "is a good, tough, straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines." [...] Referring to the negative publicity that surrounded Dr. No—in particular the article by Paul Johnson in the New Statesman entitled, [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism"—Iles was left [...] "wondering {{what all the fuss}} is about", noting that [...] "there is no more sadism nor sex than <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> the author of this kind of thriller". Peter Duval Smith, writing in Financial Times, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming's work against negative criticism, also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review: [...] "one should not make a cult of Fleming's novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing." [...] Duval Smith thought that Thunderball was [...] "an exciting story is skilfully told", with [...] "a romantic sub-plot... and the denouement involves great events" [...] He also considered it [...] "the best written since Diamonds Are Forever, four books back. It has pace and humour and style. The violence is not so unrelenting as usual: an improvement, I think." [...] He also expressed concern for the central character, saying [...] "I was glad to see him [...] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up. He was having bad hangovers on half-a-bottle of whisky a day, which I don't call a lot, unless he wasn't eating properly." ...|$|E
