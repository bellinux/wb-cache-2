40|$|By {{use of a}} {{selective}} galactose agar medium containing ethidium bromide, a population analysis of the deinduction kinetics of yeast galactose long-term adaptation mutants (gal 3) has been done. It was first determined that the gal 3 mutation is specific to the yeast galactose system and that induced cultures of gal 3 strains are capable of growth on galactose agar medium containing ethidium bromide, whereas noninduced cultures are not. Population analyses of induced gal 3 strains under going deinduction {{in the absence of}} galactose demonstrate that a minimum number of five <b>induction</b> <b>units</b> per cell are required for induction of the galactose system.

40|$|In the {{industrial}} work environment noise levels and exposition times are by law subject to rules and regulations. Additionally customer expectation {{with respect to}} the noise performance of consumer products creates high customer expectation concerning the noise performance of products used in industrial or publicly accessible installations or machines. With expectations increasing engineers are forced to face the phenomena that developed and optimized components create unwanted or unforeseen noise on a system level in an assembly. Converter fed geared <b>induction</b> motor <b>units</b> can be operated over a wide speed range. Unfavorable acoustic behavior may become apparent and prevent the application of a geared motor unit that was optimized to run with a fixed frequency power supply.

In this study, the impact of heat load arrangement and air distribution generated in a room by linear slot diffuser, radial multi-nozzle diffuser and radial swirl <b>induction</b> <b>unit</b> on the cooling power of radiant panels was compared. The impact on the thermal environment was also studied.
