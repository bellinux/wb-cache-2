50|$|Edgwarebury Brook SINC {{goes through}} private land, {{but it can}} be viewed near its source next to Edgwarebury Lane. There is {{extensive}} <b>floating</b> <b>sweet-grass,</b> with clumps of brooklime and water-pepper. Old oak trees are thought to be relics of ancient field boundaries.|$|E
50|$|Glyceria fluitans (syns Festuca fluitans, Poa fluitans, Panicularia fluitans), {{known as}} <b>Floating</b> <b>Sweet-grass</b> and water mannagrass, is {{a species of}} {{perennial}} grass in the genus Glyceria native to Europe, the Mediterranean region and Western Asia and occurring in wet areas such as ditches, riverbanks and ponds.|$|E
50|$|Marsh {{varieties}} of plants include marsh pennywort, lesser spearwort, marsh speedwell, common marsh-bedstraw, <b>floating</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> and {{various types of}} sedge. Where there are drier areas {{at the edge of}} the water, purple moor-grass, common bent, tufted hair-grass and various rushes flourish. Uncommon bog asphodel is present and is recorded as an increasing population.|$|E
50|$|This marsh has {{a variety}} of habitats, {{including}} a scarce quaking bog. Many species are now uncommon due to changes in agricultural practices. it has several springs, with <b>floating</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> and brooklime and areas dominated by rushes. Species in drier areas include field woodrush, and there are also mature hedges and pollarded willows.|$|E
50|$|Wetter {{areas of}} the site are {{dominated}} by soft rush Juncus effusus, and stable wet areas exhibit Sphagnum moss. Other areas have sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus and herbs such as water mint Mentha aquatica and sneezewort Achillea ptarmica. The bulrush Typha latifolia, <b>floating</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> Glyceria fluitans and common spike-rush Eleocharis palustris are also found.|$|E
5000|$|The pools on {{the reserve}} are {{surrounded}} by reedmace, sea club-rush, grey club-rush, soft rush and hard rush. Areas of damp grassland contain marsh foxtail, <b>floating</b> <b>sweet-grass,</b> creeping bent and soft rush. Wild flowers include marsh marigold and fleabane. Whilst wild orchids such as southern marsh orchid {{can be found in}} abundance, bee orchids are also present ...|$|E
40|$|Over much of Britain, 1995 and 1996 {{have been}} {{perceived}} as drought years. To evaluate {{the impact that}} local climatic conditions are having upon successional changes in higher vegetation (macrophytes), Speakmans Pond in Epping Forest was surveyed and mapped in 1996. The results are related to previous vegetation surveys carried out in 1989 and 1991. In 1989 the dominant marginal vegetation was <b>floating</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> Glyceria fluitans, which also covered {{a major part of}} the main body of the pond. Other abundant species included soft rush Juncus effusus, reed mace Typha latifolia and yellow flag Iris pseudocorus. A small (central) area of open water contained bladderwort Utricularia vulgaris and white water-lily Nymphaea alba. A similar plant coverage was found in 1991, with a dominance of <b>floating</b> <b>sweet-grass</b> along the shallow eastern edge. A marked change in the pond was found during the 1996 survey of vegetation in July, when the pool was dry. The major plant cover now consisted of creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, with isolated clumps of Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus around the edges; both are terrestrial grasses found on land surrounding the pond. Rushes (Juncus) had increased their distribution round the margins of the pond, and the patch of yellow flag noted in 1989 and 1991 was not found in 1996. The deeper trenches were also dry, but a small patch of white water-lily remained adjacent to one of the trenches...|$|E
