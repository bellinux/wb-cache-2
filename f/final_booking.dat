5000|$|North Queensland lost 16-12 {{against the}} Brisbane Broncos in week 1 of the finals series before {{putting in the}} most {{clinical}} display from a single club all year in the next weeks semi-final against Cronulla in which North Queensland won 39-0, booking their first preliminary final since 2007. The Cowboys beat the Melbourne Storm 32-12 in the Preliminary <b>Final</b> <b>booking</b> {{their place in the}} 2015 NRL Grand Final against the Brisbane Broncos, their first since Grand Final in a decade, since 2005 where they finished runners-up. The Cowboys claimed their maiden premiership with a 17-16 win over the Brisbane Broncos. This made Green the first coach in history to defeat the Brisbane Broncos in a Grand Final, a team whom had a perfect record going into the game with 6 wins from 6 attempts.|$|E
5000|$|Rolling {{began his}} career as an attacking player at RC Strasbourg, making his debut in a game against Sporting Club Toulon on October 15, 1988. However Rolling did not manage to carve out a regular first team place and so dropped down a {{division}} in 1992 to join Pau FC. He moved to Scotland with Ayr United F.C. in 1994 and was spotted there by Leicester City F.C. who brought him to England the following year for a fee of £100,000. Rolling found it hard to get a spot in the Foxes first team, particularly after their promotion to the Premier League. He departed Filbert Street in 1997 to join A.F.C. Bournemouth and made something of a name for himself at the club by scoring two goals in the two-leg Associate Members' Cup Southern <b>Final,</b> <b>booking</b> the club a place at the Wembley showpiece. [...] He was an unused substitute for the final (1-2 defeat vs. Grimsby), after which his relationship with the manager had irretrievably broken down.|$|E
40|$|This {{report shows}} the {{application}} of Regression Analysis in reservations forecasting in airline yield management. The first three chapters highlight the need for yield management and the automation of seat inventory control. The seat inventory control problem {{is related to the}} determination of an optimal allocation of seats among the various fare classes being offered in a flight so as to maximize revenues. In order to determine such optimal seat allocation, forecasts of <b>final</b> <b>bookings</b> need to be made. Forecasting alternatives are presented in this report. An example of application of Time Series Analysis is given as an alternative in providing such forecasts. Results obtained via Time Series Analysis were not encouraging enough in providing acceptable estimates. Regression Analysis is also presented as a forecasting tool. Although regression models were developed for each market, a generalized model structure was thought to be preferable in view of the reduction of modeling efforts, data handling and model specification, that are needed for forecasting <b>final</b> <b>bookings</b> for all markets/flights/classes. A general structure model is presented in this thesis {{as the result of the}} search for structural behavior across markets and flights. Regression Analysis results are presented for a set of five citypairs, one flight in each directional market, i. e. ten flights in total. These results evidenced that a general structure model via regression analysis can indeed be used in the forecasting module of an automated seat inventory control system, and thus provide better estimates of <b>final</b> <b>bookings</b> when compared to Time Series Analysis or historical averages.

500|$|A new Hamburg music venue, the Star-Club, {{opened on}} 13 April 1962, with The Beatles booked {{for the first}} seven weeks. The Beatles {{returned}} to Hamburg in November and December 1962 for their fourth and fifth engagements there, which had been booked for the Star-Club many months in advance. Unlike their previous three trips to Hamburg, their drummer was Starr, having replaced Best in August. The Beatles were reluctant to return for their <b>final</b> two-week <b>booking,</b> which started 18 December, as they were gaining popularity in Britain and had just achieved their first charted single with [...] "Love Me Do".|$|R
40|$|For railway companies, the {{benefits}} from revenue management activities, like inventory control, dynamic pricing, and so forth, rely heavily on {{the accuracy of the}} short-term forecasting of the passenger flow. In this paper, based on the analysis of the relevance between <b>final</b> <b>booking</b> amounts and shapes of the booking curves, a novel short-term forecasting approach, which employs a specifically designed clustering algorithm and the data of both historical booking records and the bookings on hand, is proposed. The empirical study with real data sets from Chinese railway shows that the proposed approach outperforms the advanced pickup model (one of the most popular models in practice) during the early and middle stages of booking horizon when bookings are not concentrated in the final days before departure...|$|E
50|$|The booking {{offices of}} the Orpheum were {{constantly}} busy. The halls and elevators would be crowded all day with Vaudeville performers seeking audiences with booking powers. In other rooms booking agents tried to sell the acts they represented. Bookers would meet to arrange fast paced playbills trying to bring the acts together creating a harmonious show. Successful programs delivered diversity and Orpheum managers avoided similar types of acts on the same playbill. The entire show was packaged to achieve maximum efficiency and momentum {{from the top of}} the show to the <b>final</b> curtain. <b>Booking</b> agents tried to engage an act at a theater only once a season.|$|R
5000|$|BBC {{commentator}} John Motson stated it was [...] "the finest Cup Final I've had {{the pleasure}} of commentating on". It was a clean, good-willed yet well-contested <b>final,</b> with no <b>bookings</b> and high-quality football being produced by both sides. Both teams exercised quick, neat passing ability interspersed with exciting wing play and it was generally considered a good advertisement for English football. In marked contrast to the modern game, all but one of Coventry's players were English, the exception being Welsh international David Phillips, while eight of the Spurs starting eleven were also English.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 April, Ramires took a {{pass from}} Frank Lampard and setup Didier Drogba's extra time goal in Chelsea's {{shocking}} 1-0 victory over FC Barcelona {{in the first}} leg of the Champions League semi-finals at Stamford Bridge. Ramires, already booked during the first leg, received a yellow card in the second leg at Camp Nou, which would rule him out of the final. In a performance compared to Roy Keane (who scored to inspire his team to a comeback victory in the 1999 champions league semi-finals despite already being suspended for the <b>final</b> with accumulated <b>bookings),</b> Ramires scored a fantastic lobbed shot over Víctor Valdés to help send Chelsea through to the final as his goal leveled the aggregate score at 2-2 while putting Chelsea ahead on away goals. Assisted by Frank Lampard, this goal later was later chosen as Chelsea's [...] "Goal of the Season." [...] Chelsea teammate Fernando Torres added another goal in stoppage time to give Chelsea a 3-2 victory on aggregate and spot in the final with Bayern Munich in the final on 19 May. Unfortunately, {{he was not able to}} play in the final as he had accumulated yellow cards in the competition. Nevertheless, Chelsea emerged victorious against the Bavarians, winning 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 finish.|$|R

Ciampa and Gargano lost the championships to The Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar) at NXT TakeOver: San Antonio. They would get their rematch at NXT TakeOver: Orlando in a triple threat elimination match also involving The Revival, but were unsuccessful after being the first team eliminated. They then received another shot at NXT TakeOver: Chicago in a ladder match against The Authors of Pain in an unsucceful attempt.After the match, Ciampa attacked Gargano, turning into a villain and disbanding #DIY. It was later revealed that Ciampa had ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee and would await surgery in Birmingham, Alabama. In a further update, it was reported that his surgery was successful, and the timetable for his return has been estimated for March 2018.|$|R
