Recalling the album in later years, Waters said: [...] "Ummagumma – what a disaster!", while in 1995, Gilmour described the album as [...] "horrible". In a 1984 interview, Mason said: [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> and interesting little exercise, the whole business of everyone doing a bit. But I still feel really that that's quite {{a good example of}} the sum being greater than the parts..." [...] Later, he described it as [...] "a failed experiment", adding that [...] "the most significant thing is that we didn't do it again".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{was less}} enthusiastic; {{he felt that}} the script could have been better and said that the film [...] "feels like it's going to be terrific", but Tarantino's script does not have much curiosity about the characters. He also said that Tarantino [...] "has an idea, and trusts the idea to drive the plot." [...] Ebert gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four and said that while he enjoyed it and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> film from a talented director, [...] "I liked what I saw, but I wanted more." [...] Ebert's biggest praise was the acting in the film.|$|E

The series is intended to focus on a group of characters at Crystal Lake, who {{have to deal with the}} return of Jason Voorhees, as well as discover new information about him and his family. On August 2015, it {{was announced}} that the series was being developed by The CW. Steve Mitchell and Craig Van Sickle were hired to write the pilot, while Sean S. Cunningham, Randall Emmett, George Furla and Mark Canton would be the executive producers. On August 2016, the network announced that decided to not move forward with the series. The CW president Mark Pedowitz explained, “We had better pilots. The bottom line is we felt we had stronger things to go with, and we didn’t go forward with it. It was well-written, it was darker than we wanted it to be, and we didn’t believe it had sustainability... We didn’t believe that it was a sustainable script, a sustainable series. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> pilot, but not a sustainable series." ...|$|E

[...] When he brought in the script for series co-creators Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor to review, {{he was told that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> script. [...] However, Piller said that [...] "I don't think the teaser works at all." [...] Biller {{received}} so many notes on the script that he began to feel as though the experience were an audition. [...] After rewriting the script, Taylor expressed his pleasure with Biller's technical descriptions within the script and asked if Biller had a science background; ironically, Biller had instead attended Brown University specifically to avoid taking science courses—the technical details were all made up. The day after presenting the rewrite, Taylor asked Biller to join the Voyager writing staff. [...] Biller had been unaware of the vacancy, having come on board for the $15,000 fee and expecting nothing more. [...] Though initially reluctant, Biller took Taylor's offer for the [...] "opportunity to write television that was about something." [...] Taylor and Biller conceded that it was UPN's holding back of the episode until the second season that resulted in Ensign Wildman's strange gestation period of seven or eight months.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, The Illustrated Weekly of India {{described}} Miss Malini as [...] "the best film" [...] of its period. In 1994, film historian S. Theodore Baskaran, who saw {{the film}} as a child, recalled, [...] "My memory is that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> film, {{one of the rare}} humorous films in Tamil." [...] Documentary filmmaker and writer S. Krishnaswamy remembered it as a successful venture which was a [...] "cut above the rest" [...] in terms of content, handling and the sophistication of its humour. Reviewing the film in 2008, Guy termed it as [...] "one of the finest social satires to have been made in South Indian cinema" [...] and noted that it [...] "did not receive the appreciation it so richly deserved" [...] because it was ahead of its time. He described Subbu's performance as [...] "one of the finest portrayals of suave villainy ever seen in South Indian cinema" [...] and concluded the film would be [...] "remembered for its music, Gemini Ganesan's debut and as a film that appealed to the intellectuals in South India". Guy also praised Gopalakrishnan's performance, Sundari Bai's brand of humour, and opined that Seetharaman made an [...] "impressive debut" [...] with Miss Malini. In 2009, he called Miss Malini [...] "the best" [...] of the films Subbu wrote and directed for Gemini.|$|E

Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E

I went over to work on the script with Huston. He wasn't very well, I ended up with sole screen credit, but {{one of the problems is}} the screen credit is misleading very often.

He'd written a book I Am Not Spock, and that gave people the idea. Anyway, when a fringe group of Trekkies learned that we were going to kill the Spock character, it was like we'd taken a child of theirs onto the Brooklyn Bridge with the intention of throwing it off.

Year 2011 is certainly a bad year for dictators. We pray that God also calls to heaven the few remaining ones". The larger faction of the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai stated that “Kim Jong- il killed our loved ones and now it is his time to meet his victims in the presence of God”, and a spokesperson for the larger faction added “his party won’t shed a tear for the North Korean dictator and he should rot in hell”.|$|E
