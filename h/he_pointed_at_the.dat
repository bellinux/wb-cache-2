6000|$|The other turned, {{and without}} seeking {{aid from the}} gun which rested against his shoulder, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> several objects he named, and answered-- ...|$|E
60|$|The fat, red, bald {{little man}} peered round with keen eyes. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside, and {{disclosed}} the boy.|$|E
50|$|In the uncensored {{version of}} the music video, the fat man in {{underwear}} wears a ball gag; in the censored version, he does not. The edited version also does not show Eminem raising his middle fingers; instead, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera.|$|R
5000|$|As many of Bradbury's stories, [...] "Marionettes, Inc." [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a warning to society. Bradbury comments on the rise of technology as a way to solve marital conflicts. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> probable dangers of dehumanized, machine-driven world where artificial intelligence, AI, slowly substitutes for man and eliminates its makers.|$|R

6000|$|... "This infernal thing's a serial," [...] he gasped, as <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> words, [...] "To be continued," [...] "and that's {{all there}} is in this number." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wanchee look see, all same look see can do," [...] said Jukes, who {{having no}} talent for foreign {{languages}} mangled the very pidgin-English cruelly. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> open hatch. [...] "Catchee number one piecie {{place to sleep}} in. Eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{found himself}} in front of a {{formidable}} young lady in black, and unprepared with any formula. He had never bought flowers before. He looked about him for an inspiration. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> roses. [...] "I want those roses," [...] he said....|$|E
50|$|While doing {{handicraft}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> daycare centre, Ludo sews {{a stuffed}} rabbit without ears. As Anna criticises him for it, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fact that another rabbit {{made by the}} child Cheyenne-Blue has no ears as well. Anna thereupon claims {{that it is a}} Keinohrhase, a no-ears rabbit, which is able to hear through its nose. This scene was also used for the first teaser trailer.|$|R
60|$|Bailey shied like {{a startled}} horse <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hated phrase. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> furiously <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{photograph}} of the great thinker.|$|R
6000|$|... "I want a {{house like}} Mr. Dwyer's," [...] <b>he</b> declared, <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> distant {{imposing}} roof line against the fading eastern sky.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{table and}} Sir Walter {{caught his breath}} {{with a sort of}} curse at his own blindness. For the candle in the {{candlestick}} had obviously burned itself away to nothing and left him, mentally, at least, very completely in the dark.|$|E
6000|$|... "The sauce!" [...] said Mr Apjohn, in a {{voice that}} would have melted a hermit; and as he looked at Mr Fothergill, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> now distant sinner, who was {{dispensing}} his melted ambrosia at least ten heads upwards, away from the unfortunate supplicant.|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll {{be through}} in a minute. Sniff! She smells good to-night. Dad ships {{a good cook}} ef he do suffer with his brother. It's a full catch today, ain't it?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pens piled high with cod. [...] "What water did ye hev, Manuel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is the man, constable," [...] <b>he</b> shouted, <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{battered}} lieutenant. [...] "He is {{a suspicious}} character. He did the murder." ...|$|R
40|$|Charles Taylor {{has made}} a {{remarkable}} attempt to recover the moral ideal of authenticity {{as opposed to the}} debased form of authenticity, that leads to individualism. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dialogical nature of authenticity, and finally, in another work, justifies the need for recognition. I want to show that the middle part of this chain of argument, dialogicality, if properly understood, cannot lead us to recognition in the sense Taylor ascribes to the latter...|$|R
50|$|The book {{is written}} in an artistic language. It is a poetical vision, and Comenius doesn't just criticize society, he also tries to capture the {{progress}} of Man in general (and show the dualism of material and spiritual ways of life). <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> vanity of human endeavour {{that focuses on the}} material world and tells the reader that one must follow the will of God, as it is revealed in the Bible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing whatever, Mr. Hopper," [...] he said. [...] "This {{is the way}} out." [...] <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door. Stephen, who was {{watching}} him, could not tell whether it were a grim smile that creased {{the corners of the}} Colonel's mouth as he added. [...] "You might prefer the window." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Professor {{looked over}} my {{shoulder}} at this point. [...] "Bosh!" [...] said he. [...] "They will become just a supplementary China--another field for Chinese cheap labour. When the Dutch Settlements were returned in 1815,--all these islands hereabouts, you know,--we should have handed over these places as well. Look!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> swarming Chinamen below.|$|E
6000|$|... "On the whole--yes," [...] said Hirst. [...] "I like observing people. I {{like looking}} at things. This country is amazingly beautiful. Did you notice how {{the top of the}} {{mountain}} turned yellow to-night? Really we must take our lunch and spend the day out. You're getting disgustingly fat." [...] <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> calf of Hewet's bare leg.|$|E
50|$|In Beit Keshet, On {{the nearby}} hill under the Carob tree, Ami shows Margalit the {{surrounding}} view. Mount Tavor, {{the mountains of}} Gil'ad and Mount Hermon. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> houses of the local Bedouin tribe and tells her that their leader, Sheikh Abu-Nimer, {{is a friend of}} his father and always declares that he is Ami's brother. Under that tree, Ami asks Margalit to marry him. The wedding date is set for Purim.|$|R
6000|$|MARCHBANKS (earnestly). I {{assure you}} I didn't touch the keys. I didn't, indeed. I only turned a little wheel. (<b>He</b> <b>points</b> irresolutely <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tension wheel.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> portrait. [...] "I {{did that}} myself, Reggie. It was away being cleaned {{when you were}} here last. It's like dear Amelia, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your evil doing has not prospered over much, Piet Van Vooren," [...] called Ralph, [...] "and {{presently}} {{when you}} are dead you will taste the fruits of it. Suzanne shall be mine till the end as she was mine from the beginning, but look upon the Death-wife that your wickedness has won," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> body with his spear.|$|E
6000|$|... "All white boy's for fox! White boy count--fifty dollar! White boy buy much things. Have good time." [...] He smiled meaningly. [...] "Indian take fox {{and leave}} much money. White boy hide um--so." [...] He thrust a {{hand into his}} shirt. [...] "Nobody know. Indian go way--far." [...] He swept a hand toward the mountains. Then <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bills at his feet. [...] "Much money. Very much money. White boy count." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yump," [...] said Father. He still smiled strangely. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{table between}} the twin beds. On {{the table was}} a little brown, dusty book. Mother gazed at it dazedly. Her step was feeble as she tottered between the beds, picked up the book, opened it. It was the New Testament which she had had since girlhood, which she had carried all through their hike, which she {{supposed}} to be in their rooms back at the Star Hotel.|$|E
60|$|The mate {{walked to}} the rails and shouted to his boat-boys, while, when the gig slid away, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{drooping}} flags {{as he turned to}} Austin.|$|R
6000|$|A boy {{accompanied}} the newcomers. [...] "There he is!" [...] <b>he</b> screamed, <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Oskaloosa Kid. [...] "There he is! And you've got Miss Prim, too, and when do I get the reward?" ...|$|R
40|$|The monographical {{method and}} the monographs on {{different}} social groups may be, contrary to some opinions, very useful for collecting factographical materials and their subsequent analysis. The author advocates preparing possibly complex monographs on industrial enterprises since such monographs are indispensable to formulate {{the theory of}} an industrial enterprise. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> existing approach to the sociological monographs on the factory crew and he suggests a scheme of issues useful for the research on the social function of an industrial enterprise.

6000|$|... "O liar! O damned, audacious liar," [...] roared Garnache uncompromisingly, {{advancing}} a step {{upon the}} Seneschal, and shaking the parchment threateningly in his very face, {{as though it}} were become a weapon of offence. [...] "Was it {{to hide the fact that}} she had not been taught to write that she sent the Queen a letter pages-long? Who is this woman?" [...] And the finger <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl quivered with the rage that filled him at this trick they had thought to put upon him.|$|E
6000|$|After we had {{finished}} our second tour round the drum, {{with the utmost}} solemnity, one of the monks approached Hilda, whom he seemed to take now for an important priestess. He said something to her in Tibetan, which, of course, we did not understand; but, as <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time to the brother on the floor who was turning the wheel, Hilda nodded acquiescence. [...] "If you wish it," [...] she said in English--and he appeared to comprehend. [...] "He wants to know whether I {{would like to take}} a turn at the cylinder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be quiet now," [...] cautioned the ape-man. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{entrance}} to {{what appeared to}} be a cave at the far end of the gulch. [...] "There is a hungry lion in there. If you can reach that tree before he discovers you, you will have several days longer in which to enjoy life and then--when you are too weak to cling longer to the branches of the tree Numa, the man-eater, will feed again for the last time." [...] He pushed Schneider from his foothold to the ground below. [...] "Now run," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|This {{touched the}} captain's heart, and he tossed a dollar towards the Indian, who {{suffered}} it, however, to lie {{at his feet}} unnoticed. Turning to <b>the</b> stockade, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> significantly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> open gateways.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> cleared 8000 <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2013 Decastar meeting, taking {{third place}} {{with a total of}} 8018.|$|R
5000|$|The fourth wall {{is broken}} once more as Judge Marshall talks Joboy and Philip out {{of letting the}} {{syndicate}} go down with the barge. There are [...] "witnesses", <b>he</b> says, <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> reader, much to the duo's disappointment.|$|R
