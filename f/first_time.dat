For the zero drift case, using fractional calculus an explicit analytic {{solution for the}} <b>first</b> passage <b>time</b> densityfunction in terms of Fox or H-functions is given. The asymptotic behaviour of the densityfunction is discussed. For the nonzero drift case, we obtain an expression for the Laplace transform of the <b>first</b> passage <b>time</b> densityfunction, from which the mean <b>first</b> passage <b>time</b> and variance are derived. ...|$|R

To check on accuracy of this approximation, the analytical results for {{the mean of the}} <b>first</b> overflow <b>time</b> in the GI/G/m system with finite capacity is numerically compared with the diffusion approximation results. Numerical results show that the diffusion approximation is a good approximation for heavy traffic systems...|$|R
