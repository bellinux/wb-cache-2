50|$|With {{advances}} in electrical locking of the lever frame within the signal box, the tablet instrument also <b>electrically</b> <b>locked</b> the section signal lever. This was {{marked with a}} white stripe on the red background.|$|E
50|$|Some {{alarm systems}} serve a single purpose of {{burglary}} protection; combination systems provide both fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion alarm systems {{may also be}} combined with closed-circuit television surveillance (CCTV) systems to automatically record the activities of intruders, and may interface to access control systems for <b>electrically</b> <b>locked</b> doors. Systems range from small, self-contained noisemakers, to complicated, multiarea systems with computer monitoring and control. It may even include two-way voice which allows communication between the panel and Monitoring station.|$|E
50|$|Assuming {{that the}} signal lever had frozen (when {{in fact it}} was <b>electrically</b> <b>locked</b> by the {{stationary}} train), he authorised the driver to pass the signal at danger, and the train set off into the still-falling snow. Glancing again at his diagram, he saw that the lights towards Beaconsfield were not in fact lit, and realised that the empty train was still in the section near Seer Green. He quickly went to the window and tried to attract the driver's attention by shouting, but nobody heard him.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} position-sensorless {{control of}} an interior permanent magnet synchronous (IPM) motor, which {{is characterized by}} real-time position estimation based on magnetic saliency. The real-time estimation algorithm detects motor current harmonics and determines the inductance matrix, including rotor position information. An experimental system consisting of an IPM motor and a voltage-source pulsewidth modulation inverter has been implemented and tested to confirm the effectiveness and versatility of the approach. Some experimental {{results show that the}} experimental system has the function of <b>electrically</b> <b>locking</b> the loaded motor, along with a position response of 20 rad/s and a settling time of 300 ms</p...|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the canal and lock was completed in 1895. At {{that time it was}} the largest <b>lock</b> and first <b>electrically</b> operated <b>lock</b> in the world. The canal is about 1.6 km long and originally the lock portion was 274 m long and 18 m wide.|$|R
50|$|The Trendline grade {{has over}} the base version <b>electrically</b> {{operated}} door <b>locking,</b> electric windows and wing mirror adjustment {{as well as}} a radio with a CD player, climate control (Climatic), multi-functional display, cruise control, front fog lights, 17-inch aluminium wheels.Also painted in the body colour are the front bumper, door handles and wing mirrors.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1992, the Barge Canal is {{no longer}} known by that name. Individual canals in the New York State Canal System, {{formerly}} collectively known as [...] "the Barge Canal," [...] are now referred to by their original names (Erie Canal, Oswego Canal, Cayuga-Seneca Canal, and Champlain Canal). Today, the system's canals are 12 ft deep and 120 ft wide, with 57 <b>electrically</b> operated <b>locks,</b> and can accommodate vessels up to 2,000 tons (1,800 metric tons). The canal system is open for navigation generally from May 1 through November 15. Payment of a fee for a permit is required to transverse the locks and lift bridges with motorized craft.|$|R
5000|$|... 1959: 1488 cc, {{on request}} 1680 cc, [...] Also {{available}} as four-door saloon. Several refinements including padded dashboard, ignition <b>lock,</b> <b>electrically</b> driven windscreen wipers. The new base model [...] "Opel 1200" [...] replaced the former Olympia (1196 cc, , DM 5,835); the 1200 remained in production until December 1962, while the P I was superseded in August 1960 by the Rekord P II.|$|R
25|$|The ring is 74 {{miles and}} {{includes}} 105 <b>locks</b> including 3 <b>electrically</b> operated river <b>locks,</b> 2 pairs of staircase locks and 2 broad locks. The route includes flights of locks at Tardebigge (x30), Stourbridge (x16) and the Black Delph at Brierley Hill (x8). The route also includes {{two of the}} longest navigable tunnels on the UK network, these being the Netherton and Wast Hills Tunnels.|$|R
50|$|With the {{internal}} combustion engine and transaxle mounted very low in the back, the T3 had much larger disc brakes in the front, and drums in the rear. Axle weight is very nearly equal upon both the front and back ends of the vehicle. Unlike the T2 before it, the T3 was available with amenities such as power steering, air conditioning, power door <b>locks,</b> <b>electrically</b> controlled and heated mirrors, lighted vanity mirrors, and a light above the glove box (most of which were essentially standard equipment in later models).|$|R
40|$|We explore three coupled networks. Each is {{an example}} of a network whose {{spatially}} coupled behavior is dratically different than the behavior of the uncoupled system. 1. An evolution equation such that the intrinsic dynamics of the system are those near a degenerate Hopf bifurcation is explored. The coupled system is bistable and solutions such as waves and persistent localized activity are found. 2. A trapping mechanism that causes long interspike intervals in a network of Hodgkin Huxley neurons coupled with excitatory synaptic coupling is unveiled. This trapping mechanism is formed through the interaction of the time scales present intrinsically and the time scale of the synaptic decay. 3. We construct a model to create the spatial patterns reported by subjects in an experiment when their eyes were stimulated <b>electrically.</b> Phase <b>locked</b> oscillators are used to create boundaries representing phosphenes. Asymmetric coupling causes the lines to move, as in the experiment. Stable stationary solutions and waves are found in a reduced model of evolution/ convolution type...|$|R
5000|$|There are no {{reasonable}} {{means by}} which the door locking and latching mechanisms could open mechanically in flight from a properly closed and locked position. If the lock sectors were in proper condition, and were properly situated over the closed latch cams, the lock sectors had sufficient strength to prevent the cams from vibrating to the open position during ground operation and flight. However, there are two possible {{means by which}} the cargo door could open while in flight. Either, the latching mechanisms were forced open <b>electrically</b> through the <b>lock</b> sectors after the door was secured, or the door was not properly latched and locked before departure. Then the door opened when the pressurization loads reached a point that the latches could not hold.|$|R
40|$|Topological {{insulators}} {{provide a}} new platform for spintronics {{due to the}} spin texture of the surface states that are topologically robust against elastic backscattering. Here we report on {{an investigation of the}} measured voltage obtained from efforts to <b>electrically</b> probe spin-momentum <b>locking</b> in the topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 using ferromagnetic contacts. Upon inverting the magnetization of the ferromagnetic contacts, we find a reversal of the measured voltage. Extensive analysis of the bias and temperature dependence of this voltage was done, considering the orientation of the magnetization relative to the current. Our findings indicate that the measured voltage can arise due to fringe-field-induced Hall voltages, different from current-induced spin polarization of the surface state charge carriers, as reported recently. Understanding the nontrivial origin of the measured voltage is important for realizing spintronic devices with topological insulators...|$|R
50|$|There {{were three}} signals spaced at {{three-quarters of a}} mile, {{a quarter of a}} mile, and 500 ft from the draw bridge, and an {{automatic}} derailing device fifty feet beyond the third signal. The bridge span had to be down and <b>locked</b> <b>electrically</b> before the signals and derail devices could be cleared for movement on the track. Conversely, all the devices had to be in their most restrictive positions before the bridge could be unlocked and raised. The train ran through two signals and was derailed automatically; the automatic derailer was designed to knock the wheels off the track so that the resistance of the ties and ballast against the train's wheels would bring a slow-moving derailed train to a stop. Train #3314, although derailed, was moving at such a great speed that it did not have sufficient distance to stop before diving off the bridge.|$|R
