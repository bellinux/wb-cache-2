5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> embolize {{vascular}} lesions through interventional radiology; {{this requires}} passing a catheter {{through a large}} artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> exploit RNA {{interference}} in therapy. Although {{it is difficult}} to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful. Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus. RNAi has also been shown to be effective in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models.|$|E
5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E
5|$|After Sibelius's {{death in}} 1957, {{news of the}} Eighth Symphony's {{destruction}} was made public, and {{it was assumed that}} the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since then, several short manuscript sketches have been tentatively identified with the Eighth, three of which (comprising less than three minutes of music) were recorded by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra in 2011. While a few musicologists have speculated that, if further fragments can be identified, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct the entire work, others have suggested that this is unlikely given the ambiguity of the extant material. The propriety of publicly performing music that Sibelius himself had rejected has also been questioned.|$|E

5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this Allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> ascertain whether or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{calculated}} that the isotope 295Ts would have a half-life of 18±7milliseconds and that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> produce this isotope via the same berkelium–calcium reaction used in the discoveries of the known isotopes, 293Ts and 294Ts. The chance of this reaction producing 295Ts is estimated to be, at most, one-seventh the chance of producing 294Ts. Calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several isotopes of tennessine up to 303Ts. The most stable of these {{is expected to be}} 296Ts with an alpha-decay half-life of 40milliseconds. A liquid drop model study on the element's isotopes shows similar results; it suggests a general trend of increasing stability for isotopes heavier than 301Ts, with partial half-lives exceeding {{the age of the universe}} for the heaviest isotopes like 335Ts when beta decay is not considered. Lighter isotopes of tennessine may be produced in the 243Am+50Ti reaction, which was considered as a contingency plan by the Dubna team in 2008 if 249Bk proved unavailable,Ca + 238U-249Cf |trans-title=Synthesis of new elements 113–118 in complete fusion reactions 48Ca + 238U–249Cf |last=Utyonkov |first=V.
