40|$|Abstract — Software <b>defects</b> have a {{major impact}} of {{software}} development life cycle. Software <b>defects</b> are expensive. Moreover, the cost of finding and correcting <b>defects</b> represents {{one of the most expensive}} software development activities. For the foreseeable future, it will not be possible to eliminate <b>defects.</b> While <b>defects</b> may be inevitable, we can minimize their number and impact on our projects. To do this development teams need to implement a <b>defect</b> management process that focuses on preventing <b>defects,</b> catching <b>defects</b> as early in the process as possible, and minimizing the impact of <b>defects.</b> The purpose of this paper is to develop guidance for software managers in the area of <b>defect</b> management and to introduce the <b>defect</b> management model. This <b>defect</b> management model is not intended to be a standard, but rather a starting point for the development of a customized <b>defect</b> management process within an organization.

40|$|In this article, {{localized}} <b>defect</b> modes in one-dimensional optically induced photonic lattices are studied comprehensively. First, {{the origin}} of these <b>defect</b> modes is investigated analytically in the weak-defect limit by perturbation methods. It is shown that in an attractive <b>defect</b> where the lattice light intensity at the <b>defect</b> site is {{higher than that of}} nearby sites, a <b>defect</b> mode bifurcates from the left edge of every Bloch band; while in a repulsive <b>defect,</b> a <b>defect</b> mode bifurcates from the right edge of every Bloch band. When the <b>defect</b> is not weak, <b>defect</b> modes are examined by numerical methods. It is shown that in a repulsive <b>defect,</b> the strongest confinement of <b>defect</b> modes arises when the lattice light intensity at the <b>defect</b> site is nonzero rather than zero. In addition, as the potential strength increases, <b>defect</b> modes disappear from lower bandgaps and appear in higher bandgaps. In an attractive <b>defect,</b> however, <b>defect</b> modes persist in every bandgap as the potential strength increases. Using a piecewise-constant potential model, <b>defect</b> modes are calculated analytically for a general <b>defect.</b> The analytical results qualitatively explain the main features in numerical results. 1...|$|R
