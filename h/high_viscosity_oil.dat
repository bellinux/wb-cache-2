He further defines petroleum {{as a form}} of bitumen that is gaseous or liquid in the reservoir and can be produced through a pipe. Other bitumens range from very viscous (e.g., Athabasca and Venezuelan heavy oils, La Brea tar pits) to solid (e.g. gilsonite, ozocerite, grahamite, impsonite). Pyrobitumen is formed by thermal decomposition and molecular cross-linking of bitumen. Pyrobitumen is distinguished from other solid bitumens extruded from early-mature kerogen-rich source rocks (e.g., gilsonite) and semi-solid bitumens in <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> <b>oil</b> sands formed by water washing and biodegradation of conventional oil (e.g., Athabasca bituminous sands), all of which are soluble in carbon disulfide.|$|E

30|$|Hydrate {{slurries}} generated without anti-agglomerant showed {{high shear}} thinning behavior and <b>higher</b> <b>viscosities</b> compared to systems with AAs. Also, shear thinning behavior increased with increasing hydrate volume fraction. Without AA hydrates agglomeration result in early onset of exponential viscosity increase and early deviation from Newtonian rheology. Use of AAs minimize agglomeration and dispersed slurries exhibit Newtonian rheology. Newtonian slurries display gradual increase in viscosity with increase in HVF. However, at high HVF AAs fail and agglomeration occurs. Slurries that experience severe agglomeration flow with a radial solid concentration gradient exhibit shear thinning rheology. This suggests that shear thinning (or non-Newtonian) behavior of hydrate slurries {{is associated with}} particle interaction, agglomeration and solid concentration gradient. When <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils</b> were used, the resulting slurries exhibited less shear thinning effects and less viscosity increase with increasing hydrate volume fraction.

However, the advent of <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> <b>oil</b> requires more investigations to enhance good design of transportation system and forestall its inherent production difficulties. Experimental and numerical studies were conducted on water-sand, oil-water and oilwater- sand respectively in 1 -in ID 5 m long horizontal pipe. The densities of CYL 680 and CYL 1000 oils employed are 917 and 916. 2 kg/m 3 while their viscosities are 1. 830 and 3. 149 Pa. s @ 25 oC respectively. The solid-phase concentration ranged from 2. 15 e- 04 to 10 %v/v with mean diameter of 150 micron and material density of 2650 kg/m 3. Experimentally, the observed flow patterns are Water Assist Annular (WA-ANN), Dispersed Oil in Water (DOW/OF), Oil Plug in Water (OPW/OF) with oil film on the wall and Water Plug in Oil (WPO).

Piston-cylinder friction is a major contributor compared to the other contributors like thrust bearing, piston pin and crank.

The main purpose of the heating is to mobilise the hydrocarbons by heat-induced temporary reduction of the viscosity or by a form of stripping to remove the lighter fractions. The same is true for oil sands, although this is usually carried out as a kind of surface mining operation with intensive treatment in site processing plants. Similar considerations apply to systems for oil shales where mining, crushing, ash-forming mineral removal, but most importantly the liberating heating (or “retorting”) process are applied.|$|R

In this case, the droplet basically bounces on the interface. We observe that the conditions for bouncing depends on the frequency, more precisely we observe resonance when the Eigenfrequency of the droplet is excited. Lord Rayleigh expressed the droplet deformation modes in terms of spherical harmonics Y_ℓ^m. We present different experimental modes of deformation with the corresponding spherical harmonic model with ℓ= 2, 3, 4 and 5.

In dry machining, wear mechanisms were caused by adhesion and micro-attrition at low combination of machining parameters. While at high combination of machining parameters, the cutting edge failed due to catastrophic failure such as micro-cracks. Wear mechanisms that occur when milling using cutting fluid were abrasion, adhesion and diffusion.

The grafted PU sponge also possessed high absorption capacity (23 times of the self weight), high oil retention (93 %), high mechanical strength and good recyclability (more than 400 times).

Soft and flexible butyl acrylate chain segments prompted poly (styrene-co-butyl acrylate) chains to entangle {{with each other in}} spinning solution.

Extrusion rate and applied voltage imposed a great impact on the relaxation of polymer chains through affecting strain rate and fiber formation duration. The fibrous membranes prepared at different extrusion rates or applied voltages showed different morphological structures.

Many works are found in literature for bearings running under grease lubrication. There is no much importance given for bearings with liquid lubricants.
