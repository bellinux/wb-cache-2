50|$|In telephony, a main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF or main frame) is {{a signal}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> for {{connecting}} equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate {{on the same}} MDF or on a separate trunk main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (TMDF).|$|R
40|$|Two micromechanical {{models were}} {{developed}} to investigate the thermal expansion of graphite/copper (Gr/Cu) composites. The models incorporate the effects of temperature-dependent material properties, matrix inelasticity, initial residual stresses due to processing history, and nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution.</b> The first model {{is based on the}} multiple concentric cylinder geometry, with each cylinder treated as a two-phase composite with a characteristic fiber volume fractions. By altering the fiber volume fraction of the individual cylinders, unidirectional composites with radially nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distributions</b> can be investigated using this model. The second model is based on the inelastic lamination theory. By varying the fiber content in the individual laminae, composites with nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> in the thickness direction can be investigated. In both models, the properties of the individual regions (cylinders or laminae) are calculated using the method of cells micromechanical model. Classical incremental plasticity theory is used to model the inelastic response of the copper matrix at the microlevel. The models were used to characterize the effects of nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> on the thermal expansion of Gr/Cu. These effects were compared to the effects of matrix plasticity, choice of stress-free temperature, and slight fiber misalignment. It was found that the radially nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> has little effect on the thermal expansion of Gr/Cu but could become significant for composites with large fiber-matrix transverse CTE and Young's modulus mismatch. The effect of nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> in the through-thickness direction of a laminate was more significant, but only approached that of the stress-free temperature for the most extreme cases that include large amounts of bending. Subsequent comparison with experimental thermal expansion data indicated the need for more accurate characterization of the graphite fiber thermomechanical properties. Correlation with cyclic data revealed the presence of a mechanism not considered in the developed models. The predicted response did, however, exhibit ratcheting behavior that has been observed experimentally in Gr/Cu. Finally, simulation of the actual <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> of particular specimens had little effect on the predicted thermal expansion...|$|R
40|$|Engineered {{cementitious}} composites (ECC) is {{a class of}} ultra ductile fiber reinforced {{cementitious composites}}, characterized by high ductility and tight crack width control. The polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber with a diameter of 39 lm and a length of 6 - 12 mm is often used. Unlike plain concrete and normal fiber reinforced concrete, ECC shows a strain-hardening behavior under tensile load. Apart from the mix design, the <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> is another crucial factor for the mechanical properties of ECC, especially the ductility. In order to obtain a good <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution,</b> the plastic viscosity of the ECC mortar before adding fibers needs to be controlled, for example, by adjusting water-to-powder ratio or chemical admixtures. However, such adjustments have some limitations and may result in poor mechanical properties of ECC. This research explores an innovative approach to improve the <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> by adjusting the mixing sequence. With the standard mixing sequence, fibers are added after all solid and liquid materials are mixed. The undesirable plastic viscosity before the fiber addition may cause poor <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> and results in poor hardened properties. With the adjusted mixing sequence, the mix of solid materials with the liquid material {{is divided into two}} steps and the addition of fibers is between the two steps. In this paper, the influence of different water mixing sequences is investigated by comparing the experimental results of the uniaxial tensile test and the <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> analysis. Compared with the standard mixing sequence, the adjusted mixing sequence increases the tensile strain capacity and ultimate tensile strength of ECC and improves the <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution.</b> This concept is further applied in the development of ECC with high volume of sand...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA pressure transducer with an outside diameter of 0. 190 " {{has been built}} and statically tested. The transducer used a glass fiber bundle 0. 109 " in diameter to transmit and receive reflected light from a pressure diaphragm. The amount of light returned to a photosensor was dependent upon the diaphragm shape and relative position from the optic fiber bundle. The response was linear over a pressure range which was dependent upon the diaphragm thickness. Several fiber optic probes with different <b>fiber</b> <b>distributions</b> were tested. The random <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> gave the greatest sensitivity. However, with suitable choice of gain selection, pressure range could be sacrificed for increased pressure resolution for any combination of <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> and diaphragm thickness. A theory was developed for a coaxial <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> with the source light transmitted by the inner circle of fibers and operating with reflection from a flat surface. The theory provided a response curve shape which compared with the measured response. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{incorporation}} of fibers on cement composites reduces its fragility, turning it a ductile material. The amount of <b>fibers</b> and its <b>distribution</b> presents a large {{influence on the}} composite performance, especially {{by the fact that}} it is self-consolidating, which facilitates the <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution.</b> 3 D microtomography is an efficient tool for determining the <b>fibers</b> <b>distribution,</b> generating images and creating a representation in three dimensions of the sample. Moreover, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can be used to analyze the interaction of fibers with the cement composite. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the application of these techniques to visualize the distribution and interaction of metallic and polypropylene fibers inserted into an advanced cementitious composite, at 3 % in volume content.
