40|$|To {{identify}} {{patients with}} severe chronic heart failure {{who are at}} greatest risk of developing <b>functional</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> during converting enzyme inhibition, creatinine clearance was measured in 59 patients before and after long-term therapy with Captopril (39 patients) or enalapril (20 patients), while digitalis and diuretic therapy was kept constant. Creatinine clearance increased or remained constant in 33 of the 59 patients (Group I), but declined in the remaining 26 patients (Group II). The two groups were similar {{with respect to the}} cause of heart failure, pretreatment renal function and all pretreatment hemodynamic variables. Patients in Group II, however, had lower values for serum sodium concentration (134. 8 ± 1. 0 versus 137. 0 ± 0. 6 mmol/liter) and higher values for plasma renin activity (10. 6 ± 3. 4 versus 3. 0 ± 0. 5 ng/ml per hour), received larger doses of furosemide (108 ± 11 versus 84 ± 6 mg/day), were more frequently diabetic (42 versus 15 %) and were more frequently treated with enalapril (50 versus 21 %) than were patients in Group I (all p 80 mg daily) showed a decrease in creatinine clearance only if they were also hyponatremic, but not if they had a normal pretreatment serum sodium concentration.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether moderate <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> was associated with total and cardiovascular mortality, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, in a community sample representative of the U.

First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I, 1974 – 1975) and NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS, 1992, 18 year follow-up) were evaluated. The primary analysis was limited to 2352 adults with complete data, and no baseline cardiovascular disease. A creatinine of 104 to 146 μmol/L in women, and 122 to 177 μmol/L in men (approximate glomerular filtration rate of 30 to 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) was defined as moderate <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Supplementary analyses included participants with marked renal impairment and baseline cardiovascular disease. ResultsThe unadjusted hazard ratio for moderate <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> compared to preserved renal function was significant for total mortality (hazard ratio 1. 7; 95 % confidence interval 1. 3 to 2. 2), and for cardiovascular mortality (2. 2; 1. 5 to 3. 1).

Methods: In this prospective, observational cohort study 48 patients undergoing repair or palliation of congenital heart disease in the first 6 months of life were studied intraoperatively and on postoperative day 1 and 2. The NIRS mean and nadir were recorded for the 3 time periods, as were urine output, fluid balance, and serum creatinine. <b>Renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> was defined as rise in creatinine 40 % from baseline or oliguria for> 4 hours.

40|$|Acute normocapnic {{hypoxemia}} {{can cause}} <b>functional</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> by increasing renal vascular resistance (RVR), leading to renal hypoperfusion and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) activity {{is low in}} fetuses and newborns and further decreases during hypoxia. IGF- 1 administration to humans and adult animals induces pre- and postglomerular vasodilation, thereby increasing GFR and renal blood flow (RBF). A potential protective effect of IGF- 1 on renal function was evaluated in newborn rabbits with hypoxemia-induced renal insufficiency. Renal function and hemodynamic parameters were assessed in 17 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated newborn rabbits. After hypoxemia stabilization, saline solution (time control) or IGF- 1 (1 mg/kg) was given as an intravenous (i. v.) bolus, and renal function was determined for six 30 -min periods. Normocapnic hypoxemia significantly increased RVR (+ 16 %), leading to decreased GFR (- 14 %), RBF (- 19 %) and diuresis (- 12 %), with an increased filtration fraction (FF). Saline solution resulted in a worsening of parameters affected by hypoxemia. Contrarily, although mean blood pressure decreased slightly but significantly, IGF- 1 prevented a further increase in RVR, with subsequent improvement of GFR, RBF and diuresis. FF indicated relative postglomerular vasodilation. Although hypoxemia-induced acute renal failure was not completely prevented, IGF- 1 elicited efferent vasodilation, thereby precluding a further decline in renal function...|$|E

Glomerulonephritis was worse in CD 11 b / chimeras compared with all others, whereas disease in FcRc / and wild-type chimeras was comparable. Disease tracked strongly with humoral immune responses, but not glomerular immune complex deposits. Interstitial inflammation with M 1 macrophages strongly correlated with glomerulonephritis scores.

The renal dendritic cell populations originating from bone marrow–derived CD 11 cþ cells were similar in all experimental groups. CD 11 bþ cells bearing colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor were present in kidneys, including CD 11 b / chimeras; these cells correlated negatively with glomerulonephritis scores.

The atherogenic risk for chronic <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> patients and dialysis treated patients was assessed by measuring total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, LDLcholesterol and calculating the ratio: TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C. The examined group consisted of 18 cronic <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> patients and 60 patients on hemodialysis. The results were compared to a control group of 85 voluntary blood donors. Serum lipid parameters were examined by standard methods. All lipid parameters in hemodialysis patients were statistically different compared to the control group (p< 0. 05) while chronic <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> patients showed significant difference only in triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol. Hypertriglyceridemia was present in both examined groups of patients and HDL-cholesterol was lower within both groups. All calculated atherogenic ratios were higher for patients than the control group. Lipid parameters were compared between chronic <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and hemodialysis patients but statistical significantly difference was obtained only for HDL-cholesterol (p< 0. 05). We conclude that increased values of triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol in chronic <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> patients contribute to high incidence of cardiovascular disease.

Design Single-centre observational study. Setting One tertiary cardiac centre. Patients All consecutive patients with STEMI planned for primary percutaneous coronary intervention in one Swedish county in 2005 (98 women and 176 men). Main outcome measures Logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the predictors of <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> associations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and outcome in each gender and a possible interaction between gender and eGFR regarding outcome. Results <b>Renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> was defined as eGFR less than 60 ml/min per 1. 73 m(2). 67 % of women had <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> compared with 26 % of men, OR 5. 06 (95 % CI 2. 66 to 9. 59) after multivariable adjustment. In women each 10 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 increment of eGFR was associated with a 63 % risk reduction for 1 -year mortality, OR 0. 37 (95 % CI 0. 15 to 0. 89). No such association was found in men, OR 1. 05 (95 % CI 0. 63 to 1. 76). A trend towards a significant interaction between gender and eGFR regarding 1 -year mortality was found, OR 2. 05 (95 % CI 0. 93 to 4. 50). Conclusions A considerable gender difference in the prevalence of <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in STEMI was found and <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> seemed to be a more important prognostic marker in women. These results are important as previous STEMI studies have shown higher multivariable adjusted mortality in women than in men but renal function has seldom been taken into consideration.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease risk}} status in elderly persons with <b>renal</b> <b>{{insufficiency}}.</b> BackgroundRenal insufficiency has been independently associated with incident cardiovascular disease events in some, but not all, prospective studies. We determined {{the prevalence of}} elevated cardiovascular disease risk status among elderly persons with <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> MethodsThis study is a cross-sectional analysis using data collected at the baseline visit of the Cardiovascular Health Study, which enrolled 5888 community dwelling adults aged 65 years or older from four clinical centers in the United States. <b>Renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{was defined as a}} serum creatinine level ≥ 1. 3 mg/dL in women and ≥ 1. 5 mg/dL in men. The outcomes of this study included prevalent cardiovascular disease [prior coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke], subclinical cardiovascular disease (abnormal values of ankle-arm index, carotid ultrasound, and echocardiography) and elevated cardiovascular risk based upon a diagnosis of diabetes and the Framingham equations. The association between <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and cardiovascular risk status was estimated with and without adjustment for other cardiovascular predictors. ResultsAmong the 5808 participants with creatinine levels measured at entry, 15. 9 % of men (N = 394), and 7. 6 % of women (N = 254) had <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> The prevalence of either clinical or subclinical cardiovascular disease was 64 % in persons with <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> compared with 43 % in those without it [odds ratio (OR) 2. 34; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 1. 96, 2. 80]. After adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors, <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> remained significantly associated with clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease (adjusted OR 1. 43; 95 % CI, 1. 18, 1. 75), but the magnitude of association was substantially reduced. After combining clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and an estimated risk> 20 % by the Framingham equations, 78 % of men and 61 % of women with <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> had elevated cardiovascular risk status.

40|$|The {{congenital}} form of {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} (TTP) {{is caused}} by genetic mutations in ADAMTS 13. Some, but not all, congenital TTP patients manifest <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in addition to microangiopathic hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. We included 32 congenital TTP patients in the present study, {{which was designed to}} assess whether congenital TTP patients with <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> have predisposing mutations in complement regulatory genes, as found in many patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). In 13 patients with severe <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> six candidate complement or complement regulatory genes were sequenced and 11 missense mutations were identified. One of these missense mutations, C 3 :p. K 155 Q mutation, is a rare mutation located in the macroglobulin-like 2 domain of C 3, where other mutations predisposing for aHUS cluster. Several of the common missense mutations identified in our study have been reported to increase disease-risk for aHUS, but were not more common in patients with as compared to those without <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Taken together, our results show {{that the majority of the}} congenital TTP patients with <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> studied do not carry rare genetic mutations in complement or complement regulatory genes...|$|R
