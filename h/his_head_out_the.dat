500|$|Sam is a laid-back but enthusiastic, brown-coated {{anthropomorphic}} [...] "canine shamus". He wears {{either a}} gray or blue {{suit with a}} matching fedora, to make people more cooperative when conversing with a six-foot talking dog. A warped sense of justice makes Sam the more passionate of the pair for their police work, only held back from taking his job seriously by Max. Nevertheless, he enjoys the mannerisms and dress that come with their line of work. Sam possesses near encyclopedic amounts of knowledge, particularly on obscure topics, and is prone to long-winded sentences filled with elaborate terminology. Although he is always keen to display this information—regardless of its accuracy—Sam can be capable of total ignorance towards more practical matters; for instance, despite his regard for his DeSoto Adventurer, he is severely negligent with the car's maintenance. Sam still retains various doglike qualities: he is excitable, enthusiastic but also susceptible to emotions of embarrassment and guilt. Nevertheless, Sam is [...] "not above sticking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> car window and letting his tongue flap in the breeze". Sam rarely loses his temper, {{and is able to}} react to panic-inducing situations with extreme calm. When he does get angry, Sam tends to react in a violent, uncharacteristically savage manner, in which case it is usually Max that calms him down and prevents him from acting upon his anger. Sam usually is armed with an oversized [...]44 revolver.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's your haste?" [...] Parlay {{chuckled and}} girded at his departing guests. [...] "A last drink, brave gentlemen." [...] No one noticed him. As {{they took the}} shell-bordered path to the beach he stuck <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door and called, [...] "Don't forget, gentlemen, at ten to-morrow old Parlay sells his pearls." ...|$|E
60|$|He arose {{and thrust}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> port-hole, looking {{down into the}} milky wash. The Mariposa was deeply loaded, and, hanging by his hands, his feet {{would be in the}} water. He could slip in noiselessly. No one would hear. A smother of spray dashed up, wetting his face. It tasted salt on his lips, and the taste was good. He {{wondered}} if he ought to write a swan-song, but laughed the thought away. There was no time. He was too impatient to be gone.|$|E
60|$|The voices {{dropped to}} a whisper. <b>The</b> Bishop thrust <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Dickens {{turned his}} back and put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> door into the darkness.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> Major put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> bedroom door, {{as soon as}} he had his wig on.|$|R
60|$|But old Granny Fox didn't laugh--oh, my, no, indeed! Her heart went lower still, {{and she did}} {{her best}} to run faster. Pretty soon she came out {{on the top of the}} hill where she could look, and then it seemed as if her heart came right up in her mouth and stopped beating. Her eyes popped almost out of her head. There was Farmer Brown's boy {{standing}} right in front of the door of her home. And while she was watching, what should Reddy Fox do but stick <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
60|$|But he couldn't stop {{very long}} {{to make fun}} of poor Chatterer. In the first place Farmer Brown's boy had put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> barn door to see what all the fuss was about. In the second place, Sammy fairly ached all over to spread the news through the Green Forest and over the Green Meadows. You know he is a great gossip. And this was such unusual news. Sammy knew very well that no one would believe him. He knew that they just couldn't believe that smart Mr. Chatterer had really been caught. And no one did believe it.|$|E
60|$|Reddy Fox {{wiped his}} eyes on his coat sleeve and hobbled along as best he could. Granny Fox would run a little way ahead {{to see that the}} way was safe and then come back for Reddy. Poor Reddy. He did his best not to complain, but it was such hard work. And somehow Reddy Fox didn't believe that it was at all necessary. He had been terribly frightened when he had disobeyed Granny Fox that {{afternoon}} and put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door, only to look right into the freckled face of Farmer Brown's boy. He had ducked back out of sight again too quickly for Farmer Brown's boy to shoot, and now he couldn't see why old Granny Fox wanted to move that very night.|$|E
60|$|Wrayson put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> cab. The young man's {{face was}} not {{pleasant}} to look at.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Moby Dick with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> {{water and}} {{breaking}} a boat in half with his jaws ...|$|R
60|$|Obeying {{the voice}} of authority, he pushed the {{tombstone}} {{to one side and}} poked <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> sepulchre.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Cork McManus, {{pulling his}} ear, [...] "I'm the latest thing in suitings with side vents and bell skirt {{when it comes}} to escortin' a lady. You bet you'll find me all right, Ruby. And I'll give you a tip as to who I am. My {{governor}} is one of the hottest cross-buns of the Wall Street push. Morgan's cab horse casts a shoe every time the old man sticks <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window. Me! Well, I'm in trainin' down the Street. The old man's goin' to put a seat on the Stock Exchange in my stockin' my next birthday. But it all sounds like a lemon to me. What I like is golf and yachtin' and--er--well, say a corkin' fast ten-round bout between welter-weights with walkin' gloves." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{time went}} by, and the suspense, to me, was terrible. Thomas Mugridge, {{on the other}} hand, {{considered}} it a laughable affair, and was continually bobbing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> galley door to make jocose remarks. How I hated him! And how my hatred for him grew and grew, during that fearful time, to cyclopean dimensions. For {{the first time in}} my life I experienced the desire to murder—“saw red,” as some of our picturesque writers phrase it. Life in general might still be sacred, but life in the particular case of Thomas Mugridge had become very profane indeed. I was frightened when I became conscious that I was seeing red, and the thought flashed through my mind: was I, too, becoming tainted by the brutality of my environment?—I, who even in the most flagrant crimes had denied the justice and righteousness of capital punishment? ...|$|E
50|$|Henwood, {{while riding}} the tram, was {{overcome}} by a fit of nausea and stuck <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window. This breached a bylaw made by the tram authority as a safety precaution, and he was struck twice by standards outside the tram.|$|E
60|$|CROFTS [putting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window] I say, Praed: {{what are}} you about? Do come along. [He disappears].|$|R
60|$|Lyra bent {{her face}} on her arm, and Jack Wilmington put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window where he stood.|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} Ulf heard steps rapidly approaching; then a low whistle. He put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window.|$|R
50|$|Isaac Seneca's brother, Victor Seneca, {{also played}} for Carlisle. On the train {{returning}} from {{a game against the}} University of Pennsylvania in 1897, Victor was killed when he put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window of the train and was struck by a telegraph pole.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile back at {{the rich}} home, Adelbert is tormenting Pluto and tying objects, {{including}} a roasted chicken onto Pluto's tail. The frustrated father finally has the butler throw the dog out, before spanking Adelbert. Pluto then follows Mickey's tracks to where he finds the lonely mouse {{sitting in front of}} a fire along with a snow sculpture of Pluto. Pluto burrows through the snow and pops <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> top of the sculpture surprising Mickey. The two of them share the roasted chicken for a Christmas dinner.|$|E
50|$|Renfield (Dwight Frye) is a {{solicitor}} {{traveling to}} Count Dracula's (Bela Lugosi) castle in Transylvania {{on a business}} matter. The people in the local village fear that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses {{to stay at the}} inn and asks his carriage driver {{to take him to the}} Borgo Pass. Renfield is driven to the castle by Dracula's coach, with Dracula disguised as the driver. En route, Renfield sticks <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window to ask the driver to slow down, but sees the driver has disappeared; a bat leads the horses.|$|E
60|$|The {{smoke was}} now getting very dense, {{and they could}} with {{difficulty}} breathe. Rupert put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Coast clear?" [...] whispered <b>the</b> lad, {{thrusting}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> entrance. <b>His</b> {{gray eyes}} gleamed brightly, showing his eager spirit.|$|R
60|$|The man obeyed. I {{sprang to}} the ground. <b>The</b> Baron had <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window, {{and the driver}} was {{flogging}} his horses.|$|R
5000|$|Before the two Sams {{can take}} a bite, a hoard of hungry mice dash {{from out of the}} {{woodwork}} and strip the turkey clean in a few seconds. At the point of despair, they hear another knock on the door. Daffy is there again, offering some after-dinner mints. The two Sams grab him and pull him inside. Daffy is able to stick <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door for a moment and tell the audience, [...] "Well, here we go again!" [...] He then gets yanked back inside and the door closes to a black-out that ends the cartoon.|$|E
50|$|The police pass by and Durrell orders {{everyone}} {{to the back}} room and orders Ricky to poke <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door and talk to them. Ricky does so, and attempts to signal to them with blinks and long drawn-out words. However the police simply figure that he is eccentric. The hostages moan {{that it is too}} hot. Durell goes to fix the broken air conditioner, while LeeJohn watches over the hostages. To Lee John's bewilderment, sister Doris begins cooking for everyone, using the church's kitchen. Doris gives him a plate, and fondly remembers how her husband loved her cooking on his birthday. He expresses his sadness at never having had a birthday as no one knew his birthday, and is comforted by Sister Doris.|$|E
50|$|The play {{opens at}} the {{exterior}} of a farmhouse in New England. It is sunset on an early summer day in 1850. Eben Cabot enters {{and walks to the}} edge of the porch. He rings a bell to call in his half-brothers, Simeon and Peter, who emerge soon after Eben goes back inside. The two brothers begin to talk about gold in the west and the risk of leaving everything they have worked for here. Eben sticks <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window as the two brothers speculate over their father's disappearance to the west, saying that he hasn't left the farm in 30 years or more. They decide they can't go west until their father dies. Eben reveals himself then by saying he prays his father were dead. With one last look at the setting sun and the promise of the west, the brothers retreat inside for supper.|$|E
5000|$|A {{loose-fitting}} BC {{without a}} crotch strap may slide up the diver {{and fail to}} keep <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> water at the surface.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a halt, much shouting, a volley of oaths from the drivers, and citizen Chauvelin thrust <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> {{carriage}} window.|$|R
60|$|But only a curse {{answered}} him, and a peremptory command not to {{lose sight}} of the prisoners by poking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window.|$|R
5000|$|Browning {{was a man}} of {{eccentric}} personal habits, {{particularly in}} relation to his bats. He spoke to them, and gave each one a name, often that of a Biblical figure. In the belief that any individual bat contained only a certain number of hits, he would periodically [...] "retire" [...] bats, keeping vast numbers of the retired ones in the home he shared with his mother. These bats were 37 inches long and 48 ounces in weight, enormous even {{by the standards of the}} time. He also habitually stared at the sun, thinking that by doing so, he would strengthen his eyes. He also [...] "cleansed" [...] his eyes when travelling by train by sticking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window in an effort to catch cinders in them. Browning also computed his average on his cuffs on a regular basis, and was not above announcing to all when his train arrived at a depot that he was the champion batter of the American Association.|$|E
50|$|A pilot {{trapped in}} his stateroom {{was able to}} find a wrench to open the porthole. With items in his room {{catching}} fire, the pilot continually wrapped himself in wet sheets or blankets, and kept <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> porthole; as the sheets or blankets began to smolder, the pilot would wet the items down again, wrap himself up, and return to the porthole. Unable to escape due to the fire outside his room, the pilot kept this up for some time. Finally, an enlisted sailor discovered his plight and was able to supply him with a firehose, a battle lantern, and an Oxygen Breathing Apparatus; {{for the duration of the}} fire, the pilot used the hose to fight the fire and cool his stateroom, and keep the fire from spreading again into the room. Nearby, the executive officer of the air wing's Crusader squadron, finding himself in a similar situation, stripped naked and forced his way through his porthole. He was able to obtain a firefighting suit, and later helped the ship's fire marshal in organizing firefighting parties.|$|E
50|$|Christian {{abandons}} {{his girlfriend}} and leaves the party with Barbara, upsetting Alex. They drive through a wooded area, where they see lingerie-clad mannequins hanging. The couple winds up back at Barbara's motel. Christian tells Barbara about a terrible childhood incident with his father, and Barbara explains that Alex is not her boyfriend but more of a provider. After some flirtation, Barbara makes an odd request: Christian must shave his beard before the two have sex. He complies. As Christian shaves in the bathroom, he hears a noise outside. He pokes <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> open window and is assaulted by {{a man with a}} gun. The man, Tatum, enters the bathroom and threatens Christian. A brief struggle ensues wherein Tatum is shot and killed. Christian leaves the bathroom and tells Barbara everything. Strangely at ease with the concept of a dead man in her room, she convinces Christian that {{the best thing to do}} is run. The pair go to a friend's place, a seaside castle and lighthouse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, youngster, I {{can tell}} you it goes for something. I wasn't at all sure whether the ass mightn't get <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> lion-skin." ...|$|R
60|$|Ginger stuck <b>his</b> <b>'ead</b> <b>out</b> o' <b>the</b> window, and by and by, when Peter whistled, him and Sam {{took the}} dog downstairs and <b>out</b> into <b>the</b> street.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Travers slipped {{inside and}} then thrust <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window. [...] "Won’t she think it funny {{you should be}} so handy?" [...] he inquired.|$|R
