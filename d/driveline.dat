25|$|On-Demand Mode - In {{this mode}} the {{transfer}} case operates {{primarily in the}} 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any <b>driveline</b> wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, {{as described in the}} section on traction control systems.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 Kelly {{finished}} {{the season in}} sixth place and Skaife finished in a miserable sixteenth. Both drivers did have success during with Skaife winning at Pukekohe and Wanneroo and Kelly winning at Surfers Paradise and Phillip Island. With HRT out of the title race {{by the time of}} the endurance races and the sister HSV Dealer Team having both its drivers in contention, it was controversially decided to split its drivers with Garth Tander driving with Skaife and Kelly with his brother Rick at the HSV Dealer Team. However the plan was not successful with the Skaife/Tander car finishing 26th at the Sandown 500 and crashing on lap 1 at Bathurst after a <b>driveline</b> failure. The second HRT car was driven by Jim Richards and Ryan Briscoe and finished in 21st at Sandown and did not finish at Bathurst.|$|E
2500|$|Part-time Mode - The {{front and}} rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the {{transfer}} case. Since the <b>driveline</b> does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause <b>driveline</b> wind-up, this mode is recommended only for ‘part-time’ use in off-road or loose surface conditions where <b>driveline</b> wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to either axle depending on the road condition and the weight over the axles.|$|E
2500|$|A concept Riviera {{was also}} {{shown at the}} 2013 Shanghai Motor Show, again {{developed}} by the Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center PATAC. [...] It had gull-wing doors and a plug-in electric <b>driveline.</b>|$|E
50|$|While the {{overwhelming}} majority of bus designs have been geared to internal combustion engine propulsion, accommodation has also been made for a variety of alternative <b>drivelines</b> and fuels, as in electric, fuel cell and hybrid bus technologies.

40|$|Version 2. 0 of the PowerTrain library will be {{released}} in March 2005. This article presents the new release, which is enriched by optional consideration of 3 D ef-fects, a simpler signal bus concept, new components and example models for flexible <b>drivelines,</b> 4 wd driv-elines and hybrid vehicles. In addition, various new driver models have been added. ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{new design}} also {{received}} mechanical upgrades including 30% larger brakes {{than those on}} the previous models. The I8 engine was also increased to [...] and produced [...] Options included a freewheeling clutch to disengage the <b>driveline,</b> {{as well as a}} selective-control automatic clutch.|$|E
2500|$|... all {{automotive}} {{manufacturers of}} EV or HEVs have developed prototypes that uses supercapacitors instead of batteries to store braking energy {{in order to}} improve <b>driveline</b> efficiency. The Mazda 6 is the only production car that uses supercapacitors to recover braking energy. Branded as i-eloop, the regenerative braking is claimed to reduce fuel consumption by about 10%.|$|E
2500|$|Externally, this Falcon's {{redesigned}} {{front end}} adopts Ford's Kinetic 2.0 styling theme featuring the trapezoidal grille which debuted on the Ford Evos concept. The re-introduction of the iconic XR8 model {{stems from the}} closure of FPV's operations, hence the reason why this model features {{the bulk of the}} FPV GT <b>driveline,</b> including the local supercharged [...] "Miami" [...] variant of the Coyote V8.|$|E
40|$|The Vehicle Dynamics Library is a {{commercial}} Modelica library for vehicle dynamics applications. This paper highlights recent development with focus on extended usability. Key changes are improved interoperability with other tools, improved simulation performance, extended vehicle system simulation, and expanded analysis.

50|$|The {{front axle}} {{was an unusual}} triple {{reduction}} type which did not need universal joints on the outer ends and allowed a tighter turning radius. The two rear axles were a double reduction type. Final drive ratios were 9.02:1 for gas powered trucks and 10.11:1 for diesels. All <b>drivelines</b> of both manufacturers were built by Mack.|$|R

2500|$|All work {{together}} {{to respond to the}} Ridgeline's electronic throttle that's also linked to the VTM-4 and VSA systems. [...] The automatic transmission uses a four-shaft design with a flat lock-up torque converter that's managed by the PGM-FI's central processing unit. A direct-control real-time pressure management system coordinates engine and transmission operation to minimize <b>driveline</b> shocks and a Grade Logic Controller prevents gear hunting when climbing hills or when more engine braking is required.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the model year, all Eagles carried over the new-for-1980 permanent all-wheel drive system with viscous fluid coupling that protected the suspension or <b>driveline</b> components from wear during dry pavement use. A [...] "Select Drive" [...] option, which allowed the Eagle to run in two-wheel-drive (RWD) mode and be switched to four-wheel-drive via a dashboard switch, was offered as a fuel economy measure at midyear. Select Drive required the vehicle to be stationary when switching between two-wheel and four-wheel-drive.|$|E
2500|$|Full-time Mode - Both axles {{are driven}} {{at all times}} but an {{inter-axle}} differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of <b>driveline</b> wind-up. With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the inter-axle differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’.|$|E
25|$|Shipping {{costs were}} considerable: From Kenosha, Wisconsin the Nash engines and <b>drivelines</b> went to England for {{installation}} in the Healey-fabricated frames. Healey then sent the rolling chassis to Italy, where Pininfarina's craftsmen fashioned the bodywork and assembled the finished product. Finally Farina exported the cars to America. The {{result was a}} $5,908 sticker price in 1953, while the new Chevrolet Corvette was $3,513.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, Pontiac models used Chevrolet <b>drivelines</b> {{for greater}} economy. To ensure that used car buyers in the U.S. were not sold less {{expensive}} Canadian models, different series names were used. The Canadian {{equivalent to the}} Star Chief was called Laurentian. Nonetheless, Pontiac offered a similarly-named series called the Strato Chief, but this model was the lowest-priced big Canadian Pontiac.|$|R
