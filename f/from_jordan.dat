5|$|Abu Iyad {{appointed}} Abu Nidal in 1968 as the Fatah {{representative in}} Khartoum, Sudan, then (at Abu Nidal's insistence) {{to the same}} position in Baghdad in July 1970, two months before Black September, when over 10 days of fighting King Hussein's army drove the Palestinian fedayeen out of Jordan, {{with the loss of}} thousands of lives. Seale writes that Abu Nidal's absence <b>from</b> <b>Jordan</b> during this period, when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was interested only in saving himself.|$|E
5|$|After Israel {{captured}} East Jerusalem <b>from</b> <b>Jordan</b> in 1967, {{a number}} of plans were submitted {{for the design of}} a new building. After years of deliberation and indecision, a commemorative arch was erected instead at the site in 1977, itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter. The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its 19th-century style received approval by the Israeli Government in 2000, and the newly rebuilt synagogue was dedicated on March 15, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Empress was {{the largest}} chili parlor chain in Cincinnati until 1949, when a former Empress {{employee}} and Greek immigrant, Nicholas Lambrinides, started Skyline Chili. In 1965, four brothers named Daoud, immigrants <b>from</b> <b>Jordan,</b> bought a restaurant called Hamburger Heaven from a former Empress employee, noticed the Cincinnati chili was outselling the hamburgers on their menu, and changed the restaurant's name to Gold Star Chili. As of 2015 Skyline (over 130 locations) and Gold Star (89 locations) were the largest Cincinnati chili parlor chains, while Empress had only two remaining locations, down from over a dozen during the chain's most successful period.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel {{captured}} the rest of Mandate Palestine <b>from</b> <b>Jordan</b> and Egypt, and began a policy of establishing Jewish settlements in those territories. From 1987 to 1993, the First Palestinian Intifada against Israel took place, which included the Declaration of the State of Palestine in 1988 and ended with the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords and the creation of the Palestinian National Authority.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{has seen}} a {{substantial}} economic growth since the QIZ were set up. Exports <b>from</b> <b>Jordan</b> to the United States grew from 15 million USD to over 1 billion USD in 2004. Government sources have estimated that over 40,000 jobs have been created with the set up of QIZs. Investment is currently valued at USD 85100 million and expected to grow to $180 to $200 million. The success of QIZ {{have led to the}} United States and Jordan signing a Free Trade Agreement in 2001 that was approved by the US Congress.|$|E

5|$|The route {{was once}} part of the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road, a plank road {{established}} by a New York State Legislature charter in the 1850s. It spanned a short distance <b>from</b> <b>Jordan</b> {{to the village of}} Skaneateles and was a successor to the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad, which ceased operations in 1834. However, the plank road lasted less than two decades. In 1866, the Legislature granted another charter, this time creating the Skaneateles Railroad and its corporation, which bought out most of the plank road company.|$|E

5|$|Both teams traded {{touchdowns in}} the third. The Tigers scored first on a 75-yard Rueben Randle {{reception}} <b>from</b> <b>Jordan</b> Jefferson, and the Crimson Tide responded with a five-yard Mark Ingram touchdown run. LSU scored 14 fourth quarter points to secure the victory {{with a pair of}} Jasper field goals and a one-yard Stevan Ridley touchdown run and a successful two-point conversion. Alabama responded with a nine-yard Julio Jones touchdown reception, but was unable to get a defensive stop late in the game preserving the 24–21 LSU victory. Turnovers proved costly for Alabama with LSU scoring field goals on drives after a McElroy interception in the first and fumble in the fourth. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 45–24–5.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recognized}} {{one of the}} men {{living in}} the safe house as former small-time criminal Mustaffa Karami (Kais Nashef), Salaam takes Karami into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening to set him up as a collaborator if he does not co-operate. Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unknown to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Ferris' CIA subordinate (Skip) to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Ferris's partner is caught and Salaam accuses Ferris of having had knowledge of the move on Karami, and blames Ferris's duplicity with him for the destruction of the safe house. He exiles Ferris <b>from</b> <b>Jordan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kent State went three-and-out {{on their}} first drive of the second quarter.

Kent State committed another miscue on their next drive, throwing an interception to Dechane Durante. Northern Illinois again capitalized, {{this time with a}} 12-play, 58-yard drive culminating with a 1-yard rush by Akeem Daniels. That drive would be the final scoring drive of the half, at which the score was Northern Illinois Huskies 17, Kent State Golden Flashes 10.|$|E

5|$|Palestinian groups used to {{initiate}} few attacks on Israeli targets {{from both the}} West Bank and Jordan before the Six-Day War, some of which caused Israel to retaliate which {{became known as the}} Reprisal operations. Following the seizure of the West Bank <b>from</b> <b>Jordan</b> in the June 1967 Six-Day War, Israel destroyed the existing Palestinian group Fatah networks there. In early 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on the Jordanian side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army.|$|E
5|$|The modern routing of NY317 was {{originally}} {{the northern part}} of the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road. Chartered in 1855, the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road Company was set to provide a plank road <b>from</b> <b>Jordan</b> southward to Skaneateles. This plank road was constructed in the 1850s in place of the Syracuse and Auburn Railroad and a small railroad from Skaneateles to Skaneateles Junction, two crude railroads that were in the area which had ended service in 1836 and 1850 respectively. On March25, 1853, the New York State Assembly proposed an additional toll gate to be constructed in Elbridge along the plank road. On June15, 1853, the bill was passed by the Legislature and went into effect.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 1957, Abu Nuwar, Rimawi and al-Hiyari {{were sentenced}} to 15 years {{imprisonment}} in absentia. During his exile <b>from</b> <b>Jordan,</b> Abu Nuwar initially resided in Damascus, along with other Jordanian dissidents, including al-Hiyari and Rimawi. However, in 1958, Abu Nuwar moved to Egypt following that country's union with Syria forming the United Arab Republic (UAR) under Nasser's presidency (Syria seceded in 1961). Thenceforth, Abu Nuwar lived much of {{the remainder of his}} exile in Cairo. In 1958, {{under the aegis of the}} UAR and with assistance from the head of Syrian intelligence, Abd al-Hamid al-Sarraj, the Jordanian dissidents in exile formed the Jordanian Revolutionary Council. It consisted of Jordanian Baathists, left-leaning politicians and dissident army officers, including Abu Nuwar, al-Hiyari and Abdullah al-Tal, a friend of Abu Nuwar who had been exiled by Hussein before him. The group attempted to recruit a university students in Jordan to form the vanguard of the nationalist movement in the country, funded the smuggling of weapons to Palestinian dissidents in the West Bank and the refugee camps around Amman, financially assisted Jordanian officers and politicians dismissed by Hussein, and organized assassination attempts against leading royalist politicians, including al-Rifai, Talhouni and Hazza al-Majali. There were disputes between al-Tal and Abu Nuwar over leadership of the group.|$|E

5|$|York lost 4–0 away to third-place Oxford, in {{what was}} only their first home league win of 2016, with a first-half goal <b>from</b> <b>Jordan</b> Bowery and second-half goals from Chey Dunkley, Danny Hylton and Kemar Roofe. Platt and Sinclair's {{respective}} loans at Harrogate and Guiseley were extended for a further month. York were beaten 1–0 away by bottom-of-the-table Dagenham, which meant they moved to within two points of York. Penn was sent off in the 57th minute for handling {{the ball on the}} goal line, and the resulting Joss Labadie penalty was saved by Flinders, before Dagenham scored the only goal through Josh Passley on 78 minutes. York signed Rochdale striker Lewis Alessandra on a one-month emergency loan and Notts County defender Scot Bennett on loan for the rest of 2015–16, while Massanka was recalled by Burnley. The team drew 1–1 at home with Barnet, which combined with Hartlepoool's win over Dagenham meant York were seven points adrift of safety. Alessandra gave York the lead 20 minutes into his debut with a shot from 10yards after Jake Hyde hit the post, before Barnet equalised shortly before half-time through Akinde. Rzonca joined Stamford on a one-month loan, with Hare's loan at the club extended {{to the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Conference Final began {{between the}} Penguins and the Philadelphia Flyers on May 9. Malkin scored with 7seconds {{left in the}} first period to take a 3–2 lead, and {{extended}} the advantage with a shorthanded goal in the second period, giving the Penguins a 1–0 advantage in the series after Game 1. In Game 2, Talbot scored {{to take the lead in}} the third period, and Staal added an empty-net goal to give the Penguins a 4–2 win and a 2–0 series lead. The win was the Penguins' seventh consecutive home playoff win, a franchise record, improving on a six-game streak in the 1992 playoffs. The Penguins also became only the fifth team to start the playoffs with a 10–1 record, and the first since the Detroit Red Wings in 1995. Game 3 saw the series move across state to Philadelphia; the Penguins struck quickly with goals from Ryan Whitney and Hossa within the first eight minutes. Hossa added his second goal on an empty net to seal the victory. With the win, the Penguins become the first team since the 1983 Edmonton Oilers to start the playoffs 11–1. The Penguins failed to close out the Eastern Conference Finals with a sweep of the Flyers in Game 4, losing 4–2. The Flyers jumped out to a 3–0 lead in the first period. The Penguins fought back getting two goals <b>from</b> <b>Jordan</b> Staal in the third period, but Joffrey Lupul's second goal on an empty net sealed the win for the Flyers. The series returned to Pittsburgh for Game 5, where the Penguins won their eighth consecutive home game by a final score of 6–0, the Prince of Wales Trophy, and a trip to the Stanley Cup Final.|$|E
