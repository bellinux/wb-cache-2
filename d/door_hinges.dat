25|$|The {{purpose of}} door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger {{trapping}} devices, or finger guards) {{is to reduce}} the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in <b>door</b> <b>hinges</b> by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.|$|E

25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, {{in which a}} stressed-skin GRP unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used glass-reinforced plastic for the entire load-bearing structure of the car, although a steel subframe for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into {{the front of the}} monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points for <b>door</b> <b>hinges,</b> jacking point for lifting the car and roll-over protection. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The body construction caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|E
500|$|In {{the initial}} {{moments of the}} assault, Mexican troops were at a disadvantage. Their column {{formation}} allowed only the front rows of soldiers to fire safely. Unaware of the dangers, the untrained recruits in the ranks [...] "blindly fir their guns", injuring or killing the troops in front of them. The tight concentration of troops also offered an excellent target for the Texian artillery. Lacking canister shot, Texians filled their cannon with any metal they could find, including <b>door</b> <b>hinges,</b> nails, and chopped-up horseshoes, essentially turning the cannon into giant shotguns. According to the diary of José Enrique de la Peña, [...] "a single cannon volley did away with half the company of chasseurs from Toluca". Duque fell from his horse after suffering a wound in his thigh and was almost trampled by his own men. General Manuel Castrillón quickly assumed command of Duque's column.|$|E

In 1999, Gittings summed up her inspiration for her activism: [...] "As a teenager, I had to struggle alone to learn about myself and {{what it meant to be}} gay.

2500|$|In Europe one of {{the oldest}} DIN {{standard}} applies: DIN 107 [...] "Building construction; identification of right and left side" [...] (first 1922-05, current 1974-04) defines that doors are categorized from the side where the <b>door</b> <b>hinges</b> can be seen. If the hinges are on the left, it is a DIN Left door (DIN links, DIN gauche), if the hinges are on the right, it is a DIN Right door (DIN rechts, DIN droite). The DIN Right and DIN Left marking are also used to categorize matching installation material such as mortise locks (referenced in DIN 107). The European Standard DIN EN 12519 [...] "Windows and pedestrian doors. Terminology" [...] includes these definitions of orientation.|$|E

2500|$|The Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art (PGSMA) was {{incorporated}} as a nonprofit institution in 1976. [...] It {{was named for}} Paris Gibson, the city's founder. The museum faced two immediate problems. [...] First, the historic building was climate controlled for the storage or display of perishable art, and lacked storage space. Second, the museum had no collection to display. Renovations began immediately, with community volunteers providing most of the work. Some aspects of the building—such as the highly detailed brass doorknobs and <b>door</b> <b>hinges,</b> the carved door frames, and ornate iron grating over the air vents—were retained. However, the [...] high oak wainscoting and historic slate blackboards were covered over with drywall, which both protected them from damage as well as provided much-needed display space. As the Great Falls High School structure was renovated, the museum quickly began acquiring art for display, primarily through donations. In late 1976, it acquired 243 sculptures by Lee Steen, a nationally known folk artist from Roundup, Montana. The museum, unable to display Steen's work, stored it in its attic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{front end}} of the Range Rover was revamped in 1986. This brought a more pedestrian-friendly plastic grille with {{horizontal}} slats, and optional front valance with two fog lights. The seat base was lowered and door handles were redesigned, making it more difficult for rear passengers but greatly improving the comfort for taller people in the front. The dashboard switchgear was updated again, now featuring steering column stalks from the Austin Montego, and other miscellaneous items from the Austin Rover car range. [...] Other changes included the windows, tailgate and bonnet, but none of those affected the general design. Bonnet and <b>door</b> <b>hinges</b> gradually evolved out of sight and the fuel filler cap was hidden behind a hinged flap. [...] The last major change to the interior took place in 1994, when the Range Rover was re-designated [...] "Classic" [...] upon the arrival of the replacement P38A version. The car gained a 'soft feel' safety dashboard (derived from that used in the facelifted Series 1 Discovery) with new switches (this time lifted from the Rover 800) and instruments. [...] These end of the line models are popularly called [...] "soft dash" [...] models by the motor trade and by enthusiasts to distinguish them from other members of the Range Rover Classic series.|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Zetterbergs Industri AB. Zetterbergs is designing, building and mounts body systems for trucks, including dumpers and tippers. The assignment for the thesis was {{to design a}} <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> for a spreader gate. The spreader gate is {{the top of the}} two tailgates on a dumper or tipper and opens back and outwards when tipping the cargo. The spreader gate controls the mass flow of the material being tipped. Zetterbergs want to offer their customers an opportunity to also open the spreader gate as a door and place it along the outside of the tipper to get easier access to the platform when loading equipment. They already have an existing solution for both the tipper and the dumper, but {{there is a need to}} improve and coordinate these solutions. The existing solution is not entirely rigid which causes problems of sagging when used, and a result of this is heavy lifting for the operator.   The process with designing a new hinge began with an initial study where, among others, the existing hinge and prototype solutions of the hinge at Zetterbergs were examined. To get to understand the process and which parts that needed to be taken into consideration when designing, a participation in the production was made. The initial study was finalized with the preparation of a user and technical specification.   Following the initial study several concepts was generated with a method called “ the five step method”.  Afterwards the concepts were evaluated and compared which lead to the selection of one of the concepts for a final design.   The result of this thesis is a <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> with tree different configurations. Those three configurations were made to fit the combinations between tipper and dumper as well as aluminum and steel hatch. The hinges are similar to each other and only a few details separate them. All components in the <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> are adjusted for the production at Zetterbergs. The <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> is designed in a way that prevents the operator from using it improperly...|$|R
