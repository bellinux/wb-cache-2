50|$|The 155 mm M549/M549A1 HERA is a separate-loading munition with {{a two-part}} forged shell body. The forward HE-filled shell body is {{constructed}} from high-fragmentation steel (HF1) and is of a low-drag aerodynamic profile. The rocket-motor body {{makes up the}} rear of the shell, this constructed from 4340 steel. The motor body weighs 13.5 kg (approximately 3.175 kg of which is propellant), is 266.7 mm long and is encircled by a welded overlay copper driving band and obturator band, both protected during storage and transit by a polycarbonate composition grommet. At the front of the projectile, the <b>fuze</b> <b>cavity</b> is protected during transport by an energy-absorbing lifting plug, which protects the fuze area from damage during storage, transit and handling. Before loading, the lifting plug is replaced by a fuze, and the protector cap over the rocket-motor nozzle is removed; the 155 mm M549/M549A1 HERA is not intended to be fired in the 'rocket-off' mode. On-target effects are enhanced by the shell's HF-1 steel body.The 155 mm M549 HERA forward shell body is filled with a nominal 7.26 kg of Composition B. The M549A1 HERA filler is 6.8 kg of cast TNT.At the instant of firing, the propellant gases ignite a pyrotechnic delay train in the rocket motor. The delay burns for approximately seven seconds. By the end of this seven seconds, the end of the delay train reaches the rocket's primary igniter and subsequently lights the motor's two propellant grains via an igniter pellet.|$|E
