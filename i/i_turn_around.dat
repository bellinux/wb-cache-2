This portion of the composition consists of eight-bar [...] "A" [...] sections and twelve-bar [...] "B" [...] sections, structured in an A-B-A-B pattern.

In keeping with the minimal harmonic movement of Indian music, the composition's only deviation from its I chord of C is a series of implied VII chord changes, which occur in the B sections.|$|E
