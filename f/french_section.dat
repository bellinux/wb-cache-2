5|$|This {{perspective}} {{was accepted}} within the Fourth International, yet sowed {{the seeds for}} the split in 1953. At the Third World Congress, the sections agreed with the perspective of an international civil war. The <b>French</b> <b>section</b> disagreed with the associated tactic of entryism sui generis, and held that Pablo was underestimating the independent role {{of the working class}} parties in the Fourth International. The leaders {{of the majority of the}} Trotskyist organisation in France, Marcel Bleibtreu and Pierre Lambert, refused to follow the line of the International. The International leadership had them replaced by a minority, leading to a permanent split in the <b>French</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

Around this time, M'ba was {{establishing}} his political career after being exiled to Oubangui-Chari. Affiliating with the <b>French</b> <b>Section</b> of the Workers' International (SFIO), Aubame later worked most closely with the Indépendants d'Outre-Mer, an African parliamentary group whose leaders were Senegalese Léopold Sédar Senghor and Cameroonian Louis-Paul Aujoulat. While a deputy he lived in Paris and toured Gabon regularly.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} of the International that recognised {{the leadership of the}} International Secretariat remained optimistic about the possibilities for increasing the International's political influence and extended the entrism into social democratic parties which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into communist parties and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed between those who subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, John Lawrence, George Clarke, Michele Mestre (a leader of the <b>French</b> <b>section),</b> and Murray Dowson (a leader of the Canadian group).|$|E

25|$|Unification was {{discussed}} between the International and the French group Lutte Ouvriere.

In 1976 discussions between the LCR and Lutte Ouvriere progressed again. The two organisations started to produce a common weekly supplement to their newspapers, common electoral work and other common campaigning.|$|E
25|$|Mauroy {{was born}} in Cartignies. A teacher, he led the Socialist Youth Movement and the Technical Teaching Union in the 1950s. He became a leading figure in the Socialist {{federation}} of Nord département, which was among the third biggest of the <b>French</b> <b>Section</b> of the Workers' International (SFIO) party and climbed quickly in the party. In 1966, he became the second most powerful person of the party behind the secretary general, Guy Mollet. Nevertheless, when Mollet resigned as leader in 1969, Alain Savary was chosen to succeed him.|$|E
25|$|In June 1939, Franco-German {{relations}} were strained when {{the head of}} the <b>French</b> <b>section</b> of the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, Otto Abetz, was expelled from France following allegations that he had bribed two French newspaper editors to print pro-German articles. Ribbentrop was enraged by Abetz's expulsion and attacked Count Johannes von Welczeck, the German Ambassador in Paris, over his failure to have the French re-admit him. In July 1939, Ribbentrop's claims about an alleged statement of December 1938 made by the French foreign minister Georges Bonnet were to lead to a lengthy war of words via a series of letters to the French newspapers between Ribbentrop and Bonnet over precisely what Bonnet had said to Ribbentrop.|$|E

50|$|In 1960, {{the first}} year of its operation, the National Theatre School only offered classes in acting for its Franophone and English students. They had been {{selected}} from hundreds of auditions conducted in every province and territory across the country to participate in thirty months of rigorous training conducted over three years, with eight months annually spent in Montreal and the two summer months in Stratford, Ontario, where students were afforded unparalleled access to the facilities and professional influences of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. The following year, 1961, a bilingual production program was inaugurated; in 1978 a French program in playwriting was added to the <b>French</b> acting <b>section</b> of the school and in 1980, an equivalent English playwriting program was added to its English acting section. Directing has been the most changeable program at the school. Beginning in the early 1980s, various attempts were made to create programs in English and French for the instruction of directing; but for both financial and pedagogical reasons, these programs have not always succeeded, and the English and <b>French</b> <b>sections</b> of the school have apparently abandoned the pursuit of synchronized objectives in this area. Indeed, while the integration of anglophone and francophone students has been fairly thorough in the production program, in other programs it has been more usual to see the English and <b>French</b> <b>sections</b> of the school operating autonomously.|$|R
25|$|Pierre Vidal-Naquet defined {{himself as}} an “activist historian”, and while {{pursuing}} his studies never ceased engaging in political struggles and taking part in political committees, etc. A member of the Comité Audin, along with Jérôme Lindon (editor of the Minuit publishing house), {{he was one of}} the best known opponents of the use of torture by the French Army during the Algerian War (1954–62). Along with Jean-Paul Sartre and 119 others, he signed the Manifesto of the 121, a call for civil disobedience against the Algerian war. As an anti-colonialist, Vidal-Naquet was opposed to Guy Mollet’s <b>French</b> <b>Section</b> of the Workers' International (SFIO) reformist party because of Mollet’s support of the First Indochina War and Algerian War.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Mitterrand was {{the first}} left-wing {{politician}} who saw the presidential election by universal suffrage {{as a way to}} defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the <b>French</b> <b>Section</b> of the Workers' International (SFIO), French Communist Party (PCF), Radical-Socialist Party (PR) and Unified Socialist Party (PSU)). He ended the cordon sanitaire of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader Guy Mollet, Mitterrand's candidacy prevented Gaston Defferre, his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties' staff members.|$|E
25|$|Until World War II, Radicals were {{a strong}} {{political}} force in France, embodied by the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party {{which was the}} most important party of the Third Republic. Since World War II, they were marginalized while French politics became characterised by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred on the <b>French</b> <b>Section</b> of the Workers' International and its successor the Socialist Party (since 1969); and the other right-wing, centred on the Gaullist Party, whose name changed over time: the Rally of the French People (1947), the Union of Democrats for the Republic (1958), the Rally for the Republic (1976), the Union for a Popular Movement (2007) and The Republicans (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, radical centrist party En Marche! became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans.|$|E
