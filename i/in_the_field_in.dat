5|$|Other artists {{influenced}} by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–49). Both trained in Glasgow, but {{spent most of}} their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose. Both were {{influenced by}} surrealism and the work of Bruegel. They focused on landscape, {{as can be seen in}} McIntosh Patrick's Traquair House (1938) and more overtly Baird's The Birth of Venus (1934). Before his success in painting, McIntosh Patrick gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>in</b> the inter-war period included William Wilson (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).|$|E

In 1983 he started to train as an astronaut and six months before the launch he was told that he would be the prime astronaut, much to his own surprise.

5|$|When {{the first}} state {{highways}} were signed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>in</b> 1919, M-53 was one of them, running from Detroit to Elkton. In the 1920s, the highway was extended northward to connect with Port Austin. Later improvements through 1940 realigned {{a section of the}} roadway near Imlay City and completed paving. With planning and construction during the 1950s and 1960s, the state converted portions of the road north of Detroit to have divided highway and freeway segments. The freeway bypass of Romeo was started in the 1990s and finished to its current state in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Around late August {{or early}} September, Wiśniowiecki {{met with the}} army regimentarzs Władysław Dominik Zasławski-Ostrogski, Mikołaj Ostroróg and Aleksander Koniecpolski. He was not on overly {{friendly}} terms with them, as he resented being passed in military nominations, but after short negotiations he agreed to follow their orders, and thus reduced to a junior commander status which had little impact over {{the next phase of}} the campaign. On 23 September, their forces were, however, defeated at the Battle of Pyliavtsi; {{near the end of the}} battle some accounts suggest Wiśniowiecki was offered the hetman's position, but refused. On 28 September in Lviv, Wiśniowiecki, with popular support, was given a field regimentarz nomination; about a week later this nomination was confirmed by the Sejm. To the anger of Lviv's townfolk, he decided to focus on retreating towards the key fortress in Zamość instead of Lviv; he would leave garrisons on both towns, and keep his army <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> <b>In</b> the end, the cities were not captured by the Cossacks, who in the light of the coming winter decided to retreat, after being paid a ransom by both town councils; no other large field battle took place that year.|$|E

5|$|Gadret and Dupont then showed {{climbing}} prowess in {{the first}} of three consecutive high mountain stages that preceded the second rest day. While Contador and José Rujano were easily the strongest riders on the day, the Ag2r tandem broke away from the peloton behind and secured third and fourth positions on the day. Gadret was third, which afforded him a time bonus in addition to the actual time taken. This moved him into the top ten {{for the first time in}} the race, in eighth. Dupont also entered the top ten after this stage, at tenth place. With sixth place the next day on Monte Zoncolan and attrition to other riders, Gadret moved up further, to fifth place. Dupont finished eighth on this stage to move up to eighth overall. Gadret gained further time against the vast majority of the field in the Giro's queen stage, stage 15, by finishing fifth and moving up to fourth place in the overall standings. Dupont struggled, coming in 22nd on the day, to fall to 15th overall. Gadret finished the race in fourth place, holding it after each of the remaining stages. Dupont took back a little time against some of the other riders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>in</b> stages 17 and 20, to improve his final position to 12th. Gadret's fourth place was the team's best overall placement in a Grand Tour in their history, bettering the sixth place attained by Cyril Dessel in the 2006 Tour de France.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} the {{formation}} of the 4th Brigade in England, in response to a request made by the British War Office to the New Zealand government for another infantry division. Although their numbers were insufficient for a new division, personnel from New Zealand were arriving in the various NZEF depots in Europe at a much higher rate than they were being lost from the division due to casualties and attrition. By early 1917, there was a reserve of around 10,000 men available with which to draw upon for the new brigade without adversely affecting the ability to replace existing troops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>in</b> the short term at least. The brigade's core units were four infantry battalions designated as the 3rd Battalions of the Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury and Otago Regiments. Newly promoted Brigadier General Herbert Ernest Hart was appointed by Godley as the brigade's commander, and after a rigorous training programme, curtailed by orders to report to France, it embarked for the front on 29 May 1917. With four infantry brigades, the New Zealand Division was now the strongest Dominion formation fighting in France with 20,000 personnel. However, Russell did not like his division's four-brigade structure (the remainder of the British and Dominion infantry divisions had three brigades) as he continually had to fend off requests to use the extra brigade for labouring work in the corps rear area.|$|E
