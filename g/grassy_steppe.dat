5000|$|The {{marsh sandpiper}} (Tringa stagnatilis) {{is a small}} wader. It is a rather small shank, and breeds in open <b>grassy</b> <b>steppe</b> and taiga {{wetlands}} from easternmost Europe to central Asia. The genus name Tringa is the New Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific stagnatilis is from Latin stagnum, [...] "swamp".|$|E

50|$|These foxes inhabit open <b>grassy</b> <b>steppes</b> and semideserts, {{and avoid}} dense {{vegetation}} and mountainous regions. True deserts with drifting sands are also avoided, as are snowfields {{more than about}} 15 cm deep. Corsac foxes generally stay far away from human disturbances.|$|R
50|$|Iris albertii is {{a species}} of iris found in Central Asia. It grows in the wild on <b>grassy</b> <b>steppes</b> at an {{elevation}} of 200 to 2000 meters, in sunny or semi-shaded locations. It {{is a member of}} the subgenus iris, meaning that it is a bearded iris, and grows from a rhizome.|$|R
50|$|At 1564116 km2, Mongolia is the 18th largest {{country in}} the world by land mass and has a {{population}} of around three million people. It is also the world's second-largest landlocked country behind Kazakhstan and the largest landlocked country that does not border a closed sea. The country contains very little arable land, as much of its area is covered by <b>grassy</b> <b>steppe,</b> with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi Desert to the south. Ulaanbaatar, the capital and largest city, is home to about 40%-45% of the country's population.|$|E
50|$|Faunal {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} by A. Lasota-Moskalewska and found relatively few remains from domestic sheep, goats, pigs and cattle. Other bones found included various antelope, jackal, deer, boar, badger, and horse. Some snail shells were found that were also considered to be a food source. There was also evidence of panther and Indian buffalo. Plant remains at the site were floated by Mark Nesbitt and indicated evidence for bitter vetch, pea and lentil, the domestication of which was not determined. The site was well situated between the two terrain types of <b>grassy</b> <b>steppe</b> and forest and is considered of key importance for research into village structures in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A stage.|$|E
40|$|The Valdes Peninsula is a high-natural value area, {{located on}} the east coast of Argentine Patagonia. The aim of the {{reported}} research was to analyze the community of breeding passerine birds of the inland areas, with the purpose to identify the species that characterize each community, determining the main environmental typologies frequented, in order to study the relationships between bird richness and abundance, and environmental structure. During the breeding season 2011, 107 point counts were performed. 869 birds belonging to 23 passerine species were contacted and analyzed through a cluster analysis using the Indicator Value method. Results revealed the existence of two different communities: one that essentially refers to the <b>grassy</b> <b>steppe</b> where the characteristic species are Short-billed Pipit (Anthus furcatus) and Common Miner (Geositta cunicularia), and the other one, which occupies the shrub-steppe consisting of more characteristic species, starting from the Rufous-collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), the most widespread species. These results update previous results on the community of passerines living in the study area and provide some useful insights for management purposes...|$|E
50|$|Central Asia is an {{extremely}} large region of varied geography, including high passes and mountains (Tian Shan), vast deserts (Kyzyl Kum, Taklamakan), and especially treeless, <b>grassy</b> <b>steppes.</b> The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of Eastern Europe as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the Eurasian Steppe.|$|R
50|$|Vegetation {{includes}} deciduous xerophytic forests, palm groves, <b>grassy</b> savannahs, <b>grassy</b> <b>steppes</b> and bushy steppes.

40|$|The {{lower part}} of a {{sediment}} core taken from the Ezero lake, next to Tell Ezero, in the Thracian Plain, Bulgaria, covers the period 15500 – 13500 calBP (Greenland Ice Core Stages G 1 - 1 c– 1 e). The recovery of plant macrofossils as well as pollen grains indicated that, far from a largely treeless <b>grassy</b> <b>steppe</b> vegetation, there were stands of trees and bushes {{as well as a}} rich wetland flora. Archaeological, ethnographic and ethnohistoric investigations of over 70 plant taxa showed that 20 taxa had documented use exclusively for food, 14 for exclusively medicinal use and 14 for both uses; moreover, several taxa were utilised or present in coeval sites such as the Franchthi Cave and in southwest Germany. The presumption is that Final Palaeolithic communities in the Thracian Plain would have made good use of such a rich supply of food and medicinal plants. However, there is a variety of reasons – whether taphonomic, research led or pedagogical – for the current absence of any Final Palaeolithic sites in the Thracian Plain. A hypothetical mating network centred on Ezero puts this problem in spatial context...|$|E
40|$|Las sierras septentrionales, o de Tandilia y las australes, o de Ventania, caracterizadas por su gran diversidad orgánica y su alto número de endemismos, están ubicadas en la planicie bonaerense de pastizales denominada "pampa". Con el objeto de establecer las relaciones entre Tandilia y Ventania con otras áreas, se analizaron las distribuciones de los taxones específicos e infraespecíficos de Asteraceae que habitan estas sierras. Se delimitaron trece áreas: sur de América del Norte y América Central, sur de Brasil, Uruguay, Pampa, Tandilia, Ventania, Chaco, Sierras Pampeanas, Sierras Subandinas, Mahuidas, Patagonia, Chile Central, y Andes del Norte. Las unidades de estudio fueron 112 taxones de Asteraceae presentes en Tandilia y Ventania (taxones endémicos, adventicios y naturalizados no fueron incluidos en el análisis). Las distribuciones de estos taxones fueron analizadas utilizando dos métodos: panbiogeografía compatibilidad de trazos) y análisis de simplicidad de endemismos. Ambos métodos conectan sur de Brasil, Uruguay, Pampa, Tandilia, Ventania y Sierras Pampeanas. Las Asteraceae de Tandilia y Ventania estarían más relacionadas con estas áreas que con la de las Sierras Subandinas, Andes del Norte, Chaco, Patagonia, Mahuidas y Chile Central. El área de América del Norte y América Central aparece menos relacionada a Tandilia y Ventania en relación a las otras áreas. La evolución de las Asteraceae de Tandilia y Ventania y las áreas relacionadas ha sido probablemente afectada por los eventos geológicos de los períodos Terciario y Cuaternario. La discontinuidad actual en el patrón de distribución de las Asteraceae, restringidas en general a las zonas elevadas, es explicada principalmente por eventos vicariantes debidos a condiciones áridas. Tandilia and Ventania are {{the only}} systems ofmountain ranges {{situated}} in a <b>grassy</b> <b>steppe</b> or "pampas" in the political province of Buenos Aires in Argentina. Tandilia and Ventania have a high taxa diversity and endemicity. A historical biogeographic analysis was carried out {{on the basis of}} distributional patterns of species and infraspecific taxa of Asteraceae inhabiting Tandilia and Ventania in orderto establish the relationships ofthese mountain ranges with other areas. Two methods were applied for the analysis: panbiogeography using the compatibility track method and parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE). Thirteen areas were delimited for the study: Southern North America and Central América, Southern Brazil, Uruguay, Pampa, Tandilia, Ventania, Chaco, Sierras Pampeanas, Sierras Subandinas, Mahuidas, Patagonia, Central Chile, and Northern Andes. The units of the study were 112 taxa inhabiting Tandilia and Ventania (endernic, naturalized, and adventicious species were not included). Both methods connect southern Brazil, Uruguay, Pampa, Tandilia, Ventania, and Sierras Pampeanas, showing that the Asteraceae biota ofTandilia and Ventania have closer relationships with the biota ofthese are as rather than with that of Sierras Subandinas, North Andean, Chaco, Patagonia, Mahuidas, and Central Chile. The Asteraceae ofCentral and North America appear less related to Tandilia and Ventania in regard of the rest ofthe areas. The evolution of Asteraceae in Tandilia and Ventania and related areas is hypothetized to have been affected mainly by Tertiary and Quaternary geologic events. The discontinuous pattern found, occurring mostly in elevated areas, is explained principally by vicariance under dry conditions. </p...|$|E

50|$|These are {{medium-sized}} birds, intermediate {{between the}} larger pheasants {{and the smaller}} quails. Partridges are native to the <b>grassy</b> <b>steppes</b> of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Nowadays they are often found nesting on agricultural land. They nest {{on the ground and}} have a diet consisting of seeds and insects. Species such as the grey partridge and the red-legged partridge are popular as game birds, and are often reared in captivity and released for the purpose of hunting. For the same reason, they have been introduced into large areas of North America.|$|R
50|$|The scimitar oryx once {{inhabited}} <b>grassy</b> <b>steppes,</b> semideserts and deserts in {{a narrow}} strip of central north Africa (Niger and Chad).

500|$|The {{habitat of}} the woolly mammoth {{is known as}} [...] "mammoth steppe" [...] or [...] "tundra steppe". This {{environment}} stretched across northern Asia, many parts of Europe, and {{the northern part of}} North America during the last ice age. It was similar to the <b>grassy</b> <b>steppes</b> of modern Russia, but the flora was more diverse, abundant, and grew faster. Grasses, sedges, shrubs, and herbaceous plants were present, and scattered trees were mainly found in southern regions. This habitat was not dominated by ice and snow, as is popularly believed, since these regions are thought to have been high-pressure areas at the time. The habitat of the woolly mammoth also supported other grazing herbivores such as the woolly rhinoceros, wild horses and bison. A 2014 study concluded that forbs (a group of herbaceous plants) were more important in the steppe-tundra than previously acknowledged, and that it was a primary food source for the ice-age megafauna.|$|R

The southernmost woolly mammoth specimen known is from the Shandong province of China, and is 33,000 years old. The southernmost European remains are from the Depression of Granada in Spain and are of roughly the same age. DNA studies have helped determine the phylogeography of the woolly mammoth. A 2008 DNA study showed there were two distinct groups of woolly mammoths: one that became extinct 45,000 years ago and another one that became extinct 12,000 years ago. The two groups are speculated to be divergent enough to be characterised as subspecies. The group that became extinct earlier stayed {{in the middle of the}} high Arctic, while the group with the later extinction had a much wider range. Recent stable isotope studies of Siberian and New World mammoths have shown there were also differences in climatic conditions on either side of the Bering land bridge, with Siberia being more uniformly cold and dry throughout the Late Pleistocene. During the Younger Dryas age, woolly mammoths briefly expanded into north-east Europe, whereafter the mainland populations became extinct.|$|R
