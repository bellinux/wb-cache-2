5|$|The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children began {{referring}} {{to it as}} female genital mutilation in 1990, and the World Health Organization (WHO) followed suit in 1991.

5|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{also known as}} <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> <b>cutting</b> and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of {{some or all of}} the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.|$|E
5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> <b>cutting</b> (FGC). STIs are a global health priority {{because they have}} serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the forces}} {{underpinning}} <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> mutilation/ <b>cutting</b> (FGM/C) {{is a necessary}} first step to prevent the continua-tion of a practice {{that is associated with}} health complications and human rights violations. To this end, a systematic review of 21 studies was conducted. Based on this review, the authors reveal six key factors that underpin FGM/C: cultural tradition, sexual morals, marriageability, religion, health benefits, and male sexual enjoy-ment. There were four key factors perceived to hinder FGM/C: health consequences, it is not a religious requirement, it is illegal, and the host society discourse rejects FGM/C. The results show that FGM/C appears to be a tradition in transition. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2008) classification describes four types of <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) : clitoridectomy, excision, infibulations, and other. Despite considerable variation in extent of genital tissue removed, instruments used, age at which it is performed, and termi-nology of the practice, common to all forms of FGM/C is that it involves “the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> organs for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons...|$|R
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> <b>cutting</b> (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris {{does not mean that the}} whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E
5|$|Violence {{against women}} may take many forms, {{including}} physical, sexual, emotional and psychological and may occur throughout the life-course. Structural violence may be embedded in legislation or policy, or be systematic misogyny by organisations against groups of women. Perpetrators of personal violence include state actors, strangers, acquaintances, relatives and intimate partners and manifests itself across a spectrum from discrimination, through harassment, sexual assault and rape, and physical harm to murder (femicide). It may also include cultural {{practices such as}} <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> <b>cutting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Women {{experience}} many unique {{health issues}} related to reproduction and sexuality and these are responsible for {{a third of all}} health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a major risk factor, especially in developing countries. Reproductive health includes {{a wide range of issues}} including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and perinatal care. Global women's health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> <b>cutting,</b> and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{examining}} {{the issue of}} <b>Female</b> <b>Genital</b> <b>Cuttings</b> (FGC) in Norway, which {{is said to have}} one of the strictest laws on FGC. However, {{it has been argued that}} there is an incongruence between the research used by the Norwegian state and the independent research estimating the actual prevalence of the practice in the country. There has been no single individual convicted for FGC in Norway, and independent academic research has shown a negative attitude towards the practice among immigrant communities coming from practicing societies. Nevertheless, the Norwegian authorities have taken further stricter measures towards the practice. Since there is limited research reflecting the experiences and attitudes of immigrant women on the practice and policies in Norway, this work aims at involving the voices of these women and listen to their feelings and attitudes towards the Norwegian policy and discourse around FGC in Norway. For this I have undertaken ten semi-structured interviews with women from the Somali and Eritrean community in Stavanger, Norway. Most of the women arrived as refugees/migrants and some were born in Norway. The theoretical framework behind this paper is Michel Foucault’s concept of bio-power to explain the practice of FGC as a way to discipline women’s sexuality. As social beings, we are disciplined by the society and culture around us, with each culture having its own form of discipline on the body. In some societies it may be FGC, in others plastic surgery. The women interviewed emphasised the stigma towards the Somali community, some highlighting their Islamic faith as the reason for increased focus on them. Although, all women in this study agreed to some extent with the ban on FGC, they felt that the later additions to the law had led to hysteria and unjustified suspicion upon their community. All agreed that the Norwegian authorities should involve the Somali community when taking decisions related to FGC policies. Therefore, this paper concludes that further research needs to be done on the attitudes of the communities affected by the FGC policies in Norway. There should be more accurate knowledge of the prevalence of the practice in the country and amend the law in accordance with independent research. Most importantly, it is recommended that the Norwegian authorities work together with the affected communities so as to promote integration and eliminate the stigma, which is counterproductive to the former...|$|R

25|$|One common {{cultural}} practice, {{irrespective of}} religion or economic status, is female genital mutilation (FGM), {{also known as}} <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> <b>cutting</b> (FGC), a procedure that involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The practice has been made illegal in Ethiopia in 2004. FGM is a pre-marital custom mainly endemic to Northeast Africa {{and parts of the}} Near East that has its ultimate origins in Ancient Egypt.

25|$|From feminists' perspectives, sexology, {{which is}} the study of human {{sexuality}} and sexual relationship, relates to the intersectionality of gender, race and sexuality. Men have dominant power and control over women in the relationship, and women are expected to hide their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women of color face even more sexual violence in the society. Some countries in Africa and Asia even practice <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> <b>cutting,</b> controlling women's sexual desire and limiting their sexual behavior. Moreover, Bunch, the women's and human rights activist, states that the society used to see lesbianism as a threat to male supremacy and to the political relationships between men and women. Therefore, in the past, people viewed being a lesbian as a sin and made it death penalty. Even today, many people still discriminate homosexuals. Many lesbians hide their sexuality and face even more sexual oppression.|$|E
500|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (also {{referred to as}} <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> <b>cutting)</b> {{is defined by the}} World health Organization (WHO) as [...] "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons". It has sometimes been referred to as female circumcision, although this term is misleading because it implies it is analogous to the circumcision of the foreskin from the male penis. Consequently, the term mutilation was adopted to emphasise the gravity of the act and its place as a violation of human rights. Subsequently, the term cutting was advanced to avoid offending cultural sensibility that would interfere with dialogue for change. To recognise these points of view some agencies use the composite female {{genital mutilation}}/cutting (FMG/C).|$|E

A professor of environmental studies in Japan wrote in his book that Japan's modern commercial whaling bears little resemblance to the small-scale subsistence whaling that, until the dawn of the 20th century, was limited to certain coastal regions, and Japan's whale-eating culture was also very limited in scope and an invented tradition, only lasting 20 years from the end of World War II to the early 1960s to augment Japanese school lunch programs during the U.S. occupation.|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} feminist discursive {{approach was}} used to explore how and to what ends women organized their talk about <b>female</b> <b>genitals.</b> Exploration and interpretation of how the eight women in this research used talk to orient their constructed positions for <b>female</b> <b>genitals,</b> within the dyad conversational sessions, was informed by the analytic concepts of interpretative repertoires, subject positioning and ideological dilemmas. Findings indicated that these women repeatedly drew on socially available information (e. g., fictional and non-fictional literature, media, family and friend, empirical research) regarding <b>female</b> <b>genitals</b> during their dyad discussions. Shared components in the women’s accounts were organized into two opposing interpretative repertoires consistent with those identified in a selection of reviewed textual resources: powerful <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> repertoire and powerless <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> repertoire. The participants drew on both these repertoires when arguing and defending multiple, and often contradictory, subject positions on this topic. Although the women discursively demonstrated a strong pull toward a position that aligned with the powerful repertoire, their powerful subject positions were tenuous. This tenuousness {{may have been due}} to the sensitive nature of this topic, the rhetorical demands of the research conversations, and/or the untenability of an extremist position in either of the powerful or powerless <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> repertoires. Further, these women did not construct any new information in their talk regarding <b>female</b> <b>genitals,</b> thus suggesting that the <b>female</b> <b>genital</b> repertoires are discursively pervasive and constraining.
