40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the portrayal of}} <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> with disabilities in a Turkish daily sports newspaper. A content analysis was conducted on 486 articles published in a popular sports newspaper between the years of 2007 and 2011. <b>Female</b> <b>athletes</b> with disabilities had less media coverage than male athletes with disabilities in Turkish sports media. While male athletes with disabilities were depicted more in team sports, <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> were depicted mostly in individual sports. However, the individual sports <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> {{participated in this study}} were sports that are considered ‘masculine’. <b>Female</b> <b>athletes</b> with disabilities were depicted as passive in most of the articles published. Disability was visible and both male and <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> were mostly depicted in wheelchairs which reinforced stereotypical perception of disability. Articles also focused on achievement of athletes with disabilities...|$|R

40|$|Osteoporosis afflicts {{millions}} of women worldwide, but is especially prevalent among <b>female</b> <b>athletes.</b> The stress of intense workouts places these <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> at a greater risk than the general female population. Absence or suppression of menstruation in <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> leads to a low peak bone mass and subsequently to the weakening of their bones. This domino effect, coupled with their participation in physical activities, greatly amplifies their susceptibility to stress fractures. Although intense workouts cannot {{be removed from the}} regimen of <b>female</b> <b>athletes,</b> increased awareness may prevent or lessen the effects of osteoporosis.

40|$|AbstractDespite the {{prolific}} {{advancement of}} women sports and <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> {{and the potential}} for strong women to be positive role models, the portrayal of these athletes in the media has been subjected to objectification and invisibility compared to male athletes or men's sports. Though there has been tremendous growth and popularity of women sports, <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> are still considered inferior to male athletes and that compared to male athletes there is still an obsession with the body of <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> rather than on her athletic skills. This inequality within sport will continue to exist until the media re-examines it portrayal of <b>female</b> <b>athletes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} {{the suitability of}} the Compulsive Exercise Test (athlete version; CET-A) for identifying <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> with clinically significant features related to or comparable with eating psychopathology. Three hundred and sixty-one <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> (including 12 with a clinically diagnosed eating disorder) completed the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the CET-A. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis was employed to identify a cut-off value on the CET-A which could indicate clinically significant features related to or comparable with eating psychopathology among <b>female</b> <b>athletes.</b> The analysis demonstrated that a CET-A score of 10 successfully discriminated <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> with a current eating disorder.

30|$|A unique {{point of}} this study is that we {{recruited}} <b>female</b> team sport <b>athletes.</b> Although we found marked improvements in repeated sprint ability, we cannot conclude whether the training effects in this study are specific to <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> because of a lack of comparative data from males. Because <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> tend to have lower anaerobic power outputs than do male athletes (Brooks et al. 1990; Billaut and Smith 2009), there might be greater trainability in response to sprint training. In contrast, females have been shown to be less sensitive to hypoxic stimuli for arterial O 2 desaturation (Billaut and Smith 2009). Therefore, it is unlikely that our results are specific to <b>female</b> <b>athletes.</b> We believe that RSH is suitable for both male and <b>female</b> <b>athletes.</b>|$|R

40|$|The study {{examines}} quantitatively and qualitatively gender representation in Finnish and Swedish tabloids’ sports coverage during Athens 2004 summer and Turin 2006 winter Olympics. Several media studies argue that sports journalism marginalises women’s sports and sexualises <b>female</b> <b>athletes.</b> The {{results of this}} study show that male athletes received more coverage than <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> in every tabloid, but when the number of domestic participants and their level of success were considered, neither country’s tabloids quantitatively marginalised women’s sports. Qualitative analysis found that research stereotypes showing trivialisation and sexualisation of <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> were incorrect, with the exception of Finnish tabloids representations of <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> participating in sports that are considered masculine. For the most part, <b>female</b> <b>athletes</b> were represented {{in the same way as}} male athletes.
