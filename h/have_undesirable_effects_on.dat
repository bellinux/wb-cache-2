The main feature of this current is its high amplitude and second harmonic content.

Intermodal freight transport, where freight is shipped from origin to destination by a sequence {{of at least two}} transportation modes, offers the possibility of shifting freight (either partially or in full) from one mode to another in the hope of reducing the greenhouse emissions by appropriately scheduling the services and routing the freight. Traditional planning methods for scheduling services in an intermodal transportation network usually focus on minimizing travel or time-related costs of transport.

30|$|However, {{immobilization}} {{promoted a}} decrease in enzyme activity for all experiments. The possible reason for this may be denaturation of the enzyme on nanoparticles' surface [40]. After immobilization on Au-citr(CTAB) surface, the enzyme activity decreased with about 90 %, revealing that this direct immobilization method <b>has</b> <b>undesirable</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> TbADH activity. The adsorbed enzyme may leak from the nanoparticles' surface during use due to the weak binding force between the enzyme and the carrier that could be caused by the transformation of amino acid residues located in the microenvironment of the catalytic site of TbADH, affecting both the local charge and topology of this site [21]. Therefore, this was a lower activity than that of glucose oxidase immobilized on Ag-citr nanoparticles [12]. The covalent immobilization through direct adsorption of the enzyme on Au-COOH, Au-COOH(CTAB), and Ag-COOH nanoparticles showed an enhancing <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> enzyme activity, loss only of 28 % and 46 %, respectively, of the initial enzyme activity. In that case, the binding between enzyme and nanoparticles is stronger that no leakage of the enzyme occurs.
