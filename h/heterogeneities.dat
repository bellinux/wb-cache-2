These technologies are used to observe the thermal emissions and measure the composition of gases over volcanoes such as Pele and Tvashtar. Imaging from the Keck telescope in February 2001 revealed the most powerful volcanic eruption observed in modern times, either on Io or on Earth, at the volcano Surt. Earth-based telescopes coming online over the next decade, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatory, will provide more-detailed observations of Io's volcanoes, approaching the resolution achieved by Galileos near-IR spectrometer. Hubble ultraviolet, millimeter-wave, and ground-based mid-infrared observations of Io's atmosphere have revealed strong density <b>heterogeneities</b> between bright, frost-covered regions along the satellite's equator and its polar regions, providing further evidence that Ionian atmosphere is supported by the sublimation of sulfur dioxide frost on Io's surface.|$|E

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} {{ecological}} debate on whether area per se or habitat <b>heterogeneity</b> is the main driver for species richness. The wetland remnants in the Sanjiang Plain, NE China harbor a high biodiversity and {{play an important role}} for local ecosystems. Fifty-one wetland remnants were sampled to examine the effect of area and habitat <b>heterogeneity</b> on vascular plant species richness. Number of community types, elevation, water <b>heterogeneity</b> and soil resource <b>heterogeneity</b> were employed as habitat <b>heterogeneity</b> variables, but only water <b>heterogeneity</b> was identified as the proper surrogate for habitat <b>heterogeneity.</b> Compared with the classic species-area model, the choros model achieved better fitness when water <b>heterogeneity</b> and elevation were employed as habitat <b>heterogeneity</b> variables. Nevertheless, elevation was poorly correlated with species richness. It suggests, without a comprehensive analysis of habitat <b>heterogeneity</b> variables, the choros model might result in a misleading result. In this study, species richness was significantly influenced by water <b>heterogeneity,</b> area and number of community types. Water <b>heterogeneity</b> and area both controlled the number of community types, and they were the two main determinants of species richness. As area was significantly and positively correlated with water <b>heterogeneity,</b> the variance in species richness was mainly related to the mutual effect of area and water <b>heterogeneity.</b> The results of this study confirmed that the relationship between the area per se hypothesis and the habitat <b>heterogeneity</b> hypothesis was conjunct rather than mutually exclusive. In addition, it is critical that both area and water <b>heterogeneity</b> should be taken into account for biodiversity conservation and management in wetland remnants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Stochastic {{frontier}} modeling has proceeded rapidly recently. <b>Heterogeneity</b> modeling internalized into frontier estimation {{has opened}} up new promising possibilities. In this paper we study different ways of considering <b>heterogeneity</b> in stochastic frontier models. It is possible to take <b>heterogeneity</b> into account by including those effects in the mean and/or variance {{of the distribution of}} inefficiency (observed <b>heterogeneity)</b> or by randomizing some parameters of the stochastic frontier model (unobserved <b>heterogeneity).</b> We compare the advantages of <b>heterogeneity</b> including models over the conventional random effects models for measuring the cost efficiency of electricity distribution utilities. Our results indicate that in all <b>heterogeneity</b> accounting models mean inefficiency decreases significantly compared to the basic random effects model. According to our results randomizing some of the parameters seems to help to capture the unobserved <b>heterogeneity</b> and hence this kind of firm specific <b>heterogeneity</b> does not appear as inefficiency in our estimation results. Notable is that the model which accounts observed <b>heterogeneity</b> and the models which account unobserved <b>heterogeneity</b> produce clearly different rank orders...|$|R

40|$|Restoring the <b>heterogeneity</b> of {{agricultural}} landscapes {{has been proposed}} as a key measure to promote farmland biodiversity. Recent studies, however, warn against generalizing this measure because effects can vary across agricultural contexts and species. We explored the hypothesis that <b>heterogeneity</b> has {{a negative effect on}} habitat specialists and a positive effect on generalists. We studied 22 species of common farmland birds belonging to three groups: arable specialists, grassland specialists, and mixed habitat (arable, grassland) “generalist” species. Abundances of these three groups were compared on a nationwide gradient of <b>heterogeneity</b> in France (2006 data), including 510 survey sites. We addressed the <b>heterogeneity</b> of the two main farmland habitats: arable land and grassland. We measured habitat extent (arable/(arable + grassland) ratio) and two <b>heterogeneity</b> components: composition (evenness in the land use proportions) and configuration (probability of adjacency). Although maximal configurational <b>heterogeneity</b> was found at maximal compositional <b>heterogeneity,</b> several landscapes had high compositional <b>heterogeneity</b> but low configurational <b>heterogeneity.</b> The abundance of specialists was strongly correlated with habitat extent and negatively correlated with configurational <b>heterogeneity.</b> It suggests that the most important mechanism influencing their population level could be habitat loss, worsened by fragmentation. Generalist species were more abundant in landscapes with higher proportion of arable land and high configurational <b>heterogeneity,</b> which suggests resource supplementation could be the mechanism that improves their population level.
