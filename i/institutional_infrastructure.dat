25|$|Driving Unger's {{political}} engagement is {{the idea}} that society can be made and remade. Unlike Mill or Marx, who posited a particular class as the agent of history, Unger does not see a single vehicle for transformative politics. He advocates world-wide revolution, but does not see this happening as a single cataclysmic event or undertaken by a class agent, like the Communist movement. Rather, he sees the possibility of piecemeal change, where institutions can be replaced one at a time, and permanent plasticity can be built into the <b>institutional</b> <b>infrastructure.</b>|$|E

Virtual <b>institutional</b> <b>infrastructures</b> include electronic medical and information services and the structure of national networks linking such services. Particular attention is focused on sociometric analysis of the interface between Cuban national information networks and the global Internet. The distinguishing characteristics of the Cuban case serve as a basis for formulation of recommendations for future research on sustainable development and integration of global healthcare systems...|$|R

From 1979 to 1984, the government also successfully pushed for the construction of 309 new primary healthcare facilities and the training of over 3,000 health professionals. Following the wake of the Revolution, MINSA promoted several prevention-based health efforts, one of the earliest being its Brigadista program. This Brigadista program involved the training of community health advocates, the majority of whom were chosen from the Sandinista Youth Organization, who were selected to be trained and transported to serve in underserved rural regions.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Internet and {{telecommunications}} technologies contribute to {{national health care}} system infrastructures and extend global health care services markets. The Cuban national health care system offers a model to show how a national information portal can contribute to system integration, including research, education, and service delivery as well as international trade in products and services. Objective: The objectives of this paper are (1) to present {{the context of the}} Cuban national health care system since the revolution in 1959, (2) to identify virtual <b>institutional</b> <b>infrastructures</b> of the system associated with the Cuban National Health Care Telecommunications Network and Portal (INFOMED), and (3) to show how they contribute to Cuban trade in international health care service markets. Methods: Qualitative case research methods were used to identify the integrated virtual infrastructure of INFOMED and to show how it reflects socialist ideology.

40|$|Capacity {{building}} is increasingly {{seen as a}} key component of land administration projects in developing or transition countries undertaken by the World Bank and individual country development assistance agencies. However, the capacity building concept is often used within a narrow meaning such as focusing on staff development through formal education and training programmes to meet the lack of qualified personnel in the short term. In fact, capacity {{building is}} often used as a synonym for human resource development. This paper argues that even if the key focus may be on education and training to meet short and medium term needs, capacity building measures should be addressed in the wider context of developing <b>institutional</b> <b>infrastructures</b> for implementing land policies in a sustainable way. Capacity building measures must be addressed at three levels: the societal level (policies, legal frameworks and accountability), the organisational level (<b>institutional</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and organisational effectiveness), and individual level (technical and professional competencies and responsibilities). Capacity building should be seen as a comprehensive methodology aiming to provide a sustainable outcome through assessing and addressing a whole range of relevant issues and their interrelationships. This paper aims to develop the capacity building concept to provide some guidance in the area of introducing sustainable land administration infrastructures. The paper also analyses the complex and interdisciplinary nature of the land administration paradigm in order to identify the key issues to be addressed. The paper then discusses the future directions towards developing methodological guidelines for capacity building in land administration...|$|R
