40|$|The Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) {{instrument}} {{heat rejection}} system has been operating in space for nearly 8 years since launched on NASA's EOS Aura Spacecraft. The instrument is an infrared imaging fourier transform spectrometer with spectral coverage of 3. 2 to 15. 4 microns. The loop heat pipe (LHP) based {{heat rejection system}} manages all of the instrument components waste heat including the two mechanical cryocoolers and their drive electronics. Five propylene LHPs collect and transport the instrument waste heat to the near room temperature nadir viewing radiators. During {{the early months of}} the mission, ice contamination of the cryogenic surfaces including the focal planes led to increased cryocooler loads and the need for periodic <b>decontamination</b> <b>cycles.</b> Focal plane <b>decontamination</b> <b>cycles</b> require power cycling both cryocoolers which also requires the two cryocooler LHPs to turn off and on during each cycle. To date, the cryocooler LHPs have undergone 24 start-ups in orbit successfully. This paper reports on the TES cryocooler loop heat pipe based heat rejection system performance. After a brief overview of the instrument thermal design, the paper presents detailed data on the highly successful space operation of the loop heat pipes since instrument turn-on in 2004. The data shows that the steady-state and transient operation of the LHPs has not changed since 2004 and shows consistent and predictable performance.

The deposition of 0. 51 ng/mm 2 of protein onto surgical grade stainless steel by one finger print alone has been demonstrated. Moreover, using a previously described contamination index, a 5 to 10 -fold increase in protein present on surgical instruments was noted following handling by clean-room staff under current departmental practices, relative to instruments handled by staff wearing gloves. While unlikely to pose a direct risk to patient health, subsequent sterilisation will fix protein to an instrument surface thereby decreasing the effectiveness of further <b>decontamination</b> <b>cycles.</b> Current guidelines make no recommendations surrounding the use of gloves by staff working within the clean room. However {{it is clear that}} this matter must be reviewed to limit the unnecessary transference of protein to surgical instruments...|$|R
40|$|Slag and {{crucible}} can be dissolved satisfactorily by the Los Alamos {{method of}} total dissolution with nitric acid {{in the presence}} of aluminum nitrate. Extraction of 99 % of the plutonium from total dissolution salted with aluminum nitrate was achieved by three successive contactings with 1 / 10 volumes of 30 % TBp- AMSCO 125 - 90 W. The TBPAMSCO phases contacted with leaching solutions salted with calcium nitrate must be scrubbed to remove calcium. Stripping with three 1 / 10 volumes of 0. 1 M hydroxylamine sulfate removes 99 % of the plutonium from the 30 % TBPAMSCO, initially O. lM HNO/sub 3 /. Plutonium(III) oxalate, (which could be blended into 234 - 5 operations) can be precipitated from the aqueous strip solution.

40|$|Surgical {{power tools}} (SPTs) are {{frequently}} {{used in many}} surgical specialties such as dentistry, orthopaedics, ophthalmology, neurology, and podiatry. They have complex designs that may restrict access to cleaning and sterilization agents and frequently become contaminated with microbial and tissue residues following use. Due to these challenges, surgical power tools can be considered the weak link in the <b>decontamination</b> <b>cycle</b> and present a potential for iatrogenic transmission of infection. We aimed to review the existing literature on the decontamination of surgical power tools and associated iatrogenic transmission of infection. A search of the medical literature was performed using Ovid online using the following databases: Ovid Medline 1950 – 2014, Embase 1980 – 2014, and EBM Reviews Full Text – Cochrane DSR, ACP Journal Club, and Dare. Despite challenges to decontamination processes, reported episodes of iatrogenic infection directly linked to SPTs appear rare. This may reflect a true picture but more likely represents incomplete reporting, failure to investigate power tools, or lack of surveillance linking surgical site infections (SSIs) to power tools. Healthcare professionals {{should be aware of}} the complexities associated with the decontamination of different SPTs, and should review manufacturers' reprocessing instructions prior to purchase. More clarity is required in the manufacturers' validation of these reprocessing instructions. This particularly applies to the emerging surgical robot systems that present extreme challenges to decontamination between uses. Investigation of cross-infection incidents or SSI surveillance should include an element of assessment of SPT decontamination to further elucidate the contribution of SPTs to skin and soft tissue infections...|$|E
40|$|In {{hygienic}} sensitive room settings like operation {{theaters and}} intensive care unit, hygiene {{is one of}} the major issues in order to prevent nosocomial infections. Using hygienic design principles originating from the food industry sector, the cleanability and therefore the overall hygiene status of these sensitive hospital areas can be improved significantly. This will consequently lead to a better hygiene status and reduced nosocomial infections. The suitability of the used building materials regarding low abrasion (VDI 2083 part 17), chemical (ISO 2812 - 1) and microbiological resistance (ISO 846) is evaluated using standardized test protocols. Using room decontamination with vaporized hydrogen peroxide, an appropriate selection of building materials with low adsorption and fast and desorption characteristics of H 2 O 2 can speed-up the aeration phase after the decontamination of an intensive care unit or operation theatre drastically. Shorter total <b>decontamination</b> <b>cycles</b> results in shorter down-times of these cost-sensitive rooms in hospital settings.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{contamination}} 'Haze' anomaly for the Cassini Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), {{one of two}} optical telescopes that comprise the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS). Cassini is a Saturn Orbiter with a 4 -year nominal mission. The incident occurred in 2001, five months after Jupiter encounter during the Cruise phase and ironically at the resumption of planned maintenance <b>decontamination</b> <b>cycles.</b> The degraded optical performance was first identified by the Instrument Operations Team with the first ISS Saturn imaging six weeks later. A distinct haze of varying size from image to image marred the images of Saturn. A photometric star calibration of the Pleiades, 4 days after the incident, showed stars with halos. Analysis showed that while the halo's intensity was only 1 - 2 % of {{the intensity of the}} central peak of a star, the halo contained 30 - 70 % of its integrated flux. This condition would impact science return. In a review of our experiences, we examine the contamination control plan, discuss the analysis of the limited data available and describe the one-year campaign to remove the haze from the camera. After several long conservative heating activities and interim analysis of their results, the contamination problem as measured by the camera's point spread function was essentially back to preanomaly size and at a point where there would be more risk to continue. We stress the importance of the flexibility of operations and instrument design, the need to do early infight instrument calibration and continual monitoring of instrument performance...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} of separating actinides (uranium and plutonium) from fission products (FP) were conducted using a modified Plutonium Uranium Recovery by Extraction (PUREX) process. The sample under investigation was a low-burn-up (< 5 GWd/tHM), depleted uranium dioxide (DUO 2) sample (~ 13 mg) irradiated in a fast neutron spectrum in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The {{objective of the}} study was to quantify the fission product decontamination factor for PUREX process steps while separating and purifying plutonium. Aliquots of the dissolved neutron-irradiated DUO 2 sample containing FPs and near weapons-grade plutonium (~ 89 % 239 Pu), underwent three modified PUREX <b>decontamination</b> <b>cycles</b> with products (organic and aqueous solutions) from each process step being analyzed via high-resolution gamma spectroscopy. The purification cycle consisted of tri-n-butyl-phosphate (TBP) and kerosene contacted with the feed solution aliquot to extract actinides (plutonium and uranium primarily) from feed to organic phase and further actinide (plutonium only) back-extraction using ferrous sulfamate. Fission product elements, cesium (by measuring 137 Cs) and cerium (by measuring 144 Ce) were determined to be the most readily removed elements from the product stream when analyzing a whole plutonium purification cycle. The nuclides that posed the greatest difficulty in removal included zirconium (by measuring 95 Zr) and ruthenium (by measuring 106 Ru) through the 1 st cycle of the purification. The results of this study could be useful in nuclear forensics analysis in the event of a plutonium smuggling interdiction or reprocessing plant inspection. This is because individual element decontamination factors will aid in nuclear forensics while examining the trace fission product contaminants in the smuggled plutonium...|$|R
40|$|The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) {{instrument}} {{pulse tube}} cryocoolers began opera-tion 39 days after {{launch of the}} NASA EOS/AQUA on May 4, 2002. Designed with redundant cryocoolers (a primary and a backup), the instrument began operation using a single cooler to bear the load of both the detector and the non-operating, backup cooler. During {{the early months of}} the mission, contamination of the cryogenic surfaces led to increased cryocooler loads and the need for periodic <b>decontamination</b> <b>cycles.</b> A change in operating strategy was made in November 2002 to run both coolers simultaneously to both overcome the increased cryogenic contamination load and to allow operation at a much reduced compressor stroke level. This change led to the successful continuous operation of the coolers since November 2002 and the non-interruption of science data collection from the AIRS instrument. After a brief review of the AIRS instrument cryogenic design, this paper presents detailed data on the highly successful continuous operation of the AIRS pulse tube cryocoolers and instru-ment thermal design {{over the past six years}} since the original turn-on in 2002. The data show that the cryogenic contamination reached an equilibrium level after a year of space operation and the cooler stroke required for constant-temperature operation has only increased by 2 % since that time. This high level of operational stability not only indicates that the cooler contamination load has not increased, but also that the cryocoolers have maintained near-constant efficiency and that the instrument’s thermal design has presented a near-constant heat rejection and parasitic-load environment. At this time AIRS maintains continuous operation in space providing important scientific data on Earth’s atmospheric parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate both condensing (wet) and non-condensing (dry) vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP) technologies for decontaminating a worst-case scenario Class II biosafety cabinet. A 23 -year-old Class II, type A 2 biosafety cabinet equipped with loaded HEPA filters and an inoperable blower was used for this study. Biological indicators were placed at various locations within the cabinet, including between the pleats of supply and exhaust HEPA filters, to assess the success of the decontamination processes. A variety of <b>decontamination</b> program <b>cycle</b> parameters in combination with two different routes of VHP introduction and minor biosafety cabinet preparations were assessed. Initial decontamination attempts using routine program cycles failed (at least one biological indicator grew upon incubation); however, program cycles consisting of modified parameters and BSC preparations resulted in successful (all the biological indicators were inactivated) and repeatable decontaminations. This study concludes that VHP, either wet or dry, could be used to decontaminate an entire biosafety cabinet only if appropriate and thoroughly validated decontamination processes are employed...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs) cost the National Health Service (NHS) in England in excess of £ 1 billion per year. One of the main HAIs {{is caused by the}} endospore-forming bacterium Clostridium difficile. The most common cause of healthcare-acquired diarrhoea in the developed world, C. difficile was responsible for around 850 deaths in England and Wales in 2011. To help reduce the spread of the HAI-causing bacteria, terminal disinfection of isolation rooms and wards using hydrogen peroxide vapour is actively promoted. The key advantages of hydrogen peroxide vapour are its high oxidation potential which has been reported to inactivate bacteria, fungi and spores. An additional advantage of hydrogen peroxide vapour is that it is relatively environmentally friendly, breaking down into oxygen and water. Investigation into bacterial inactivation kinetics was undertaken at controlled, steady concentrations of hydrogen peroxide vapour in the range of 10 ppm to 90 ppm. An exposure chamber was designed whereby the bacterial spores could be exposed to constant concentrations of hydrogen peroxide for various exposure times. Bacterial spores (1 -log 10 to 8 -log 10 cfu) were filter deposited onto membranes to achieve an even layer for consistent exposure of the hydrogen peroxide vapour to the spores. Bacillus subtilis is often used for method development in bacterial studies; advantages are it {{has been shown to be}} highly resistant to hydrogen peroxide vapour and is not a human pathogen. Following the method development, different strains of C. difficile (ribotypes 014, 027, 103 and 220) were exposed to identify differences in resistance. Inactivation models (Chick-Watson, Series-Event, Weibull and Baranyi) were used to fit the data generated using the environmental chamber. Decimal reduction values (D-values) were calculated from the models for comparative studies regarding the inactivation achieved for the different bacteria and different hydrogen peroxide concentrations. The findings from this thesis revealed the Weibull model provides the best fit for most of the data. An initial shoulder period was identified for B. subtilis which was absent for C. difficile inactivation by hydrogen peroxide vapour; B. subtilis is therefore more resistant to hydrogen peroxide disinfection than C. difficile. Typical D-values for B. subtilis and C. difficile when exposed to hydrogen peroxide vapour at a concentration of 90 ppm were 140 and 1 min, respectively. C. difficile inactivation data were used to develop a model to estimate the log reduction that could be achieved during an inactivation cycle based on the concentration-time integral (). This model could be used to estimate the log reduction of commercially available hydrogen peroxide decontamination systems; these release a fixed amount of hydrogen peroxide into the room resulting in a peak concentration before decomposition to oxygen and water. Releasing the hydrogen peroxide into the room in this manner results in spatial and temporal variation; this could result in differences in bacterial inactivation in different areas within the room. Using the aforementioned regression model, the inactivation achieved at all locations within the room could be predicted, which could be used to optimise the current hydrogen peroxide <b>decontamination</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{remediation}} technologies themselves incur environmental costs, it is advantageous {{to recognize the}} total environmental impact of the entire <b>decontamination</b> process. Life <b>Cycle</b> Assessment (LCA) allows for such a quantitative investigation of a seemingly qualitative process. By utilizing case studies detailing two sites that were clarified by in-situ bioremediation (ISBR) and then theoretically configuring them for pump-and-treat (PT) and funnel-and-gate (FG) systems, {{it is possible to}} realistically compare secondary impacts, namely environmental consequences, that a site could incur in each respective process of remediation. Environmental impact and inventory are analyzed based on direct data relating to a functional unit, using variant sensitivity and variant influence as well as outranking and eco-balancing methods. Enhanced natural attenuation scenarios, including ISBR, are currently being sought as generally reliable, comparably inexpensive and environmentally sound alternatives to conventional remediation strategies like pump-and-treat and funnel-and-gate.

40|$|This Tank Characterization Plan (ICP) {{identifies}} the {{information needed to}} address issues related to short-term and long-term safe storage and long-term management of single shell tank 241 -T- 1, 10 (T- 110). It should be understood that needs and issues surrounding tank T- 110 are evolving as new information becomes available. As a result, this TCP addresses only issues that have been identified to date. It is expected that changes may be necessary as additional issues or needs arise which impact the management of tank T- 110. As necessary, this TCP will be revised to reflect changes. This plan reflects the best information available as of August 1996. Tank T- 110 entered into service {{in the first quarter}} of 1945. The tank began receiving second- <b>cycle</b> <b>decontamination</b> waste {{in the first quarter of}} 1945 (Agnew et al. 1995). The tank began to cascade overflow to Tank 241 -T- 111 in October 1945. In the second quarter of 1952, the tank began receiving 224 waste in addition to the second-cycle waste. The tank contained second-cycle and 224 waste until the first quarter of 1976. During the third quarter of 1974, the tank received waste water. The tank was removed from service in 1976. A level adjustment was made in April of 1982. The tank was primarily stabilized in 1978 and partially isolated in December 1982. The tank is classified as a sound, non-stabilized tank (Brevick et al. 1995). Tank T- 110 currently contains a total volume of 14351789 kL. (379 kgal) of waste, which is equivalent to 338. 5 cm (133 in) of waste as measured from the baseline of the tank (Hanlon 1996). Tank T- 110 is on the Flammable Gas Watch List. Near-term sampling and analysis activities are focused on verifying or changing the Watch List tank status, and identifying any new safety issues. If new safety issues are identified, analysis activities consistent with the identified issue will be performed. In addition to resolving safety issues, it is intended that all tank waste will be subject to pretreatment and retrieval to prepare it for final storage or disposal.
