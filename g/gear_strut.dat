25|$|On 27 May 1985, a Lockheed TriStar (registration: G-BBAI) overran {{the runway}} at Leeds/Bradford Airport on landing from Palma after a rain shower. The {{aircraft}} was evacuated, with only minor injuries {{sustained by the}} 14 crew and 398 passengers. The nose landing <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> folded backwards during the overrun, leading to severe damage to {{the underside of the}} forward fuselage. The undersides of both wing-mounted engines were flattened and both engines suffered ingestion damage. The main wheels of the aircraft also dug deep troughs in the area beyond the end of the runway, damaging the buried airfield lighting cables. The accident report concluded that the overrun was caused by the inability of the aircraft to achieve the appropriate level of braking effectiveness, and recommended that both the scheduled wet runway performance of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and the condition of the surface of runway 14 at Leeds/Bradford Airport should be re-examined.|$|E
2500|$|The first F-107A (s/n 55-5118) with North American's chief {{test pilot}} Bob Baker at the controls, made its initial flight on 10 September 1956, {{attaining}} Mach1.03. Although successfully carrying out its flight, the brake chute did not deploy, {{which resulted in}} a [...] "hot" [...] landing with the nose <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> breaking. The aircraft first achieved Mach2 in tests on 3 November 1956.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first five}} prototypes had {{conventionally}} operating dual-strut leg rearwards-retracting main gear, but {{starting with the}} V6 prototype, a main gear design debuted that twisted the new, single-leg main <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> through 90° during the retraction sequence, much {{like that of the}} American Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter. This feature allowed the main wheels to end up above {{the lower end of the}} strut when fully retracted [...] and was adopted as standard for all future production Ju 88s, and only minimally modified for the later Ju 188 and 388 developments of it. These single-leg landing gear struts also made use of stacks of conical Belleville washers inside them, as their main form of suspension for takeoffs and landings.|$|E
50|$|The {{landing gear}} is fixed and unsprung. The main landing <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> {{are made of}} {{laminated}} wood with a steel axle. The only shock absorption comes from the tires themselves. Hydraulic wheel brakes are usually fitted.|$|R
50|$|The aircraft's {{structure}} {{is made from}} 6061-T6 aluminum, with the main landing <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> of 4130 steel. The aluminum frame wing is covered in pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. Construction time from the kit is reported as 120 hours.|$|R
50|$|As it {{is larger}} than the GE90, for testing it fits only the 747-400 with larger main <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> and bigger tires and not the {{previous}} -100 GE testbed, and the tested engine is tilted 5° more than the original CF6. Boeing builds a large, specially designed pylon for the testbed.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{of those}} {{airframes}} {{were converted to}} use eight Allison J35 jet engines, and designated YB-49. The second YB-35 converted to a YB-49 all-jet airframe crashed after Air Force test pilot Forbes pulled the outer wing panels off during stall tests at [...] The first YB-35 airframe jet-modified to a YB-49 completed all stall tests and even demonstrated recovery from a spin. It was later destroyed after the Flying Wing's forward landing <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> and wheel collapsed after encountering high vibration during a highly unusual taxi test procedure made with the engine's fuel tanks full, causing a fire that spread rapidly. Seven incomplete airframes began conversion to jet power as YB-35B but were never finished.|$|E
2500|$|AF Ser. No. 52-2220 – National Museum of the United States Air Force (NMUSAF), {{formerly}} The U.S. Air Force Museum, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. Its {{flight to}} the museum from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona on 30 April 1959 was the last flight of a B-36. This B-36J replaced the former Air Force Museum's original YB-36, AF Serial Number 42-13571 (see above). This {{was also the first}} aircraft to be placed in the Museum's new display hangar, and was not moved again until relocated to the Museum's latest addition in 2003. It is displayed alongside the only surviving example of the massive [...] lower main <b>gear</b> <b>strut,</b> single wheel and tire that was used on the original XB-36.|$|E
2500|$|The Thunderceptor's {{most notable}} design feature was {{intended}} to address this problem. The wings were built to have considerably more chord (distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge) at the tip than root, allowing them to generate more lift. This neatly addressed the problem of Sabre dance by delaying the point of stall on the tip {{to that of the}} entire wing. A side-effect of this design was that the tips had more internal room, so the landing gear was mounted to retract outwards with the wheels lying in the wingtips, using two smaller wheels in a tandem arrangement for each main <b>gear</b> <b>strut,</b> instead of one larger one. Another design change was the ability to vary the angle of incidence of the wing as a whole, tilting it up for low speed operations during takeoff and landing, and then [...] "leveling it off" [...] for high-speed flight and cruise. This allowed the fuselage to remain closer to level while landing, greatly improving visibility.|$|E
50|$|In August 1944 he {{returned}} to JG 52 and took over command of 5./JG 52, his score standing at 111. On the 22 December 1944 he scored his last two kills. Taking off for another sortie from Csór that day, one of the landing <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> hit a truck killing him in the accident.|$|R
50|$|The Model 187 shape {{was similar}} to the 177, with a high {{cantilever}} wing (its design was a mix of the cantilever wings on the 177 and the 210), all-moving tailplane, and tubular main landing <b>gear</b> <b>struts.</b> In a departure from the 177 approach, the 187's stabilator was mounted atop the vertical tail in a T-tail configuration.|$|R
50|$|Nose wheel {{steering}} is electronically {{controlled by the}} rudder pedals, utilizing the synchro principle. Hydraulic pressure for retraction and extension of the gear is transmitted by a system of tubing, hoses and actuating cylinders and is electrically controlled by limit switches and solenoid valves. Emergency extension can be accomplished pneumatically in case of hydraulic or electrical system failure. The main gear is enclosed by two doors after retraction. The inboard doors are hydraulically operated while the outboard doors are mechanically operated by linkage connected to the main <b>gear</b> <b>struts.</b> The nose <b>gear</b> doors operate mechanically with linkages attached to the nose <b>gear</b> shock <b>strut.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Power {{came from}} a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp two-row 18-cylinder radial engine {{producing}} 2,000hp (1,500kW)—the same engine that would power the prototype Vought XF4U-1 fighter to just over 400mph (644 kph) in October 1940—with the Double Wasp on the XP-47B turning a four-bladed Curtiss Electric constant-speed propeller of 146in (3.7m) in diameter. The loss of the AP-4 prototype to an engine fire ended Kartveli's experiments with tight-fitting cowlings, so the engine {{was placed in a}} broad cowling that opened at the front in a [...] "horse collar"-shaped ellipse. The cowling admitted cooling air for the engine, left and right oil coolers, and the turbosupercharger intercooler system. The engine exhaust gases were routed into a pair of wastegate-equipped pipes that ran along each side of the cockpit to drive the turbosupercharger turbine {{at the bottom of the}} fuselage about halfway between cockpit and tail. At full power, the pipes glowed red at their forward ends and the turbine spun at 21,300rpm. The complicated turbosupercharger system with its ductwork gave the XP-47B a deep fuselage, and the wings had to be mounted in a relatively high position. This was problematic since long-legged main landing gear struts were needed to provide ground clearance for the enormous propeller. To reduce the size and weight of the main landing gear struts and so that wing-mounted machine guns could be fitted, each main <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> was fitted with a mechanism by which it telescoped out 9in (23cm) when extended.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 November 1991, a SAHSA Boeing 737-200 landed hard on {{the right}} main <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> at Juan Santamaria International Airport casing the right landing <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> to collapse. All 36 {{passengers}} and 6 crew escaped.|$|E
5000|$|... {{there must}} be weight of at least 6.3 tons on each main landing <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Some R-4s had the {{tailwheel}} {{located at}} the extreme aft end of the boom near the tail rotor while others had it positioned at {{the midpoint of the}} boom. Additionally, some had short [...] "stub" [...] exhaust pipes from the engine while others had a much longer one which extended vertically and then aft above the main landing <b>gear</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|R
500|$|Mounting the {{receiver}} in the Heyford {{was not a}} trivial task; the standard half-wave dipole antenna needed to be about [...] long to detect wavelengths of 6.7m. The solution was eventually found by stringing a cable between the Heyford's fixed landing <b>gear</b> <b>struts.</b> A series of dry cell batteries lining the aircraft floor powered {{the receiver}}, providing high voltage for the CRT through an ignition coil taken from a Ford.|$|R
2500|$|All {{models of}} the AA-1 {{accommodate}} two people in side-by-side seating under a sliding canopy and are noted for their exceptionally light handling. The Yankee and its four-seater siblings, the AA-5 series, feature a unique bonded aluminum honeycomb fuselage and bonded wings that {{eliminate the need for}} rivets without sacrificing strength. The wide-track main landing <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> are laminated fiberglass for shock absorption, marketed as the [...] "Face Saver" [...] design by American Aviation.|$|R
5000|$|Some main {{landing gear}} struts on World War II aircraft, {{in order to allow}} a single-leg main gear to more {{efficiently}} store the wheel within either the wing or an engine nacelle, rotated the single <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> through a 90° angle during the rearwards-retraction sequence to allow the main wheel to rest [...] "flat" [...] above {{the lower end of the}} main <b>gear</b> <b>strut,</b> or flush within the wing or engine nacelles, when fully retracted. Examples are the Curtiss P-40, Vought F4U Corsair, Grumman F6F Hellcat, Messerschmitt Me 210 and Junkers Ju 88. The Aero Commander family of twin-engined business aircraft also shares this feature on the main gears, which retract aft into the ends of the engine nacelles. The rearward-retracting nosewheel strut on the Heinkel He 219 and the forward-retracting nose <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> on the later Cessna Skymaster similarly rotated 90 degrees as they retracted.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{seats in}} tandem configuration. The {{standard}} engine is the [...] Rotax 582. Optional equipment includes agricultural spray <b>gear,</b> <b>strut</b> fairings and tundra tires. First flew in 1992 {{and there were}} 21 reported flying in 1998. Discontinued around 2000.|$|E
50|$|During a post-accident inspection, {{maintenance}} personnel discovered a broken landing gear oleo attachment bracket {{on the left}} main landing <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> assembly. The manufacturer had changed {{the design of the}} oleo attachment bracket which was made of aluminum alloy. The newly designed oleo attachment bracket is made of steel.|$|E
2500|$|On October 12, 2011, a Nationale Regionale Transport EMB-120, {{registration}} ZS-PYO (MSN: 120245) {{performing a}} charter flight from Libreville to Port Gentil (Gabon), overran runway 21's end {{and came to}} a stop with the nose gear intact, both main <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> bent backwards causing the engines to [...] "pitch down" [...] together with the wings. A few passengers sustained minor injuries, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and was written off.|$|R
50|$|Mounting the {{receiver}} in the Heyford {{was not a}} trivial task; the standard half-wave dipole antenna needed to be about 3.5 m long to detect wavelengths of 6.7 m. The solution was eventually found by stringing a cable between the Heyford's fixed landing <b>gear</b> <b>struts.</b> A series of dry cell batteries lining the aircraft floor powered {{the receiver}}, providing high voltage for the CRT through an ignition coil taken from a Ford.|$|R

5000|$|Three seats, {{with two}} front seats in {{side-by-side}} configuration and one rear seat or optional extended cargo space. The standard engine is the [...] Rotax 582. Optional equipment includes agricultural spray <b>gear,</b> <b>strut</b> fairings and tundra tires. First flown in 1990, 78 were reported flying in 2004. Also marketed as the T-Bird Cargo.|$|E
50|$|Further {{additional}} causes {{were certain}} design {{features of the}} aircraft. Computer logic prevented the activation of both ground spoilers and thrust reversers until a minimum compression load of at least 6.3 tons was sensed on each main landing <b>gear</b> <b>strut,</b> thus preventing the crew from achieving any braking action by the two systems before this condition was met.|$|E
50|$|Except for {{the engine}} change and its Townend ring cowling, the YP-20 was not {{drastically}} {{different from the}} P-6 from which both it and the P-11 derived, though the YP-20 had more fin and less rudder area, and featured a steerable tailwheel, rather than the original skid. Later, a crankcase cover, <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> fairings, and wheel pants were added.|$|E

25|$|The {{prototype}} of the Witch, serial J8596, was first flown on 30 January 1928 at RAF Andover, with Louis Paget at the controls. The type was praised for its stability as a bombing platform, and its 138mph maximum speed was good, although its 62mph landing speed was felt to be too fast. However, the Witch was judged unsuitable for service due to structural weaknesses, including a number of failures of the landing <b>gear</b> <b>struts</b> and other components.|$|R
50|$|On 21 June 1957, {{the sole}} {{prototype}} I-7U suffered damage when the starboard landing <b>gear</b> <b>strut</b> failed as the aircraft landed on its 13th flight. After repair, the test program was resumed but {{came to an}} end after only six more flights. After 19 flights, the last in February 1958, the 1-7U was rebuilt into the 1-75 prototype interceptor.|$|E
