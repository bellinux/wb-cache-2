50|$|As the Georgia Baptist {{association}} grew, {{there was}} competition among congregations to claim lines to founding core members and be declared the first {{church in the}} state. In 1888 at the Georgia Convention, claims were examined as to primacy of <b>First</b> African <b>Baptist</b> of Savannah and the <b>First</b> Bryan <b>Baptist</b> Church. The convention declared that <b>First</b> African <b>Baptist</b> of Savannah was the banner church, due largely to Marshall's leadership during the difficult years of the 1830s, which held his congregation together {{under the name of}} the original church.|$|R
5|$|As of 2007 {{there are}} five church {{buildings}} in the Sycamore Historic District. When it was nominated to join the National Register there were seven church buildings within the district. One of those included is a residential structure that was utilized as a church {{when it was first}} constructed; the Arthur Stark House was once home to the Sycamore Universalist Church congregation. In the time since its listing, two churches have been destroyed or demolished. The Evangelical Church of St. John was destroyed by fire in 2004 and the United Methodist Church in Sycamore is no longer extant, replaced by a modern office building.

5|$|NY31F {{continues}} through the residential western {{portion of the}} village to an intersection with NY250 (South Main Street) {{just south of the}} village's business district and adjacent to the <b>First</b> <b>Baptist</b> Church of Fairport. After crossing NY250, NY31F becomes East Church Street and begins to parallel the canal as both exit the village. Now solely in Perinton once more, NY31F cuts to the north along Turk Hill Road, crossing the Erie Canal and the Rochester Subdivision, CSX's main line through the Rochester area, on a large overpass. The route resumes its eastward path at an intersection with High Street in the northeast corner of the village, becoming Macedon Center Road in the process.|$|E

5|$|Grissom {{sought to}} be {{discharged}} as the war neared its end, and married Betty Moore on July 6, 1945. They married at the <b>First</b> <b>Baptist</b> Church in Mitchell while on leave, and his brother Norman served as his best man. He was discharged from the army in November 1945. Grissom {{took a job at}} Carpenter Body Works, a local bus manufacturing business, and rented an apartment in Mitchell. He had trouble earning a sufficient income and was determined to attend college. Using the G.I. Bill for partial payment of his school tuition, Grissom enrolled at Purdue University in September 1946. During his time in college, Betty returned to live with her parents and took a job at the Indiana Bell Telephone Company while he worked part-time as a cook at a local restaurant. Grissom took summer classes to finish early and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering in February 1950.|$|E
5|$|In Fairport, NY250 follows South Main Street down a large {{hill that}} levels {{off at the}} {{southern}} edge of the village's business district. Here, NY250 intersects Church Street (NY31F) and passes by the <b>First</b> <b>Baptist</b> Church of Fairport, located on the northwestern corner of the junction. The route continues north {{into the center of the}} village, passing by several small businesses and Fairport Village Landing—the largest shopping plaza in the village—before crossing over the Erie Canal by way of a lift bridge and becoming North Main Street. Once on the north side of the canal, NY250 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester and West Shore Subdivisions at a single grade crossing ahead of High Street. At this point, the businesses give way to homes as the highway ascends a hill at the north end of the village and meets Whitney Road at the northern village line.|$|E

5|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with SR 84 west of Stanfield. SR 347 then heads northward as John Wayne Parkway, a four-lane expressway, which SR 347 is for its entirety, through a desert landscape. After intersecting Meadowview Road and crossing a canal, SR 347 meets Carefree Place, where a farm appears {{to the west}} part of the road. At Clayton Road, {{the east side of}} the road becomes farmland as well. John Wayne Parkway enters the Ak-Chin Indian Community, passing the Harrah's Ak-Chin Casino, and intersects BIA Route 14 within this community. At Route 14, the route becomes Maricopa Road, but retains its name as John Wayne Parkway, as it heads toward Maricopa. Continuing on its northerly path, the road exits the Indian community with a residential area to the west and desert to the east. Past Bowlin road, this orientation switches, as the residential area is located on the east side of Maricopa Road. The arrangement of the landscape switches again at Desert Cedars Road, where the road passes the Maricopa <b>First</b> <b>Baptist</b> Church. Before meeting the Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway, the road passes Maricopa High School. It also meets an at-grade intersection with a rail line, owned by Union Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Casting Crowns {{was formed}} in 1999 by Mark Hall (lead vocals), Hector Cervantes (guitar, vocals), Juan DeVevo (guitar, vocals), and Melodee DeVevo (violin, vocals) as a student worship band. The band is {{originally}} from Daytona Beach, Florida but relocated to Eagle's Landing <b>First</b> <b>Baptist</b> Church in McDonough, Georgia in 2001, where they recruited Megan Garrett (piano/vocals), Andy Williams (drums), and Chris Huffman (bass guitar) as members. One of their independent records was discovered by Mark A. Miller, the lead vocalist for country band Sawyer Brown. Although Casting Crowns had not released their independent records with intentions of receiving a record deal, Miller offered the band {{the opportunity to become}} the first artists signed to his record label. The band agreed to join and signed with the as-yet-unnamed record label, an imprint of Provident Label Group, and began work on their debut album. As a group, Casting Crowns was unusual in several ways, such as having seven members, never having toured before, and their producer (Miller) having no history in the Christian music industry. However, Christian singer and songwriter Steven Curtis Chapman was brought in to co-produce the album with Miller, giving the project a greater amount of support in the Christian music industry. Terry Hemmings, Provident Label Group CEO/President and a personal friend of Miller, openly predicted success for Casting Crowns and made them one of his top priorities at the label. While most artists in a similar situation would have received nine months for artist development, Hemmings gave the band four months and sped up the album's release. Casting Crowns was recorded at Glow in the Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee. The album was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E
