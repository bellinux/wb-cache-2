40|$|In many legal, political, {{and social}} settings, people must <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> before {{particular}} outcomes {{can be achieved}} and failing to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> may be costly. In this article, we present a theory and conduct experiments that {{take into account the}} costs associated with communicating, as well as the difﬁculty of the decisions that groups make. We ﬁnd that when there is even a small cost (relative to the potential beneﬁt) associated with sending information to others and/or listening, groups are much less likely to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus,</b> primarily because they are less willing to communicate with one another. We also ﬁnd that difﬁcult problems signiﬁcantly reduce group members’ willingness to communicate with one another and, therefore, hinder their ability to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Research in {{sociology}} studies {{the effectiveness of}} social networks in achieving computa-tional tasks. Typically the agents {{who are supposed to}} achieve a task are unaware of the underlying social network except their immediate friends. They have limited memory, communication, and coordi-nation. These limitations result in computational obstacles in achieving otherwise trivial computational problems. One of the simplest problems studied in the social sciences involves <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> among players between two alternatives which are otherwise indistinguishable. In this paper we formalize the computational model of social networks. We then analyze the consensus problem as well as the problem of <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> which is identical to the majority of the original signals. In both models we seek to minimize the time it takes players to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus...</b>|$|R

30|$|Actually, {{we use our}} {{own system}} model to apply binary {{consensus}} and average <b>consensus</b> algorithm in <b>a</b> distributed network for <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> decision. Our algorithm runs for a huge network. Initially we don’t {{have any idea of}} the whole network besides there can be many faulty nodes. Our main goal is to reach consensus decision as fast as possible. In few cases, randomly chosen nodes will run faster but we are ignoring random choices because random choices might get huge amount of time to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> decisions. So, we can claim that the probability of our algorithm runs faster than random choice-based algorithm like gossip algorithm.|$|R
