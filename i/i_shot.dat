500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "This Love" [...] also {{features}} Levine and his then-girlfriend, model Kelly McKee, {{in a few}} intimate scenes. The video used creative camera angles, thereby avoiding possible FCC action. A version of the video where a stream of computer-generated flowers cover up more was created for more conservative markets. When asked about the video, Levine said: [...] "It was surprisingly not weird and surprisingly not sexual. It was totally comfortable. I didn't get horny or anything, which was weird since <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> it with my girlfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And {{it seemed to me that}} a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E
500|$|Sevigny {{followed}} Kids with actor/director Steve Buscemi's {{independent film}} Trees Lounge (1996), starring {{in a relatively}} small role as Buscemi's object of affection. During this time, director Mary Harron (after having seen Kids) offered Sevigny a minor part in her film, <b>I</b> <b>Shot</b> Andy Warhol (1996). Harron tracked Sevigny down to the SoHo clothing store Liquid Sky, where she {{was working at the}} time. Sevigny then gave her first audition ever, but ultimately decided to turn down the part; she would later work with Harron on American Psycho (2000). Instead of taking the part in <b>I</b> <b>Shot</b> Andy Warhol, Sevigny starred in and worked as a fashion designer on Gummo (1997), directed and written by Harmony Korine, who was romantically involved with Sevigny during filming. Gummo was as controversial as Sevigny's debut; set in Xenia, Ohio, the film depicts an array of nihilistic characters in a poverty-stricken small-town America, and presents issues such as drug and sexual abuse as well as anti-social alienated youth in Midwestern America. In retrospection to the confronting nature of the film, Sevigny cited it as one of her favorite projects: [...] "Young people love that movie. It's been stolen from every Blockbuster in America. It's become a cult film". The film was dedicated to Sevigny's father, who died prior to the film's release.|$|E

Cruz explain the video's simplistic theme and recording saying, [...] "It was shot in this really cool basement in LA. We wanted it {{to look like a}} party scene, but not in a typical club, and it was really good fun. Kesha's shots were recorded in London because our schedules were all over the place, and then <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> the rest in LA." ...|$|E

They cited obvious similarities in the two hijackings, claims by McCoy's family that the tie and mother-of-pearl tie clip left on the plane belonged to McCoy, and McCoy's own refusal to admit or deny that he was Cooper. A proponent of their theory was the FBI agent who killed McCoy. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> Richard McCoy," [...] he said, [...] "I shot D. B. Cooper at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Streep's {{first feature}} film role came {{opposite}} Jane Fonda in the 1977 film Julia, {{in which she}} had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: [...] "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've made a terrible mistake, no more movies. I hate this business". However, Streep cites Fonda as having a lasting influence on her as an actress, and has credited her as [...] "open probably more doors than I probably even know about".|$|E

500|$|Guggenheim {{says while}} it would've {{been a lot}} easier to use one format, it would not have had the same impact. [...] "Each format has its own feel and texture and touch. For the {{storytelling}} of what Gore’s memory was like of growing up on the farm, some of this 8mm stuff that <b>I</b> <b>shot</b> is very impressionistic. And for some of his memories of his son’s accident, these grainy black-and-white stills... have a feel that contrasted very beautifully with the crisp hi-def HD that we shot.

And my family’s in it." [...] A 15-second preview {{of the project was}} released on April 14, 2014, while the final product was premiered through the online retailer Ssense on April 16, 2014. It was the first of several [...] "shoppable" [...] music videos released through the retailer, in partnership with London magazine System. The clip was inspired by the visuals for 1990s hip hop music and the catalog of Michael Jackson, which Ferreira revealed [...] "inspire me and played a big part of my childhood." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996, actress Lili Taylor played Solanas in {{the film}} <b>I</b> <b>Shot</b> Andy Warhol, which focused on Solanas's {{assassination}} attempt on Warhol (played by Jared Harris). Taylor won Special Recognition for Outstanding Performance at the Sundance Film Festival for her role. The film's director, Mary Harron, requested permission to use songs by The Velvet Underground, but was denied by Lou Reed, who feared that Solanas would be glorified {{in the film}}. Six years before the film's release, Reed and John Cale included a song about Solanas, [...] "I Believe", on their concept album about Warhol, Songs for Drella (1990). In [...] "I Believe", Reed sings, [...] "I believe life's serious enough for retribution... I believe being sick is no excuse. And I believe I would've pulled the switch on her myself." [...] Reed believed Solanas was to blame for Warhol's death from a gallbladder infection 20 years after she shot him.|$|E

People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when <b>I</b> was being <b>shot</b> and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television." ...|$|R
