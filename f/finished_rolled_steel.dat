40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} the magnetic flux density in the container is examined {{in an attempt to}} improve the electro-magnetic barrel <b>finishing</b> machine. A <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> core was placed {{on the cover of the}} container as the ferro magnetic material to increase the magnetic flux density. The magnetic flux density in the container could then be varied by the height of the container and the applied voltage. The effect of the magnetic flux density on the finishing characteristics was investigated under various conditions. It was found that the magnetic flux density in the container continuously increased when the upper iron core end of the finishing machine was installed near the cover of the container. Optimum values of the magnetic flux density with respect to the finishing characteristics were obtained, and revealed to vary with respect to the material of the workpieces...|$|R
50|$|Work {{hardening}} may {{be desirable}} or undesirable {{depending on the}} context. An example of undesirable work hardening is during machining when early passes of a cutter inadvertently work-harden the workpiece surface, causing damage to the cutter during the later passes. Certain alloys {{are more prone to}} this than others; superalloys such as Inconel require machining strategies that take it into account. An example of desirable work hardening is that which occurs in metalworking processes that intentionally induce plastic deformation to exact a shape change. These processes are known as cold working or cold forming processes. They are characterized by shaping the workpiece at a temperature below its recrystallization temperature, usually at ambient temperature. Cold forming techniques are usually classified into four major groups: squeezing, bending, drawing, and shearing. Applications include the heading of bolts and cap screws and the <b>finishing</b> of cold <b>rolled</b> <b>steel.</b> In cold forming, metal is formed at high speed and high pressure using tool steel or carbide dies. The cold working of the metal increasing the hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength.|$|R

40|$|Abstract––The {{past few}} decades have seen {{outstanding}} advances {{in the use of}} composite materials in structural application. Composite members are widely used in structural systems to achieve additional rigidity. R. C. C. members with conventional Torsteel reinforcement may now be replaced by composite members with <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> sections like angle sections, galvanized iron pipe sections. Experimentally as well as analytically these members prove to be a better alternative to conventional members and are more advantageous especially at the beam-column junction and in high rise earthquake-resistant structures. The present paper aims at studying the effect of change in grade of concrete on the behavior of composite members. Beams and columns using <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> sections as reinforcement were cast using varying grades of concrete and tested. Results of failure loads and deformations in flexure and axial compression show that use of <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> sections as reinforcement proves to be advantageous even for variations in grades of concrete.
