40|$|The {{food web}} {{of the central}} Amazon basin {{displays}} {{one of the largest}} discrepancies in <b>food</b> source <b>utilisation</b> versus availability for consumers. While C- 4 macrophytes dominate the primary producing biomass in floodplains, the food web is dominated by the use of C- 3 carbon sources. Amazon fish species have wide-ranging diets and show feeding flexibility in response to spatial and temporal patterns in food source availability. Fish are therefore expected to use a range of available resources. Fatty acids and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions were studied to investigate their trophic behaviour and provide a better assessment of <b>food</b> source <b>utilisation</b> by nine fish species from two Amazon floodplains. Although nitrogen stable isotopes positioned detritivores {{at the base of the}} food chain, their large proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) suggest selection of a high-quality food source, such as microalgae. Omnivores and insectivores displayed a wide range of <b>food</b> source <b>utilisation,</b> indicating opportunist feeding behaviour. Piscivores displayed the most N- 15 -enriched signature (up to 10. 6), concomitant with their predator position in the studied food web. C- 3 carbon was the dominant source for most species, which is a finding consistent with current classical knowledge. However, consumption of C- 4 macrophytes was detected for the herbivore Schizodon fasciatus, in line with the spatial availability of this food source in the floodplain system. Large amounts of polyunsaturated and essential FAs in these C- 4 macrophytes indicate their high nutritive value. Our results suggest that this food source is rather neglected by fish due to low digestibility, with the exception of the herbivore that may possess modification of its digestive system that allows the use of C- 4 plants...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the problem}} of food waste has {{attracted}} considerable interest from food producers, processors, retailers, and consumers alike. Food waste is considered not only a sustainability problem related to food security, but also an economic problem since it directly impacts the profitability of the whole food supply chain. In developed countries, consumers {{are one of the}} main contributors to food waste and ultimately pay for all wastes produced throughout the food supply chain. To secure food and reduce food waste, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the various sources of food wastes throughout the food supply chain. The present review examines various reports currently in the literature and quantifies waste levels and examines the trends in wastage for various food sectors such as fruit and vegetable, fisheries, meat and poultry, grain, milk, and dairy. Factors contributing to food waste, effective cost/benefit <b>food</b> waste <b>utilisation</b> methods, sustainability and environment considerations, and public acceptance are identified as hurdles in preventing large-scale food waste processing. Thus, we highlight the need for further research to identify and report food waste so that government regulators and food supply chain stakeholders can actively develop effective waste utilisation practices...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the spatial distribution and diet composition of Asplanchna species might be affected by the presence of aquatic macrophytes in 33 wetlands in South Korea. We estimated the densities of Asplanchna and other rotifer and crustacean, together with environmental parameters, in both vegetated and open water zones, from May to June 2011. In the present study, two species of Asplanchna, A. priodonta and A. herrickii, were observed and significantly more abundant in open water zones lacking macrophytes. In particular, the density of A. priodonta was higher than that of A. herrickii, and the density of A. priodonta was strongly positively correlated with the area of open water. In addition, gut content analysis was used to determine their dietary preferences, with the finding that there was apparent differentiation in <b>food</b> source <b>utilisation</b> between the two Asplanchna species; A. priodonta consumed some protozoa, phytoplankton, and exclusively pelagic rotifer, while A. herrickii consumed primarily Euglena. In particular, Keratella and Polyarthra were most commonly consumed by A. priodonta in open water. Macrophytes represent a suitable habitat for epiphytic rotifer but not for pelagic rotifer; this characteristic drives pelagic rotifer such as Asplanchna towards open water and may be responsible for the significant negative correlation that we observed between macrophyte and Asplanchna densities. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cultured salmon as escapees {{should never}} {{threaten}} salmon {{stocks in the}} wild {{as long as they}} are healthy and are not genetically manipulated. By studying a key digestive protease, trypsin, which is sensitive to environmental changes and influences on <b>food</b> <b>utilisation</b> and growth during the whole life cycle of Atlantic salmon, it is indicated that changes in the phenotypic expression of trypsin can be induced by temperature during egg incubation and the start-feeding period of the alevins. In addition, Atlantic salmon with the same trypsin phenotype showed different feed conversion efficiency and growth rate at different temperatures. Trypsin genes seem to be stable, and although the pattern of expressed genes varies extensively, the expression of trypsinogen mRNA is quantitatively similar between individual salmon in line with the observation that the total trypsin specific activity was similar between the fish with different trypsin phenotypes. However the luminal secretion of the active enzyme, and probably the relative amounts of trypsin isozymes, could be modified by water temperature and food quality. These results indicate that changes in the environmental condition can influence gene expressions of the fish at DNA, RNA and protein levels, regardless of genetic expression of parents. This means that whether the escapees or wild fish is the spawning population, an incidence of the offsprings to have their gene expressions adapted to that environment will be similar. It is the environmental condition that has to be conserved in order to control the genetic structure of animals in the wild. It is naive to think that genetically manipulated escapees such as triploid salmon will not have any impact on wild population, as they are not fertile. Under a more favourable condition for growth, triploid escapees could compete with wild fish on food availability as they have higher consumption rates for higher growth rates, unlike ordinary diploid salmon that could have better <b>food</b> <b>utilisation</b> at a similar consumption rate. This may cause a higher survival rate in triploid escapees and if they spawn, hatching success and survival rate of the offsprings will be low due to low gamete quality for reproduction in triploid fish. This could result in a smaller population of the new generation in that environment in the wild...|$|E

To assess the effects of allochthonous input on benthicmacrofaunalcommunities in estuarinesaltmarshes, we determined the source of substrate sediments and <b>food</b> resource <b>utilisation</b> patterns of benthic invertebrates in 2 temperate estuaries (the Tama River and the Obitsu River estuarine outlets into Tokyo Bay) by using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses. In the Tama River estuary, which has small patches of marsh vegetation upstream of the river mouth, there was an input of sedimentary organic matter from autochthonous sources (i. e. common reed and microphytobenthos). In the Obitsu River estuary saltmarsh, which is situated immediately upstream of the river mouth and is well connected to the sea, sediment consists of allochthonous sources (i. e. imported phytoplankton), along with microphytobenthos. Isotope analysis indicated that most benthic invertebrates in the Tama River estuary depend on benthic microalgae (autochthonous) as a food resource, whereas the macrofauna in the Obitsu River estuary are supported by drift macroalgae (allochthonous), in addition to microphytobenthos or phytoplankton. Our results indicated that allochthonousmaterial provides a food resource and potential habitat for benthic macrofauna in extensive saltmarshes that have a strong connection to the sea but is not substantial in smaller marshes with limited connectivity to coastal water...|$|R

Germination decreased starch content, with amylose being more degraded than amylopectin. In germinated grain, -amylase activity increased several-fold in all varieties, whereas -amylase activity did not increase uniformly and even decreased in some varieties. Activity of the key enzyme in phenolic biosynthesis, PAL, was detected in only half of the varieties before germination but in all of them after germination. PPO was not activated in germinated sorghum grains, whereas POX activity increased up to tenfold in some varieties. Zymography revealed that germination induced de novo synthesis of several POX isoenzymes, among which an anionic POX isoenzyme (pI 3. 1) was ubiquitously present. Amylase and phenolic enzyme activities could be correlated with grain and plant agronomic characteristics. The use of sorghum varieties for local dishes such as tô, dolo, couscous and thin porridge could be correlated with amylase and phenolic enzyme activities and the contents of their substrates.

40|$|A {{dramatic}} {{population growth}} is projected for the least developed {{countries of the world}} (United Nations 2013), which will also suffer disproportionally from ongoing and predicted climate disruptions (IPCC 2013). More frequently occurring extreme weather events have led to yield losses and decreasing cattle populations—aggravating an already precarious situation and leading to critical food shortages. Food security is a function of food availability, food accessibility, food stability and <b>food</b> <b>utilisation</b> (FAO 2002; Ziervogel and Ericksen 2010). Climate change and population growth are seen as key drivers of food insecurity severely affecting farming systems (Muller et al. 2011; Haberl et al. 2011, Strengers et al. 2010), as well as the global energy demand and therefore induced biofuel production (Von Braun 2007 a), changing trade patterns through liberalisation and globalisation (Von Braun 2007 b; Lotze-Campen et al. 2010), and the state of health of the population (10 – 20 % AIDS rate in East Africa). Cause–effect chains, in which food security is involved (droughts– diseases–health–human capital), are also drivers over large regions (Ziervogel and Ericksen 2010). Most of these drivers do not only lead to a productivity decline, but also often result in a degraded natural resource base and declining soil fertility (Graef et al. 2000).

This thesis presents different projects that aim to assess the potential of using commensal animals, such as the house mouse Mus musculus, the black rat Rattus rattus, and the Asian house gecko Hemidactylus frenatus, as proxies to infer pathways of human travel and trade. Commensal species are usually small animals, that live in close association with humans and opportunistically exploit their habitat and <b>food</b> sources. <b>Utilisation</b> of these new resources has led to a close relationship between humans and certain species, and thus favoured their global distribution due to translocations through humans. Therefore, genetic analyses from modern and museum samples of the species in question have been employed, and embedded in a phylogeographic approach. This integrative methodology connects genealogy and geography, with the aim to reconstruct evolutionary, demographic, and biogeographic processes that led to the contemporary distribution of genetic lineages of the commensal species and subsequently mirrors travel routes of the humans who carried them. The incorporation of ancient DNA analysis provides a powerful method, not only enabling the detection of source populations, but direct monitoring of their genetic change through time. Given that people have moved them around for a long time, undirected distribution pattern of populations were expected for each species. However, the results demonstrate that several unique and geographically restricted lineages have been identified, reflecting past human-mediated translocation throughout the Indian and Pacific Ocean from the 1 st millennium AD onwards...|$|R

One of the most prominent challenges commonly acknowledged by modern manufacturing industries is ‘how to produce more with fewer resources?’ Nowhere is this more true than in the food sector due to the recent concerns regarding the long-term availability and security of food products. The unique attributes of food products such as the need for fresh perishable ingredients, health risks associated with inappropriate production environment, stringent storage and distributions requirements together with relatively short post-production shelf-life makes their preparation, production and supply considerably different to other manufactured goods. Furthermore, the impacts of climate change on our ability to produce food, the rapidly increasing global population, as well as changes in demand and dietary behaviours both within developed and developing countries urgently demands a need {{to change the way we}} grow, manufacture and consume our food products. This paper dis-cusses a number of key research challenges facing modern food manufacturers, including improved productivity using fewer resources, valorisation of food waste, improving the resilience of food supply chains, localisation of <b>food</b> production, and <b>utilisation</b> of new sustainable sources of nutrition for provision of customised food products...|$|R
