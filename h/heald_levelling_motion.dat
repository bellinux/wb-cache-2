40|$|AbstractMotion {{in a part}} of {{the field}} induces motion in an {{adjoining}} region. In this study, it was investigated how the noise <b>level</b> affects induced <b>motion</b> of a counterphase flickering (target) grating due to adjacent drifting (inducer) gratings. It was shown that at low noise <b>levels,</b> <b>motion</b> contrast occurred, and at high noise <b>levels,</b> <b>motion</b> assimilation occurred. When the noise level was randomly set for each trial, the adaptive change with the noise level was also observed. The result suggests that the adaptive change occurs for a short period. It was also found that noise for the target as well as noise for the inducers contributes to the effect of noise on motion induction. It suggests that the overall noise level is crucial for the effect. The study provided evidence that motion integration changes from a spatially band-pass operation to a low-pass operation as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel region-based video coding {{technique}} using a multiscale image segmentation method thus obtaining better quality {{at the same}} bit rate. In most of the previous region-based video coding techniques, occlusion caused degradation {{in terms of both}} PSNR and perceptual video quality. We propose a new motion estimation and compensation algorithm which solves occlusion related problems effectively. The proposed motion estimation and compensation is a two stage procedure: the first stage uses U coarse motion model while the second stage uses a dense motion model. The coarse motion model generates region <b>level</b> <b>motion</b> vectors which are then fine tuned by the dense motion model which produces pixel <b>level</b> <b>motion</b> vectors. A fusion of these concepts leads to a gain of 2 N 3 dB in PSNR over the block-bused algorithm for a variety of test sequences using a fully functional video coder. ...|$|R

Such systems can attain micron <b>level</b> <b>motion</b> resolution and open-loop repeatability of 10 m. This paper outlines a optical sensing technique for Sawyer motors which is capable of sub-micron resolution. Such a sensor can easily be integrated into a motor enabling closed-loop control and sub-micron repeatability. ...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{automate}} {{the manual}} process {{performed by the}} technicians. We propose an integrated assembly and motion planning system which is done in both assembly <b>level</b> and <b>motion</b> <b>level.</b> In the assembly level, the system checks all combinations of the assembly sequences and gets a set of candidates. In the <b>motion</b> <b>level,</b> the system performs motion planning recursively for each candidate assembly sequence and finds the motions to manipulate the base object {{as well as to}} assemble the other object to the base.|$|R
