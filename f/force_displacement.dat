In some applications, mechanical amplification induced by nature or unintentional oversights in man-made designs can be disastrous. When employed appropriately, it can help to magnify small mechanical signals for practical applications.|$|E

As two solild bodies of the same material approach one another, they transition from conditions of non-contact to homogeneous bulk type behaviour. The varying values of stiffness and true contact area that is exhibited at an interface during this transition is dependent on conditions of applied pressure and is of notable importance {{for the study of}} systems involving the physical interactions of multiple bodies including granular matter, electrode contacts, and thermal contacts, where the interface-localized structures govern overall system performance.|$|E

40|$|Movement {{diagrams}} {{are used}} by physiotherapists to depict the behaviour of resistance through the available range of accessory and physiological joint movement. It is generally accepted that for an asymptomatic joint, the resistance first felt by the therapist (R 1) occurs {{towards the end of}} range. R 1 is considered to be at the transition point between the toe and linear region of a load displacement curve. The aim {{of this study was to}} more accurately define R 1 from <b>force</b> <b>displacement</b> curves of accessory movement to the spine and peripheral joints using a validated instrument, the Spinal Assessment Machine (SAM). Thirty archived <b>force</b> <b>displacement</b> curves obtained using the SAM, which applied a posteroanterior force of 100 N at a frequency of 0. 5 Hz to L 3 spinous process, were examined. In addition <b>force</b> <b>displacement</b> curves were similarly obtained from the tibiofemoral joint, glenohumeral joint and radiocarpal joint of one asymptomatic individual. In all cases resistance to a PA movement commenced at the beginning of range, the curve ascending as soon as the force was applied. While in most cases there was a low stiffness ‘toe’ region there was no unambiguous point where it could be said that the toe region ended. It is concluded that for spinal and peripheral accessory movements both the onset of resistance and the toe occurs at the beginning of range. Therapists should therefore depict R 1 at the beginning of range not toward the end of range as is current practice...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if a synthetic bone substitute would provide results similar to bone from osteoporotic femoral heads during in vitro testing with orthopaedic implants. If the synthetic material could produce results similar to those of the osteoporotic bone, it could reduce or eliminate the need for testing of implants on bone. MethodsPushout studies were performed with the dynamic hip screw (DHS) and the DHS Blade in both cadaveric femoral heads and artificial bone substitutes in the form of polyurethane foam blocks of different density. The pushout studies were performed as a means of comparing the <b>force</b> <b>displacement</b> curves produced by each implant within each material. ResultsThe results demonstrated that test material with a density of 0. 16 g/cm(3) (block A) produced qualitatively similar <b>force</b> <b>displacement</b> curves for the DHS and qualitatively and quantitatively similar <b>force</b> <b>displacement</b> curves for the DHS Blade, whereas the test material with a density of 0. 08 g/cm(3) (block B) did not produce results that were predictive of those recorded within the osteoporotic cadaveric femoral heads. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that synthetic material with a density of 0. 16 g/cm(3) can provide a good substitute for cadaveric osteoporotic femoral heads in the testing of implants. However we do recognise that no synthetic material can be considered as a definitive substitute for bone, therefore studies performed with artificial bone substrates may need to be validated by further testing with a small bone sample in order to produce conclusive results.

40|$|For {{reasons of}} energy saving and {{pollution}} reduction, {{there is a}} growing interest in the development of lightweight structures manufactured with materials of natural origin and recyclable. Agglomerated cork is a mixture of natural cork and an organic binder, and can be considered an alternative to polymeric foams used in structural applications with a high capacity of energy absorption. One of these applications involves impact-absorbing elements in vehicles, which are subjected mainly to dynamic compressive loads. In this work, the dynamic crushing behaviour of agglomerated cork was experimentally studied, analysing the influence of the specimen thickness on the energy-absorption capacity, contact <b>force,</b> <b>displacement,</b> and strain. Dynamic crushing tests with specimens of four different thicknesses were performed in a drop-weight tower. An increase in the maximum contact <b>force,</b> <b>displacement,</b> and strain was observed when the impact-energy/thickness ratio increased. For each specimen thickness a linear variation of the maximum displacement and energy absorbed with the impact-energy/thickness ratio was found.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the human chest {{exhibits}} a strong <b>force</b> <b>displacement</b> hysteresis during CPR, a stark contrast to the non hysteretic behavior of standard spring manikins. We hypothesize that individuals with experience performing CPR on humans would perceive a manikin with damping as more realistic and better for training. By analyzing data collected from chest compressions on real patients, we created a dynamic model that accounts for this hysteresis with a linear spring and a one-way variable damper, and we built a new high-fidelity manikin to enact the desired <b>force</b> <b>displacement</b> relationship. A linkage attached to the chest plate converts vertical compression motions to the horizontal displacement of a set of pneumatic dashpot pistons, sending a volume of air {{into and out of the}} manikin through a programmable valve. Position and pressure sensors allow a microcontroller to adjust the valve orifice so that the provided damping force closely follows the desired damping force throughout the compression cycle. Eight experienced CPR practitioners tested both the new manikin and an identical looking standard manikin; the manikin with damping received significantly higher ratings for haptic realism and perceived utility as a training tool...|$|E

30|$|Dissemination of IHL {{guidelines}} on <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> and illegal appropriation through <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> to key stakeholder groups: Contemporary {{research and the}} issues which this paper raises suggest that the humanitarian approach to <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> needs to be revaluated. The issues raised in this paper, if disseminated widely, may contribute to an improved approach to reducing civilian vulnerability to <b>forced</b> <b>displacement.</b> The existing guidebooks or manuals on <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> inadequately address the issues raised in this paper. The majority of publications on <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> from {{agencies such as the}} ICRC, UNHCR, IASC, and NRC, are concerned with the protection of IDPs, and refugees, post displacement. These publications and normative frameworks, in addition, contain numerous issues which constitute gaps for protection actors attempting to reduce vulnerability to the act of <b>forced</b> <b>displacement.</b> In the Handbook for the Protection of Internally Displaced Persons (PCWG 2007), for example, we see the following question: ‘Is forcible displacement an offence that is prosecuted and are all actors aware that arbitrary displacement is unlawful?’ This question contradicts itself as forcible displacement is not always an offence, as the phrase then implies by indicating that only arbitrary displacement is unlawful. Normative frameworks, furthermore, while providing important legal protection to IDPs and refugees, provide little assistance to protection actors trying to reduce vulnerability to <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> or HLP pillage through <b>forced</b> <b>displacement.</b> The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement principle 6 (1) and the Pinheiro Principles 5 (1) use the term ‘(…) right to be protected against being arbitrarily displaced’ without a clear explanation that indicates ‘arbitrary’ here implies when the exceptions of military necessity or civilian security are inapplicable. The principle objective of the recommended IHL guidelines would be to clarify in simple terms, for all stakeholders, when <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> is illegal and when <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> becomes illegal appropriation. The guidelines might contain, for example, a chapter aimed at armed parties including a section on the responsibility to evacuate civilians whose security is compromised by imperative military operations. In addition, include a section to provide instruction on how to carry out a legal evacuation/forced displacement (i.e. to agree host community support for IDPs, facilitate return, and to respect civilian objects). The guidelines, furthermore, should give clear instruction on ‘ordering’ and clarify who is responsible if <b>forced</b> <b>displacements</b> do take place.|$|R

30|$|Regarding {{the point}} at which <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> becomes pillage, the time factor is {{significant}} in the findings. There is, for example, allowance for <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> due to civilian security or military necessity. Therefore, time to establish that a particular <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> is illegal is required. Nonetheless, if dispossession is the obvious intention, and the <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> is clearly illegal, then immediately establishing pillage may be possible. What if the crime is carried out extemporaneously, however, and the <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> was not obviously illegal? Consequentially, therefore, establishing the exact point at which displacement becomes pillage should be done from the moment at which military engagement that affects the security of civilians has ended. The first element is if voluntary return is not facilitated within a reasonable timescale contingent on the time required for return (e.g. 3  months). Thereafter, if parties occupy or profit from the HLP required by the civilians to survive or remain at origin, pillage can be considered to have taken place.|$|R

30|$|The {{development}} of Humanitarian Protection strategy {{with a focus}} on <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> and HLP pillage: This paper does not concern the design of humanitarian protection strategy to address <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> or HLP pillage. Furthermore, the research for this paper has established that, beyond engaging armed parties on their obligations under IHL, humanitarian experience in protecting civilians from illegal <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> or HLP pillage is limited (Zapater 2010). Therefore, this paper is appealing to protection specialists and humanitarian academics to research and develop humanitarian protection strategy on <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> which may be applied in the field. The research for this article suggests that protection practitioners may consider incorporating the following actions in humanitarian protection strategies on <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> and illegal appropriation through forced displacement: (a) continuous contextual risk analysis with particular focus on stakeholder motives needs and objectives and increasing engagement with armed actors; (b) identify or carry out contextually relevant research or data collection to identify root causes and factors which deter <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> and HLP pillage; (c) conduct community protection meetings and mapping to identify community coping mechanisms, risk areas, local protection structures, and to reinforce deterrence factors; (d) facilitate HLP registration through formal systems or informal methods to provide documentary evidence of legal presence on HLP; and (e) engage with armed parties and other stakeholders on community protection issues, provide training in IHL, and facilitate the creation of agreement documents on <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> and HLP pillage.|$|R

30|$|The {{immediate}} {{problems that}} this causes for civilians themselves, humanitarians, or other protection actors, attempting {{to apply the}} law in practice, to reduce civilian vulnerability to <b>forced</b> <b>displacement,</b> is self-explanatory.

If there is, moreover, a current perception that military necessity excludes <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> as a crime, especially in the current climate of counter-terrorism, legal ambiguity may even encourage its practice (VDC 2015). It is important to recognize, furthermore, that it is those responsible for ‘ordering’ <b>forced</b> <b>displacement,</b> not those at risk, or those enforcing the law, or even Humanitarians, who decide if a <b>forced</b> <b>displacement</b> is justified, for imperative military reasons or civilian security in real time.

Setting: Male and female recruits from a start-to-run (STR) program during a 10 -week training period. Participants: One hundred thirty one healthy subjects (20 men and 111 women), without a history of any lower-leg complaint, participated in the study. Interventions: Before {{the start of the}} 10 -week STR program, plantar force measurements during running were performed. During STR, lower leg injuries were diagnosed and registered by a sports physician. Main outcome measurements: Plantar force measurements during running were performed using a footscan pressure plate (RsScan International). Results: During the STR, 27 subjects (5 male and 22 female) developed a LLOI. Logistic regression analysis revealed that subjects who developed a LLOI had a significantly more laterally directed force distribution at first metatarsal contact and forefoot flat, a more laterally directed <b>force</b> <b>displacement</b> in the forefoot contact phase, foot flat phase and at heel-off. These subjects also had a delayed change of the center of force (COF) at forefoot flat, a higher force and loading underneath the lateral border of the foot, and a significantly higher directed <b>force</b> <b>displacement</b> of the COF at forefoot flat. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a less pronated heel strike and a more laterally directed roll-off can be considered as {{risk factors for}} LLOI.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{relationship}} between vertical stiffness, leg stiffness and maximal sprint speed in a large cohort of 11 - 16 -year-old boys. Three-hundred and thirty-six boys undertook a 30 m sprint test using a floor-level optical measurement system, positioned in the final 15 m section. Measures of speed, step length, step frequency, contact time and flight time were directly measured whilst <b>force,</b> <b>displacement,</b> vertical stiffness and leg stiffness, were modeled from contact and flight times, from the two fastest consecutive steps for each participant over two trials. All <b>force,</b> <b>displacement</b> and stiffness variables were significantly correlated with maximal sprint speed (p 0. 7) relationship with sprint speed, while vertical center of mass displacement, absolute vertical stiffness, relative peak force, and maximal leg spring displacement had large (r > 0. 5) relationships. Relative vertical stiffness and relative peak force did not significantly change with advancing age (p > 0. 05), but together with maximal leg spring displacement accounted for 96 % of the variance in maximal speed. It appears that relative vertical stiffness and relative peak force are important determinants of sprint speed in boys aged 11 - 16 years, but are qualities that may need to be trained due to no apparent increases from natural development. Practitioners may wish to utilize training modalities such as plyometrics and resistance training to enable adaptation to these qualities due to their importance as predictors of speed in youth...|$|E
