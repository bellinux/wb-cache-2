The school has raised awareness by holding cake sales, fundraising events and holding a [...] "Green Week", which involved students paying a donation and dressing in green. The money raised has <b>gone</b> towards <b>green</b> <b>projects,</b> such as double glazing, insulation and, most notably, a wind turbine, which feeds energy into the National Grid, who then subsidise the school's energy bill.Currently, the school holds the three Eco Schools awards, bronze, silver and has earned green in recognition of its efforts.|$|R
