50|$|In {{the latter}} case, the {{goldsmith}} {{will use a}} variety of tools and machinery, including the rolling mill, the <b>drawplate,</b> and perhaps, swage blocks and other forming tools to make the metal into shapes needed to build the intended piece. Then parts are fabricated through a wide variety of processes and assembled by soldering. It {{is a testament to the}} history and evolution of the trade that those skills have reached an extremely high level of attainment and skill over time. A fine goldsmith can and will work to a tolerance approaching that of precision machinery, but largely using only his eyes and hand tools. Quite often the goldsmith's job involves the making of mountings for gemstones, in which case they often are referred to as jewelers.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{it is made}} of metal, wire {{has this}} same {{hardness}} property. Most modern manufacturers of jewelry wire make the wire with a defined hardness, generally a hardness of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Historically, these numbers {{were associated with the}} number of times that the wire was pulled through a draw plate, becoming harder or stiffer each time it was drawn through the <b>drawplate.</b> A hardness of 0 meant that the wire had been drawn through only once and was as soft and as pliable as possible. A hardness of 4 meant that the wire had been drawn through five or more times and the wire was as stiff and as hard as possible. Most jewelry wire that is sold now is designated dead soft, half-hard, or hard, where dead soft is wire that is manufactured with a hardness of 0, half-hard is wire manufactured with a hardness of 2, and fully hardened wire is wire with a hardness of 4.|$|E
40|$|Fibre-reinforced tubes {{made of a}} {{thermoplastics}} material {{are manufactured}} using a method of extruding thermoplastics material in a <b>drawplate</b> with a diverging end zone, the end zone of which has a diverging annular flow space which has a ratio A. sub. s /A. sub. e between the exit area and entry area of at least 1. 2, and a ratio between the length 1 of the lower edge of the annular exit space of the diverging zone and the width e of the straight section of said annular space which is less than 5; the extrusion operation being {{carried out in the}} presence of a liquid lubricant which is incompatible with said thermoplastics material at extrusion temperatures, said lubricant being present at the level of the external wall and at the level of the internal wall of said flow space. Tubes which are manufactured by way of this method are particularly resistant to a high degree of bursting and have an improved surface quality...|$|E
500|$|The Tjele {{fragment}} {{was discovered}} amidst a 10th century collection of smith's tools in 1850, but its significance was not understood until 1984. Originally discovered by a farmer planting saplings by Tjele Manor, between Viborg and Randers, it {{was sent by}} the manor's owner to the National Museum of Denmark, where it remains today. In 1858 the collection of tools—two anvils, five hammers, three pairs of tongs, a pair of plate shears, two files, a chisel, two <b>drawplates,</b> two foundry ladles, a whetstone, a set of balance scales with ten weights, five sickles, a key, three iron nails, an axe, two jingles, a spearhead, bronze wires, fragments of bronze and iron, {{and the remains of}} a casket—was published, but the helmet fragment passed over as a saddle mounting. After leading [...] "an unnoticed existence" [...] for some 130 years despite being on display, the fragment was finally recognized as the remainder of a helmet by Elisabeth Munksgaard, the assistant keeper at the museum's Department of the Prehistory of Denmark. Publishing her realisation in 1984, she noted that [...] "the best finds are often made not in the field, but in the museums." ...|$|R
