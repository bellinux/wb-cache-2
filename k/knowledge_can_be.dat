25|$|Henriques further {{argues that}} {{developing}} {{such a system}} for integrating knowledge {{is not just an}} academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of <b>knowledge</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen {{as one of the most}} pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.|$|E
25|$|To begin with, Kant's {{distinction}} between the a posteriori being contingent and particular knowledge, and the a priori being universal and necessary knowledge, must be kept in mind. For if we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the knowledge is always subjective because it is derived a posteriori, when what is desired is for the knowledge to be objective, that is, for the two intuitions {{to refer to the}} object and hold good of it necessarily universally for anyone at any time, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition. What else is equivalent to objective knowledge besides the a priori, that is to say, universal and necessary knowledge? Nothing else, and hence before <b>knowledge</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> objective, it must be incorporated under an a priori category of the understanding.|$|E

At the meeting, Jack informs them {{that the end of the}} world is nigh, due to a zero-point field (the 'Dark Sun') entering our solar system, which could destroy the entire world. However, in order to save the world, the 'Machine' must be rebuilt by placing six oblong diamond pillars in their respective locations around the globe. However, almost nothing is known about the Machine, but the <b>knowledge</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found using the Six Sacred Stones - the Philosopher's Stone, the Altar Stone at Stonehenge, The Twin Tablets of Thutmosis, The Seeing Stone of Delphi, the Killing Stone of the Maya, and the Basin of Ramses II.

2500|$|Also in the [...] "Ethics", Spinoza {{discusses}} {{his beliefs}} {{about what he}} considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions.

2500|$|Julien-Joseph Virey used Sarah Baartman's {{published}} {{image to}} validate racial typologies. In his essay, [...] "Dictionnaire des sciences medicales" [...] (Dictionary of medical sciences), he summarizes {{the true nature}} of the black female within the framework of accepted medical discourse. Virey focused on identifying her sexual organs as more developed and distinct in comparison to white female organs. All of his theories regarding sexual primitivism are influenced and supported by the anatomical studies and illustrations of Sarah Baartman which were created by Georges Cuvier. In cartoons and drawings Baartman's features were often exaggerated to highlight her difference from European females. This social construction of visual imagery likely amplified and reinforced racist perspectives. Little of this <b>knowledge</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> considered completely factual as most knowledge of Baartman is not extrapolated from diverse sources of documentation.|$|E
