A newfound sense of patriotism had the {{administration}} require students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance as an <b>entrance</b> <b>requirement</b> to the school. The war also {{had an effect on}} enrollment as all of the male students gradually left the school to join the war efforts; in 1916 there were 421 total students, 382 in 1917, 172 in 1918 (including only one male student), and in 1919, 147 students. In addition to the students, some of the faculty members joined the military. Due to the decreased student enrollment, the remaining faculty had the opportunity to further their own training. On campus, both students and faculty worked with the Red Cross, organized bond drives, and sent packages to troops overseas.|$|E

2500|$|In 1941 Bruun {{escaped from}} German-occupied Norway to neutral Sweden. In a three-month journey, {{he made his}} way from Sweden to the Soviet Union, passing through Moscow and Baku on his way to India, then {{travelling}} through the United States before making the final stretch from New York City to the United Kingdom. After making his way to the United Kingdom, Bruun joined the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile. From 1941 to 1942 he commanded the Royal Norwegian Navy's training unit at Port Edgar in Scotland. In 1942 he was promoted to the rank of commander, and from February that year headed the [...] – the unit responsible for training enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officers for the Royal Norwegian Navy. Starting on 18 June 1943 he also commanded the exiled Royal Norwegian Naval Academy. Part of Bruun's job as head of the Sjømilitære korps in exile was to formalize and bring order to the improvized system of recruitment employed by low-level commanders up until that point. Each warship commander had in the early phase of the Royal Norwegian Navy's time in exile personally recruited and employed crew members for his ship. At the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy, which had been re-established in the United Kingdom in January 1943, Bruun {{played a central role in}} adapting the academy to the conditions of war and exile. The academy's curriculum changed, with an increased focus on practical training. On Bruun's initiative, the academy in 1944 replaced its old <b>entrance</b> <b>requirement</b> for cadets to a new one adapted to the conditions of exile in the United Kingdom. While the old requirements had included secondary education and prior service in the merchant navy, the new ones required Examen artium qualifications in science and mathematics. The reform was motivated by a lack of potential cadets with a background in the merchant navy, combined with an ample supply of university students amongst Norwegian refugees who had made their way to neutral Sweden. One Norwegian naval cadet who joined the Royal Norwegian Navy in the United Kingdom in August 1941 described Bruun as having an informal and encouraging way of interacting with lower ranking naval personnel, instilling in the cadet [...] "a feeling of security" [...] as well as [...] "eagerness and a go-ahead spirit".|$|E
