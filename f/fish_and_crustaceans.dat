5|$|St Kilda {{is part of}} {{a nursery}} area for many of the commercially {{important}} <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans</b> in South Australian including King George whiting, western king prawns and blue swimmer crabs. There are brown snakes and skinks in dense bushes {{along the top of the}} embankments.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans</b> {{seem to find}} brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times more often than they did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was scarce. In waters where food is scarce, the snail Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, snails, tube worms, and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} starfish, {{including}} Valvatida and Forcipulatida, possess pedicellariae. In Forcipulatida, such as Asterias and Pisaster, they occur in pompom-like tufts {{at the base}} of each spine, whereas in the Goniasteridae, such as Hippasteria phrygiana, the pedicellariae are scattered over the body surface. Some are thought to assist in defence, while others aid in feeding or in the removal of organisms attempting to settle on the starfish's surface. Some species like Labidiaster annulatus, Rathbunaster californicus and Novodinia antillensis use their large pedicellariae to capture small <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans.</b>|$|E

5|$|The venom {{is a mix}} of toxins, {{including}} neurotoxins, that paralyzes {{the prey}} so the anemone can move it to the mouth for digestion inside the gastrovascular cavity. Actinotoxins are highly toxic to prey species of <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> However, Amphiprioninae (clownfish), small banded fish in various colours, are not affected by their host anemone's sting and shelter themselves from predators among its tentacles. Several other species have similar adaptions and are also unaffected (see Symbiotic relationships). Most sea anemones are harmless to humans, but a few highly toxic species (notably Actinodendron arboreum, Phyllodiscus semoni and Stichodactyla spp.) have caused severe injuries and are potentially lethal.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{live only in}} the sea, {{and most}} species avoid {{locations}} with strong currents or waves. The larvae of articulate species settle in quickly and form dense populations in well-defined areas while the larvae of inarticulate species swim {{for up to a}} month and have wide ranges. Brachiopods now live mainly in cold water and low light. <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans</b> seem to find brachiopod flesh distasteful and seldom attack them. Among brachiopods, only the lingulids (Lingula sp.) have been fished commercially, on a very small scale. One brachiopod species (Coptothyrus adamsi) may be a measure of environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an {{estimated}} 45million people were {{infected with the}} beef tapeworm Taenia saginata and 3million with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of T. solium larvae into {{the central nervous system}} is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. In 2000, about 39 million people were infected with trematodes (flukes) that naturally parasitize <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans,</b> but can pass to humans who eat raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, megaloblastic anemia.|$|E

5|$|This ray can be {{identified}} by its dark dorsal surface covered in white spots or rings. Near {{the base of the}} ray's relatively long tail, just behind the pelvic fins, are several venomous, barbed stingers. Spotted eagle rays commonly feed on small <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans,</b> and will sometimes dig with their snouts to look for food buried in the sand of the sea bed. These rays are commonly observed leaping out of the water, and on at least two occasions have been reported as having jumped into boats, in one incident resulting in the death of a woman in the Florida Keys. The spotted eagle ray is hunted by a wide variety of sharks. The rays are considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List. They are fished mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa, the most common market being in commercial trade and aquariums. They are protected in the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E
5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, paneling, doors and staircase banisters. When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies is one that has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs of shoes were observed lying next to each other on the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E
25|$|The Seagrass {{found in}} the Estuaries, (Zostera capricorni), is an {{important}} habitat for many <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans</b> including dugongs and green turtles. They {{play a crucial role}} the nutrient and carbon cycle as well as trap sediment and filter coastal water. These process are vital to the local ecosystem.

50|$|From cysts, brine shrimp nauplii {{can readily}} {{be used to}} feed to <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustacean</b> larvae just after one-day incubation. Instar I (the nauplii that just hatched and with large yolk {{reserves}} in their body) and instar II nauplii (the nauplii after first moult and with functional digestive tracts) are more widely used in aquaculture, for the reasons they are easy for operation, nutrients rich, and of small size which makes them suitable for feeding <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustacean</b> larvae live or after drying.|$|R
25|$|Myotis vivesi, the {{fish-eating}} bat or fish-eating myotis, is {{a species}} of bat that lives around the Gulf of California, and feeds on <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> It is the largest species of the genus Myotis in the Americas, and has exceptionally large feet, which it uses in hunting. It was described in 1901 by Auguste Ménégaux {{and is the only}} species in the subgenus (or genus) Pizonyx.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that water birds comprise about 60% of the cat's diet with black rats being its secondary source of food at about 10–30% of its diet. Based on stool samples, birds represent 60% of their diet, black rats 30%, insects 30%, lizards and frogs about 15–20%, bats 3–17%, and wild pig less than 1%. In addition, <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans</b> appear roughly 3–4% of the time.|$|E
25|$|Most importantly, reefs recycle nutrients, {{which happens}} much {{less in the}} open ocean. In coral reefs and lagoons, {{producers}} include phytoplankton, as well as seaweed and coralline algae, especially small types called turf algae, which pass nutrients to corals. The phytoplankton are eaten by <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans,</b> who also pass nutrients along the food web. Recycling ensures fewer nutrients are needed overall to support the community.|$|E

25|$|The establishment, in 1975, of the Castro Marim and Vila Real de Santo António Marsh Natural Reserve {{provided}} {{a refuge for}} several species of migratory and marine birds, namely mallards, flamingos, Kentish plovers, little terns, pied avocets, dunlins, stilts, white storks, and spoonbills, {{while at the same}} time protecting breeding grounds for local <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> Chameleons, oysters, and jellyfish (of the genus Rhopilema) are among the species that can be found in the region and its coastal waters, while Carob trees, gum rockrose, brooms and almond trees mingle within the forests and brush within the interior.|$|E
25|$|Other {{villages and}} {{settlements}} include Cemaes, Pentraeth, Gaerwen, Dwyran, Bodedern, Malltraeth and Rhosneigr. The Anglesey Sea Zoo {{is a local}} tourist attraction, providing a descriptive look at local marine wildlife from common lobsters to congers. All the <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans</b> on display are caught around the island and placed in reconstructions of their natural habitat. The Anglesey Sea Zoo also breed commercially lobsters, for food, and oysters, for pearls, both from local stocks. Sea salt (Halen Môn, evaporated from the local sea water), now produced in a modern facility nearby, was formerly produced at the Sea Zoo site.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} the Artemia to produce dormant eggs, known as cysts, has led to {{extensive}} use of Artemia in aquaculture. The cysts may be stored for long periods and hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for larval <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> Nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia constitute {{the most widely used}} food item, and over 2000 tonnes of dry Artemia cysts are marketed worldwide annually. In addition, the resilience of Artemia makes them ideal animals for running biological toxicity assays and it has become a model organism used to test the toxicity of chemicals. Breeds of Artemia are sold as novelty gifts under the marketing name Sea-Monkeys or Aqua Dragons.|$|E

40|$|Semi-intensive farming systems {{account for}} about 70 % of <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustacean</b> {{aquaculture}} production in the tropics, employing semi-intensive feeding methods ranging {{from the use of}} low-cost pond fertilization techniques to high-cost complete diet feeding strategies. The paper reviews the major feeding methods employed within semi-intensive farming systems, and emphasizes the importance of natural food organisms in the nutritional budget of pond-raised <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> shrimp. It also discusses the need of the aquaculture sector to reduce farm production costs through the use of improved feed formulation and on-farm feeds and new methodological approaches towards <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustacean</b> nutrition research within semiintensive pond farming systems...|$|R
25|$|An average 1200 tonnes of <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans</b> are {{harvested}} annually, of which prawns constitute 60%, followed by mullets. Seafood exports {{of white and}} tiger prawns, jellyfish, finfish and live lagoon green crabs are also economic benefits from the lagoon. 168 total fish species are reported. The frequently found ones are the mullets: M. cunnesius, M. jerdoni, M. dussumieri, M. cephalus, M. bornensis and blowfish T. nigropunctatus, T. leopardus, Barbus dorsalis, catfish Macrones vittatus, sardines, Sardinella fimbriata and milk fish. Finfish, green crabs, clams and prawns are the most commercially exploited fishes of the lagoon. Endangered green sea turtles are found on the beaches of Sriharikota beach. Apart from prawns, salt is also produced from the lagoon.|$|E
25|$|Nylon {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to abrasion and degradation, hence the netting {{has the potential}} to last for many years if it is not recovered. This ghost fishing is of environmental concern. Attaching the gillnet floats with biodegradable material can reduce the problem. However it is difficult to generalize about the longevity of ghost-fishing gillnets due to the varying environments in which they are used. Some researchers have found gill-nets still catching <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans</b> over a year after loss, while others have found lost nets destroyed by wave action within one month or overgrown with seaweeds, increasing their visibility and reducing their catching potential {{to such an extent that}} they became a microhabitat used by small fish.|$|E
25|$|Green {{sea turtles}} play an {{essential}} role within the ecosystem in which they live. In the seagrass beds, the turtles feed on the seagrass by trimming only the top and leaving {{the roots of the}} plant. Through their feeding technique, the turtles help to improve the health and growth of the seagrass beds. The healthy seagrass beds that the turtles provide give habitat and feeding grounds for many species of <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> On the nesting beaches, the green sea turtles provide key nutrients for the ecosystem through their hatched egg shells. In their coral reef habitat, the green sea turtles have a symbiotic interaction with reef fish, including the yellow tang. The yellow tang fish swims along with the turtle and feeds on the algae, barnacles, and parasites on its shell and flippers. This species interaction provides food for the yellow tang and provides a necessary cleaning and smoothing of the turtle’s shell. This cleaning helps the turtle swim by reducing the amount of drag and improves their health.|$|E
