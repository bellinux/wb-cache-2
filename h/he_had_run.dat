5|$|Ross's biggest {{contribution}} to his field was not through his research, but through his mathematics education programs. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> {{each of his}} summer programs from 1957 to 2000, working with over 2,000 students. His summer program graduates found roles in prestigious research positions in fields across the sciences. The Ross Program was acclaimed by mathematicians as highly influential.|$|E
5|$|Although Aucouturier had {{abandoned}} in the first stage, and so was not eligible for the general classification, he could still start {{the rest of the}} stages. In the second stage, Aucouturier was able to win the sprint. In the third stage, the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one hour earlier than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. At the end of that stage, a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugène Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> the course 33 minutes faster, so he was declared the winner of the stage. Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in the second stage, which eliminated him from the race.|$|E
5|$|At the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods {{on both sides of}} the road between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, both of which were repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> out of artillery ammunition. The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwies, successfully taking it, but they were unable to hold it in the night, and subsequently fell back.|$|E

5|$|Party Politics, {{who won the}} 1992 Grand National with partner Carl Llewellyn, {{was also}} pulled up after the water jump when in a good position. Since his Aintree victory the {{previous}} April <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> unimpressively in two chases without Llewellyn in the saddle before they were reunited to win the Greenhalls Gold Cup at Haydock in February. As defending champion, and with his jockey taking his fourth ride in a Grand National, the horse was popular with the public who had backed him down to 7/1 favourite at the start.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's winning time of 1: {{and last}} quarter mile in 23 seconds were both {{records for the}} Derby. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> each quarter-mile faster than before, with times of , 24, , , and 23 seconds. Sham {{maintained}} his stride and crossed the line in second place, eight lengths ahead of third-place finisher Our Native, who had lost ground on the final turn into the homestretch. Sham also broke the previous course record {{with a time of}} 1:. Shecky Greene, who led for most of the race, finished in sixth position.|$|E
5|$|A return {{match against}} Surrey began on Thursday, 29 August, at Clifton College Close Ground and Gloucestershire were {{fortunate}} {{to get a}} draw after being forced to follow on. For once this season, Grace struggled to take wickets and could manage only 1–86 in Surrey's total of 232 which was made over two days because of rain. Gloucestershire struggled to 84–9 at the close on Friday, Grace out for 3, and were immediately dismissed for 84 on Saturday. Grace was out for 25 in the second innings but Fred again {{came to the rescue}} with 63 as Gloucestershire held on for the draw, scoring 161–4. An oft-recounted incident involving Grace occurred in this match. While he was batting, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> three when a fielder's throw caused the ball to lodge in his shirt and he seized the opportunity to complete several runs before the fielders forced him to stop. He disingenuously claimed that he would have been out handled the ball if he had removed it and, following a discussion, the umpires agreed that only the initial three runs should be awarded as the ball was dead (out of play) when it went into his shirt.|$|E

5|$|Chambers began 2014 by {{finishing}} {{second in}} the 60 m at the British Indoor Championships, before going on to finish sixth in the 60 m final at the World Indoor Championships {{in a time of}} 6.52s. This was the fastest time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> the 60m in since 2010. In his first three 100 m races of the outdoor season he failed to break 10.20, before hitting form during the British Championships. Going into the event, he was only ranked 10th in the UK, but he won the 100 m final, defeating Chijindu Ujah, who had broken 10 seconds three weeks earlier. Chambers' victory guaranteed him selection for the European Championships as his winning time was 10.12 secs, inside the European qualifying mark of 10.20. This was his fifth consecutive win at the British Championships.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 1942, Marseille {{claimed his}} 100th aerial victory. He was the 11th Luftwaffe pilot {{to achieve the}} century mark. Marseille then {{returned}} to Germany for two months leave and the following day was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. On 6 August, he began his journey back to North Africa accompanied by his fiancée Hanne-Lies Küpper. On 13 August, he met Benito Mussolini in Rome and was presented with the highest Italian military award for bravery, the Medaglia d'Oro al Valor Militare. While in Italy Marseille disappeared for some time prompting the German authorities to compile a missing persons report, submitted by the Gestapo head in Rome, Herbert Kappler. He was finally located. According to rumours <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> off with an Italian girl and was eventually persuaded {{to return to his}} unit. Unusually, nothing was ever said about the incident and no repercussions were visited upon Marseille for this indiscretion.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of this, Hugh DeWitt, a {{physicist}} at the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratory, forwarded a copy to Chuck Hansen. Hansen was a computer programmer from Mountain View, California, who collected information about nuclear weapons as a hobby. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> a competition to design an H-bomb, the winner {{of which would be}} the first person to have their design classified by the DOE. It now began to occur to him that his hobby might not be legal. On August 27, He wrote a letter to Senator Charles H. Percy detailing how much information he had deduced from publicly available sources. This included his own design, one not as good as Morland's, which Hansen had not seen. Hansen further charged that government scientists—including Edward Teller, Ted Taylor, and George Rathjens—had leaked sensitive information about thermonuclear weapons, for which no action had been taken. In this, Hansen was mistaken: Taylor had indeed been reprimanded, and Teller was not the source of the information that Hansen attributed to him. Hansen made copies of his letter available to several newspapers.|$|E

5|$|While {{maintaining}} a cordon between the Austrian forces approaching from Switzerland, under command of Baron von Hotze, most of Ferino's division {{participated in a}} simultaneous assault in the first hours of the engagement at Stockach. With part of Joseph Souham's Center (the II. Division of the Army of the Danube), they assaulted the Austrian left, but were stopped by overwhelming numbers. Ferino tried to attack again, initiating his assault with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods {{on both sides of}} the road between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, both of which were repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond, because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> out of artillery ammunition, but his troops fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwiess, capturing it despite the heavy fire and massive numbers. They were forced to relinquish the village at darkness.|$|E
5|$|Another early roguelike whose {{development}} pre-dated Rogue was Sword of Fargoal (1982), {{developed by}} Jeff McCord starting in 1979. The game {{was based on}} GammaQuest, an earlier title McCord had created on the Commodore PET which he shared locally with friends while a student at Henry Clay High School in Kentucky; the game itself {{was based on a}} Dungeons & Dragons campaign <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> himself in the prior years. Before graduating and attending the University of Tennessee in 1981, he had started work on GammaQuest II, which required the player to navigate through randomly generated dungeon levels, acquire a sword, and make it back to the surface with that sword through more randomly generated levels. The more advanced computers available at the school, such as the Commodore VIC-20, enabled him to expand out the game further from the highly limited memory on the PET. On seeing the prospects of selling computer software, he eventually got a publication deal with Epyx, where they helped him to refine the marketing of the game, renaming it Sword of Fargoal, and giving him access to the more powerful Commodore 64, enabling him to use graphics and sound as part of the game. The game was considered a success, and when it was ported to the PC in 1983, it out-shone Rogues PC release the same year due to Sword of Fargoals superior graphics and sound.|$|E

25|$|Her husband's death netted Gunness another $3,000 (some {{sources say}} $4,000; value of about $65,200 and $87,500 in 2012, respectively). Local people {{refused to believe}} that her husband could be so clumsy; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> a hog farm on the {{property}} and {{was known to be}} an experienced butcher; the district coroner reviewed the case and unequivocally announced that he had been murdered.

25|$|The {{view of the}} German police {{was that}} Duggan had arrived at that stretch of road after running 5km from the apartment.

Other allegations included that he had spent the night at the nearby LaRouche offices and ran from there to the road, and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> onto the road from a car. Forensic reports commissioned by Erica Duggan suggested that he may have died elsewhere and been moved onto the road after the fact, a position the coroner rejected in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Though George's 4:12¾ was impressive, he ran {{some time}} trials in 1885 which were truly remarkable. In the first, {{two weeks before}} his {{professional}} debut against Cummings, he ran a 4:14½. Then, in Surbiton several days before the big race, he ran against some local runners with handicaps. His splits were 58, 1:58 and 3:07. He finished in a startling 4:10. Not believing their watches, the track was immediately measured. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>run</b> six yards too far.
