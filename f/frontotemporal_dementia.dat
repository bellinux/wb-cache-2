Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, <b>frontotemporal</b> <b>dementia,</b> and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
5|$|In October 1932, Ravel {{suffered}} {{a blow to}} the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested <b>frontotemporal</b> <b>dementia,</b> Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.|$|E

Lloyd Objectives: Single photon {{emission}} computerised tomography (SPECT) studies allow {{the assessment of}} cerebral blood flow and have been increasingly used as a clinical tool in neurology and neuropsychiatry. This paper examines the contribution of SPECT to the clinical management of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular patients with atypical or early onset dementia. Method: All patients admitted to an eight-bed neuropsychiatry unit in a general hos-pital setting who had undergone SPECT scanning over a 15 -month period were reviewed. Information was collected on clinical diagnosis, neuropsychological testing, structural neuroimaging and SPECT. Results: SPECT abnormalities were present in 88 % of patients. The pattern of SPECT abnormality was concordant with structural neuroimaging in 65 % of patients and concordant with neuropsychological testing in 82 % of patients. The sensitivity and specificity of SPECT was 89 %/ 79 % for Alzheimer’s disease and 56 %/ 79 % for <b>frontotemporal</b> <b>dementias.</b> Conclusions: SPECT results must be interpreted {{in the context of}} other clinical and diagnostic assessments. In no single case was the clinical diagnosis made {{solely on the basis of}} a SPECT result. SPECT was of maximum clinical use in the diagnosis of <b>frontotemporal</b> <b>dementias</b> and in confirming the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s demen-tia.

Due to their biophysical properties, soluble amyloid oligomers can adopt multiple conformations and sizes that potentially confer differential biological activities. Therein lies the problem: with sporadic knowledge and limited tools to identify, characterize, and study amyloid oligomers, how can we solve the enigma of their respective role(s) in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders?

Over time, some patients develop a more generalized dementia. Four clinical subtypes characterize the predominant presentations of this illness: behavioral or frontal variant FTD, progressive nonfluent aphasia, semantic dementia, and logopenic primary progressive aphasia. These clinical variants correlate with regional patterns of atrophy on brain imaging studies such as MRI and PET scanning, as well as with biochemical and molecular genetic variants of the disorder.

40|$|Fibrillar {{deposits}} of highly phosphorylated tau {{are a key}} pathological feature of several neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease and some <b>frontotemporal</b> <b>dementias.</b> Increasing {{evidence suggests that the}} presence of these end-stage neurofibrillary lesions do not cause neuronal loss, but rather that alterations to soluble tau proteins induce neurodegeneration. In particular, aberrant tau phosphorylation is acknowledged to be a key disease process, influencing tau structure, distribution and function in neurons. Although typically described as a cytosolic protein that associates with microtubules and regulates axonal transport, several additional functions of tau have recently been demonstrated, including roles in DNA stabilization, and synaptic function. Most recently, studies examining the trans-synaptic spread of tau pathology in disease models have suggested a potential role for extracellular tau in cell signalling pathways intrinsic to neurodegeneration. Here we review the evidence showing that tau phosphorylation {{plays a key role in}} neurodegenerative tauopathies.

2500|$|Nietzsche's {{mental illness}} was {{originally}} diagnosed as tertiary syphilis, {{in accordance with}} a prevailing medical paradigm of the time. Although most commentators regard his breakdown as unrelated to his philosophy, Georges Bataille dropped dark hints ("'Man incarnate' must also go mad") and René Girard's postmortem psychoanalysis posits a worshipful rivalry with Richard Wagner. Nietzsche had previously written, [...] "All superior men who were irresistibly drawn to throw off the yoke {{of any kind of}} morality and to frame new laws had, if they were not actually mad, no alternative but to make themselves or pretend to be mad." [...] (Daybreak, 14) The diagnosis of syphilis has since been challenged and a diagnosis of [...] "manic-depressive illness with periodic psychosis followed by vascular dementia" [...] was put forward by Cybulska prior to Schain's study. Leonard Sax suggested the slow growth of a right-sided retro-orbital meningioma as an explanation of Nietzsche's dementia; Orth and Trimble postulated <b>frontotemporal</b> <b>dementia</b> while other researchers have proposed a hereditary stroke disorder called CADASIL.

40|$|The peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans {{isomerase}} (PPIase) Pin 1 modulates {{the activity}} {{of a range of}} target proteins involved in the cell cycle, transcription, translation, endocytosis, and apoptosis by facilitating dephosphorylation of phosphorylated serine or threonine residue preceding a proline (p-Ser/Thr-Pro) motifs catalyzed by phosphatases specific for the trans conformations. Pin 1 targets include the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau, whose dephosphorylation restores its ability to stabilize microtubules. We, and others, have shown that tau hyperphosphorylation in the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with redirection of the predominantly nuclear Pin 1 to the cytoplasm and with Pin 1 shortfalls throughout subcellular compartments. As nuclear Pin 1 depletion causes apoptosis, shortfalls in regard to both nuclear and p-tau targets may contribute to neuronal dysfunction. We report here that similar Pin 1 redistribution and shortfalls occur in <b>frontotemporal</b> <b>dementias</b> (FTDs) characterized by abnormal protein aggregates of tau and other cytoskeletal proteins.

40|$|A {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s {{disease and the}} <b>frontotemporal</b> <b>dementias,</b> {{is the presence of}} intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The principal component of these structures is the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau that in these deposits, is abnormally phosphorylated, insoluble and redistributed from the axonal to the somatodendritic compartments of neurons. The identification of mutations in the tau locus in patients with familial <b>frontotemporal</b> <b>dementias</b> has demonstrated that mutations in tau are sufficient to cause neurodegenerative disease. Whether neuronal loss occurs due to the presence of aggregated tau or due to the loss of normal tau activity, or both, still remains unanswered. To address these issues, we have used a complementary approach of loss-of-function and overexpression studies in the genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster. ^ We present molecular and genetic analysis of a novel Drosophila gene, tau which we have concluded is the homologue of the mammalian MAP tau gene on the basis of sequence homology, phylogenetic data and the apparent molecular weight of the protein. The fly tau protein is expressed in development throughout the CNS and in specific neuronal accessory cells in the PNS called cap cells. In larval and adult stages, we find tau protein in photoreceptor neurons {{as well as in the}} nurse and follicle cells of the ovary. ^ Genetic analysis of loss-of-function mutations in the fly tau reveals that fly tau is an essential gene. Our results support distinct roles for tau in normal neuronal development and in adult viability. Homozygous tau mutant flies exhibit neuronal patterning defects of the PNS during embryogenesis. Loss of tau function impairs normal synaptic transmission in larval motor neurons and this may be linked to abnormal locomotor behavior in mutant larvae. ^ Using a targeted overexpression strategy of the human tau protein, we can recapitulate features of tau-related pathology including the accumulation of insoluble, abnormally phosphorylated tau that is associated with cell death. Courtship analysis of these tau transgenic flies reveals a functional impairment of short-term memory. This model system presents a powerful tool for the performance of modifier screens to identify molecules involved in the pathogenesis of tau-induced neurodegeneration. ...|$|R

40|$|Dementia is {{understood}} as a clinical syndrome characterized by impairment in memory impairment along with cognitive deficits in other domains. Over the years, understanding {{about the causes of}} dementias has improved. Broadly, dementias can be classified as irreversible degenerative dementias and reversible dementias. Alzheimer′s disease is the prototype of degenerative dementias and is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (called as amyloid plaques) outside the neurons and accumulation of tau protein (called tau tangles) inside the neurons. Vascular dementias are characterized by cerebrovascular insults which lead to pathological brain changes that impair cognition. The pathological hallmark of Lewy body dementia is the presence of α-synuclein neuronal inclusions, also known as Lewy bodies, accompanied by neuronal loss. <b>Frontotemporal</b> <b>dementias</b> are characterized by abnormal deposits of the microtubule-associated protein tau, the trans-activation response TAR DNA-binding protein with molecular weight 43 kDa (TDP- 43), and the fused in sarcoma protein.

40|$|Many {{neurodegenerative}} diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson disease, vascular and <b>frontotemporal</b> <b>dementias,</b> as well {{as other}} chronic neurological pathologies, are characterized by slow development with a long asymptomatic period followed by a stage with mild clinical symptoms. As a consequence, these serious pathologies are diagnosed late {{in the course of a}} disease, when massive death of neurons has already occurred and effective therapeutic intervention is problematic. Thus, the development of screening tests capable of detecting neurodegenerative diseases during early, preferably asymptomatic, stages is a high unmet need. Since such tests are to be used for screening of large populations, they should be non-invasive and relatively inexpensive. Further, while subjects identified by screening tests can be further tested with more invasive and expensive methods, e. g. analysis of cerebrospinal fluid or imaging techniques, to be of practical utility screening tests should have high sensitivity and specificity. In this review, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to developing screening tests based on analysis of circulating cell-free miRNA.

Here we report, in a longitudinal ageing study, the sensorimotor and cognitive assessment of transgenic mice expressing the human tauV 337 M (‘Seattle Family A’) FTDP- 17 mutation, which we have previously shown to demonstrate abnormalities in brain tau phosphorylation. The data indicated highly specific effects of transgene expression on the ability to withhold responding in a murine version of the 5 -choice serial reaction time task, behaviour consistent with deficits in impulse control. Ageing exacerbated these effects. In young tauV 337 M mice, increased impulsivity was present under task conditions making inhibition of premature responding more difficult (longer inter-trial intervals) but not under baseline conditions. However, when older, the tauV 337 M mice showed further increases in premature responding, including under baseline conditions.
