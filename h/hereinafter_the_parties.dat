At present, there is a Basic Law (<b>hereinafter</b> <b>the</b> BL) which is enforced in the territory under PA control, and a Draft Palestinian Constitution (<b>hereinafter</b> <b>the</b> DPC) is also circulating. 2 At the same time, the 1968 Palestinian National Charter (<b>hereinafter</b> <b>the</b> Charter) remains, formally, in force, although considered by many as 'old fashioned' since it renounced the armed resistance as a means to national liberation (Nofal 1997, 87). Furthermore, the Palestine Liberation Organization (<b>hereinafter</b> <b>the</b> PLO) unilaterally proclaimed the establishment of a new independent state called the ‘State of Palestine’ in 1988 but this did not lead directly to the realization of statehood. Therefore it remains an aspiration and future objective as the Israeli occupation persists and the ‘State of Palestine’ has still to be established. Throughout this report, reference will be made to both the BL and the DPC as these documents represent the current and the future Palestinian constitutional framewo...|$|R

40|$|The {{grounds for}} review of {{arbitration}} awards are stipulated in section 145 of the Labour Relations Act No 66 of 1995 (<b>hereinafter</b> <b>the</b> “LRA”). However, the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (<b>hereinafter</b> <b>the</b> “CCMA”) is an organ {{of state and}} therefore bound by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa No 108 of 1996 (<b>hereinafter</b> <b>the</b> “ 1996 Constitution”). Therefore, the issuing of an arbitration award is bound by section 33 of the 1996 Constitution which requires that administrative should be lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair. It {{is for this reason}} that <b>the</b> Constitutional Court (<b>hereinafter</b> <b>the</b> “CC”) in Sidumo & another v Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd [2007] 12 BLLR 1097 (CC) held that section 145 of the LRA is suffused by the constitutional standard of “reasonableness”. The CC in Sidumo subsequently confirmed that the standard of review is whether the decision reached by the CCMA commissioner is one that a reasonable decision-maker could not reach. This dissertation seeks to determine how this standard as laid down in Sidumo influenced the courts’ interpretation of the grounds for review and whether there is certainty by the courts on the interpretation of this test.

In particular, it demonstrates that the provisions of the Council of Europe’s Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, adopted in 2011 in Istanbul and entered into force in 2014 (hereinafter ‘Istanbul Convention’), can constitute ‘relevant rules of international law’ under Article 31 (3) (c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties (VCLT) in the interpretation of applicable articles of the European Convention on Human Rights (<b>hereinafter</b> <b>the</b> ‘European Convention’) ...|$|R
