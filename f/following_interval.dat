40|$|Introduction: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the main}} global cause of {{mortality}} with a death rate higher in females than males. Exercise training {{has the potential to}} reduce CVD risk but the optimal exercise type has not been determined. Therefore, the effects of two different types of exercise (interval and continuous) on markers related to CVD risk were assessed in women across the lifespan. Methods: The effect of exercise on vascular health was studied in three different populations of women; young premenopausal, middle-aged overweight/obese, and postmenopausal women. In chapters 4 and 6, 12 healthy and 20 overweight/obese women, respectively, completed either an interval or continuous exercise training programme. In chapter 5, 15 postmenopausal women performed a 30 min moderate-intensity continuous and interval exercise bout, with 9 participants completing a further interval exercise session at a heavy-intensity. Endothelial function, arterial stiffness, circulating angiogenic cell (CAC) number and function, and cardio-respiratory fitness were assessed in these chapters at pre and post-exercise. Results: Arterial stiffness was unaltered following exercise in all chapters. Cardio-respiratory fitness was increased following both interval and continuous exercise training. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was increased <b>following</b> <b>interval</b> exercise training in young women, unaltered acutely in postmenopausal women, and decreased <b>following</b> <b>interval</b> exercise training in overweight/obese women. CAC number was increased following both types of exercise in young women, but in overweight/obese women, CAC number was only increased after interval exercise training, and was unaltered acutely in postmenopausal women. Markers of CAC function were unaltered following exercise training in healthy young women, but CAC colony-forming units increased acutely following moderate and heavy-intensity interval exercise in postmenopausal women, and CAC adhesion increased <b>following</b> <b>interval</b> exercise training in overweight/obese women. However, continuous exercise (acutely and chronically) did not change endothelial function or CAC function in any study. Discussion: Interval exercise modified more markers of vascular health than continuous exercise. The mechanisms behind this discrepancy might be related to potential differences in the arterial shear stress profiles experienced during the exercise. Future studies are required to explore this theory. Exercise-mediated changes in many variables depended on the baseline health of participants and therefore, highlights that exercise effects are heterogeneous...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: High aerobic {{capacity}} is {{inversely related to}} cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Recent studies suggest greater improvements in aerobic capacity with high-intensity interval training (interval) compared to moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise (continuous). Therefore we perform a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of INTERVAL versus CONTINUOUS in aerobic capacity, amongst patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and preserved ejection fraction METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register, clinicaltrials. gov and TROVE for randomised controlled trials comparing INTERVAL with CONTINUOUS in patients with CAD. Studies published in the English language up to December 2013 were eligible for inclusion. Aerobic capacity, quantified by peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 peak) post exercise training was extracted and compared post-intervention between INTERVAL and CONTINUOUS {{by way of a}} fixed model meta-analysis. Secondary outcomes including anaerobic threshold, blood pressure and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) were also analysed. RESULTS: Six independent studies with 229 patients (n= 99 randomised to INTERVAL) were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significantly higher increase in VO 2 peak <b>following</b> <b>INTERVAL</b> compared to CONTINUOUS (Weighted Mean Difference= 1. 53 ml•kg(- 1) min(- 1), 95 % CI 0. 84 to 2. 23) with homogeneity displayed between studies (Chi Squared= 2. 69; P= 0. 7). Significant effects of INTERVAL compared to CONTINUOUS were also found for anaerobic threshold but not systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSION: In patients with CAD, INTERVAL appears more effective than CONTINUOUS for the improvement of aerobic capacity in patients with CAD. However, long-term studies assessing morbidity and mortality <b>following</b> <b>INTERVAL</b> are required before this approach can be more widely adopted. Adrian D.
