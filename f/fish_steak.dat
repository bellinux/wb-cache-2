25|$|Umlikaaq (or Umlikaq ~ Umlikqaq) or Ungllekaq (ungllik'ar in Nunivak Cup'ig) {{is fresh}} boiled fish. All {{parts of the}} fish except for the {{entrails}} are used to prepare umlikqaq. Fresh fish that have been dead {{for less than a}} day make the best umlikqaq because the meat is still firm. If a freshwater fish is caught with a hook, it is best to kill the fish by hitting its head soon after capture so the meat will stay firm for cooking. The main ingredients of umlikqaq are cut-up fish, water, and salt which are boiled for about 29 minutes. This is a preferred food for elders because it easy to make and is not strongly seasoned. First heads are good prepared as umlikqaq. Also, Ungelkaaq is <b>fish</b> <b>steak</b> cut transversely.|$|E

50|$|A <b>fish</b> <b>steak,</b> {{alternatively}} {{known as}} a fish cutlet, is a cut of fish which is cut perpendicular to the spine and can either include the bones or be boneless. Fish steaks can be contrasted with fish fillets, which are cut parallel {{to either side of}} the spine and do not include the larger bones. In contrast to other vertebrate animals, over 85% of the fish body is made up of consumable muscle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>steaks</b> can be grilled, pan-fried, broiled or baked. While beef steak {{takes time}} to cook and can be tough, fish cooks rapidly, is tender, and tends to fall apart. <b>Fish</b> <b>steaks</b> {{are less likely to}} fall apart than fish fillets. Unlike beef <b>steak,</b> <b>fish</b> <b>steaks</b> are often baked in a sauce.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>steaks</b> are {{generally}} cooked {{for a short}} time, as the flesh cooks quickly, especially when grilled. <b>Fish</b> <b>steaks,</b> such as tuna, can also be cooked to various temperatures, such as rare and medium-rare. The {{different ways in which}} a steak dish could be cut are - rib eye, sirloin, tenderloin, rump, porterhouse and t-bone.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>steaks</b> are cut {{perpendicular}} to the spine and include bones. Although their delicate flesh requires quicker cooking than beef, steaks from swordfish, halibut, tuna, salmon and mahi-mahi can be grilled. They are frequently cooked whole or as fillets. <b>Fish</b> <b>steaks</b> may also be poached or baked using a court bouillon, wine or sauce or cooked en papillote.|$|R
5000|$|Fish steaks can be {{made with}} the skin on or off, and are {{generally}} made from fish larger than 10 lb. Fish steaks from particularly large fish can be sectioned so they are boneless. It takes less time to make a <b>fish</b> <b>steak</b> than a fillet, because steaks are often bone in and skin on. Cutting through the backbone with a knife can be difficult, so it is preferable to use a butchers saw to make fish steaks. Larger fish, such as tuna, swordfish, salmon, cod and mahi-mahi, are often cut into steaks.|$|E

It is a sauce in which <b>fish</b> <b>steak</b> is cooked and to which are added capers, olives and lemon.For {{the choice of the}} fish, many species are used such as grouper (threatened species), angel shark, tuna or mackerel.The sauce is spicy and tasty. The main ingredients used in the preparation are: onion, olive oil, tomato paste, garlic, harissa, salt, pepper, cumin, caper, lemon, pitted black olives, pitted green olives and a pinch of saffron.This dish goes very well with baked potato and green pepper.|$|E

30|$|Musk lime (Citrus microcarpa) {{from family}} Rutaceae is {{commonly}} found in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Philippines (Abdullah et al. 2012). The health benefits of lime include skin care, eye care, weight loss, good digestion, relief from constipation, and treatment of scurvy. Besides that, the juice is also commonly used as a flavoring ingredient in desserts or as an additive in various food preparations such as <b>fish</b> <b>steak,</b> jams, candies, and marmalade. The pulp of the fruit {{is used as a}} major ingredient in purees, syrups, concentrates, and beverages. The peel of musk lime is rough and usually discarded. Thus, utilization of musk lime peel for AC production is a way of placing value on this waste thereby saving disposal cost. As a result of the hazardous health effects of MG dye, the present study is aimed at removing this dye from wastewater using musk lime peel as adsorbent by employing a central composite design (CCD) in response surface methodology (RSM) Design Expert software version 7.1. 5.1 (STAT-EASE Inc., Minneapolis, USA). RSM was selected to elucidate the simultaneous effects of parameters on the adsorption process. The multiple regression analysis technique in the RSM was utilized to develop the equations and empirical models correlating the dye removal efficiency and activated carbon yield to three adsorption variables. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to judge the adequacy of the model. The optimized conditions developed from the model were validated experimentally and the feasibility of LPAC for MG dye removal was obtained.|$|E
