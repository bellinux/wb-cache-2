It would result in a thinner device because you don’t have the pieces of glass. It could conform around the sides, so you can show information on the sides. It would be lighter. So you can either make it smaller or thinner or you can make a larger battery so that it lasts longer. The challenges are encapsulation, so you need an encapsulation process.

[2000] P 09. A work of architecture does not begin at the physical boundaries of site as it ultimately looks as if, but it takes much more to complete its process mainly in architects mind.

One would see as the drawings, sketches, models, and computer generated animations primarily meant to convey design idea to clients or to the members involve in the design process. Then they can be identified as communicative tools. But the word communication by its definition is not simply to convey ideas, but it is exchange of meanings between individuals through a common system of symbols. "It is clear then that designers do not just use drawings to communicate with clients, builders or legislators. Drawings are {{an essential part of the}} design process itself. "Lawson [1994]P. 171 "The designer then is always working with some sort of mental image of the reality of his designs. Until the building or object is constructed no one really knows just what it will be like to live in, look at or hold. The designer tries to create and manipulate his own "reality" and may use drawings and models to help in this process. However the designer's mental image usually contains many qualitative ideas too nebulous for iconic representation. These ideas are often expressed as symbolic images, and although these symbolic images are undoubtedly essential to the designer he can easily become trapped by his own illusion.

When there is drought for example, some fruit trees will not blossom. But there are ways of preserving the fruits so that {{during the dry season}} they can still be enjoyed. In this interview forest office Wyson Banda speaks to Excello Zidana in Malawi. Mr Banda explains how communities can make sure that they have delicious fruit all year round.

Transcript Banda	There are so many advantages because you see people enjoy fruit in Malawi, fruits are just very common here, like masuku; marula. Usually what they do is to dry or season some of the fruits, they dry them, there is time when they also go out of season. Then during off-season, what they do is to soak them in the water, then enjoy the water by putting porridge, they still enjoy the fruits during that time. Zidana	What containers do they use to store what you have just talked about? Banda	The containers are just locally found their villages, like baskets. Zidana	Now let?s go to the actual extraction of the juice that is to be stored. How do they do it locally? Banda	What they <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> pound them in the mortar, the traditional mortars, after pounding them they dry them in the sun. Then the day after they store them while dry. But when they want to use it, when those things are off-season, they just soak them in water, or cook porridge from that water. Zidana	When they are trying to store fruits, they pound them. Do they keep them in the powder form or what? Banda	Some are kept in powder from but some are just dried as they are, then when soaked, they just extract water from them. Zidana	And you have an idea that people enjoy indigenous fruit trees? Banda	Yes for sure yes, they are really enjoying the indigenous fruits. Zidana	Are they nutritious? Banda	Very much so.

40|$|Practical {{solutions}} to aflatoxins Cue: Maize and groundnuts {{are among the}} most important crops grown in Africa, providing energy and protein to millions. Sometimes, however, these crops can carry a danger to health, particularly if they are not properly dried before storage, or are stored in damp conditions. Such moisture can allow fungi to grow on the stored crop, and some types of common fungi produce poisonous substances, called aflatoxins, which contaminate the maize or groundnuts. Unfortunately, aflatoxins are not destroyed by cooking, and eating contaminated foods, particularly over a long period, can have serious impacts on health. There are, however, many practical things that farmers can do to prevent the growth of fungi and cut the risk of aflatoxin contamination. In the following interview, Excello Zidana discusses some of these strategies with Dr Benjani Theu, Malawi?s National Co-ordinator for Plant Protection. Dr Theu begins with a brief description of what aflatoxins are. IN:		?Aflatoxins are substances that are ?? OUT:		??and it would be very very bad. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 47 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Benjani Theu of the Malawi Ministry of Agriculture, describing the dangers to health from foods contaminated by aflatoxins ? natural poisons that are produced by certain fungi which grow on poorly stored maize and groundnuts. Transcript Theu	Aflatoxins are substances that are released by a fungus which attacks our crops. Zidana	What is the real problem with these aflatoxins to human life? Theu	Aflatoxins as I said are substances that will get into our food. When it gets into your food, it gets into your liver. Then it affects your liver negatively, and it could reduce the immune system in your body. It could also incite the production of abnormal cells in the liver, therefore the liver becomes cancerous, then you have what we call cancer of the liver. Zidana	What can you say about all the cultural practices in the field or up to the storage time? Theu	The crop in our country that has got very high levels of aflatoxin is groundnuts, then you second it with grains like maize. What happens is, when you are in the field, there is this fungus which is already in the field and it attacks our groundnut kernels. So what we have encouraged farmers to <b>do</b> <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> should make sure their crops are very dry, then they make a selection before storing, so that you don?t have to store groundnut kernels or shells or pods that are cracked. You store very good groundnuts and then when you also shell them, you make another selection. That way will do very well. Zidana	Now let?s come to the actual storage facilities; people have argued that the right granary should be a raised house whereby people can maybe have some fire below. How do you look at this facility? Theu	Yes, if you have a raised one and then you light the fire below, it means you are perpetually denying it of moisture, so actually the grain will stay very well. But there are some types of granaries or nkokwes which are not raised and they are kept with very low moisture and that?s fine. And then by not keeping it well covered, rain comes in it then it will not be a very good type of granary. You can also have a granary where there was aflatoxin affected maize last year, and if you did not clean it very well, and then you put in maize this year, and there is some level of moisture, especially during the rainy season, then the aflatoxin will spread onto the next grain. Zidana	How do you look at the practice of harvesting produce before they have actually dried up? I?m looking at the current situation whereby people go around stealing some people?s produce and to run away from that people tend to harvest early. How do you look at this? Theu	Even if you harvest early, you must let the maize, or the crop like groundnuts, dry adequately before it is stored. You cannot harvest it earlier and then leave it like that. The main problem which we have had is that people will harvest, and will put in a pile in our backyard and not ready to dry. Then after 3, 4, days or 5 days or a week or 2 weeks, then we say ?Let?s now start drying it up. ? And if you look at that type of groundnuts you will find that there?s a lot of fungus growing on it, as if you are trying to grow mushrooms. That is what has been a problem. Zidana	But the truth is aflatoxins are very dangerous. Theu	Aflatoxins are dangerous, and for those whose system is already immune-compromised or whose immune system is already down because of other ailments, like those who are HIV/Aids patients, then there will be a double blow in terms of the strength in their immune system, and it would be very very bad. End of track. Dr Benjani Theu, Malawi?s national coordinator for plant protection, explains what aflatoxins are, and what farmers can do to prevent the growth of the fungi that produce them...|$|E

In Cameroon, Martha Chindong {{went to the}} Ministry of Secondary Education to ask Chofor Ndimofor for some tips on drying meat. Smoking and drying meat has been done for centuries ? it?s {{one of the oldest}} kinds of preservation. But, there are health concerns related to drying meat. As usual, preparation and washing {{needs to be done in}} a clean area, and boiled water should be used. And different kinds of meat will require different drying times and storage periods. But why dry meat at all? Martha Chindong finds out. IN:	?Well basically there are two reasons? OUT:	?when meat will be scarce. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 53 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Martha Chindong speaking to Chofor Ndimofor of the Ministry of Secondary Education in Cameroon. It is always best to seek advice about how long it is safe to dry your meat or fish. If it decays, it can cause serious illness. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Ndimofor	Well basically there are two reasons. The first reason is that when meat is dried it is properly preserved and secondly it is a way of improving the taste of the meat. People consider dry meat as a delicacy. Chindong	So which type of meat or fish are also best to dry? Ndimofor	Well, as you see presently, I am in the process of drying a rabbit. Chindong	What of fish? Ndimofor	Yes fish, all kinds of fish can be dried, especially fish that is not too oily and which does not have a lot of water. We are thinking of fish like mackerel. Chindong	So how do you just get started?Just describe one, how you get started with at least one? Maybe this here rabbit which I see in front of you? Ndimofor	All right, in order to dry a rabbit, the first thing is you select a healthy rabbit, one that is not lean, one that is in good health. You kill it, you skin it and then you open it up. You actually open it up in such a way that it is spread out and you can use pieces of stick to get it well spread out so that it remains in shape. And then you salt it with brine; that is you put some salt in water and steep it in it for a while. You hang it out or you expose it in the sun to drip a little then you put it over the fire as you see me doing. Chindong	So is that the same process you do for meat and fish? Ndimofor	No, for meat you have to choose meat that does not have too much fat because too much fat will not enhance the drying process. Then the meat should be lean, it should not have too much fat and the best way is for you to slice it into strands. When you slice it into strands you treat it with brine in the same way. Sometimes in order to give added flavour you might like to spice it with other ingredients, maybe curry, maybe ginger then you hang it out to drip and then you put the strands either over a grill or you hang them from a hook or a rope over a fire, a smoke fire. Chindong	Smoke fire like what we are seeing? Ndimofor	Yes, what we are seeing, we are using the grill now. There is fire under the grill, not burning into flames but only producing the smoke and heat that go up to dehydrate the meat and after some three or four hours the meat is well dehydrated and now you only leave it for sometime to get properly dried. Chindong	Is it within the reach of smallscale farmers living in the villages? Ndimofor	Yes, I think it is within the reach of smallscale farmers. I say it is within their reach because the materials are not expensive. Chindong	So you have constructed it with what type of material? Ndimofor	Burnt bricks and then he will need to have a good piece of grill which cannot be rusted. The best one within the reach of the people in the rural areas is the traditional everyday fire with which they prepare their meals. What they <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> prepare their meat or whatever animal they have to smoke or dry and just hang it over the fireplace. Chindong	So, Mr Chofor Ndimofor, this meat that you have dried can keep for how long? Ndimofor	Ah, it depends. If you really want the meat to keep for long it should be properly dehydrated. The only things is that you should avoid during that time, you should avoid it coming into contact with moisture. Chindong	When it comes in contact with moisture can it be contaminated? Ndimofor	Oh yes, when it comes in contact with moisture you know especially in rural areas there is this tendency that it can fall out of the containers and when it falls out of the containers onto the ground it can pick up dirt and germs and all kinds of things. When dry meat gets into contact with moisture maggots tend to infest it and it will reduce the quality and also the look of it and nobody would really like to eat it. Chindong	What advice do you have for farmers? What message do you have for people who are interested in drying meat? Ndimofor	Yes what I have to say is, you know in the first place why do we dry meat? We dry meat because there are certain seasons when you have abundance of meat. Use that opportunity to dry the meat and preserve it for when meat will be scarce. End of trackHow to get the most from your mea...|$|E
40|$|Cue: While it?s always {{possible}} for accidents {{to happen on}} a farm, especially when using heavy or sharp equipment, farming is not usually regarded as a very dangerous occupation. However, there are health risks that many farmers are not aware of. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides, for example, if handled or applied wrongly can cause serious illness. And for farmers who keep livestock {{there is also a}} risk of catching diseases from their animals. While the majority of animal diseases cannot be caught by humans, a few serious ones can. They are called zoonotic diseases, or zoonoses, and if they are not treated quickly they can prove fatal for human sufferers. Kwenkam Paul of Cameroon?s ministry responsible for livestock spoke to Martha Chindong about the dangers of zoonotic diseases and how farmers and veterinary technicians can reduce them. Martha started by asking him to give some examples of these diseases that farmers are at risk of catching from their livestock. IN:		?Thank you very much Martha ?? OUT:		??. This is very very important. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 52 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Kwenkam Paul describing how livestock farmers can prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Transcript Paul	Thank you very much Martha. There are so many diseases that affect both animals and humans, which we call zoonotic diseases, or zoonoses. There are many of them, it will depend on the animal species. For example in cattle, we have tuberculosis, we have brucelosis, these are examples. In poultry we have Newcastle to some extent. In pigs we have swine erysipelas etc. Chindong	Now doctor, from your experience among farmers and the farmers? communities, how are these diseases transmitted from animals to farmers? Paul	For example, like swine erysipelas, which is a very important zoonosis among our pig population. Now because farmers are always working with these pigs, it entails that if the pigs come down with erysipelas, the farmers are immediately exposed. Therefore, what do we tell farmers? We tell them that you should not handle your pigs when you have wounds on you body, because legions on the body are some of the principal routes of transmission of this disease. For example, in the recent past one of our technicians in the Douala region himself contracted erysipelas, by handling pigs, and he developed very severe fever, severe joint pains, and severe inflammation of the legs, and he had to be put under serious emergency treatment, if not his life was in great danger. Chindong	Now how can farmers properly manage their livestock in order to prevent infectious diseases, both for themselves and their animals? Paul	This is a very good question. The first thing, for example, is that farmers should work with the technicians. The technicians themselves should be well-informed, and they should be disposed to the farmers, they should understand their role in development, they should understand their role in fighting poverty. So when farmers work with technicians, the technicians will help them make sure they have good inputs, for example good breeding stock: good piglets or good day-old chicks, or good dairy animals. That implies that the animals must have good infrastructure; for example like the piggery. Before you plan a piggery somewhere, you must know that, whether other piggeries are within the area, and as much as possible you plan the piggery such that the other piggeries are not an immediate threat to that piggery. You make sure that you advise the farmers to construct modern piggeries. By ?modern piggeries? I mean some area, well-defined, where the animals are kept away from sun, from direct sunlight, and where they have adequate supply of water. And then you keep off all stray animals, all intruders be they humans, and then you advise the farmers not to visit other farms. Then the farmer to a large extent will reduce the chances of infectious diseases coming to his farm. But one other important thing is that you the technician yourself, you could bring disease to the farmer?s farm. So definitely you yourself the technician, you must make sure that you don?t visit two farms in a day, and {{if you are going to}} have meetings with farmers, it is better not to have meetings within the farm premises. You should probably have it in a neutral place, maybe a primary school or within a church area, and then you insist to farmers, you inform them that as much as possible, though working together, they should work as individuals. Chindong	Though working together they should work as individuals. What do you mean? Paul	By this I mean, actually I am addressing myself to pig farmers, considering the dangers of African swine fever. The emphasis for you, Martha, and myself, is that we try as much as possible to encourage farmers to work as a group, we try as much as possible to encourage them to have co-operatives. But for pig farmers, we are saying that the farmer should not go to other pig farms, he should not, he should not visit them. And even, when he goes for example to the pig market, he should not bring animals back to his farm, and once he comes back from the pig market he should not go to his farm. He should first of all have a good bath, all the dresses that he wore in the market, and his shoes, he must wash, clean them very very well. If not he will bring very virulent viruses or micro-organisms to his farm, and that will be plenty of trouble for him. Chindong	Now, let?s say farmers are already exposed to these diseases, what can they do? Paul	Yes if farmers are exposed to this problem, the first thing they should <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> have to go to the hospital; this is absolutely important, and this is the advice we give them, that once they feel sick they must go to the hospital. And when they go to the hospital, they should not hide telling the doctors what their occupation is, what their activities are. Because if they don?t tell the doctor, the doctor may take the fever for some ordinary fever, maybe for malaria fever. So now when they tell the doctor that they are livestock farmers, since the doctor is aware of the various zoonotic problems, then he will start by eliminating first of all those zoonotic problems before attacking the other problems. This is very very important. End of track.
