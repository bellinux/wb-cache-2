Concluiu que, provavelmente, apenas 48, 1 % das estufas da Grande Florianópolis estavam operando segundo as normas de tempo e temperatura preconizadas na {{literatura}} e pode constatar que houve falha de 22, 5 % na eficácia das 40 estufas da amostra testada. Abstract : The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of dry heat dental offices in Florianópolis, S. C., Brazil. The work intended to discover the capacity dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> have to eradicate the spores of B. subtilis on biological indicators strips and also to compare temperatures during the sterilization cycles to the ones proposed in the literature. Moreover, it endeavored to assure that the built in thermometer and thermostat in the dry <b>heat</b> <b>oven</b> were reliable, and to analyze the influence how the materials were displayed in the sterilization chambers. As a complementing part, a survey was made in order to investigate who operates the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> in different dental clinics and their specialist field of work. The results indicated that, out of the samples tested, a rate fall of 22. 5 % was found in dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> effectiveness to destroy the spores of R subtilis. Moreover, from the final results, it is possible to infer that only 48. 1 % of the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> investigated actually used the parameters (time and temperatare) as proposed in the literature. From the observed samples, it was also shown that the built in thermometers and thermostat were not reliable. Furthermore, results suggested that there was temperature variation inside the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens,</b> therefore, it was found that the materials placed in the upper shelf received less heat. Finally, findings confirmed that dental assistants were responsible for managing the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> in 67. 5 % of the dental offices surveyed. Last but no least, although there was a vast area of specialists participating in the survey, such as periodontics, prosthodontics, orthodontics, endodontics, implantodontics, pedodontics, and radiology, general clinics showed to have participated with the highest percentage (57. 5 %) ...|$|R

50|$|Several {{methods were}} {{applied in the}} {{preparation}} of locusts, prior to eating them. One of the more popular ways was to take the locusts after gathering them and to throw them into a pot of boiling salt water. After cooking for a few minutes, they were then removed from the pot and placed within a <b>heated</b> <b>oven</b> in order to dry them, or else spread out in the sun to dry. Once dry, they would take up the locusts and break off their heads, wings and legs and discard them, eating only the thorax and abdomen. Another method was to stoke an earthenware stove and, when fully heated, to cast them while alive into the cavity of the stove. Once roasted, they were taken out and a brine solution was sprinkled over them, before spreading them out in the sun to dry, usually upon one’s rooftop.|$|E
50|$|He {{published}} his first scientific paper, about {{carbon dioxide and}} oxygen metabolism in plants, with Dehérain in 1874. He left plant physiology and then turned towards inorganic chemistry; subsequently his research on pyrophoric iron was well received by the two most prominent French inorganic chemists of that time, Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville and Jules Henri Debray. After Moissan received his Ph.D. on cyanogen and its reactions to form cyanures in 1880, his friend Landrine offered him a position at an analytic laboratory. His marriage, to Léonie Lugan, took place in 1882. They had a son in 1885. During the 1880s, Moissan focused on fluorine chemistry and especially the production of fluorine itself. He had no laboratory of his own, but used several laboratories, for example that of Charles Friedel. There he had access to a strong battery consisting of 90 Bunsen cells which {{made it possible to}} observe a gas produced by the electrolysis of molten arsenic trichloride; the gas was reabsorbed by the arsenic trichloride. The electrolysis of hydrogen fluoride yielded fluorine on 26 June 1886. The French academy of science sent three representatives, Marcellin Berthelot, Henri Debray, and Edmond Frémy, to verify the results, but Moissan was unable to reproduce them, owing to the absence from the hydrogen fluoride of traces of potassium fluoride present in the previous experiments. After resolving the problem and demonstrating the production of fluorine several times, he was awarded a prize of 10,000 francs. In subsequent years, until 1891, he focused on the study of fluorine chemistry. He discovered numerous fluorine compounds, such as (together with Paul Lebeau) SF6 in 1901.
