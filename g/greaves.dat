5|$|For 2009, Pierre Bruneau {{joined the}} team, {{and as a}} result, the team {{became known as the}} Bruichladdich-Bruneau Team, with the team {{continuing}} to use the AER-engined Radical SR9. The opening round of the season, which was the 1000km of Catalunya, saw Bruneau, partnered by Moseley and Nigel Greensall, finishing tenth overall, and fourth in the LM P2 category. At the 1000km of Spa, Tim <b>Greaves</b> and Jonathon Coleman replaced Moseley and Greensall, but the team were disqualified from the event for an unspecified technical infringement.

Though he did not score in the final itself, a 2–1 victory, with six goals in eight games <b>Greaves</b> was the competition's leading scorer. The 1967–68 season was a disappointing one for Spurs following their 3–3 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford in the 1967 FA Charity Shield. They finished seventh in the league, exited the FA Cup in the Fifth Round and were knocked out of the Cup Winners' Cup in the Second Round. <b>Greaves</b> had a poor season by his own standards, though with 29 goals in 48 appearances he was still the club's top scorer. Nicholson bought <b>Greaves</b> a new strike partner in Martin Chivers from Southampton for a club record £125,000 fee, with Gilzean dropping further back into midfield to accommodate, but <b>Greaves</b> and Chivers were not as effective together as Nicholson had hoped.|$|E

In winning the competition, Tottenham Hotspur became the first British team to win a European trophy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greaves</b> was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation.

5|$|In January 1971, with Bobby Moore, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, <b>Greaves</b> was {{involved}} in late-night drinking, against the wishes of manager Ron Greenwood, prior to an FA Cup tie away to Blackpool.

2500|$|Although {{individual}} gladiators of {{a single}} class might fight with widely different gear, in general, the Samnite fought in the gear of a warrior from Samnium: a short sword (gladius), a rectangular shield (scutum (shield)), a <b>greave</b> (ocrea), and a helmet. The helmet had a crest, a rim, a visor, and a plume (galea); this last element gave [...] "an imposing appearance". The Samnite's <b>greave</b> was worn on the left leg and reached to just below the knee. It was made of leather and sometimes had a metal rim. He also wore an ankleband on the right ankle. The Samnite's sword arm was protected by an arm guard (manica); this became a common piece of equipment for most gladiators. The sword was the Samnite's most common weapon (the word gladiator comes from the Latin gladius, [...] "sword"), but some seem to have fought with a lance instead.|$|R
