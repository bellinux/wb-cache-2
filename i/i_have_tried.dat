5|$|Stowe {{intended}} that Fred would {{manage the}} estate as he recovered from his wounds and addictions. As {{an extension of}} her abolitionist ideals, she wrote to her brother Charles Beecher, however, about her potential role in the endeavor: My plan...is not in any sense a mere worldly enterprise. I have for many years had a longing to be more immediately doing Christ's work on earth. My heart is with that poor people whose cause in words <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to plead, and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that formative state in which whoever seizes has them.|$|E

25|$|I {{have often}} {{sat back and}} thought just how nice {{it would be if}} you could relive your life based on the {{experience}} gained. For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to do this , I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity.|$|E

500|$|Charles II, Anne's uncle, famously said of Prince George, [...] "I {{have tried}} him drunk, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> him sober {{and there is}} nothing in him". He was quiet and self-effacing. John Macky thought him [...] "of a familiar, easy {{disposition}} with a good sound understanding but modest in showing it... very fat, loves news, his bottle & the Queen." [...] In making fun of George's asthma, Lord Mulgrave said the Prince was forced to breathe hard in case people mistook him for dead and buried him. By the time of Queen Victoria, George had a reputation as a dullard, and was the target of disdain. Victoria hoped her own husband, Prince Albert, would never fill the [...] "subordinate part played by the very stupid and insignificant husband of Queen Anne". In the 1930s, Winston Churchill said he [...] "mattered very little", except to Anne.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, de Lucía, John McLaughlin, and Larry Coryell formed The Guitar Trio and {{together}} made {{a tour of}} Europe and released a video recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall entitled Meeting of the Spirits. Pohren said that de Lucía's decision to work with musicians like McLaughlin, Di Meola, Coryell, and Chick Corea {{must have been an}} [...] "exciting and stimulating" [...] experience for him, given their technical musical knowledge and ability to improvise and said that they carried him [...] "so far afield that at times he must have been profoundly confused, a man running the risk of losing his musical identity." [...] This concerned de Lucía, who said in a late 1990s interview, [...] "I have never lost the roots in my music, because I would lose myself. What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to do is have a hand holding onto tradition and the other scratching, digging in other places, trying to find new things I can bring into flamenco." ...|$|E
500|$|Lulla Rosenfeld {{writes that}} Henry Irving, the great Shylock before that time, played Shylock as [...] "morally {{superior}} to the Christians around him... driven to cruelty only by their more cruel persecutions." [...] In contrast, [...] "Adler scorned justification. Total vindication was his aim." [...] In Adler's own words, [...] "Shylock from the first was governed by pride rather than revenge. He wishes to humble and terrify Antonio for the insult and humiliation he has suffered at his hands. This is why he {{goes so far as}} to bring his knife and scales into the court. For Shylock, however, the desired climax was to refuse the pound of flesh with a gesture of divine compassion. When the verdict goes against him, he is crushed because he has been robbed of this opportunity, not because he lusts for Antonio's death. This was my interpretation. This is the Shylock <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to show." [...] The road from this to method acting is clear.|$|E

500|$|Her thirteenth album, Reba, {{was issued}} in 1988 {{and was not}} well {{received}} by critics, who claimed she was moving farther away from her [...] "traditional country" [...] sound. Stereo Review disliked the album's contemporary style, stating, [...] "After years of insisting that she'd stick to hard-core country 'because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> the contemporary-type songs, and it's not Reba McEntire—it's just not honest,' McEntirehas gone whole-hog pop. The album peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart and remained there for six consecutive weeks. Okay, so maybe that's not so terrible." [...] Although it was reviewed poorly, the album itself was certified platinum in sales and produced two number-one singles: [...] "I Know How He Feels" [...] and [...] "New Fool at an Old Game". In addition, the release's cover version of Jo Stafford's [...] "A Sunday Kind of Love" [...] became a Top 5 hit on the Billboard country music chart. Also in 1988, McEntire founded Starstruck Entertainment, which controlled her management, booking, publishing, promotion, publicity, accounting, ticket sales, and fan club administration. The company would eventually expand into managing a horse farm, jet charter service, trucking, construction, and book publishing.|$|E
500|$|Ursula Franklin {{explains}} in {{a prelude to}} her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms [...] "the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole," [...] {{has been at the}} root of most of her activities. Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, [...] "I can see how <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist {{in the here and now}} and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'" [...] As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. [...] "Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," [...] she writes. [...] "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement." [...] Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls [...] "the real world" [...] by [...] "the maps of pacifism and feminism".|$|E
500|$|Robyn was {{involved}} in the writing process for the entirety of My Truth, co-writing all fourteen tracks. She teamed up with Swedish rapper Petter for a Swedish-language duet titled [...] "Det gör ont ibland". The collaboration came about when the two were at a friend's country house. Petter said the song came together quickly, despite their different musical styles. The track was produced by rapper Thomas Rusiak with additional production by Robyn, Lindström and Ekhé. She recorded another duet for the album, titled [...] "Healthy Love", with singer Cindy Heinold. In the fall of 1998, Robyn had an abortion, which she revealed to the public months later in an issue of Café Magazine. Following the abortion, she penned the songs [...] "88 Days" [...] and [...] "Giving You Back", to help her cope with the incident. At the time of the album's completion, she deemed the latter among the best songs she had written thus far. She began using songwriting as a coping mechanism during production of Robyn Is Here when she wrote [...] "In My Heart" [...] about her parents' divorce. She wanted My Truth to be positive in spirit, but acknowledged there is [...] "some sadness expressed". She said, [...] "Every song is about something I've been through that I think is important to talk about. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to turn these experiences into inspiring songs about my life." [...] Eric Broms photographed the artwork for My Truth, which sees Robyn wearing a feather headpiece designed by Sebastian Wahl.|$|E

500|$|With Somerset runners-up in the English 2009 Twenty20 Cup, Trescothick and his county {{travelled}} to India {{to partake}} in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. Though both Kieswetter and Hildreth were anticipated as successes, it was Trescothick who {{was described as}} having [...] "been in sparkling form all season" [...] and began the tournament under media scrutiny given his previous difficulties playing on tour. There was much speculation regarding any [...] "recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006", as {{this was to be}} his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the BBC World Service which read [...] "I know the risk and I know what happens when it goes wrong. In the last couple of times <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to go on tour it's failed, so of course ... Let's try and break the tradition of what has happened over the last few times... I can only try. It's a big competition for the players and for the club. I have got to try and make it happen." [...] Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was dismissed for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, [...] "after offering a fleeting glimpse of his talent" [...] according to ESPNcricinfo.|$|E

2500|$|Now more {{sought after}} than ever, Capote wrote {{occasional}} brief articles for magazines, and also entrenched himself more {{deeply in the}} world of the jet set.

2500|$|By the 1990s, Keaton had {{established}} herself {{as one of}} the most popular and versatile actors in Hollywood. She shifted to more mature roles, frequently playing matriarchs of middle-class families. Of her role choices and avoidance of becoming typecast, she said: [...] "Most often a particular role does you some good and Bang! You have loads of offers, all of them for similar roles ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to break away from the usual roles and have tried my hand at several things." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{riddle of}} the early Academy is epitomized in the {{discrepancy}} between Aristotle's account of Plato's theory of ideas and that theory {{as we know it}} from Plato's writings. To explain that discrepancy, scholars have constructed the hypothesis of an oral Platonic doctrine. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to show that that hypothesis is unsatisfactory not only because the evidence for Plato's one attested lecture fails to support it, but also because the inconsistency in Aristotle's testimony itself appears to contradict it… ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Bloom {{credited}} Northrop Frye as his nearest precursor. He told Imre Salusinszky in 1986: [...] "In {{terms of}} my own theorizations... the precursor proper has to be Northrop Frye.
