40|$|Reduced {{intensity}} conditioning (RIC) {{is desirable}} for {{hematopoietic stem cell}} (HSC) gene therapy applications. However, low gene marking was previously observed in gene therapy trials, suggesting that RIC might be insufficient for (i) opening niches for efficient engraftment and/or (ii) inducing immunological tolerance for transgene-encoded proteins. Therefore, we evaluated both engraftment and tolerance for <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> using our rhesus HSC gene therapy model following RIC. We investigated a dose de-escalation of total body irradiation (TBI) from our standard dose of 10 Gy (10, 8, 6, and 4 Gy), in which rhesus CD 34 + cells were transduced with a VSVG-pseudotyped chimeric HIV- 1 vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) (or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)). At ∼ 6 months after transplantation, higher-dose TBI resulted in higher gene marking with logarithmic regression in peripheral blood cells. We then evaluated immunological tolerance for <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells,</b> and found that lower-dose TBI allowed vigorous anti-GFP antibody production with logarithmic regression, while no significant anti-VSVG antibody formation was observed among all TBI groups. These data suggest that higher-dose TBI improves both engraftment and immunological tolerance for <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells.</b> Additional immunosuppression might be required in RIC to induce tolerance for transgene products. Our findings should be valuable for developing conditioning regimens for HSC gene therapy applications...|$|E

We examined the long-term safety of MGMTP 140 K selection in a clinically relevant dog model. Based on the association of provirus integration and proto-oncogene activation leading to leukemia in the X-linked immunodeficiency trial, we focused our analysis {{on the distribution of}} retrovirus integration sites (RIS) relative to proto-oncogene transcription start sites (TSS). We analyzed RIS near proto-oncogene TSS before (n = 157) and after (n = 129) chemotherapy in dogs that received MGMTP 140 K <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> and identified no overall increase of RIS near proto-oncogene TSS after chemotherapy. We also wanted to determine whether in vivo selected cells retained fundamental characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells. To that end, we performed secondary transplantation of MGMTP 140 K <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> after in vivo selection in dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) –matched dogs. <b>Gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> achieved multilineage repopulation, and we identified the same gene-modified clone in both dogs more than 800 and 900 days after transplantation. These data suggest that MGMTP 140 K selection is well tolerated and should allow clinically for selection of gene-corrected cells in genetic or infectious diseases or chemoprotection for treatment of malignancy...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{clinical}} trials in HIV-infected patients involving infusion of T cells protected by an antiviral gene {{have failed to}} show any therapeutic beneﬁt. The value of such a treatment approach is thus still highly controversial. In this study, the anticipated effects of <b>gene-modiﬁed</b> <b>cells</b> on virus and T-cell kinetics are analysed by mathematical modeling. Because technically {{only a small fraction}} of all T cells in a patient can be manipulated ex vivo, therapeutic success will depend on the accumulation of <b>gene-modiﬁed</b> <b>cells</b> after infusion into the patient by in vivo selection. Our simulations predict that a signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁt is conferred only by antiviral genes that inhibit HIV replication before virus integration (class I genes). Genes that inhibit viral protein expression (class II, used in previous {{clinical trials}}), require a much higher inhibitory activity than class I genes to promote the regeneration of T cells and reduce the viral load. Inhibition of virus assembly and release alone (class III) confers no selective advantage to the T cell and is therefore ineffective unless combined with class I (or, possibly, class II) genes. Also crucial in determining the clinical outcome are the regenerative capacity of the <b>gene-modiﬁed</b> <b>cells</b> and the level of HIV replication in the patient. These results can be important for guiding future strategies in the ﬁeld of gene therapy for HIV infection...|$|E

Currently, along with advances in synthetic immunology, <b>gene-modified</b> T <b>cells</b> retargeted to defined tumor antigens have been introduced as “cellular drugs”. As the functional properties of the adoptive immune response mediated by T lymphocytes are decisively regulated by their T-cell receptors (TCRs), transfer of genes encoding target antigen-specific receptors should enable polyclonal T cells to be uniformly redirected toward cancer cells. Clinically, anticancer adoptive immunotherapy using genetically engineered T cells has an impressive track record. Notable examples include the dramatic benefit of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) <b>gene-modified</b> T <b>cells</b> redirected towards CD 19 in patients with B-cell malignancy, and the encouraging results obtained with TCR <b>gene-modified</b> T <b>cells</b> redirected towards NY-ESO- 1, a cancer-testis antigen, in patients with advanced melanoma and synovial cell sarcoma.

Gene modification of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) {{has the potential}} to cure genetic, malignant and acquired diseases. Despite success in pre-clinical gene therapy studies, achieving genetic correction or a therapeutic response in humans has been challenging. HIV- 1 -based lentivirus vectors have come to the forefront of pre-clinical studies due to their ability to more effectively transduce quiescent HSCs. Drug resistance gene expression coupled to chemotherapy after HSC transplantation may support in vivo selection of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> while protecting the patient from chemotoxicity. We hypothesized that lentivirus-mediated transfer of a methotrexate (MTX) resistance gene, Tyr 22 -dihydrofolate reductase (Tyr 22 -DHFR), into stem cells would support long-term stable gene expression in vivo and protect hematopoietic daughter cells from MTX toxicity. To test our hypothesis, we first generated high-titer lentivirus vectors expressing Tyr 22 -DHFR and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in different genetic configurations, and then compared MTX resistance, enzyme activity and GFP fluorescence in mouse and human cell lines including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Tyr 22 -DHFR-HSCs protected transplanted mice from MTX myelotoxicity, and conferred a significant survival advantage compared to MTX treated GFP-HSC transplanted mice. To assess the feasibility of a physiologic scale-up in a large animal model, we demonstrated DHFR-GFP expression in canine CD 34 + cells and long-term engraftment of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo. MTX administration increased gene-marking in the peripheral blood of one dog, without causing cytopenia. We also defined the optimal priming of HSCs (c-G-CSF/c-SCF BM), transduction conditions and MTX tolerated doses in dogs. Finally, we present a novel application of selective expansion of hESCs-derived cells in mouse xenografts. Methotrexate-resistant (MTXr) -DHFR hESCs gave rise to MTXr-GFP+ teratomas, indicating that that <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> retain their pluripotency during MTX treatment. MTXr-hESCs placed in stromal cell co-culture differentiated into GFP+ hemato-endothelial cells, including CD 34 +CD 45 + subsets, which subsequently gave rise to MTXr-hematopoietic colony forming cells (CFCs). Finally, we showed that MTX administration of mice bearing hESC xenografts supported in vivo selection of Tyr 22 -DHFR-hESC-hematopoietic cells and increased engraftment of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> in the bone marrow of treated mice. Taken together, these results show that lentivirus vectors effectively transduce MTXr-DHFR into HSCs, thereby preventing life-threatening myelotoxicity (as observed in our mouse studies), and supporting long-term engraftment of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo. These studies mark significant progress of MTX resistance gene therapy toward clinical trials in humans...|$|E
40|$|A {{naturally}} occurring 32 -base pair deletion of the HIV- 1 co-receptor CCR 5 has demonstrated protection against HIV infection of human CD 4 + T cells. Recent genetic engineering approaches using engineered nucleases {{to disrupt the}} gene and mimic this mutation show promise for HIV therapy. We developed a megaTAL nuclease targeting the third extracellular loop of CCR 5 that we delivered to primary human T cells by mRNA transfection. The CCR 5 megaTAL nuclease established resistance to HIV in cell lines and disrupted the expression of CCR 5 on primary human CD 4 + T cells with a high efficiency, achieving up to 80 % modification of the locus in primary cells as measured by molecular analysis. <b>Gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> engrafted at levels equivalent to unmodified cells when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, genetically modified CD 4 + cells were preferentially expanded during HIV- 1 infection in vivo in an immunodeficient mouse model.

40|$|The in vivo {{persistence}} of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> can {{be limited by}} host immune responses to transgene-encoded proteins. In this study we evaluated in a nonhuman primate model whether the administration of a nonmyeloablative regimen consisting of low-dose total-body irradiation with 200 cGy followed by immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporin A for 28 and 35 days, respectively, {{could be used to}} facilitate {{persistence of}} autologous gene-modified T cells when a transgene-specific immune response had already been established or to induce long-lasting tolerance in unprimed recipients. Two macaques (Macaca nemestrina) received infusions of T cells transduced to express either the enhanced green fluorescent protein and neomycin phosphotransferase genes or the hygromycin phosphotransferase and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase genes. In the absence of immunosuppression, both macaques developed potent class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD 8 + cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses that rapidly eliminated the gene-modified T cells and that persisted long term as memory CTL. Treatment with the nonmyeloablative regimen failed to abrogate preexisting memory CTL responses but interfered with the induction of transgene-specific CTL and facilitated in vivo persistence of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> in an unprimed host. However, sustained tolerance to gene-modified T cells was not achieved with this regimen, indicating that further modifications will be required to permit sustained persistence of gene-modified T cells...|$|E

40|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hES Cs) are an attractive alternative cell source for hematopoietic gene therapy applications as the cells are easily modified with lentiviral or other vectors and can be subsequently induced to differentiate into hematopoietic progenitor cells. However, demonstration of the full hematopoietic potential of hESC-derived progeny is challenging due to low marrow engraftment {{and the difficulty of}} detecting cells in the peripheral blood of human/mouse xenografts. Methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy coupled with expression of a drug resistant dihydrofolate reductase such as Tyr 22 (Tyr 22 DHFR) has the potential to selectively increase engraftment of <b>gene-modified</b> human hematopoietic <b>cells</b> in mice, which would allow for better phenotypic characterization of hESC-derived cells in vivo. We showed that hES Cs transduced with Tyr 22 DHFR-GFP encoding lentivirus vectors differentiate into MTX resistant (MTXr) hemato-endothelial cells. MTX treatment of immunodeficient mice infused with Tyr 22 DHFR hESC-derived hemato-endothelial cells increased the long-term engraftment of human cells in the bone marrow of MTX-treated mice. In contrast to previous studies, these results indicate that MTX administration has the potential to support in vivo selection that is maintained after cessation of treatment. The MTX/Tyr 22 DHFR system may therefore be useful for enrichment of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cell</b> populations in human stem cell and gene therapy applications...|$|R

Recently, a patient was successfully transplanted with allogeneic, naturally resistant CCR 5 -negative (CCR 5 D 32) cells, {{setting the stage for}} transplantation of naturally resistant, or genetically modified stem cells as a viable therapy for AIDS. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy using vectors that express various anti-HIV transgenes has also been attempted in clinical trials, but inefficient gene transfer in these studies has severely limited the potential of this approach. Here we evaluated HSC gene transfer of an anti-HIV vector in the pigtailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) model, which closely models human transplantation. Methods and Findings: We used lentiviral vectors that inhibited both HIV- 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) /HIV- 1 (SHIV) chimera virus infection, and also expressed a P 140 K mutant methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) transgene to select <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> by adding chemotherapy drugs. Following transplantation and MGMT-mediated selection we demonstrated transgene expression in over 7 % of stem-cell derived lymphocytes.

40|$|Purpose: Immune {{responses}} to <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> are a {{concern in the}} field of human gene therapy, as they may impede effective treatment. We conducted 2 clinical trials in which cancer patients were treated with lymphocytes genetically engineered to express murine T-cell receptors (mTCR) specific for tumor-associated antigens p 53 and gp 100. Experimental Design: Twenty-six patients treated with autologous lymphocytes expressing mTCR had blood and serum samples available for analysis. Patient sera were assayed {{for the development of a}} humoral immune response. Adoptive cell transfer characteristics were analyzed to identify correlates to immune response. Results: Six of 26 (23 %) patients' posttreatment sera exhibited specific binding of human anti-mTCR antibodies to lymphocytes transduced with the mTCR. Antibody development was found in both responding and nonresponding patients. The posttreatment sera of 3 of these 6 patients mediated a 60 % to 99 % inhibition of mTCR activity as measured by a reduction in antigen-specific interferon-γ release. Detailed analysis of posttreatment serum revealed that antibody binding was α-chain specific in 1 patient whereas it was α-chain specific in another. Conclusions: A subset of patients treated with mTCR-engineered T cells developed antibodies directed to the mTCR variable regions and not to the constant region domains common to all mTCR. Overall, the development of a host immune response was not associated with the level of transduced cell persistence or response to therapy. In summary, patients treated with mTCR can develop an immune response to <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> in a minority of cases, but this may not affect clinical outcome...|$|E

Consequently, a number of clinical protocols have been developed to treat cancer patients with cytokine <b>gene-modified</b> tumour <b>cells.</b> Here, we report the results of a clinical phase I trial using for the first time autologous, interleukin 7 <b>gene-modified</b> tumour <b>cells</b> for vaccination of ten patients with disseminated malignant melanoma. Melanoma cells were expanded in vitro from surgically removed metastases, transduced by a ballistic gene transfer technique and were then injected after in vitro irradiation s. c. at weekly intervals. Clinically, there was no major toxicity except for mild fever, and no major clinical response towards vaccination was observed. Eight of ten patients completed the initial three s. c. vaccinations and were eligible for immunological evaluation. Post vaccination, peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were found to contain an increased number of tumour-reactive proliferative as well as cytolytic cells, as determined by a limiting dilution analysis. In three of six patients, the frequencies of anti-melanoma cytolytic precursor cells increased between 2. 6 - and 28 -fold. Two of these patients showed a minor clinical response. Analysis of the autologous tumour cell vaccines regarding IL- 7 secretion after gene transfer, HLA class I and class II cell surface expression, secretion of immunosuppressive mediators (TGF-beta 1, IL- 10) and various melanoma-associated tumour antigens revealed a very diverse expression profile. In conclusion, vaccination using <b>gene-modified</b> autologous melanoma <b>cells</b> induced immunological changes in a group of advanced, terminally ill patients. These changes can be interpreted as an increased anti-tumour immune response. However, immunological modulation was most pronounced in patients in good physical condition. Therefore, patients with minimal tumour load or minimal residual disease might preferentially benefit from tumour cell vaccination in further studies. In order to evaluate the effects of the cytokine <b>gene-modified</b> tumour <b>cell</b> vaccines more precisely, an antigenically better defined vaccine is needed...|$|R

In a clinical study in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients with CAR T cells specific for carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), we observed toxicities that (most likely) indicated in vivo function of CAR T cells as well as low T cell persistence and clinical response rates. The latter observations were confirmed by later clinical trials in other solid tumor types and other <b>gene-modified</b> T <b>cells.</b> To improve the efficacy of T cell therapy, we have redefined in vitro conditions to generate T cells with young phenotype, a key correlate with clinical outcome. For their impact on <b>gene-modified</b> T <b>cell</b> phenotype and function, we have tested various anti-CD 3 /CD 28 mAb-based T cell activation and expansion conditions {{as well as several}} cytokines prior to and/or after gene transfer using two different receptors: CAIX CAR and MAGE-C 2 (ALK) /HLA-A 2 TCR.

Using muscle-specific cDNA derived from LVhMyoD <b>gene-modified</b> patient <b>cells,</b> we identified a female carrier bearing a large dystrophin deletion and a previously unidentified non-coding splice-site mutation within dystrophin in a Becker muscular dystrophy patient. This study highlights the significant potential of lentiviral MyoD-forced myogenesis for study of a wide range of human muscle disorders; a field constrained by the limited availability of human tissue. LVhMyoD <b>gene-modified</b> patient <b>cells</b> provide a renewable source of mutant protein and muscle-specific mRNA, facilitating accelerated mutation screening of large genes, molecular analyses of splicing abnormalities and study of disease-causing mutation...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of an inducible suicide gene {{such as the}} herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) might allow exploitation of the antitumor activity of donor T cells after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) without graft versus host disease. However, HSV-TK is foreign, and immune responses to <b>gene-modified</b> T <b>cells</b> could lead to their premature elimination. We show that after the infusion of HSV-TK–modified donor T cells to HCT recipients, CD 8 + and CD 4 + T-cell responses to HSV-TK are rapidly induced and coincide with the disappearance of transferred cells. Cytokine flow cytometry using an overlapping panel of HSV-TK peptides allowed rapid detection and quantitation of HSV-TK–specific T cells in the blood and identified multiple immunogenic epitopes. Repeated infusion of modified T cells boosted the induced HSV-TK–specific T cells, which persisted as memory cells. These studies demonstrate the need for nonimmunogenic suicide genes and identify a strategy for detection of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell responses to transgene products that should be generally applicable to monitoring patients on gene therapy trials. The potency of <b>gene-modified</b> T <b>cells</b> to elicit robust and durable immune responses imply this approach might be used for vaccination to elicit T-cell responses to viral or tumor antigens...|$|R
40|$|Retroviral vectors have induced subtle clonal skewing in many {{gene therapy}} {{patients}} and severe clonal proliferation and leukemia {{in some of}} them, emphasizing the need for comprehensive integration site analyses to assess the biosafety and genomic pharmacokinetics of vectors and clonal fate of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo. Integration site analyses such as linear amplification-mediated PCR (LAM-PCR) require a restriction digest generating unevenly small fragments of the genome. Here we show that each restriction motif allows for identification of {{only a fraction of}} all genomic integrants, hampering the understanding and prediction of biological consequences after vector insertion. We developed a model to define genomic access to the viral integration site that provides optimal restriction motif combinations and minimizes the percentage of nonaccessible insertion loci. We introduce a new nonrestrictive LAM-PCR approach that has superior capabilities for comprehensive unbiased integration site retrieval in preclinical and clinical samples independent of restriction motifs and amplification inefficienc...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, {{the most}} common adult primary {{malignant}} brain tumor, confers poor prognosis (median survival of 15 months) notwithstanding aggressive treatment. Combination chemotherapy including carmustine (BCNU) or temozolomide (TMZ) with the MGMT inhibitor O 6 -benzylguanine (O 6 BG) has been used, but {{has been associated with}} dose-limiting hematopoietic toxicity. OBJECTIVE: To assess safety and efficacy of a retroviral vector encoding the O 6 BG-resistant MGMTP 140 K gene for transduction and autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in MGMT unmethylated, newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients in an attempt to chemoprotect bone marrowduring combination O 6 BG/TMZ therapy. METHODS: Three patients have been enrolled in the first cohort. Patients underwent standard radiation therapy without TMZ followed by G-CSF mobilization, apheresis, and conditioning with 600 mg/m 2 BCNU prior to infusion of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells.</b> Posttransplant, patients were treated with 28 -day cycles of single doseTMZ (472 mg/m 2) with 48 -hour intravenous O 6 BG (120 mg/m 2 bolus, then 30 mg/m 2 /d). RESULTS: The BCNU dose was nonmyeloablative with ANC, 500 /mL for ≤ 3 d and nadir thrombocytopenia of 28, 000 /mL. Gene marking in pre-infusion colony forming units (CFUs) was 70. 6 %, 79. 0 %, and 74. 0 % in Patients 1, 2, and 3, respectively, by CFU-PCR. Following engraftment, gene marking in white blood cells and sorted granulocytes ranged between 0. 37 - 0. 84 and 0. 33 - 0. 83 provirus copies, respectively, by real-time PCR. Posttransplant gene marking in CFUs from CD 34 -selected cells ranged from 28. 5 % to 47. 4 %. Patients have received 4, 3, and 2 cycles of O 6 BG/TMZ, respectively, with evidence for selection of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells.</b> One patient has received a single dose-escalated cycle at 590 mg/m 2 TMZ. No additional extra-hematopoietic toxicity has been observed thus far and all three patients exhibit stable disease at 7 - 8 months since diagnosis CONCLUSIONS: We believe that these data demonstrate the feasibility of achieving significant engraftment of MGMTP 140 K-modified cells with a well-tolerated dose of BCNU. Further follow-up will determine whether this approach will allow for further dose escalation of TMZ and improved survival...|$|E
40|$|There is {{currently}} no effective AIDS vaccine, emphasizing {{the importance of}} developing alternative therapies. Recently, a patient was successfully transplanted with allogeneic, naturally resistant CCR 5 -negative (CCR 5 Delta 32) cells, {{setting the stage for}} transplantation of naturally resistant, or genetically modified stem cells as a viable therapy for AIDS. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy using vectors that express various anti-HIV transgenes has also been attempted in clinical trials, but inefficient gene transfer in these studies has severely limited the potential of this approach. Here we evaluated HSC gene transfer of an anti-HIV vector in the pigtailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) model, which closely models human transplantation. We used lentiviral vectors that inhibited both HIV- 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) /HIV- 1 (SHIV) chimera virus infection, and also expressed a P 140 K mutant methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) transgene to select <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> by adding chemotherapy drugs. Following transplantation and MGMT-mediated selection we demonstrated transgene expression in over 7 % of stem-cell derived lymphocytes. The high marking levels allowed us to demonstrate protection from SHIV in lymphocytes derived from gene-modified macaque long-term repopulating cells that expressed an HIV- 1 fusion inhibitor. We observed a statistically significant 4 -fold increase of <b>gene-modified</b> <b>cells</b> after challenge of lymphocytes from one macaque that received stem cells transduced with an anti-HIV vector (p< 0. 02, Student's t-test), but not in lymphocytes from a macaque that received a control vector. We also established a competitive repopulation assay in a second macaque for preclinical testing of promising anti-HIV vectors. The vectors we used were HIV-based and thus efficiently transduce human cells, and the transgenes we used target HIV- 1 genes that are also in SHIV, so our findings can be rapidly translated to the clinic. Here we demonstrate the ability to select protected HSC-derived lymphocytes in vivo in a clinically relevant nonhuman primate model of HIV/SHIV infection. This approach can now be evaluated in human clinical trials in AIDS lymphoma patients. In this patient setting, chemotherapy would not only kill malignant cells, but would also increase the number of MGMTP 140 K-expressing HIV-resistant cells. This approach should allow for high levels of HIV-protected cells in AIDS patients to evaluate AIDS gene therapy...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{vaccination}} against cancer, {{either for}} prophylaxis or therapy, {{has been an}} elusive goal for years. Cytokine gene therapy offers a novel approach to generate immunogenic tumor cell vaccines. To examine the feasibility of cytokine gene transfer into human renal cancer (RC) cells, we introduced the cDNAs for human interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) into various RC cell lines with retroviral vectors. Using the NIH 3 T 3 amplification assay, no replication competent retroviral particles were detectable in cell culture supernatants taken from <b>gene-modified</b> RC <b>cell</b> lines. Efficient expression of both lymphokines was achieved. Depending on the cell line and the vector construct used, lymphokine <b>gene-modified</b> human RC <b>cell</b> lines released 4 to 29 units/ 10 (6) cells of IL- 2, or up to 10 units/ 10 (6) cells of IFN-gamma within 48 h. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of SK-RC- 29 cells releasing IFN-gamma showed increased expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen, beta 2 -microglobulin, and ICAM- 1, as well as induction of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression [human leukocyte antigen(HLA) -DR, -DP], but no changes in these cell surface markers were observed with SK-RC- 29 cells releasing IL- 2. Following in vitro gamma-irradiation with 5, 000 or 10, 000 rad, growth of lymphokine <b>gene-modified</b> RC <b>cells</b> was abrogated, but their capability to release lymphokine and express lymphokine-induced antigenic determinants, such as HLA-DR, was retained. Tumor formation by the human RC cell line SK-RC- 29 in BALB/c nude mice was not affected by IFN-gamma secretion, but was inhibited by in vivo release of IL- 2 from s. c. injected tumor cells. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of retroviral mediated lymphokine-gene transfer into human RC cells and suggest a means for generating autologous or HLA-matched allogeneic tumor cell vaccines {{for the treatment of}} patients with renal cell carcinoma...|$|R

Typically this process is done {{in conjunction with a}} conditioning regimen such as cyclophosphamide, which has been shown to potentiate the effects of infused T-cells. This effect has been attributed to making an immunologic space within which the cells populate. The process as a whole results in an effector cell, typically a T-cell, that can recognize a tumor cell antigen {{in a manner that is}} independent of the major histocompatibility complex and which can initiate a cytotoxic response.|$|R
40|$|Our {{previously}} reported phase I clinical trial with the allogeneic <b>gene–modified</b> tumor <b>cell</b> line RCC- 26 /CD 80 /IL- 2 showed that vaccination was well tolerated and feasible in metastatic {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC) patients. Substantial disease stabilization was observed in most patients despite a high tumor burden at study entry. To investigate alterations in immune responses that might contribute to this effect, we performed an extended immune monitoring that included analysis of reactivity against multiple antigens, cytokine/chemokine changes in serum and determination of the frequencies of immune suppressor cell populations, including natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cell subsets (MDSCs). An overall immune response capacity to virus-derived control peptides was present in 100 % of patients before vaccination. Vaccine-induced immun...|$|R
