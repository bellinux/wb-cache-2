2500|$|The {{production}} of copra – removing the shell, breaking it up, drying – is usually done where the coconut palms grow. Copra {{can be made}} by smoke drying, sun drying, or kiln drying. Hybrid solar drying system [...] is also used to make drying process runs continuously, therefore it will reduce drying time. In hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night. Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight. [...] Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove mold-creating contaminants. [...] After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total). [...] Sun drying is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture. [...] This process can also be reversed, partially drying the copra in the kiln and finishing the process with sunlight. [...] There are advantages and disadvantages in both – starting with sun drying requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with <b>kiln-drying</b> can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun. [...] In India, small but whole coconuts can be dried over the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball. [...] Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white. [...] Coconut meat can be dried using direct heat and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire. [...] The smoke residue can help preserve the half-dried meat but the process overall suffers from unpredictable results and the risk of fires.|$|E

40|$|Observations of Hylotrupes bajulus in <b>kiln-dried</b> timber {{are very}} rare. In Germany, this {{has often been}} {{attributed}} to a preventive effect of the drying process. Commonly assumed explanations for a preventive effect are the loss of substances that attract the insects and the decline in nutrients caused by kiln drying. A {{review of the literature}} has been undertaken and these explanations are not well supported. Seemingly, the main direct effect of kiln drying at temperatures below 100 °C is the killing of all larvae present in the timber before drying. Some indirect effects may also contribute to the reduced risk of infestations in <b>kiln-dried</b> timber, namely <b>kiln-dried</b> timber is often free of wane and therefore free of outer sapwood; it shows a low number of cracks and has a planed surface. Especially the absence of wane may contribute to the scarcity of Hylotrupes in <b>kiln-dried</b> timber...|$|R

5000|$|Mills {{that have}} a kiln on site {{have the option of}} artificially {{accelerating}} the drying process. Green timber is placed inside a large oven, where heat removes moisture from them; however, they can suffer severe checking and cracking if the kiln controls are not properly monitored during the drying process.

50|$|Seed {{dormancy}} is {{a complex}} phenomenon and is not always consistent within species. Cold stratification of white spruce seed to break dormancy has been specified as a requirement, but Heit (1961) and Hellum (1968) regarded stratification as unnecessary. Cone handling and storage conditions affect dormancy in that cold, humid storage (5 °C, 75% to 95% relative humidity) of the cones prior to extraction seemingly eliminated dormancy by overcoming the need to stratify. Periods of cold, damp weather {{during the period of}} cone storage might provide natural cold (stratification) treatment. Once dormancy was removed in cone storage, subsequent <b>kiln-drying</b> and seed storage did not reactivate dormancy.|$|E
40|$|Avoid {{the expense}} of <b>kiln-dried</b> lumber by {{processing}} and drying your own lumber at home. Anyone who has done much woodworking knows how expensive high quality, <b>kiln-dried,</b> hardwood lumber can be. Even <b>kiln-dried</b> construction lumber is expensive. Besides expense, there also may be problems with finding certain species of wood, highly figured wood, or hardwood boards thicker than one inch (4 / 4). One way to avoid these problems is to dry your own lumber. Green, unsurfaced, or unplaned lumber {{can be obtained from}} many small sawmills in Nebraska and surrounding states. You may also want to obtain your own logs and hire a sawmill operator to cut them to your specifications. These logs could come from your own land or could be purchased from a woodlot owner. Even shade trees that need to be removed can sometimes be used in this way...|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} moisture content (MC) of members on the mechanical properties of timber joints, bending tests of precut joints and shear tests of dowel-type joints were carried out using timbers of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D.

For the bending test, timbers were processed with a precut processing machine into “koshikake-ari” (a kind of dovetail joint) and “koshikake-kama” (a kind of mortise and tenon joint). A pair of members was jointed together without mechanical fasteners. Bolts (diameter = 12 [*]mm) and nails (diameter = 2.45 [*]mm) were used as dowels in the shear test.
