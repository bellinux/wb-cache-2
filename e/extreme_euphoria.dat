50|$|Hypomanic episodes. Symptoms of the hypomanic episode {{may include}} {{any of the}} {{following}} conditions: unusually good mood or cheerfulness (<b>euphoria),</b> <b>extreme</b> optimism, inflated self-esteem, rapid speech, racing thoughts, aggressive or hostile behavior, lack of consideration for others, agitation, massively increased physical activity, risky behavior, spending sprees, increased drive to perform or achieve goals, increased sexual drive, decreased need for sleep, tendency to be easily distracted, and inability to concentrate.|$|R
50|$|Asphyxiation {{initially}} {{produces an}} <b>extreme</b> feeling of <b>euphoria</b> leading {{some people to}} intentionally induce temporary asphyxiation. Erotic asphyxiation typically employs strangulation to produce euphoria which enhances masturbation and orgasm. The choking game, prevalent in adolescents, uses brief hypoxia in the brain to achieve euphoria. Strangulation, or hyperventilation followed by breath holding are commonly used to achieve the effects. Accidental deaths occur from both practices but are often mislabeled as suicide.|$|R
5000|$|Those {{who were}} very close to Chávez {{felt that he had}} bipolar disorder. Salvador Navarrete, a {{physician}} that treated Chávez during his first years in the presidency believed that Chávez was bipolar. In 2010, Alberto Müller Rojas, then vice president of Chávez's party, PSUV, stated that Chávez had [...] "a tendency toward cyclothymia--mood swings that range from moments of <b>extreme</b> <b>euphoria</b> to moments of despondence". A different explanation was that such behavior was a tactic used by Chávez in order to attack opponents and polarize.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{prospects}} at stardom look dim until Sarah {{takes an}} audition {{for the film}} The Silver Scream, which is being held by the powerful production company Astraeus Pictures. Her audition is met with a lackluster response by the casting director (Maria Olsen) and the assistant (Marc Senter), and Sarah is summarily dismissed from the room. Upset, Sarah enters a nearby bathroom in the building the auditions are being held in and proceeds to rip her hair out, a move that gains {{the interest of the}} casting director. Wanting to gain the role, Sarah returns to the audition room and reluctantly acquiesces to the casting director's demand that she rip her hair out again in front of them. Once this is completed, Sarah is dismissed again, much to her confusion. She then quits her job to pursue her chance at the movie. She is overjoyed when she gets a callback to a second audition. She eagerly returns to the building and is caught off guard when she is now commanded to disrobe. Sarah again reluctantly agrees to their demands, and after being told to open herself up to the potential to [...] "transform", she experiences <b>extreme</b> <b>euphoria</b> and undergoes a trance state, during which she notices that the casting director is wearing a pentagram necklace. While in this state of euphoria she begins to show mild erratic behaviors, like laughing when one of her friends breaks her nose.|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} book chapter {{does not}} have an abstract. However, I have written an abstract especially for the e-repository. Here it is: Religious life encompasses a wide diversity of situations for which the emotional tone is on a continuum from <b>extreme</b> <b>euphoria</b> to extreme dysphoria. In this book chapter, we propose the novel hypothesis that euphoria and dysphoria have distinctly separate functional consequences for religious evolution and survivability. This is due to the differential cognitive states that are created in euphoric and dysphoric situations. Based on readings from religious studies and cognitive psychology, we propose that euphoria in religion is conducive to social bonding and situations needing lateral thinking and creativity; whereas dysphoria in religion is conducive to situations where precision and analogical reasoning are necessary...|$|E
25|$|With {{evidence}} of reciprocation (real or imagined) from the limerent object, {{a state of}} <b>extreme</b> pleasure, even <b>euphoria,</b> is enjoyed. Thoughts are mainly occupied with considering and reconsidering what is attractive in the limerent object, replaying whatever events may have thus far transpired with the limerent object, and appreciating personal qualities perceived as possibly having sparked interest in the limerent object. At peak crystallization, almost all waking thoughts revolve around the limerent object. After this peak, the feelings eventually decline.|$|R
5000|$|The journal’s name {{is taken}} from Francis Bacon’s utopian novella New Atlantis, which the journal’s editors {{describe}} as a [...] "fable of a society living with the benefits and challenges of advanced science and technology." [...] An editorial in the inaugural issue states that {{the aim of the}} journal is [...] "to help us avoid the <b>extremes</b> of <b>euphoria</b> and despair that new technologies too often arouse; and to help us judge when mobilizing our technological prowess is sensible or necessary, and when the preservation of things that count requires limiting the kinds of technological power that would lessen, cheapen, or ultimately destroy us." [...] Writing for National Review, editor Adam Keiper described The New Atlantis as being written from a [...] "particularly American and conservative way of thinking about both the blessings and the burdens of modern science and technology." [...] New Atlantis authors and bioethicists publishing in other journals have also similarly referred to The New Atlantis as being written from a social conservative stance which utilizes religion.|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{set up an}} {{experiment}} in international relations that arouses the most varied reactions, going from <b>extreme</b> <b>euphoria</b> to nationalist xenophobia. This feeling of confusion is due {{not only to the}} wide range of issues that are embraced nor the organic complexity of the institution, but, principally, to superficial analysis emanating from the traditional doctrine, which still stubbornly lies on the surface, focusing in the appearance of international phenomena, without entering into its real concrete and full essence. Thus, in order to develop a consistent study is fundamental to understand European integration in their most hidden aspects, without disregarding their political and legal form, but up to them until unravelling the reality of its political economy. Up to this point it is possible to understand which lesson could be extracted from European experience to South American reality...|$|E
40|$|Romantic {{love is a}} {{psychological}} state that encompasses <b>extreme</b> <b>euphoria</b> and feelings of passion and intimacy for another individual. It can be characterized using Dr. Helen Fisher’s system of evolutionary, neural, and hormonal profiles that are distinct from those of attraction and attachment, which are two additional love-related processes. A broad review of scientific articles, classic literature, and popular culture is employed to define romantic love, and to explore its distinct evolutionary, neural, and hormonal characteristics. The possibility of romantic love under special circumstances is then explored. The discussion is specifically focused on the prospect of love without physical contact as featured in Spike Jonze’s 2013 film, Her. Results of this literature and research review support the theory that romantic love is an inebriating condition that suppresses judgment, and thus romantic love under these specific conditions is, indeed, possible. Throughout this composition, socio-cultural, evolutionary, psychological, and physiological theoretical perspectives are presented in an informal dialogue to make this topic accessible to an interdisciplinary audience...|$|E
40|$|Altered {{states of}} {{consciousness}} induced by hallucinogens (H-ASC) is still a vaguely understood phenomenon. Taken the diverse psychological effects they exert, the main mechanism of action of hallucinogens; LSD, ibogaine, THC, PCP, MDMA, methamphetamine, mescaline, psilocybin and DMT, of which psychological effects {{are discussed in the}} article, are not properly understood and explained by the modern methods of neuroscience {{due to the lack of}} vigorous research. The involvement of some receptors, such as, 5 -HT 2 (and probably other 5 -HT receptors), glutamate and dopamine receptors, adrenergic and cannabinoid receptors, is one of the mechanisms, however it is not easy to explain such incongruent psychological effects by only receptor and neurotransmitter systems alone, since H-ASCs have, sometimes, their own unity and gestalt, unfolding the subconscious, in the “voyages ” they induce, although the perception may, or may not, be distorted depending on the person, and “set and setting”. They induce visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations; synesthesia; perception of fractals, geometrical and kaleidoscopic images with vivid colors; perception of two dimensional pictures as three dimensional, animated and moving; distortions and alterations in the body perception; alterations in the perceptions of temporal-spatial continuum and time; changes in the perception of the ego and the self; feelings of unification with nature and universe, peak experiences – mimicking satori or nirvana-, ecstasy, rapture, <b>extreme</b> <b>euphoria,</b> excitement and happiness, oceanic bliss, self-fulfillment, referred as “good trip”, as well as, dysphoria, anxiety, mania, delirium, psychosis, acute schizophrenia, collapse of the self...|$|E
40|$|According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, methamphetamine is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} synthetic drug {{on the streets of}} America today (McEwan 2003). It creates an intensely pleasurable and relatively long-lasting high, making it attractive to addicts. Methamphetamine, also called meth, crystal meth, speed, ice, and several other street names, can be manufactured cheaply through easily-obtained, store-bought materials, which makes it a popular drug to be synthesized by those with no knowledge of or experience with chemicals. As a result, meth labs have surfaced all over the United States. Though they are currently more concentrated {{in the western part of}} the country, especially California, they are quickly spreading to encompass even the eastern half (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2006). The consequences of the spread of meth labs are dire, not only because of the drug’s unpleasant effects on its users, but because of the environmental hazards (natural and human) of every methamphetamine lab. This paper will discuss background on methamphetamine and the labs where it is produced; the hazards surrounding its production; and finally the cleanup of existing labs and the prevention of new labs. Methamphetamine is a Schedule II drug, which means that it has high potential for abuse, has few medical uses (it is sometimes prescribed for narcolepsy, attention deficit disorder, and on occasion obesity), and is available only through a non-refillable prescription. When taken recreationally, it is generally ingested, sniffed, smoked, or injected, with ingestion having the least potent effects and injection having the most. Chemically, meth stimulates an excessive 2 release of dopamine in the brain, creating a high for its user that lasts several hours and is followed by an agitated state that can sometimes lead to violent behavior. Prolonged use has numerous negative medical effects (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2006). In the short term, meth causes a rush (<b>extreme</b> <b>euphoria),</b> followed by a high which lasts several hours. Users usually encounter increased wakefulness, a higher level of physical activity, and decreased appetite (hence methamphetamine’s occasional prescription as an anti-obesity drug). People who are using meth often feel an increased sense of well-being (National Institut...|$|E
