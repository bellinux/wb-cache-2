When no water and extra water was added to the reaction medium, the obtained half-lives were 10 and 18 h, respectively.

TRL were isolated from serum at 2, 4, and 6 hours postprandially, and their fatty acid and TG molecular species compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography. The apolipoprotein B concentration was determined by immunoturbidimetry. POMACE and OLIVE, differing mainly in their unsaponifiable fraction, led to similar fatty acid and TG molecular species profiles in postprandial TRL. However, POMACE-TRL presented a higher particle size, estimated as TG to apolipoprotein B ratio, which was also found for the main TG molecular species (trioleoyl-glycerol, palmitoyl-dioleoyl-glycerol, palmitoyl-oeloyl-linoleoyl-glycerol, and dioleoyl-linoleoyl-glycerol). TG from POMACE-TRL also showed higher clearance rates. In this regard, apolar TG (with a higher <b>equivalent</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>number)</b> disappeared more rapidly from TRL particles obtained after the ingestion of either POMACE or OLIVE.

In this study, {{the effect of}} high pressure in the interesterification kinetics of fat blends, in solvent-free medium, catalysed by a commercial immobilized lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosa was evaluated. Reaction media were ternary blends of palm stearin, palm kernel oil and a concentrate of triacylglycerols (TAG) rich in - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Reactions were carried out at 60 ◦C, at 0. 1, 50, 100 and 150 MPa. The interesterification was followed (i) by the decrease in “Solid Fat Content” values of the blend at 35 ◦C (SFC 35 ◦C) and (ii) by {{the changes in the}} acylglycerol profile. The biocatalyst presented interesterification activity at least up to 150 MPa. Results obtained at 0. 1 MPa, with no agitation of the reaction medium, were found to be similar to those obtained under high-pressure conditions.

High pressures seem to affect lipase selectivity towards lauric acid. Batch operational stability tests showed a linear inactivation profile for each pressure. Half-lives of about 15, 6 and 4 h were estimated for the biocatalyst under 0. 1, 50 and 150 MPa, respectivel...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{petroleum}} samples {{at the molecular}} level by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) typically requires a prolonged accumulation of ions and/or summing up a large number of scans. Here, a chip-based micro-ESI system (Advion NanoMate, Ithaca, NY) has been successfully automated in combination with FT-ICR MS analysis {{of petroleum}} samples. A foil-sealed 96 -well glass plate prevents solvent evaporation, with no visible loss of sample after 20 h of continuous operation. Mass spectra obtained from the same sample but taken from different wells after various time delays were very similar. Data from replicate samples in different wells could be combined to enhance mass spectral signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range. Furthermore, the automated data acquisition eliminates sample carryover, and produces heteroatom class distribution, double-bond <b>equivalents</b> (DBE), and <b>carbon</b> <b>number</b> very similar to those from the conventional (manual) micro-ESI experiments...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{environmental}} properties of a crude oil reservoir, only 20 - 30 % of oil product can be recovered using primary and secondary extraction methods. The remaining stranded oil can only be recovered via various enhanced oil recovery methods. Chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) uses specialty chemicals to extract trapped oil in rock layers by generating in-situ microemulsion {{in the presence of}} reservoir brine and oil. In this case study, phase behavior tests are conducted for microemulsion formation between the surfactant solution and the oil. The phase behavior tests model reservoirs with low temperature and low salinity. In order to narrow the selection of surfactants for testing, phase behavior tests and interfacial tension experiments were used to determine the <b>equivalent</b> alkane <b>carbon</b> <b>number</b> (EACN) of the oil in this reservoir. Along with phase testing, extensive interfacial tension measurements were carried out with the model oil and the reservoir fluid at various salinities. The reservoir sample oil was determined to have an EACN of around 12, which effectively models the hydrocarbon part of the multicomponent crude oil similar to a dodecane system. These results facilitate in method development for EACN determination and in the selection of the surfactants that will create optimum emulsion for high efficiency oil recovery in low temperature and low salinity reservoirs typical to the Illinois basin in the United States...|$|R

40|$|A dynamic {{multimedia}} fugacity {{model was}} used to evaluate the partitioning and fate of petroleum hydrocarbon fractions and aromatic indicator compounds within the soil oil matrix of three biopiles Each biopile was characterised by four compartments air, water, soil solids and non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) Equilibrium partitioning in biopile A and B suggested that most fractions resided in the NAPL, {{with the exception of the}} aromatic fraction with an <b>equivalent</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>number</b> from 5 to 7 (EC 5 - 7) In Blopile C, which had the highest soil organic carbon content (13 %), the soil solids were the most important compartment for both light aliphatic fractions (EC 5 - 6 and EC 6 - 8) and aromatic fractions, excluding the EC 16 - 21 and EC 21 - 35 Our starting hypothesis was that hydrocarbons do not degrade within the NAPL This was supported by the agreement between predicted and measured hydrocarbon concentrations in Biopile B when the degradation rate constant in NAPL was set to zero In all scenarios, biodegradation in soil was predicted as the dominant removal process for all fractions, except for the aliphatic EC 5 - 6 which was predominantly lost via volatilization. The absence of an explicit NAIL phase in the model yielded a similar prediction of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) behaviour, however the predicted concentrations in the air and water phases were significantly increased with consequent changes in potential mobility Further comparisons between predictions and measured data, particularly concentrations in the soil mobile phases, are required to ascertain the true value of including an explicit NAPL in models of this kind (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} why Aerosol-OT (sodium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate) is such {{a versatile}} Surfactant, adsorption and aggregation in aqueous solutions have been investigated with 11 different AOT-related compounds. The first set, denoted di-CnSS with n = 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, contain linear chains. In addition six different branched chain systems have been studied, including Aerosol-OT itself. These surfactants span extremes of branching, from 3, 5, 5 -trimethyl- 1 -hexyl, through 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexyl (AOT), to 1 -ethyl- 2 -methyl- 1 -pentyl, and therefore {{it is possible to}} delineate structure-performance relationships. For one model compound, di-C 6 SS, adsorption studies were made with two complementary techniques, drop volume tensiometry (DVT) and neutron reflection (NR). The tensiometrically derived area per molecule at the critical micelle concentration Acmc was 60 ± 3 angstroms 2, which is in excellent agreement with that obtained directly by neutrons, 59 ± 2 angstroms 2. The procedures for obtaining a sufficiently high surface chemical purity and the application of the Gibbs equation, to achieve agreement between DVT and NR, are discussed. Partial structure factor experiments with di-C 6 SS gave quantitative information on the interfacial structure in terms of surfactant and solvent distributions, and the results are compared with those obtained previously for AOT. For the di-CnSS systems classic effects of chain Carbon number on surface tension behavior, critical micelle concentrations (cmc's), and Acmc were observed. With the branched chain compounds a significant increase in Acmc was found, between 10 and 20 angstroms 2, over those for <b>equivalent</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>number</b> straight chain systems. Furthermore, slight variations in Acmc were detected, reflecting changes in packing owing to differing extents of chain branching. The efficiency of packing was correlated with chain structure by introducing an empirical branching factor. In dilute aqueous systems regular Aerosol-OT behaves in a readily understandable fashion, fitting into the general pattern of behavior for all these sulfosuccinates: no special effects due to the 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexyl chains were noted...|$|E
40|$|A {{single stage}} {{reversed}} phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP HPLC) separation of animal fat triacylglycerols (TAGs) {{has been developed}} for coupling with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry using an ion trap mass spectrometer. The method developed offers significant improvements on existing methods for TAG analysis, giving better resolution of TAGs with similar <b>equivalent</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>number</b> (ECN), and good separation of TAGs with odd ECN and TAG regioisomers of animal fats. Although the analysis times for chromatographic analysis of these TAGs are long, this is compensated by better separation of highly unsaturated TAGs. Development of an ultra high performance liquid chromatography method has reduced the run time by half, while maintaining separation and resolution. The TAG profiles of fats reflect their fatty acid (FA) compositions, showing {{a high proportion of}} unsaturated FAs for chicken and pork, whereas, saturated FAs are dominant in the major TAGs detected in beef and lamb. The improved RP HPLC separation of TAGs developed in this study has been shown to give more reliable discrimination of different animal species than previous methods including analysis of FAs as the methyl esters and RP HPLC separations of intact TAGs. All animal species separated well in the principal component analysis (PCA) plot of TAG profiles, whereas in the PCA plot of FA, chicken plots very close to pork fat, particularly ham. The profiles of TAGs in animal species highlight a number of components that are important for species discrimination. The meat products of different species (beef, pork, chicken and lamb) cooked by microwave, roasting and currying are separated well in the PCA scores plot. This work shows that the discrimination of meat from different animal species is possible for both raw and cooked meat products, and reveals that the differences produced by the various cooking methods were less than the variations observed between species. The loadings values for the scores plot of TAGs for raw and cooked meat products are similar to the raw meat in different animal species and have the same important descriptors for discrimination. Hence, analysis of intact TAGs in cooked food products has considerable potential for detection of adulteration of cooked meat-based food products. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} this project was to characterize and test current and next generation high performance surfactants for improved chemical flooding technology, focused on reservoirs in the Pennsylvanian-aged (Penn) sands. In order to meet this objective the characteristic curvatures (Cc) of twenty-eight anionic surfactants selected for evaluation for use in chemical flooding formulations were determined. The Cc values ranged from - 6. 90 to 2. 55 with the majority having negative values. Crude oil samples from nine Penn sand reservoirs were analyzed for several properties pertinent to surfactant formulation for EOR application. These properties included <b>equivalent</b> alkane <b>carbon</b> <b>numbers,</b> total acid numbers, and viscosity. The brine samples from these same reservoirs were analyzed for several cations and for total dissolved solids. Surfactant formulations were successfully developed for eight reservoirs {{by the end of}} the project period. These formulations were comprised of a tertiary mixture of anionic surfactants. The identities of these surfactants are considered proprietary, but suffice to say the surfactants in each mixture were comprised of varying chemical structures. In addition to the successful development of surfactant formulations for EOR, there were also two successful single-well field tests conducted. There are many aspects that must be considered in the development and implementation of effective surfactant formulations. Taking into account these other aspects, there were four additional studies conducted during this project. These studies focused on the effect of the stability of surfactant formulations in the presence of polymers with an associated examination of polymer rheology, the effect of the presence of iron complexes in the brine on surfactant stability, the potential use of sacrificial agents in order to minimize the loss of surfactant to adsorption, and the effect of electrolytes on surfactant adsorption. In these last four studies the effects of such things as temperature, electrolyte concentration and the effect of different types of electrolytes were taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{indicator of}} the metabolic capacity of humans {{is the ability to}} regulate plasma triacylglycerol levels and to clear triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) from the circulation after a meal. This is crucial since most of the day is spent in the postprandial state. High concentrations and long circulation times of TRL remnants may be detrimental since these are considered to be highly atherogenic. Postprandial effects of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in men and women are poorly characterized. A new ALA-rich oil was produced from rapeseed and linseed oil by enzymatic interesterification. The postprandial effects of 3 meals containing 35 g of this new ALA-rich oil, olive oil, or butter were compared in two randomized crossover studies (26 men and 19 premenopausal women). Blood samples were drawn at regular intervals up to 7 h after the meals. We hypothesized that the postprandial lipid response might be attenuated by a preferential oxidation of ALA compared to other long chain dietary fatty acids. Premenopausal women showed lower postprandial lipemia and were less sensitive to variations in dietary fat than men. Butter resulted in lower postprandial lipemia than the oils in men, whereas no such difference was seen in the women. The ALA oil and olive oil meals induced similar plasma triacylglycerol concentrations. Women showed significantly lower NEFA responses after the olive oil and butter meals than men. The ALA-rich oil had significant effects on the different plasma lipid fractions and decreased the n- 6 :n- 3 ratio in plasma several hours postprandially. ALA levels remained high in plasma triacylglycerols and NEFA even after 5 - 7 h. This late high concentration of ALA in NEFA is indicative of spill-over NEFA and/or preferential release of ALA by the adipose tissue into the circulation. In summary we did thus not find evidence that ALA has a beneficial effect on postprandial lipids by a selective partitioning to oxidation. This does not exclude the possibility that ALA over a longer time period may have health effects not only as precursor of longer chain n- 3 fatty, primarily docosahexaenoic acid, but also because it is sorted out for oxidation. The enzymatic interesterification of triacylglycerols using immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (Lipozyme TL IM) as catalyst has also been investigated. Three different reaction systems were studied: rapeseed oil + butter, rapeseed oil + linseed oil (ALA oil), and trilaurin + 1, 3 -palmitin- 2 -olein. The ALA oil (35 % ALA) was the same as that used in the meal studies. All reactions were followed by reversed-phase HPLC and the triacylglycerol peaks were tentatively identified by calculating <b>equivalent</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>numbers.</b> The triacylglycerols in the rapeseed oil + butter mixture and products were also identified by HPLC-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. In ideal sn- 1, 3 -specific lipase-catalyzed interesterification, the fatty acid composition in the sn- 2 position remains constant. In practice, however, slight changes are observed in the sn- 2 position and, under certain conditions, a completely randomized fatty acid distribution can be obtained. Randomization is slower than interesterification. Uncontrolled hydrolysis should, however, be avoided as it lowers the TAG yield. Different triacylglycerol mixtures, i. e. products originating from 1, 3 -specific interesterification as well as totally or partially randomized products, can be produced by varying the reaction time. Enzymatic interesterification {{could be used as a}} method of designing dietary oils with new properties regarding fatty acid composition, susceptibility to oxidation and effects on blood lipids. The future of enzymatic processes relies on efficient, flexible, and easy-to-use systems that ensure high stability of the enzyme preparation and stable output of high-quality products at a reasonable cost...|$|R
