25|$|In the fairy-tale play The Twelve Months by Russian writer Samuil Marshak, a greedy queen decrees that {{a basket}} of gold coins shall be rewarded to anyone who can bring her galanthus flowers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> winter.

25|$|The bridge has {{not always}} been the source of tragedy, the evening of the 18th of May 1969 is fondly remembered by many of the {{community}} when a truck laden with Bushmills and Cream of Barley Whiskey was traveling from Antrim to Dublin when its brakes failed coming down the hill and it rolled over the bridge wall into the river some 3 meters or so below, the driver survived and was brought to Hospital but the entire loot of liquor was strewn across the river bottom.

25|$|Around 1577, Semyon Stroganov {{and other}} sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a Cossack leader called Yermak {{to protect their}} lands from the attacks of Siberian Khan Kuchum.

In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of Siberia. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on Irtysh River in a 3-day Battle of Chuvash Cape in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the steppes, and thus Yermak captured the Siberia Khanate, including its capital Qashliq near modern Tobolsk.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1900 s the Everett Mills, {{like all the}} other Lawrence mills were staffed mainly with European {{immigrants}} who were underpaid and overworked. When a law was passed in Massachusetts reducing the maximum number of hours that could be worked weekly by women and children, the mill owners reduced their workers’ pay accordingly and the Bread and Roses strike of 1912 erupted. Believing that a workforce of women and ethnically self-segregated immigrants living paycheck to paycheck could never band together to achieve a common goal, the mill owners were proved wrong with the strike that shut down the mills for two months <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> winter. Originating with female Polish weavers at the Everett Mills who revolted upon receiving pay reduced by thirty-two cents, soon 20,000 millworkers were on strike. Helped by the Industrial Workers of the World labor union who organized meetings with representatives from all affected ethnic communities, fundraisers to support the millworkers while they were on strike, and highly visible protests meant to arouse nationwide support and outrage at national labor norms, the workers won pay increases and time-and-a-quarter for overtime work. The strike had far reaching consequences across the country when mill owners in other cities and states voluntarily raised pay in fear of similar uprisings by their own workers.|$|E

500|$|Leftover or {{partially}} eaten food (Ucchishta) {{is recommended}} {{to be offered}} to Matangi with the devotee in the polluted Ucchishta state, that is, having eaten but not washed, with the remains of food in the mouth and hands. Offering of leftovers to Hindu deities or being in the polluted Ucchishta state is a taboo in mainstream Hinduism. Another taboo that is broken in Matangi worship is the offering to the goddess of a cloth stained with menstrual blood to gain the ability to attract a mate. Menstrual blood is considered polluted in almost all Hindu scriptures and menstruating women are kept away from Hindu worship and temples. The outcaste Matangi community of Nepal collect polluted substances and items related to death and bad luck such as sacrificial animal heads and clothes of the deceased, and offers them at special stones kept at crossroads called chwasas, where the [...] "dangerous" [...] Matangi [...] "consumes" [...] them as an offering, thereby {{getting rid of the}} pollution. The Tantrasara also advises offerings to Matangi of meat, fish, cooked rice, milk and incense at crossroads or cremations grounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> the night to overpower enemies and gain poetic talent. Oblations of Ucchishta, cat meat and goat meat to the goddess are said to help achieve Supreme knowledge.

500|$|Indian {{campaign}}— The Indian {{campaign is}} about the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and deals with a situation very similar to Chayton Black's situation in [...] campaign: [...] "Shadow". The protagonist is Lieutenant Nanib Sahir (a portmanteau name of Nana Sahib), {{a member of the}} Sepoy regiments who served the British East India Company, who slowly becomes disillusioned by its cruel ways and abuse of Indian citizens. The campaign begins with Nanib and his superior, Colonel George Edwardson, regaining British control of the saltpetre trade in the Punjab. Nanib and Edwardson then march south to Calcutta and defeat the roving bands of arsonists there. At the close of the battle, Nanib convinces a group of arsonists to lay down their weapons and leave, but Edwardson's men ambush and massacre them, leaving Nanib visibly shaken. The conflict of Nanib's loyalty comes to a head when he and his men are ordered by the Colonel Edwardson to use new Enfield Rifles despite the cartridges' greasing with beef tallow and pork fat, which is a taboo to the sepoys' Hindu and Muslim beliefs. Nanib uses one of the rifles to fire a near miss at Edwardson (loosely based on a similar incident involving Mangal Pandey), killing one of his soldiers. Nanib and fellow sepoy Pravar Patel then lead their regiment of sepoy in an attack on the local Company fort by assaulting weapon caches to cause fires and explosions under its foundations. After their victory, Nanib and Pravar quickly rally the local citizens and sepoys, raising enormous forces. Although Nanib denies leadership of the revolt, he and Pravar decide to rescue Bahadur Shah II from British captivity when the Shah declares himself supreme ruler of India. They sneak into Delhi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> night and destroy weapon caches to cause elephant stampedes, which destroy various city gates. Along the way, they find more rebels who help them battle through Delhi, freeing the Shah and escaping into the night. Nanib subsequently leads his forces in an assault on a Company fort commanded by Colonel Edwardson. Nanib destroys or captures the saltpetre sites and plantations supplying Edwardson's forces inside the fort and fends off three counterattacks. Finally, he assaults the fort and captures its outer defenses, including the fixed guns, mortally wounding Edwardson in the process before destroying the fort's command post. When the heat of battle fades, Nanib approaches a dying Edwardson, who threatens and curses the Indians, saying that the Company is a much larger and more powerful force than all of India. Nanib replies by explaining that no military force can kill the Indians' passion for their country. After Edwardson breathes his last breath, Nanib and Pravar leave to begin a long and costly war against the Company, and three rebel sepoys are seen lowering the Company's flag from the nearby flagpost.|$|E
