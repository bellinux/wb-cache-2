5|$|During {{his time}} in Kansas, Beilhart obsessively {{investigated}} a variety of beliefs, including Christian Science, Divine Science, Spiritualism, and Theosophy. He found, however, {{that none of these}} religions held his interest. In time, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> realization that he would not adhere to any one denomination, but develop a faith of his own by combining aspects of several different religions.|$|E

He began his studies at University College London in September 2005, where {{he was president of}} the school's Islamic society in 2006 and 2007, during which time he participated in, along with political discussions, such activities as martial arts and paintballing.

5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. Unlike his brothers, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne as a grown man.

He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until {{the last few weeks}} of her life.

He scored an unbeaten 35 to ensure that Australia would not {{collapse}} further and lose the match. The public reception towards the Victory Tests resulted in an additional fifth match being added to the schedule. To warm up for that match, Miller took 3/95 against the North of England.|$|E
5|$|King Chairacha of Ayutthaya was a {{scion of}} the Suphannaphum Dynasty, which {{took control of}} Siam from the Uthong Dynasty in 1409. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne in 1533 after usurping the crown of his five-year-old nephew, Phra Ratsadathirat, who had reigned for only four months.

5|$|Nima Nourizadeh had {{previously}} only worked directing music videos and commercials, but <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> producers' attention for his directing {{work on a}} series of party-themed Adidas commercials. Nourizadeh explained to the producers how he would want to develop the script and how he would want the film to look and feel, and he was eventually brought from London to Los Angeles, for what he believed would be two weeks, but stretched to two years. Phillips believed that Nourizadeh's interpretation of the film was compatible with his vision, influencing the decision to hire Nourizadeh in his feature film debut.|$|E

At age 13 <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{attention}} of Alexandre Taché, the Suffragan Bishop of St. Boniface, who was eagerly promoting the priesthood for talented young Métis. In 1858 Taché arranged for Riel {{to attend the}} Petit Séminaire of the Collège de Montréal, {{under the direction of}} the Sulpician order. Descriptions of him at the time indicate that he was a fine scholar of languages, science, and philosophy, but exhibited a frequent and unpredictable moodiness.|$|E

5|$|The Kaan dynasty was not {{originally}} {{established at}} Calakmul but rather re-located {{there in the}} 7th Century from another city. Calakmul experienced its highest achievements {{during the reign of}} king Yuknoom Che'en II, sometimes called Yuknoom the Great by scholars. Yuknoom Che'en II was 36 years old when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne of Calakmul in AD 636. A significant increase in the production of stelae at the city began with his reign and 18 stelae were commissioned by the king.

5|$|Totti {{was born}} in Rome to parents Lorenzo and Fiorella Totti. He {{was raised in the}} Porta Metronia neighbourhood. As a youngster he idolised ex-Roma captain Giuseppe Giannini, and {{regularly}} played football with older boys. Totti began to play youth team football at the age of 8, with Fortitudo, later joining Smit Trastevere and Lodigiani. After <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of scouts, his mother refused a lucrative offer from Milan in order to keep him in his home town. Although his youth club initially had come to an agreement to sell Totti to the Lazio youth side, one of Roma's youth coaches, Gildo Giannini, persuaded his parents to let him join the Roma youth squad in 1989.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Zoghby {{considered}} {{the issues of}} ecumenism and the schism between the Melkite Catholic and Antiochian Orthodox Churches. As he began to study both the historical roots of the separation and the modern divisions of Middle Eastern churches <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opinion that the schism was unjustifiable. He also began to question the domination of the so-called Uniate churches by the See of Rome. Zoghby, along with other Melkite priests in Egypt such as George Hakim and Joseph Tawil, were influenced by Father Oreste Karame, who advocated {{the need for the}} Melkite Church to return to its proper traditions and work for communion with the Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan {{was thirty}} years old when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne in 924, which would mean that {{he was born in}} about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that {{there is no reason to}} doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E

As the Razor 2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots.
