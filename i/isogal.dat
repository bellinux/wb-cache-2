The Baade’s Windows of low {{obscuration}} {{towards the}} inner {{parts of the}} Galactic bulge represent ideal places in which to {{develop an understanding of}} the <b>ISOGAL</b> colour-magnitude diagrams. Unlike the case for the solar neighbourhood, their contents are at a uniform distance from the Sun, affected only by the finite thickness of the Bulge. The objects detected in the <b>ISOGAL</b> survey are found to be late-type M-giants at the red giant tip or on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). The <b>ISOGAL</b> colour-magnitude diagrams show that mass-loss starts at about M 4 and increases towards later types. Many non-Miras have mass-loss rates similar to shorter-period Miras. The visible counterparts of the <b>ISOGAL</b> sources have been identified in the database of the MACHO gravitational lensing survey. A first report of this work is included here. It is found that nearly all the <b>ISOGAL</b> sources are semi-regular variables (SRVs), which are many times more numerous than Miras. Their stellar luminosities increase with period. Based on a simple interpretation of the photometry, mass-loss rates from about 10 − 9 M ⊙ yr − 1 to 10 − 7 M ⊙ yr − 1 are found for SRVs with periods in excess of ∼ 60 days. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>ISOGAL</b> {{project is}} {{a survey of the}} stellar populations, structure, and recent star {{formation}} history of the inner disk and bulge of the Galaxy. <b>ISOGAL</b> combines 15 and 7 micron ISOCAM observations with DENIS IJKs data to determine the nature of a source and the interstellar extinction. In this paper we report an <b>ISOGAL</b> study of a small field in the inner Galactic Bulge (l= 0 deg, b= 1. 0 deg, area= 0. 035 sq. deg) as a prototype of the larger area <b>ISOGAL</b> survey of the inner Galaxy. The five wavelengths of ISOGAL+DENIS, together with the relatively low and constant extinction in front of this specific field, allow reliable determination {{of the nature of the}} sources. The primary scientific result of this paper is evidence that the most numerous class of <b>ISOGAL</b> 15 micron sources are Red Giants in the Galactic bulge and central disk, with luminosities just above or close to the RGB tip and weak mass-loss rates. They form loose sequences in the magnitude-colour diagrams [15]/Ks-[15] and [15]/[7]-[15]. Their large excesses at 15 micron with respect to 2 micron and 7 micron is due to circumstellar dust produced by mass-loss at low rates. These <b>ISOGAL</b> results are the first systematic evidence and study of dust emission at this early stage (''Intermediate'' AGB), before the onset of the large mass-loss phase. It is thus well established that efficient dust formation is already associated with such low mass-loss rates during this early phase.

The average crustal thickness of the Palau Kyushu Ridge (PKR) is more than 10 km. In the eastern PSP the crustal thickness gradually increases eastward.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a gravity survey of the Criffel - Dalbeattie granodiorite complex and the surroundingarea, carried out from the Geology Department of the Durham Colleges. Gravity stations are sufficiently closely spacedto allow accurate contouring by means of Bouguer anomaly <b>isogals</b> at one milligal intervals. A large number of densityspecimens collected {{during the course of}} the survey have been statistically analysed and the results used in theinterpretation. The surface geology of the area has already been mapped and described in some detail and this information has been used extensively in the interpretation of the gravity data. The opinion of previous authors is that the complex is of magmatic origin. The most striking feature of the gravity field is a pronounced negative anomaly over the main granodiorite with very steep gradients over the country rock to the north-west of the granodiorite but smoother gradients on the south-east Side. The suggested interpretation, based on three dimensional computer methods, is that the main granodiorite mass extends to a depth of eight miles and exhibits a marked gradational increase in density in its south-eastern portions. It is thought that this is the result of magmatic flow within the intrusion, the magma trailing up at a centre slightly offset from the present centre of the outcrop, becoming contaminated by the country rock and flowing down on the south-east side. The gravity field over the outlying parts of the complex in the Huehencairn region suggests that the granodiorites in this area extend to the same depth as the main intrusion and are an integral part of it. Regional modifications of the gravity field are also discussed and tentative interpretations put forward...|$|R

These sources were selected to test selection criteria based on the <b>ISOGAL</b> [7] [...] [15] color and the spatial extent parameter σ_ 15. We revised these criteria until they reliably distinguished between young and late-type evolved objects and then applied them to all <b>ISOGAL</b> sources in the central molecular zone (CMZ), resulting {{in the selection of}} 485 sources believed to be young. Furthermore, we added 656 Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) sources to the CMZ sample that fulfilled F_ E/F_ D > 2 with F D and F_ E being the flux densities in the D (15 μm) and E (21 μm) bands. After obtaining L_ bol/F_ 15 conversion factors, we calculated the bolometric luminosity, L_ bol, values for the CMZ sample and subsequently the masses of the sources. Applying a Kroupa initial mass function, we derived the total mass in young objects that has been formed over the last 1 Myr, resulting in an average star formation rate of 0. 08 solar masses per year for the CMZ.

40|$|The <b>ISOGAL</b> {{mid-infrared}} {{survey of}} areas {{close to the}} Galactic Plane aims to determine their stellar content and its possible bearing {{on the history of}} the Galaxy. The NGC 6522 and Sgr I Baade’s Windows of low obscuration towards the inner parts of the Bulge represent ideal places in which to calibrate and understand the <b>ISOGAL</b> colour-magnitude diagrams, which are more difficult to interpret in heavily reddened fields. The survey observations were made with the ISOCAM instrument of the ISO satellite. The filter bands chosen were LW 2 (∼ 7 µm) and LW 3 (∼ 15 µm). The results presented here show that most of the detected objects are late M-type giants on the AGB, with a cut-off for those earlier than M 3 –M 4. The most luminous members of these two Bulge fields at 7 µm are the Mira variables. However, it is evident that they represent the end of a sequence of increasing 15 µm dust emission which commences with M giants of earlier sub-type. In observations of late-type giants the ISOCAM 15 µm band is mainly sensitive t...|$|E

By combining with the DENIS {{data in the}} near-infrared J and K_ S bands, one derives the extinction at 7 μm through A_K_ S-A_ 7 = 0. 35 (A_J-A_K_ S) which yields A_ 7 /A_ V ∼ 0. 03 from the near-IR extinction values of van de Hulst [...] Glass (Glass 1999).

The distribution of A_ V ranges from 0 to ∼ 45 and it reflects the concentration of the extinction in the spiral arms. Based on their locations in color-magnitude diagrams and a few cross-identifications with IRAS and MSX sources, the nature of objects is discussed in comparison with the case of a low extinction field in Baade's Window. Most of the objects are either AGB stars with moderate mass loss rate or luminous RGB stars. Some of them may be AGB stars with high mass loss rate.

The tracers are the <b>ISOGAL</b> point sources with [7]-[15]< 0. 4 which are RGB tip stars or early AGB stars with moderate mass loss. They have well-defined intrinsic color indices (J-Ks) _ 0, (Ks-[7]) _ 0 and (Ks-[15]) _ 0. By a linear fitting of the observed color indices Ks-[7] and Ks-[15] to the observed J-Ks, we obtain the ratio between the E(Ks-[7]) and E(Ks-[15]) color excesses and E(J-Ks). We infer the selective extinctions at 7 and 15 um {{in terms of the}} near-infrared extinction in the Ks band. The distribution of the derived extinctions around 7 micron (A_ 7) is well represented by a Gaussian function, with the peak at about 0. 47 A_Ks and ranging from 0. 33 to 0. 55 A_Ks (using the near-infrared extinctions of Rieke & Lebovsky 1985). There is some evidence that A_ 7 /A_Ks may vary significantly depending on the line of sight. The derived selective extinction at 15 um suffers uncertainty mainly from the dispersion in the intrinsic color index (Ks-[15]) _ 0 which is affected by dust emission from mass-losing AGB stars. The peak value of A_ 15 is around 0. 40 A_Ks. Comment: 21 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|E
