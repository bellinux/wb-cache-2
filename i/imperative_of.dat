5|$|That conquest was a {{consequence}} of the Augustan <b>imperative</b> <b>of</b> securing the Imperial borders. To effectively control the Alps as the shield of northern Italy, Rome needed to control both flanks of the mountain range. Thus it had to extend its power to the Rhine and Danube, thereby also opening a direct route to Germania and all of Central Europe. The last obstacle in this path were the Raetians. After a first expedition against them by Publius Silius Nerva in 16BC, a more thorough campaign by Drusus and the later emperor Tiberius brought Raetia – and thereby all of Switzerland – firmly under Roman control.|$|E

25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all he {{had to say about the}} present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the <b>imperative</b> <b>of</b> arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E
25|$|When Mehmed II {{was eleven}} years old {{he was sent to}} Amasya to govern and thus gain experience, as per the custom of Ottoman rulers before his time. Sultan Murad II also sent a number of {{teachers}} for him to study under. This Islamic education had a great impact in molding Mehmed's mindset and reinforcing his Muslim beliefs. He was influenced in his practice of Islamic epistemology by practitioners of science - particularly by his mentor, Molla Gürani - and he followed their approach. The influence of Akshamsaddin in Mehmed's life became predominant from a young age, especially in the <b>imperative</b> <b>of</b> fulfilling his Islamic duty to overthrow the Byzantine empire by conquering Constantinople.|$|E

It wasn't until 1959 that senior foundation officials succeeded in getting the Ford Foundation (and later USAID, and later still, the World Bank) {{to sign on to}} the major philanthropic project, known now to the world as the Green Revolution. It was originally conceived in 1943 as CIMMYT, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico. It also provided significant funding for the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. Part of the original program, the funding of the IRRI was later taken over by the Ford Foundation.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This <b>imperative,</b> <b>of</b> course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E

500|$|Yard's most {{successful}} publicity initiative {{during this time}} was the National Parks Portfolio (1916), a collection of nine pamphlets that—through photographs interspersed with text lauding the scenic grandeur of the nation's major parks—connected the parks {{with a sense of}} national identity to make visitation an <b>imperative</b> <b>of</b> American citizenship. [...] Yard and Mather distributed this publication to a carefully selected list of prominent Americans, including every member of Congress. [...] That same year, Yard wrote and published Glimpses of Our National Parks, which was followed in 1917 by a similar volume titled The Top of the Continent. [...] The latter volume, which was subtitled A Cheerful Journey through Our National Parks and geared toward a younger audience, became a bestseller.|$|E

[...] Cavallaro suggested that despite the feminine appearance of the [...] "angel", it could be of a [...] "preternatural order", making gender or sex distinctions irrelevant. Miyazaki referred to the angelic creature as [...] "tori no hito" [...] or [...] "a bird's person" [...] which is the nickname of Nausicaä from his Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga and film. Cavallaro noted another visual correspondence to Only Yesterday with the oppressive urban environment and the freedom of open spaces.|$|E

Weizsäcker was however criticized for some of his remarks by members of his own party. Lorenz Niegel, a politician of the sister party CSU, who had not taken part in the ceremony, objected to the term [...] "day of liberation", referring to it instead as a [...] "day of deepest humiliation". The Greens were also absent during the speech, choosing instead to visit Auschwitz. A year later, the Green politician Petra Kelly called the speech [...] "correct, but not more than self-evident", pointing to speeches president Gustav Heinemann had made during his presidency. The harshest criticism came from the Federation of Expellees, whose president Herbert Czaja, while thanking the president for highlighting the expellees' fate, criticized his remark that [...] "conflicting legal claims must be subordinated under the <b>imperative</b> <b>of</b> reconciliation".|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to provide an {{analysis}} of the use <b>of</b> logically complex <b>imperatives,</b> in particular, <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> the form Do A 1 or A 2 and Do A, if B. We argue for an analysis <b>of</b> <b>imperatives</b> in terms <b>of</b> classical logic which takes into account the influence of background information on imperatives. We show that by doing so one can avoid some counter-intuitive results which have been associated with analyses <b>of</b> <b>imperatives</b> in terms <b>of</b> classical logic. In particular, I address Hamblin's observations concerning rule-like imperatives and Ross' Paradox. The analysis is carried out within an agent-based logical framework.
