40|$|International audienceWe have {{demonstrated}} that the two-and three-dimensional motility of the human pathogenic parasite Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) depends on sustained instability of the intracellular hydrostatic pressure. This instability drives the cyclic generation and healing of membrane blebs, with typical protrusion velocities of 10 - 20 mu m/second over a few hundred milliseconds and healing times of 10 seconds. The use of a novel micro-electroporation method to control the intracellular pressure enabled us to develop a qualitative model with three parameters: {{the rate of the}} myosin-driven internal pressure increase; the critical disjunction stress of membrane-cytoskeleton bonds; and the turnover time of the F-actin cortex. Although blebs occur randomly in space and irregularly time, they can be forced to occur with a <b>defined</b> <b>periodicity</b> in confined geometries, thus confirming our model.

Analysis of Clock and Bmal 1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle.

This is particularly relevant for defining what factors are driving the presence, location, and movements of individuals. The long-term movement and space use patterns of grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, were examined on a whole of reef scale in the southern Great Barrier Reef to define whether movement and activity space varied through time. Twenty-nine C. amblyrhynchos were tracked for over 2 years to define movement patterns. All individuals showed high residency within the study site, but also had high roaming indices. This indicated that individuals remained {{in the region and}} used all of the monitored habitat (i. e., the entire reef perimeter). Use of space was consistent through time with high reuse of areas most of the year. Therefore, individuals maintained discrete home ranges, but undertook broader movements around the reef at times. Mature males showed greatest variation in movement with larger activity spaces and movement into new regions during the mating season (August-September). Depth use patterns also differed, suggesting behaviour or resource requirements varied between sexes. Examination of the long-term, reef-scale movements of C. amblyrhynchos has revealed that reproductive activity may {{play a key role in}} space use and activity patterns. It was unclear whether mating behaviour or an increased need for food to sustain reproductive activity and development played a greater role in these patterns.

Three distinct organizations, termed domains, have been identified and shown to have major concentrations on separate chromosomes. We have established that domain K is located on chromosome 15 and domain D on chromosome 16 and suggested that domain R is on chromosome 1.

Here, using a human neutrophil-like cell line and human primary neutrophils, we describe a dynamic spatiotemporal pattern of tractions during chemotaxis. Tractions are located at both the leading and the trailing edge of neutrophils, where they oscillate with a <b>defined</b> <b>periodicity.</b> Interestingly, traction oscillations at the leading and the trailing edge are out of phase with the tractions at the front leading those at the back, suggesting a temporal mechanism that coordinates leading edge and trailing edge activities.

Specifically, traction development at the leading edge requires myosin light chain kinase-mediated myosin II contractility and is necessary for α 5 β 1 -integrin activation and leading edge adhesion. Localized myosin II activation induced by spatially activated small GTPase Rho, and its downstream kinase p 160 -ROCK, as previously reported, leads to contraction of actin-myosin II complexes at the trailing edge, causing it to de-adhere.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} online periodicity mining problem. Periodicity mining {{is the process}} of discovering frequent periodic patterns in an attempt towards predicting the future behavior in time series data. The ubiquitousness of sensor devices that generate real-time, append-only and semi-infinite data streams has revived the need for online processing. ^ We <b>define</b> <b>periodicity</b> mining as a two-step process: discovering potential periodicity rates (Periodicity Detection), and discovering the frequent periodic patterns of each periodicity rate (Mining Periodic Patterns). We propose new algorithms for both online periodicity detection and online mining of periodic patterns. For the latter, the proposed algorithm incrementally maintains an efficient data structure, namely the max-subpattern tree, from which the periodic patterns are discovered. For the <b>periodicity</b> detection, we <b>define</b> two types of periodicities: segment periodicity and symbol periodicity. Whereas segment periodicity concerns the periodicity of the entire time series, symbol periodicity concerns the periodicities of the various symbols or values of the time series. For each periodicity type, we propose an efficient convolution-based periodicity detection algorithm. Furthermore, we propose online periodicity mining algorithms that integrate both periodicity mining steps, and thus are able to discover the periodic patterns of unknown periods. All the proposed online algorithms require only one pass over the time series and no reprocessing of previously seen data. Finally, we address the inevitable problem of the presence of noise in real-world time series data. We propose a new online periodicity detection algorithm that deals efficiently with all types of noise. Based on time warping, the proposed algorithm warps (extends or shrinks) the time axis at various locations to optimally remove the noise. ^ Experimental studies for all the proposed algorithms are carried out using both synthetic and real-world data. Results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing periodicity mining algorithms in terms of the time performance, the accuracy of the discovered periodicity rates and periodic patterns, and the resilience to noise. Real-data experiments demonstrate the practicality of the discovered periodic patterns. ...|$|R

Here, we show the effect of synthetic fibrillar networks patterned with nanometric periodicities, using bottom-up approaches, on the response of stem cells. We have used helical organic nanoribbons based on self-assemblies of Gemini-type amphiphiles to access chiral silica nanoribbons with two different shapes and periodicities (twisted ribbons and helical ribbons) from the same native self-assembled organic nanostructure. We demonstrate the covalent grafting of these silica nanoribbons onto activated glass substrates and the influence of this programmed isotropically oriented matrix to direct the commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into osteoblast lineage in vitro, free of osteogenic-inducing media. The specific periodicity of 63 nm (± 5 nm) with helical ribbon shape induces specific cell adhesion through the fibrillar focal adhesion formation and leads to stem cell commitment into osteoblast lineage. In contrast, the matrix of periodicity 100 nm (± 15 nm) with twisted ribbon shape does not lead to osteoblast commitment. The inhibition of non-muscle myosin II with blebbistatin is sufficient to block this osteoblast commitment on helical nanoribbon matrix, demonstrating that stem cells interpret the nanohelical shape and periodicity environment physically. These results indicate that hMSCs could interpret nanohelical shape and periodicity in the same way they sense microenvironment elasticity.

40|$|Samples of Nephrops norvegicus were {{collected}} {{on a monthly basis}} from October 1993 to September 1995 in different areas of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, both to investigate molt periodicity and to verify the existence of a common molt pattern for this species in the Mediterranean. The presence of well-developed gastroliths in the wall of the stomach was used as an indicator of molting periods. A well <b>defined</b> molting <b>periodicity</b> was not found among juveniles, which seem to molt all year round. In each studied area molt synchronism was evidenced among both males and females after the onset of sexual maturity, even if the seasonal molting pattern differs between the two sexes. Adult females have only one molting period per year (December-March), immediately after the hatching of eggs. Adult males present a molting period in late summer-autumn (August-October). In some areas a second molting period is evident and co-occurs with that of females (late winter-early spring). This molt synchrony among adults is common to all the Nephrops populations of the Mediterranean Sea. The different results obtained for the Atlantic population could be due to the influence of environmental factors on molt cycle regulation...|$|R
40|$|Self-positioned nanomembranes such as {{rolled-up}} {{tubes and}} wrinkled thin films have been potential systems {{for a variety}} of applications and basic studies on elastic properties of nanometer-thick systems. Although there is a clear driving force towards elastic energy 1 minimization in each system, the exploration of intermediate states where specific characteristics could be chosen by a slight modification of a processing parameter had not been experimentally realized. In this work, arrays of freestanding III-V nanomembranes (NM) supported on one edge and presenting a coexistence of these two main behaviors were obtained by design of strain conditions in the NMs and controlled selective etching of patterned substrates. As the etching process continues a mixture of wrinkled and rolled-up states is achieved. For very long etching times an onset of plastic cracks was observed in the points with localized stress. The well- <b>defined</b> morphological <b>periodicity</b> of the relaxed NMs was compared with finite element simulations of their elastic relaxation. The evolution of strain in the NMs with etching time was directly evaluated by X-ray diffraction, providing a comprehensive scenario of transitions among competing and coexisting strain states.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{positioning}} of InAs islands on GaAs (110) by cleaved edge overgrowth is reported. The first growth sample contains strained InxGa 1 -xAs/GaAs superlattice (SL) of varying indium fraction, which {{acts as a}} strain nanopattern for the cleaved-edge overgrowth. Atoms incident on the cleaved edge will preferentially migrate to InGaAs regions where favorable bonding sites are available. By this method InAs island chains with lateral <b>periodicity</b> <b>defined</b> by the thickness of InGaAs and GaAs of SL have been realized by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). They are observed by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM). The strain nanopattern's effect is studied by the different indium fraction of SL and MBE growth conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
