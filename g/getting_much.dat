500|$|Carlsen had an {{aggressive}} {{style of play}} as a youth, and, according to Agdestein, his play was characterised by [...] "a fearless readiness to offer material for activity". Carlsen found as he matured that this risky playing style was not as well suited against the world elite. When he started playing in top tournaments, he had trouble <b>getting</b> <b>much</b> out of the opening. To progress, Carlsen's style became more universal, capable of handling all sorts of positions well. He opens with both 1.d4 and 1.e4, as well as 1.c4, and, on occasion, 1.Nf3, thus {{making it harder for}} opponents to prepare against him and reducing the effect of computer analysis. He has said the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as it comes down to [...] "pure chess".|$|E

500|$|In 1980, {{a scheme}} for {{improving}} {{a section of}} the river between Littleton Road and Adelphi Weir in Salford for boating purposes was included in Greater Manchester Policy Committee's capital programme for 1981/82. County Councillors at a recent committee meeting had criticised the condition of the river, with the councillor for the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham calling it [...] "quite revolting and horrible". A spokesperson for the NWWA said that, although the river had a reputation for being polluted, it was <b>getting</b> <b>much</b> better but still had not reached a state where they would be satisfied. She added that tests were being carried out to show the improved cleanliness of the Irwell and that 600trout had recently been put in the river at Summerseat, near Bury. The proposals were welcomed by both Salford University and Agecroft Rowing Club, with the university stating that they wished to use that section for their boat race. [...] Later that year it was reported that hundreds of trees and shrubs were to be planted {{along the banks of the}} Irwell between Broughton and Pomona Dock in a £650,000 [...] "green finger" [...] scheme to [...] "bring the countryside into the heart of industrial Salford". The dossier outlining the scheme, prepared by Salford's Technical Services Officer, emphasised the [...] "bleak character" [...] of the Irwell Valley with [...] "many constructions by the river that are decaying and rotting" [...] and said [...] "the main problems are caused by an excess of ammonia and a high organic content from sewage effluents which discharge into the water upstream." [...] The report recommended that [...] "even more support should be given to the NWWA in their pollution control of the River Irwell." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, Saskatoon {{initiated}} {{a series of}} [...] "work for wages" [...] schemes designed to provide the unemployed with unskilled manual jobs.
