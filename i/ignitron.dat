25|$|The Virginian EL-C, later {{known as}} the New Haven EF-4 and E33, was an {{electric}} locomotive built for the Virginian Railway by General Electric in August 1955. They were the first successful production locomotives to use <b>Ignitron</b> (mercury arc) rectifier technology. Although they {{proved to be a}} successful design, no more EL-Cs were built, due to the small number of railroads that had electrification and the advent of improved electric locomotive technology. They were among the last mainline electric freight locomotives in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|GE {{employed}} then-new <b>ignitron</b> rectifier technology, {{first used}} on the experimental Pennsylvania Railroad E2c and E3b locomotives. The rectifiers converted the overhead AC to DC. [...] A transformer stepped the voltage down from 11 kV to feed the rectifier. The DC voltage from the rectifier was then smoothed by a reactor before it was {{passed on to the}} traction motors. There were six traction motors, one for each axle. Starting tractive effort was maximum power output [...] The maximum speed of the locomotive was [...] Each locomotive had six axles in a C-C configuration. They were [...] long and weighed [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{cars were}} ordered from General Electric and Avco. Aside from the boxier look and smaller side windows, the main changes {{between the new}} IVs and earlier Silverliners {{included}} a dynamic brake system, for which the resistance grids were fitted in the car's signature roof hump, and, for the Penn Central cars, a trainline automatic door system which removed the need for train crew to manually open doors at high level platforms. [...] The Silverliner IVs were also {{the first to be}} delivered in a married pair configuration, although a minority of cars were outfitted as single units. The delivery of the Silverliner IVs allowed SEPTA to replace most of its remaining PRR MP54s and Reading's pre-war MU fleet save for the 38 rebuilt [...] "Blueliner" [...] cars. [...] While being fitted with an updated propulsion system from General Electric, the Silverliner IVs were nevertheless still delivered with <b>Ignitron</b> tube rectifiers, which were later replaced with silicon controlled rectifiers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ignitrons</b> {{were long}} used as high-current {{rectifiers}} in major industrial and utility installations {{where thousands of}} amperes of AC current must be converted to DC, such as aluminum smelters. <b>Ignitrons</b> were used to control the current in electric welding machines. Large electric motors were also controlled by <b>ignitrons</b> used in gated fashion, {{in a manner similar}} to modern semiconductor devices such as silicon controlled rectifiers and triacs. Many electric locomotives used them in conjunction with transformers to convert high voltage AC from the overhead lines to relatively low voltage DC for the traction motors. The Pennsylvania Railroad's E44 freight locomotives carried on-board <b>ignitrons,</b> as did the Russian ВЛ-60 freight locomotive. For many modern applications, <b>ignitrons</b> have been replaced by solid state alternatives.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{they are}} far more {{resistant}} to damage due to overcurrent or back-voltage, <b>ignitrons</b> are still manufactured and used in preference to semiconductors in some installations. For example, specially constructed [...] "pulse rated" [...] <b>ignitrons</b> are still used in certain pulsed power applications. These devices can switch hundreds of kiloamperes and hold off as much as 50kV. The anodes in these devices are often fabricated from a refractory metal, usually molybdenum, to handle reverse current during ringing (or oscillatory) discharges without damage. Pulse rated <b>ignitrons</b> usually operate at very low duty cycles. They are often used to switch high energy capacitor banks during electromagnetic forming, electrohydraulic forming, or for emergency short-circuiting of high voltage power sources ("crowbar" [...] switching).|$|R
50|$|Several {{electric}} locomotives, {{including the}} New Haven EP5 and the Virginian EL-C, carried <b>ignitrons</b> on board to rectify incoming AC to traction motor DC.|$|R
2500|$|Differences {{from the}} earlier Pioneer IIIs {{included}} a single arm Faiveley pantograph, {{a state of the}} art propulsion system that made use of solid state phase angle controllers coupled to mercury arc <b>ignitron</b> rectifiers and higher powered motors. [...] Like the Pioneer IIIs before them, the Silverliners offered their riders air cushion suspension, air conditioning, electric train heat and a nearly silent ride. [...] With 150hp more than the Pioneer III cars (550hp total) the Silverliners could achieve a 1.7mph/s acceleration rate which was quite higher than the older MP54s and multi-function couplers and disc brakes further improved performance. [...] The 38 PRR cars were numbered in two series, 201-219 and 251-269 and given PRR classification MP85B, while the 17 Reading cars were numbered 9001-9017 and given Reading classification REB-13. [...] There were also minor differences between the two sets of vehicles with the PRR units being fitted with only one overhead luggage rack, a bar pilot, a metal framed engineer's window and cab signals, with the Reading cars being fitted with a cowcatcher and twin overhead luggage racks. [...] The first set of PRR cars, #201-216, were also equipped with bathrooms in place of a 3-person bench seat in the 'F' end of the car to enable the cars use on longer runs to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or New York City.|$|E
2500|$|The Silverliner IVs {{have never}} been officially rebuilt, {{but there have been}} a number of {{modifications}} to the class. [...] The propulsion system was initially upgraded from the original mercury arc–based <b>Ignitron</b> rectifiers to more reliable solid state silicon controlled rectifiers and later the main transformers had their coolant replaced with one that did not contain PCBs. [...] As this change was carried out in the early 1990s, all of the 9000 series Reading cars and some of the Penn Central cars were renumbered into the series 400 through 460 to help keep track of which units had undergone the modification. [...] When the Center City Commuter Connection opened in 1984, the Reading cars were converted to full train automatic door operation to take advantage of the high level platforms at the new Market East Station (now Jefferson Station) and others on the former PRR [...] "side" [...] of the system. [...] In the late 1990s the fleet received its most noticeable upgrade with the original [...] "ketchup and mustard" [...] colored interior replaced with a softer gray motif as well as softer seating. [...] Around 2004 SEPTA began to replace the cowcatcher pilots equipped on the original Reading cars with a bar type pilot to match those on the PRR cars. [...] Starting in 2009 SEPTA began to replace the original Faiveley pantographs with more modern Schunk type units.|$|E
2500|$|The Pioneer III cars {{suffered}} from a low capacity main transformer as well as gearbox issues and a complex propulsion system that coupled highly sensitive mercury arc <b>ignitron</b> rectifier tubes with an inefficient DC resistance motor controller. [...] Always distinguishable by their older style diamond pantograph, the Pioneer III cars were rechristened the Silverliner Is when the second official order of Silverliners were delivered from Saint Louis Car Company in 1967, the SL-Is would also be renumbered 244 to 248 when the Silverliner IV fleet was delivered in 1974-1975. [...] The 6th car, {{which would have been}} #249, had already been written off in an accident by that time. [...] While the other Silverliner models all came with similar GE propulsion gear, they could not MU with the earlier Silverliner I cars, which soon became the odd ducks in the SEPTA Regional Rail fleet. In the late 1980s SEPTA purchased a number of push-pull trainsets to provide enough peak period capacity to retire its remaining Reading Blueliners and the Silverliner Is by the timetable that took effect April 1, 1990. [...] Until 2000, the cars were kept in storage near Wayne Junction. Although there were plans to convert the cars into locomotive-hauled coaches, SEPTA finally decided to dispose of the fleet due to the expense it would have taken to deal with PCBs in the transformers and the lack of ADA compliance. Of the 5 surviving cars, three were sent to the AAR/FRA test site in Pueblo, Colorado for use in crash tests, while the remaining 2 Pioneer III/Silverliner I cars, 246 and 247, were donated to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg.|$|E

The electric engines can support a very large overload current of 1800 amps, well over the 1000 amp design. They suffered very little wheel slip; they could pull 1756 tonnes trains on a 10 ‰ grade and 2885 tonnes trains on a 5 ‰ grade.|$|R

40|$|Repetitively pulsed closing {{switches}} {{are often}} required in high-power physics experiments. Traditionally, <b>ignitrons</b> {{have been used}} for these applications. There are reasons why <b>ignitrons</b> have undesirable features, such as the high trigger current which causes electromagnetic interference, the arc instability and environmental concern with the mercury used in the switches. With the development of ever increasing power rating of solid-state switches, in particular thyristors, the designer has the tools to replace <b>ignitrons</b> with solid-state devices. Using as an example a recently designed and tested 10 kV, 80 kA high-power switch, the design philosophy for repetitively pulsed switches is developed. The parameters which impose the greatest challenge on the device, such as di/dt, temperature rise and reverse blocking voltage are investigated with respect to their capability when operating in the pulsed mode. Starting with the available device data sheet information and published results of the dependency of the number of life cycles {{as a function of the}} device temperature, it is shown how the overload capability of a device for short term pulsed applications can be exploited. The detailed design of a 2 Hz, 10 {sup 8 } cycle, 12. 5 kV, 80 kA, 3 ms switch, with a short circuit capability of 250 kA, is presented. The paper concludes with a short summary about device limits in voltage, current amplitude and pulse length ratings for repetitively pulsed switches using available thyristors...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the basic}} {{principles}} of how the arc is formed, along with many aspects of construction, are very similar to other types of mercury-arc valves, <b>ignitrons</b> differ from other mercury-arc valves in that the arc is ignited each time a conduction cycle is started, and then extinguished when the current falls below a critical threshold.|$|R
50|$|There were various vacuum/gas devices, such as {{the mercury}} arc rectifiers, thyratrons, <b>ignitrons,</b> and vacuum diodes.

50|$|A {{gas-filled}} tube, {{also known}} as a discharge tube, is an arrangement of electrodes in a gas within an insulating, temperature-resistant envelope. Gas-filled tubes exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, and operate by ionizing the gas with an applied voltage sufficient to cause electrical conduction by the underlying phenomena of the Townsend discharge. A gas-discharge lamp is an electric light using a gas-filled tube; these include fluorescent lamps, metal-halide lamps sodium-vapor lamps and neon lights. Specialized gas-filled tubes such as krytrons, thyratrons, and <b>ignitrons</b> are used as switching devices in electronics.|$|R
50|$|General Electric {{built an}} {{experimental}} 15 kV DC transmission {{system with a}} maximum transmission rate of 150 kW at their plant in Schenectady.

This system first used mercury arc valves, and then later <b>ignitrons,</b> as the first power electronic devices used for HVDC transmission.

50|$|An <b>ignitron</b> {{is usually}} a large steel {{container}} with a pool of mercury in the bottom {{that acts as a}} cathode during operation. A large graphite or refractory metal cylinder, held above the pool by an insulated electrical connection, serves as the anode. An igniting electrode (called the ignitor), made of a refractory semiconductor material such as silicon carbide, is briefly pulsed with a high current to create a puff of electrically conductive mercury plasma. The plasma rapidly bridges the space between the mercury pool and the anode, permitting heavy conduction between the main electrodes. At the surface of the mercury, heating by the resulting arc liberates large numbers of electrons which help to maintain the mercury arc. The mercury surface thus serves as the cathode, and current is normally only in one direction. Once ignited, an <b>ignitron</b> will continue to pass current until either the current is externally interrupted or the voltage applied between cathode and anode is reversed.|$|E

Several kinds of switches have been tested: multigap thyratrons of standard design, a composite switch called 'thyragnitron' and made of a normal thyratron by-passed <b>ignitrons,</b> and finally special thyratrons with a second cathode assembly {{in place of the}} usual anode.

500|$|Gaseous {{mercury is}} used in mercury-vapor lamps and some [...] "neon sign" [...] type {{advertising}} signs and fluorescent lamps. Those low-pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines, which are traditionally used in optical spectroscopy for calibration of spectral position. Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose; reflecting a fluorescent ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice. Gaseous mercury {{is also found in}} some electron tubes, including <b>ignitrons,</b> thyratrons, and mercury arc rectifiers. It is also used in specialist medical care lamps for skin tanning and disinfection. Gaseous mercury is added to cold cathode argon-filled lamps to increase the ionization and electrical conductivity. An argon-filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and will fail to light correctly. Lighting containing mercury can be bombarded/oven pumped only once. When added to neon filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent red/blue spots until the initial burning-in process is completed; eventually it will light a consistent dull off-blue color.|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} the metal workpiece to be fabricated {{is placed in}} proximity to a heavily constructed coil of wire (called the work coil).

50|$|The {{action of}} igniting the arc at a {{controlled}} time, each cycle, allows the <b>ignitron</b> {{to dispense with}} the auxiliary anode and control grids required by other mercury-arc valves.

The most promising approach is the application of the Light Triggered Thyristor (LTT). This especially is interesting for high power high voltage dc installations, like hvdc klystron power supplies with appropriate protection requirements. This paper describes a solution using series connected LTTs as a closing crowbar switch. Static and dynamic behaviour of the thyristors are introduced.
