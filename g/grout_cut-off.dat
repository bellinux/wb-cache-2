The dock was the largest in the World when it was completed in 1970, having been designed and built scarcely two years after the decision was taken to proceed.|$|E
40|$|The design, {{construction}} {{and performance of}} concrete <b>cut-offs,</b> and <b>grout</b> curtains, as dam seepage remediations in carbonate foundations is reviewed. Recent experiences when attempting to build concrete cut-offs through hard and highly permeable rock masses have led the authors to develop the concept of “composite cut-offs “ for seepage control. A campaign of high quality drilling, permeability testing and grouting is first conducted to pretreat the very permeable and/or clay-filled zones, to seal the clean fissures, and to provide an extremely detailed geological basis upon which to design the location and extent of the subsequent concrete wall (if in fact needed). Bearing {{in mind that the}} average cost of a concrete wall is many times that of a <b>grouted</b> <b>cut-off,</b> and that there is currently a shortfall in industry capacity to construct the former, the concept of a “composite wall ” is logical, timely and cost effective...|$|R
