5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with three rudders, and the armored {{pilothouse}} was mounted {{on top of}} the gun turret. The officers' staterooms were built on deck out of light pine, and a hurricane deck was positioned between the turret and the <b>deckhouse,</b> between the two funnels. The hull was subdivided by three transverse and three longitudinal watertight bulkheads.|$|E

Creative agency <b>Deckhouse</b> Digital {{was hired to}} produce several animated GIFs ahead of the DVD/Blu-ray release {{as part of a}} sponsored ad campaign on Tumblr. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment for digital download on August 5, 2014 and was released on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and DVD on August 19, 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Perseus {{was fitted}} with an {{experimental}} steam catapult. The catapult {{was placed on}} top of the carrier's existing flight deck and the <b>deckhouse</b> to port of the island was removed to accommodate it. Some 1,560 launches were made by the catapult, beginning with over 1,000 wheeled dead-loads, of gradually increasing weight, and moving on to with unmanned aircraft with their wings truncated to reduce their ability to glide. The final tests were made by manned aircraft of every type flown by the Fleet Air Arm. After this, the ship arrived in Philadelphia on 14 January 1952 to demonstrate the catapult to the United States Navy. Between them, some 127 launches of manned aircraft were made by the British and the Americans. Perseus arrived back at Portsmouth on 21 March and had the catapult removed. All of her remaining maintenance equipment was removed and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier.|$|E
2500|$|The hull {{was built}} of steel with a flush deck. [...] The <b>deckhouses</b> were built of teak.|$|R

50|$|Talisman had a {{passenger}} capacity of over 1250. Large <b>deckhouses</b> {{fore and aft}} and a single tall funnel amidships gave her an unusual appearance for a Clyde Steamer. During the refit on returning to civilian service, new <b>deckhouses</b> were added, providing additional shelter. Her four British Polar diesel engines powered the vessel's electricity generators that provided the power to the electric propulsions motors. Decca radar was fitted in late 1958.|$|R
5|$|The French Navy {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} her anti-aircraft armament {{in light of}} its wartime experience. Her no. 3 gun turret was to be moved to the No. 4 position, its magazine converted for extra fuel storage, and a new twin 37mm Mle 1933 mount would replace {{it on top of}} the rear deck house. Two more Mle 1933 mounts were to fitted {{on each side of the}} rear <b>deckhouse</b> and a fourth mount was to replace the 13.2Hotchkiss machine guns forward of the bridge. One 13.2mm Browning machine gun was to planned to be mounted on each side of the forward twin 37mm guns. This plan was later amended to add a degaussing cable, replacement of the SS-6 sonar by a French copy of the British ASDIC and six of the new mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940 anti-aircraft guns, plus two more 13.2mm Brownings mounted on the forward corners of the center deck house.|$|E
5|$|Chief Gunner's Mate Michael B. Wallrath, who had {{assisted}} in lowering three lifeboats while he remained on board, jumped overboard after seeing {{to it that}} all the boats were away. Wallrath was pulled into lifeboat number 6 just before a wave capsized it and drowned two of its occupants. Lieutenant commander R. B. Vandervoort, USNRF, West Gates commanding officer, remained on board until he felt sure that the entire crew had departed the sinking ship. When he climbed up on the <b>deckhouse</b> to cut free a life raft and leave the ship, he discovered six men huddled on deck. Vandervoort {{was able to get}} the six on the life raft, but the suction caused by West Gates final plunge pulled him away and below the surface. After he managed {{to get back to the}} surface, he clung to floating wreckage for two hours until pulled aboard the very raft he had missed earlier. Vandervoort and the six men aboard the raft were rescued by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water.|$|E
5|$|Implacable {{temporarily}} {{became a}} trials carrier in October 1947 {{as her own}} air group was not yet ready and she was refitted from October to December 1948 in preparation of service as the Home Fleet flagship. She embarked a squadron each of de Havilland Sea Hornets and Blackburn Firebrands in April 1949 and became the flagship of Admiral Sir Philip Vian on 29 April. A squadron of de Havilland Sea Vampires flew from her deck later that year and her air group was augmented by a squadron of Fairey Barracudas in 1950. Implacable was placed in reserve in September 1950 and slowly converted into a training ship {{by the addition of}} extra accommodation and classrooms, including the addition of a <b>deckhouse</b> on her flight deck. She was recommissioned on January 1952 as the flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. Together with Indefatigable, she was present during the Coronation Fleet Review of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June 1953. Four months later, Implacable ferried a battalion of troops from Plymouth to Trinidad in response to a crisis in British Guiana. She was decommissioned on 1 September 1954 and sold for breaking up on 27 October 1955.|$|E
50|$|As built, she had {{two small}} <b>deckhouses,</b> one forward, {{supporting}} the open bridge and one aft of the twin funnels, covering the companionway..|$|R
50|$|The {{ships were}} modernised in the 1950s with new {{anti-aircraft}} guns and anti-submarine mortars and updated sensors (new radar and sonar). One bank of torpedo tubes were removed and extra accommodation (<b>deckhouses)</b> added.|$|R
5000|$|The boiler {{and engine}} was mounted half above and half below the single main deck under wooden <b>deckhouses.</b> She had four holds [...] - [...] two {{either side of}} the central boiler and engine.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. Navy {{solicited}} {{bids for}} {{a lower cost}} steel <b>deckhouse</b> as an option for DDG-1002, the last Zumwalt destroyer, in January 2013. On 2 August 2013, the US Navy announced it was awarding a $212 million contract to General Dynamics Bath Iron Works to build a steel <b>deckhouse</b> for destroyer Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002).|$|E

50|$|Lunas wooden {{hull and}} <b>deckhouses</b> were {{built by the}} M.M. Davis Shipbuilding Company in Solomons, Maryland. The empty hull was towed from the Chesapeake to East Boston for {{outfitting}} at the Bethlehem Steel Shipyard in East Boston.|$|R
5|$|HMS Pioneer and HMS Perseus {{were not}} {{completed}} {{to their original}} design as Colossus-class light aircraft carriers; the success of Unicorn prompted modification of the ships whilst under construction into aircraft maintenance ships without aircraft catapults and <b>deckhouses</b> built on the flight deck.|$|R
25|$|The after <b>deckhouse</b> and {{rangefinder}} {{were removed}} and the forward single 12.7cm gun mounting was relocated to this position, directly {{ahead of the}} after twin gun mount; its magazine was converted {{for use as a}} fuel tank.|$|E
25|$|The design {{specifications}} for Point Baker included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction {{was used to}} save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces {{were a part of}} the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the <b>deckhouse</b> was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the <b>deckhouse.</b> The <b>deckhouse</b> contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The <b>deckhouse</b> also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door {{at the front of the}} mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, the Washington Tug and Barge Co. {{sold the}} Patterson to C.K. West Co. of Portland Oregon who {{converted}} {{her to a}} motorship for operation along the Oregon coast; the steam engine was replaced with a diesel, probably the four-cylinder Bolinder engine she had in 1930. It was probably at this time or a year later that she underwent a substantial rebuilding. Her <b>deckhouse,</b> bowsprit and eventually also her mizzenmast were removed, her bow was reshaped, and the fore and main masts were replaced with, or reduced to, pole masts. A stern <b>deckhouse</b> and superstructure were constructed. These changes {{are evident in the}} photos of the 1938 shipwreck (this article and external links) and in a 1930 photo taken at Herschel Island.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} the R. J. Hackett was innovative. [...] With its boxy hull, hatch-lined deck, and {{placement}} of the <b>deckhouses,</b> the ship was ideally suited for moving cargo through inland waterways. [...] The fore and aft <b>deckhouses</b> gave the Hackett a single immense hold that could be easily accessed and filled with cargo. [...] The boxy hull maximized cargo volume, and the hatch spacing lined the ship up perfectly with the ore dock chutes in Marquette, Michigan and elsewhere, and the center section free of rigging made loading the ship much easier. [...] The forward pilothouse gave the captain better vision and quicker reaction to dangers in the water. [...] The Hacketts design combined the best aspects of steam and sailing ships into {{a new class of}} vessel.|$|R
25|$|<b>Deckhouses</b> on the France's {{superstructure}} {{were built}} of aluminium, {{to reduce the}} ship's weight and thereby conserve fuel in operation. Within the superstructure a full-length outdoor promenade deck was designed into {{both sides of the}} Pont Canots. Unlike on many other ships, this deck did not wrap completely around the ship, being blocked at the forward end by cabins built in behind the bridgescreen.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the , {{the ships}} were built {{with a double}} ended design in order to confuse enemy {{submarine}} observers {{who were trying to}} work out which direction the ships were due to travel in. They had a single central funnel, and <b>deckhouses</b> both fore and aft were designed to be similar in order to enhance the effect. The class were painted in dazzle camouflage.|$|R
25|$|When commissioned, Explorer {{was painted}} a {{brilliant}} white, with a brown <b>deckhouse</b> and red funnel and masts. Her paint scheme, raked masts and funnel, yacht-like stem, and cruiser stern {{gave her the}} appearance of a yacht or cruiser when her large fleet of boats were not stowed on deck.|$|E

Berthing spaces were provided for 13 so that requirements were met for passengers and extra wartime manning needs. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an 18-knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Already part of the design, crews stationed in Vietnam found the air-conditioned interior especially helpful. Interior access to the <b>deckhouse</b> was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the <b>deckhouse.</b> The <b>deckhouse</b> contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer but for Vietnam service the spaces quartered the commanding officer, the executive officer and chief boatswain's mate {{as well as the}} chief engineman. The <b>deckhouse</b> also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck, which also included three bunks for first-class petty officers. A watertight door {{at the front of the}} mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was 10 feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.|$|E
5000|$|LV-117 was a steel-hulled vessel {{with steel}} <b>deckhouses</b> fore and aft, a funnel {{amidships}} for engine exhaust, and two masts.

Her sister vessels were San Francisco LV-100, Swiftsure LV-113, New Bedford LV-114, Frying Pan LV-115, and Chesapeake LV-116.|$|R
6000|$|A week of {{buffeting}} a tempestuous {{and relentless}} sea; {{a week of}} seasickness and deserted cabins; of lonely quarterdecks drenched with spray--spray so ambitious that it even coated the smokestacks thick with a white crust of salt to their very tops; a week of shivering in {{the shelter of the}} lifeboats and <b>deckhouses</b> by day and blowing suffocating [...] "clouds" [...] and boisterously performing at dominoes in the smoking room at night.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, {{the four}} Weapon-class destroyers were {{selected}} for conversion to Radar pickets in 1957, with Battleaxe being converted at Rosyth Dockyard. The ship's torpedo tubes were removed to allow the fitting of an additional lattice mast carrying a Type 965 long-range air-search radar, with <b>deckhouses</b> built to house the radar equipment and operators. Battleaxes Squid mortars were swapped with the aft mounted 4-inch turret, while a more modern fire control system for the ship's guns were fitted.|$|R
25|$|The Navy {{placed the}} first {{permanent}} memorial, a ten-foot-tall basalt stone and plaque, over the mid-ship <b>deckhouse</b> on December 7, 1955. President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved {{the creation of}} a National Memorial in 1958. Enabling legislation required the memorial budgeted at US$500,000 be privately financed; however, $200,000 of the memorial cost was government subsidized.|$|E
25|$|The first steam {{boats were}} made of wood, but steel hulls were soon {{introduced}} and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the <b>deckhouse.</b> The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. These boats had a crew of twelve {{made up of a}} skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.|$|E
25|$|During and {{following}} the end of World War II, the Arizona's wrecked superstructure was removed and efforts began to erect a memorial at the remaining submerged hull. The Pacific War Memorial Commission was created in 1949 to build a permanent memorial in Hawaii. Admiral Arthur W. Radford, commander of the Pacific Fleet attached a flag pole to the main mast of the Arizona in 1950 and began a tradition of hoisting and lowering the flag. In that same year a temporary memorial was built above the remaining portion of the <b>deckhouse.</b> Radford requested funds for a national memorial in 1951 and 1952 but was denied because of budget constraints during the Korean War.|$|E
50|$|Equipment {{mounted on}} deck, {{such as the}} ship's wheel, binnacle, fife rails, and so forth, may be collectively {{referred}} to as deck furniture. Weather decks in western designs evolved from having structures fore (forward or front) and aft (rear) of the ship mostly clear; in the 19th century, pilothouses/wheelhouses and <b>deckhouses</b> began to appear, eventually developing into the superstructure of modern ships. Eastern designs developed earlier, with efficient middle decks and minimalist fore and aft cabin structures {{across a range of}} designs.|$|R
50|$|Like the Flower-class sloops, {{they were}} {{single-screw}} fleet sweeping sloops used almost entirely for minesweeping, although only ten were {{completed by the}} Armistice in 1918. However, they had identical <b>deckhouses</b> and gun shields {{at either end of}} the vessel, with straight stems and sterns. Furthermore, four of those completed had the single mast aft of the centrally-located funnel, and the rest had the mast forward of the funnel. The symmetrical design was completed with fake anchors at the stern to confuse enemy targeting.|$|R
60|$|Shortly {{after the}} launch entered the lagoon, the Danish boat hove her anchor and steamed out to sea. Dick, who had engaged a {{half-breed}} pilot {{to take the}} launch home, lounged in a canvas chair under the poop awning. His eyes were half closed, for the white boats and <b>deckhouses</b> flashed dazzlingly in the strong light as the steamer lurched across the vivid swell of the Caribbean. The cigarette he languidly held had gone out, and his pose was slack.|$|R
