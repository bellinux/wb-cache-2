5|$|At {{first two}} groups {{established}} themselves on fertile grounds in Silesia: One {{on the left}} bank of the Oder River south of Wrocław, {{in the area that}} included Mount Ślęża, and one around the Głubczyce highlands; both stayed in their respective regions during the 400–120 BC period. Burial and other significant Celtic sites in Głubczyce County were investigated in Kietrz and nearby Nowa Cerekiew. The Ślęża group disintegrated eventually within the local population, while the one at Głubczyce Upland apparently migrated out in the southern direction. More recent discoveries include Celtic settlements in Wrocław County, where in Wojkowice a well-preserved 3rd century BC <b>grave</b> <b>of</b> a woman with bronze and iron bracelets, brooches, rings and chains was found.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} more than 1,000 Athenians died in the battle, with another 2,000 taken prisoner, and that the Thebans fared similarly. Plutarch {{suggests}} that all 300 of the Sacred Band were killed at the battle, having previously been seen as invincible. In the Roman period, the 'Lion of Chaeronea', an enigmatic monument {{on the site of}} the battle, was believed to mark the resting place of the Sacred Band. Modern excavations found the remains of 254 soldiers underneath the monument; it is therefore generally accepted that this was indeed the <b>grave</b> <b>of</b> the Sacred Band, since it is unlikely that every member was killed.|$|E
