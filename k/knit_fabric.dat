25|$|The Pirelli {{dry suit}} was {{designed}} in the 1930s and used by Italian frogmen during World War II. It became available for recreational divers {{after the war and}} was patented (US Pat. No. 2,570,019) in 1951 for Pirelli by Eugenio Wolk, listed as the inventor. This two piece suit was made from thin and elastic rubber, optionally bonded to a <b>knit</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforcement liner except at the sealing areas at the neck, wrists and waist. The waist seal was achieved by overlapping the jacket and trousers and folding the overlap down more than once before securing it in place over a profiled heavy rubber waistband using an elastic belt which pulls the rolled part into a groove in the waistband. Neck and cuff seals were the forerunners of the latex seals still used for this application. The patent claims this to be the first application of thin and flexible form-fitting rubber for the manufacture of dry suits, and also patents the waist seal system. The suits were intended to be worn over woolen underwear for thermal protection. There was no facility to inject air during a dive. These suits were available in four sizes and five styles, three of which were full length two-piece suits with integral boots, one of which was lined with cloth, and two of which had an optional integral hood on the jacket. The other two models were a two-piece with short sleeves and legs, and a one piece short trouser unit with suspenders which sealed on the chest and thighs.|$|E
2500|$|British frogmen of World War II and {{for some}} time {{afterwards}} used a similar one or two piece rubberized <b>knit</b> <b>fabric</b> suit by Siebe Gorman. They produced the one-piece front-entry Sladen suit with integral rubber helmet, developed by the British Admiralty for use with manned torpedoes, and in the late 1950s also the Essjee two-piece swim suit, based on the Sladen suit. The Essjee suit consisted of a jacket with rubber hood and lightweight wrist cuffs, and trousers shod with moulded rubber soles. The two parts were sealed by rolling the overlapped rubber skirts of the jacket and trousers together and these were {{held in place by}} a separate rubber cummerbund. Soft sponge-rubber pads inside the hood covered the ears and allowed them to be equalised. There was space under the suit for plenty of [...] woollen underclothes. The suit was available in proofed gabardine or rubberised stockinette, with the cloth on the outside and the rubber inside, to protect the rubber from sunlight while in use.|$|E
2500|$|Neoprene {{is a type}} of {{synthetic}} rubber which can be foamed during manufacture to a high proportion of tiny enclosed gas bubbles, forming a buoyant and thermally-insulating material, called [...] "foamed neoprene", [...] "foam-neoprene" [...] or [...] "expanded neoprene". Wetsuits are made from this material as it is a good insulator, waterproof, and is flexible enough for comfortable wear. The neoprene alone is very flexible, but not very resistant to tearing, so it is skinned with a layer of <b>knit</b> <b>fabric</b> bonded to each side for strength and abrasion resistance. Foamed neoprene may be used for the shell of a drysuit, providing some insulation due to the gas within the material, as in a standard wetsuit. If torn or punctured, leading to flooding, a foam-neoprene suit retains the insulation and buoyancy of the gas bubbles, like a wet suit, which is proportional to the thickness of the foam, Although foamed-neoprene dry suits provide some insulation, thermal under-suits are usually worn in cold water.|$|E

Both, Thermal comfort properties such as thermal absorptiveness, thermal conductivity, air permeability and utility properties like percent stretch, spirality, bursting strength of core yarn <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> and hollow yarn <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> were assessed. A new method was proposed and discussed for producing hollow yarns at fabric stage (in this case <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric)</b> which involved the following steps: - a) Production of ring spun yarns, comprising nylon as a core and cotton as a sheath, using Ring Spinning System. b) Production of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> of different <b>knit</b> structures viz., single jersey, rib and interlock using above mentioned yarn. c) Dissolution of core element i. e.

40|$|Single-layered warp <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> were {{produced}} by the 60 D/ 36 F (containing 36 filaments) polyester yarn with differential shrinkage (DS) property in this study. Due to the differential shrinkage property, the fabric becomes curly and bulkier, simulating cotton fabric {{in terms of its}} appearance and fabric handle. The performance and appearance of these DS polyester warp <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> were evaluated objectively and subjectively. The testing results demonstrated that the DS polyester warp <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> had better abrasion property, worse pilling resistance due to the mechanical property of polyester yarn when compared with 100 % cotton warp <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric.</b> Meanwhile, lower water vapour permeability and air resistance were found for DS polyester warp <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> resulting from the dense structure of yarn shrinkage after heat-moisture treatment. Besides, the fabric handle was evaluated by Kawabata evaluation system and subject to trial under dry and wet fabric condition. DS polyester warp <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> provide better recovery under low stress mechanical pressure.
