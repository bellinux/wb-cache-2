5|$|Pinker also {{speaks about}} {{evolutionary}} psychology in the podcast {{and believes that}} this area of science {{is going to pay}} off. He cites the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are many areas of study, such as beauty, religion, play, and sexuality, that were not studied 15 years ago. It is thanks to evolutionary psychology that these areas are being studied.|$|E
5|$|Some sources, such as Claxton, {{state that}} there was only a single boiler, but others, such as Fletcher and Maginnis, state that there were three side by side. This {{apparent}} discrepancy is explained by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were three separate boilers or boiler compartments sharing a common housing.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the product {{and the manner in}} which it is {{processed}} led to concerns that it might be a risk to human health, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> have been no reported cases of foodborne illnesses due to consumption of the product. Among consumers, media reporting significantly reduced its acceptance as an additive to ground beef.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} post World War II developments in West Natick, the homes are colonial in style, with street names reminiscent of the Robin Hood legend. The homes were built in 1948 and the neighborhood remains popular due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> no through traffic, {{and most of the}} houses have been enlarged with additions.|$|R
5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of {{the main part of}} the building also burned through and collapsed. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. The fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30am the fire was declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of {{committees}} is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Several details {{contribute}} to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are only a few}} technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium makes it possible to use zirconium for most of the applications; second, hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium-free zirconium in the late 1950s. Furthermore, the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity.|$|E

50|$|Not every set {{of natural}} numbers is computable. The halting problem, {{which is the}} set of (descriptions of) Turing {{machines}} that halt on input 0, is a well-known example of a noncomputable set. The existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are only countably many Turing machines, and thus only countably many computable sets, but there are uncountably many sets of natural numbers.|$|R
5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species {{apparently were}} present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The primary aims {{of therapy}} are {{returning}} function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications {{used in the}} management of MS may have several adverse effects, and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different alternative treatments are pursued by many people, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is little supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study. Stem cell therapy is being studied.|$|E
5|$|Within the conch fisheries, one of {{the threats}} to {{sustainability}} stems from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is almost as much meat in large juveniles {{as there is in}} adults, but only adult conchs can reproduce, and thus sustain a population. In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing, larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate. On a number of islands, subadults provide the majority of the harvest.|$|E
50|$|The court {{dismissed}} in {{part the}} plaintiffs' claim of unlawful tying.The court wrote that, although Christou's SOCO nightclubs had sufficient facts to support antitrust standing, it must consider Christou as an individual. The court found that Christou had alleged sufficient <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> had been an antitrust injury (to his reputation), but not that the injury to Christou as an individual resulted directly from the antitrust violation.|$|R

A confounding factor might {{be responsible for the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the consistent and the varied S﷓R mapping conditions gave rise to different display﷓size functions in Schneider and Shiffrin's (1977) study. Their claim that automatic detection and controlled search are qualitatively different is also discussed...|$|R

5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament {{of a wide range}} of constituents' views.|$|E
5|$|At mid-season, WCBS {{announced}} {{that for the}} 2003–04 season it had acquired the broadcast rights to The People's Court after WNBC, which had been airing the revived series since its 1997 debut, dropped it from its lineup. WCBS announced plans to move The People's Court into the time slot that was occupied by Millionaire and the still-airing 4:30 pm local newscast once it joined the station's lineup in September 2003. This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season, and BVT's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were compounded by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were not many time slots available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late-night slots that syndicators try to avoid.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected {{and that was the}} primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E
30|$|It {{is evident}} that {{cooperative}} communication brings significant benefit in improving the communication quality of wireless communication networks. Cooperative wireless communication was originally designed {{with the assumption that}} all the nodes involved always help each other and cooperate in a socially efficient manner. However, assumption on complete cooperation is broken by the <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> exist relays <b>that</b> are attacked by the network attackers and misbehave for selfish or malicious intentions.|$|R

5|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} {{have historically}} been kept in captivity, {{under the assumption that}} they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide, nearly 100 were kept in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour porpoise and five finless porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were few breeding attempts, many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the masing molecule, {{there are}} a few {{requirements}} that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place. The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, and despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.|$|E
40|$|Discourse of deviant {{behavior}} becomes {{difficult because}} of its complexity and relativity. Its complexity stems from the <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are many concepts should be considered, namely medical concepts, legal aspects, and morals issues. Its relativity comes from the <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are many perspectives, such as cross-cultural perspectives, subculture variations, ecological context, variation over time, and situational aspects. Sociologists have been made explanation on deviant behavior but not yet comprehensive. Sociological perspectives on deviant behavior can be categorized as structural functional theory, symbolic interaction theories, and conflict theory. Each of them tries to explain major question, basic assumption, and causes of deviance by using its own perspective. For example, control theory has been emphasis that because the lack of strong tied (legal or social) from others, individual tends to conduct defiantly. Sociologists also has been tried to comprehend ways people neutralize their misbehavior. Using economic perspective and control theory to eliminated corruption conducted by apparatus in district development program as an example, this article concluded that it is {{needed to make a}} comprehensive perspective in solving deviant behavior problems, such as corruption...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, {{against the}} strong theory {{and for the}} weak theory, Searle insists, [...] "it could not be the case, as some have maintained, <b>that</b> all <b>facts</b> are {{institutional}} social <b>facts,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are no brute facts, because the structure of institutional <b>facts</b> reveals <b>that</b> they are logically dependent on brute <b>facts.</b> To suppose <b>that</b> all <b>facts</b> are institutional social would produce an infinite regress or circularity {{in the account of}} institutional <b>facts.</b> In order <b>that</b> some <b>facts</b> are institutional, there must be other <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> are brute physical, biological, natural.

5|$|The {{inquiry and}} {{subsequent}} compensation cases found that Rangers had been inept in their administration and complacent after the {{incidents in the}} 1960s. The disaster also highlighted, however, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were no established safety standards that should be adhered to, let alone any means of enforcing such standards. This had been first recommended nearly 50 years earlier, after the 1923 FA Cup Final. The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973, and legislation was enacted with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. This law cut the capacity of Ibrox to 65,000. In the short term, Rangers took the stopgap measure of installing benches in the North Stand, which was renamed the Centenary Stand.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John, who died in 1216. Its present name first {{appeared}} in a 1915 publication, The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight, when it was being run as a saddler's shop. The royal part of the name {{may have come from}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a carved king's head on the building, from a time when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, but whether this represented King John or another king is not known. The head was attached to one corner of the exterior, but is now inside the building, and a replica placed on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Finery forge: In {{addition}} to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in Chinese cupola furnaces, the ancient Chinese also created wrought iron {{by using the}} finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are wrought iron items from China dating to that period {{and there is no}} documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in {{addition to}} the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E
