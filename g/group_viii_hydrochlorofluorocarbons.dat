A number of other techniques such as volumetric chemisorption by hydrogen, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray fluorescence, and model reaction studies were also used to assist the investigations on these catalysts;Two adsorbed states of hydrogen, i. e., irreversible and reversible hydrogen, on the surfaces of monometallic Ru, Pt, and Cu particles and bimetallic Ru-Group Ib, Pt-Group Ib, and Pt-Re particles were observed directly via proton NMR. The same amounts of the irreversible hydrogen adsorbed on pure Ru catalysts were measured by both proton and the volumetric technique. This strongly chemisorbed hydrogen was used to determine the dispersion of <b>Group</b> <b>VIII</b> monometallic catalysts and the overall dispersion of the Ru-Cu and Pt-Cu bimetallic catalysts. A metal-to-metal hydrogen spillover phenomenon was observed on Group VIII-Cu bimetallic catalysts. Also, the weakly adsorbed hydrogen could spill over from the metal surfaces onto the support and exchange with the OH group;The electronic environments on surfaces of monometallic catalysts are sensitive to changes in metal dispersion, state of adsorbed hydrogen, and residual chlorine. Hydrogen tends to bond more strongly with smaller metal particles containing more defect-like sites but adsorbs more weakly on chlorine-contaminated ruthenium surfaces. Minor perturbations of the valence electrons were inferred on Ru-Cu and Pt-Cu bimetallic systems. Strong electronic interactions between Pt and Re were found in the Pt-Re bimetallic catalysts;Surface compositions for the Ru-Cu and Pt-Cu bimetallic catalysts were determined by NMR of adsorbed hydrogen.

Copper has the strongest tendency to form bimetallic particles with a <b>Group</b> <b>VIII</b> element among the Group lb metals.

They are Lorentz-violating quasiparticles marked by a strongly tilted conic dispersion along a certain momentum direction and therefore have no analogs in the standard model.

As predicted, a pair of type-II Dirac crossings is experimentally confirmed along the k(z) axis. Interestingly, we observed conic surface states around time-reversal-invariant momenta (Gamma) over bar and (M) over bar points.

Group I was treated with propolis 30 days prior received BBN, and then these animals were treated daily with propolis; Groups II and III was treated with subcutaneous and oral propolis (respectively) concurrently with BBN.
