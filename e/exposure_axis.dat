40|$|Objectives: The {{aim was to}} {{construct}} and validate a gender-specific job exposure matrix (JEM) for physical exposures {{to be used in}} epidemiological studies of low back pain (LBP). Materials and Methods: We utilized two large Finnish population surveys, one {{to construct}} the JEM and another to test matrix validity. The <b>exposure</b> <b>axis</b> of the matrix included exposures relevant to LBP (heavy physical work, heavy lifting, awkward trunk posture and whole body vibration) and exposures that increase the biomechanical load on the low back (arm elevation) or those that in combination with other known risk factors could be related to LBP (kneeling or squatting). Job titles with similar work tasks and exposures were grouped. Exposure information was based on face-to-face interviews. Validity of the matrix was explored by comparing the JEM (group-based) binary measures with individual-based measures. The predictive validity of the matrix against LBP was evaluated by comparing the associations of the group-based (JEM) exposures with those of individual-based exposures. Results: The matrix includes 348 job titles, representing 81 % of all Finnish job titles in the early 2000 s. The specificity of the constructed matrix was good, especially in women. The validity measured with kappa-statistic ranged from good to poor, being fair for most exposures. In men, all group-based (JEM) exposures were statistically significantly associated with one...|$|E
40|$|The job-exposure matrix {{described}} {{has been}} developed for use in population based studies of occupational morbidity and mortality in England and Wales. The job axis of the matrix {{is based on the}} Registrar General's 1966 classification of occupations and 1968 classification of industries, and comprises 669 job categories. The <b>exposure</b> <b>axis</b> is made up of 49 chemical, physical, and biological agents, most of which are known or suspected causes of occupational disease. In the body of the matrix associations between jobs and exposures are graded to four levels. The matrix has been applied to data from a case-control study of lung cancer in which occupational histories were elicited by means of a postal questionnaire. Estimates of exposure to five known or suspected carcinogens (asbestos, chromates, cutting oils, formaldehyde, and inhaled polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were compared with those obtained by detailed review of individual occupational histories. When the matrix was used exposures were attributed to jobs more frequently than on the basis of individual histories. Lung cancer was significantly more common among subjects classed by the matrix as having potential exposure to chromates, but neither method of assigning exposures produced statistically significant associations with asbestos or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Possible explanations for the failure to show a clear effect of these known carcinogens are discussed. The greater accuracy of exposures inferred directly from individual histories was reflected in steeper dose response curves for asbestos, chromates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The improvement over results obtained with the matrix, however, was not great. For occupational data of the type examined in this study, direct exposure estimates offer little advantage over those provided at lower cost by a matrix...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{vagus nerve}} in motion-induced {{conditioned}} taste aversion (CTA) was studied in hooded rats. Animals with complete, selective gastric vagotomy failed to form conditioned taste aversion after multiple conditioning sessions in which the conditioned stimulus (a cider vinegar solution) was drunk immediately before a 30 -min <b>exposure</b> to vertical <b>axis</b> rotation at 150 deg/s. Results are discussed {{with reference to the}} use of CTA as a measure of motion-induced 'sickness' or gastrointestinal disturbance, and because motion-induced CTA requires that both the vagus nerve and the vestibular apparatus be intact, in light of the possible convergence of vegal and vestibular functions...|$|R
40|$|To study whether {{controlled}} breathing, {{known to}} ameliorate motion sickness, speeds habituation to nauseogenic motion {{when used in}} a novel accelerated training regime, 30 participants (13 men, 17 women, ages 18 - 51 years) were randomized to either a Breathing group or a Control group. Randomization was balanced for rotation tolerance measured during a first <b>exposure</b> to off-vertical <b>axis</b> rotation (OVAR 72 Â°sec. - 1). Participants subsequently received four exposures to OVAR in 1 -hr. (accelerated training). The Breathing group followed taped instructions to control their breathing during training and when retested the next day. There was overall habituation with stimulus repetition, shown {{by an increase in}} tolerance for motion, a reduction in symptoms, and speeded recovery times on retesting. There was a tendency for greater habituation with controlled breathing...|$|R
40|$|Cold exposure, {{especially}} {{early in}} life, can be stressful. We examined if cold <b>exposure</b> affects HPA <b>axis</b> sensitivity and global DNA methylation {{in the brain}} in Australian zebra finches (Taenopygia gutta). We hypothesized that cold exposure {{during the first two}} weeks post-hatch alters HPA sensitivity and global brain DNA methylation levels in juveniles and adults. Control birds showed the predicted elevation in plasma corticosterone (Cort) after restraint stress in adulthood, however cold exposed birds exhibited a blunted Cort response. There {{was no significant difference in}} global methylation levels between treatments. Juveniles showed no significant difference between baseline and restraint plasma Cort levels, but cold exposed birds had significantly lower methylation levels. DNA methylation studies suggest that both hypomethylation on a global scale and hypermethylation in specific gene sequences can occur after adverse early life events. The attenuated Cort response could protect against the noxious effects of prolonged glucocorticoid secretion...|$|R
50|$|The battle lasted three days, {{with the}} Italian and German forces {{trying to break}} out of the encirclement. These attempts, {{including}} several bayonet charges by the Italian units, were repelled with high casualties, and the situation seemed hopeless enough that the Italian regimental commanders were ordered to burn their units' flags. The extreme cold, exhaustion and hunger further worsened the situation, along with the complete <b>exposure</b> of the <b>Axis</b> forces (blocked in the valley floor) to the Soviet fire (coming from the sides). Some men committed suicide out of desperation.A Russian colonel was sent three times to ask for surrender; in the first two occasions, the offer was refused, but a number of Italian soldiers individually accepted to lay down their weapons and were marched to the Soviet lines. The third time the colonel was sent, however, German Schutzstaffels intervened during the parley and gunned down both him and the Italian negotiators.|$|R
40|$|Preterm birth {{remains a}} major health issue worldwide. Since the 1990 s, women {{at risk for}} preterm birth {{received}} a single course of exogenous antenatal corticosteroids (ACSs) to facilitate fetal lung maturity. More recently, repeated or multiple courses of ACS have been supported to provide continued fetal maturity support for women with continued risk of preterm birth. However, exogenous ACS reduces birth weight which, in turn, is associated with adverse adult outcomes such as coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The long-term effects of ACS <b>exposure</b> on HPA <b>axis</b> activity and neurological function are well documented in animal studies, {{and it appears that}} ACS, regardless of dose exposure, is capable of affecting fetal HPA axis development causing permanent changes in the HPA axis that persists through life and is manifested by chronic illness and behavioral changes. The challenge in human studies is to demonstrate whether an intervention such as ACS administration in pregnancy contributes to developmental programming and how this is manifested in later life...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Ergonomics [© Taylor & Francis] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] people are exposed to whole-body vibration in many environments. This paper investigates the effects of horizontal whole-body vibration and standing posture on task performance. Sixteen participants were exposed to random vibration (up to 4 Hz), whilst performing a timed pegboard task in two standing postures. Objective and subjective indicators of performance were used. Time taken to complete the task increased progressively with increases in vibration magnitude; the fore-and-aft posture generally showed greater performance decrements and postural interruptions (> 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.) than the lateral. For both postures, performance was better during y-axis vibration than during x-axis vibration. Subjective ratings showed similar trends to time data. Impairments due to dual <b>axis</b> <b>exposure</b> were well predicted using r. s. s. summation calculations based on single axis components. These results indicate that best performance for those standing in moving environments will be achieved if individuals adopt a lateral posture with the most severe vibration in the y-axis...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliable}} operation of trunk pipelines requires efficient monitoring of their technical state. At present, the issues involving evaluation {{of stress and}} strain in the most dangerous black spots of pipelines are urgent for the oil-and-gas industry. The problem is especially pressing for operations in corrosion-active media containing hydrogen sulfide, since hydrogenation leads {{to the formation of}} pores and cracks in steel. This paper is concerned with the magnetic, mechanical and structural characteristics of two advanced steel grades which are widely used for the construction of high-duty gas pipelines. The study shows that the numerical values of magnetic parameters depend on the magnetization direction about the control-rolling axis and correlate with the strength of X 70 steel grade. It is found that for estimating the operating tensile stress, one should measure the magnetic characteristics in different directions about the pipe <b>axis.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to the hydrogen-containing medium leads to a significant decrease in the metal plasticity, an increase in the ultimate stress and yield stress, and a slight increase in the coercivity. The duration of the hydrogen charging dramatically affects the deformation behaviour of coercivity, thus providing a tool for magnetic monitoring of mechanical stress in steel pipes for transporting aggressive types of natural gas...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} 200 years, an {{enormous}} number of synthetic chemicals with diverse structural features have been produced for industrial, medical and domestic purposes. These chemicals, originally thought to have little or no biological toxicity, are widely used in our daily lives as well as are commonly present in foods. It was not until the first World Wildlife Federation Wingspread Conference held in 1994 were concerns about the endocrine disrupting (ED) effects of these chemicals articulated. The potential hazardous effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on human health and ecological well-being are one of the global concerns that affect the health and propagation of human beings. Considerable numbers of studies indicated that endocrine disruption is linked to “the developmental basis of adult disease,” highlighting the significant effects of EDC exposure on a developing organism, leading to the propensity of an individual to develop a disease or dysfunction in later life. In this review, we intend to provide environmental, epidemiological and experimental data to associate pollutant exposure with reproductive disorders, in particular on the development and function of the male reproductive system. Possible effects of pollutant exposure on the processes of embryonic development, like sex determination and masculinization are described. In addition, the effects of pollutant <b>exposure</b> on hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal <b>axis,</b> testicular signaling, steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Failure of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to habituate to {{repeated}} stress exposure is related with adverse health outcomes, but {{our knowledge of}} predictors of non-habituation is limited. Rumination, defined as repetitive and unwanted past-centered negative thinking, is related with exaggerated HPA axis stress responses and poor health outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} was to test whether post-stress rumination was related with non-habituation of cortisol {{to repeated}} stress exposure. Twenty-seven participants (n= 13 females) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) twice on consecutive afternoons. Post-stress rumination was measured after the first TSST, and HPA axis responses were assessed by measuring salivary cortisol 1 min before, and 1, 10, 20, 60, and 120 min after both TSSTs. Stress <b>exposure</b> induced HPA <b>axis</b> activation on both days, and this activation showed habituation indicated by lower responses to the second TSST (F= 3. 7, p= 0. 015). Post-stress rumination after the first TSST was associated with greater cortisol reactivity after the initial stress test (r= 0. 45, p< 0. 05) and with increased cortisol responses to the second TSST (r= 0. 51, p< 0. 01), indicating non-habituation, independently of age, sex, depressive symptoms, perceived life stress, and trait rumination. In summary, results showed that rumination after stress predicted non-habituation of HPA axis responses. This finding implicates rumination as one possible mechanism mediating maladaptive stress response patterns, and it might also offer a pathway through which rumination might lead to negative health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether or not chloroform and alcoholic extracts of Ashwagandha root, prevent stress induced impairment in spermatogenesis, steroidogenesis and oxidative damage in the testis by suppressing the activation of hypothalamus-pituitary- adrenal <b>axis.</b> <b>Exposure</b> of adult male rats to chronic stress (restraint, 1 h followed by forced swimming exercise, 15 minutes) for 1 month resulted in a significant increase in serum corticosterone concentration coupled with a significant decrease in serum testosterone concentration and a significant reduction in counts of germ cells in stage VII of spermatogenesis and epididymal sperm count. In addition, there was a decrease in the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes and concentrations of non-enzymatic anti-oxidants (ascorbic acid and tocopherol) accompanied by an increase in malondialdehyde concentration in the testis indicating oxidative damage. However, oral administration of ethanolic or chloroform extracts of Withania somnifera (each 10 mg/kg body weight/rat/day for 1 month) or mifepristone a synthetic anti-glucocorticoid drug (10 mg/kg body weight/rat/day, last five days of the experiment) to rats 1 hour prior to stress regime did not result in changes mentioned above. The results indicate that stress alters testicular activity by suppressing the testicular steroidogenic activity and causing oxidative damage, which are effectively prevented by root extracts of Ashwagandha by suppressing stress induced activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Therefore, crude extracts of Ashwagandha have the potential to be used for reproductive abnormalities caused by stress...|$|R
40|$|Consumption of {{deoxynivalenol}} (DON), a trichothecene mycotoxin commonly {{detected in}} cereal-based foods, causes impaired growth in many animal species. While growth retardation {{is used as}} a basis for regulating DON levels in human food, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Oral exposure of mice to DON rapidly induces multiorgan expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and this is followed by upregulation of several suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), some of which are capable of impairing growth hormone (GH) signaling. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that impairment of the GH axis precedes DON-induced growth retardation in the mouse. Subchronic dietary exposure of young (4 -week old) mice to DON (20 ppm) over a period of 2 – 8 weeks was found to (1) impair weight gain, (2) result in a steady-state plasma DON concentration (40 – 60 ng/ml), (3) downregulate hepatic insulin-like growth factor acid-labile subunit (IGFALS) mRNA expression, and (4) reduce circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) and IGFALS levels. Acute oral exposure to DON at 0. 5 – 12. 5 mg/kg body weight (bw) markedly suppressed hepatic IGFALS mRNA levels within 2 h in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas 0. 1 mg/kg bw was without effect. DON-induced IGFALS mRNA upregulation occurred both with and without exogenous GH treatment. These latter effects co-occurred with robust hepatic suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 upregulation. Taken together, these data suggest that oral DON <b>exposure</b> perturbs GH <b>axis</b> by suppressing two clinically relevant growth-related proteins, IGFALS and IGF 1. Both have potential to serve as biomarkers of effect in populations exposed to this common foodborne mycotoxin...|$|R
40|$|Retinoic acid (RA), {{the major}} biologically active form of vitamin A, is {{required}} for normal development of the mouse embryo. In particular, RA {{is necessary for the}} correct anteroposterior specification of the embryonic <b>axis.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to RA at certain stages of development leads to premature truncation of the vertebral column, accompanied by spina bifida. In contrast, embryos that are homozygous null for RARgamma do not exhibit these defects, indicating that this receptor specifically mediates this teratogenic effect. Differential display PCR and suppression subtractive hybridization were employed using the RARgamma null embryos in an attempt to identify downstream targets that may be involved in the formation of these abnormalities. As a result of this process, a full-length cDNA molecule encoding a novel member of the aldo-keto reductase family (AKR 1 A 4) was cloned. Although RA does not regulate the expression of this gene, its developmental expression pattern and substrate specificity suggests a potential role for this enzyme in the protection of certain rapidly growing embryonic structures from harmful metabolites. A precise level of RA signaling is also required for proper specification of vertebral identity. Exposure to excess RA during the early stages of gastrulation results in posterior homeotic transformations of several vertebrae. These transformations are correlated with shifts in the anterior boundaries of Hox expression. In contrast, the loss of functional RARs leads to anterior vertebral transformations. Although retinoic acid response elements have been identified in Hox promoters, it is likely that RA regulates the expression of some Hox genes through intermediary factors. Cdx 1 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor that influences vertebral patterning {{in a manner similar to}} RARs, and is directly regulated by RA in the mouse embryo. Analysis of an allelic series of RARgamma/Cdx 1 null mutant mice demonstrated that Cdx 1 and RARgamma act synergistically to pattern certain cervical vertebrae. In addition, Cdx 1 {{is required for}} the full effect of RA treatment on the vertebral column. However, Cdx 1 does not mediate all of the effects of RARgamma as the incidence of a thoracic to cervical vertebral transformation is significantly higher in RARgamma/Cdx 1 double mutants as compared to either single null mouse...|$|R
40|$|Preterm {{delivery}} {{occurs in}} approximately 10 % of all pregnancies. Prenatal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) reduces {{the incidence of}} respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in these babies. Therefore, administration of multiple courses of sGCs became common practice. Animal and human {{studies have demonstrated that}} multiple courses of sGCs can have long-term effects. While the majority of animal studies have been undertaken in male offspring, it is emerging that there are profound sex differences in the consequences of prenatal sGC exposure. To our knowledge, no studies have determined the effects of prenatal sGC exposure on hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis function in female offspring while accounting for reproductive cycle status, or determined if there are effects on pregnancy parameters. Pregnant guinea pigs were administered three courses of betamethasone (Beta), dexamethasone (Dex) or vehicle on gestational days 40 / 41, 50 / 51 and 60 / 61. In adulthood (age range: postnatal days 126 – 165), basal and activated HPA axis function were assessed at various stages of the reproductive cycle. The female offspring were then mated and underwent an undisturbed pregnancy. Females were killed in the luteal phase of the reproductive cycle following litter weaning, and molecular analysis undertaken. In the luteal phase, Beta-exposed females exhibited significantly lower basal salivary cortisol levels (P < 0. 05). Dex-exposed females also exhibited significantly lower basal salivary cortisol levels during the luteal phase (P < 0. 05), but increased basal salivary cortisol levels during the ostrous phase (P < 0. 01). The Beta-exposed females exhibited increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression in the CA 1 / 2 region of the hippocampus (P < 0. 05) and MC 2 R mRNA in the adrenal cortex (P < 0. 05). The Dex-exposed animals exhibited higher hippocampal GR and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) mRNA levels (P < 0. 05). Beta-exposed females showed reduced fecundity (P < 0. 05). In Dex-exposed females there was a lower male to female sex ratio. In conclusion, prenatal sGC <b>exposure</b> affects HPA <b>axis</b> activity, in a cycle-dependent manner, and long-term reproductive success. The clinical implications of the findings on endocrine function and pregnancy in females are profound and further follow-up is warranted in human cohorts. Furthermore, we have shown there are considerable difference in phenotypes between the Beta- and Dex-exposed females and the specific endocrine and maternal outcome is contingent on the specific sGCs administered during pregnancy...|$|R

[] irradiating are used in DOELAP to deliver accident-and protection-level doses to personal dosimeters. It is absolutely paramount that the calibration radiation fiends are well characterized. During the summer of 1997, the DOELAP Calibration Laboratory Facility was remodeled to accommodate an increasing workload. Remodeling the laboratory facility and the installation of a new, automated control calibration system required a complete characterization of DOELAP'S 20 Ci [] beam, irradiated verify that the new DOELAP configuration was in compliance with the DOE Standard for Performance Testing of Personnel Dosimetry Systems.

In addition, a new procedure was authored to provide guidelines for future DOELAP rail mapping experiments. To ensure that all dosimeters receive the same dose during DOELAP irradiations, beam uniformity measurements were also source using both an ionization chamber and a film exposure. Beam uniformity results, using an ion chamber, showed a pronounced penumbra {{at the edge of a}} whole body phantom at 100 centimeters. The beam was fairly uniform at 200 centimeters. Beam uniformity results the DOELAP dosimeter mounting area showed that the beam was uniform at both 100 and 200 centimeters with maximum deviation of approximately 1 - 1. 5 %. Comparing beam uniformity results between the ionization chamber and the film exposures determined that using film was an acceptable practice for determining beam uniformity and requires less time.
