500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1958, Bánáthy {{recruited}} two patrols of boys to take part. [...] Chiorini was recruited to serve as senior patrol leader. At the beginning {{there was not much}} discussion of leadership competencies. Chiorini said, [...] "White Stag was all about creating an environment in which youth led youth. At the time, Scouting was not necessarily a boy-led program. I remember <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> in Béla’s mind what a boy-led Scouting program looked like. There was no question about who was in charge in White Stag. The boys were." [...] Fran Peterson, a local Scouter who served on the National Engineering Service for the Boy Scouts of America, along with St. Clair, Sujan, and Tripp, helped Bánáthy develop the White Stag program. Some of them remained active with it into the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|In {{hopes of}} averting the lean years that troubled most {{expansion}} teams, George Imlach, the Sabres first coach and General Manager, attempted {{to build a}} high-scoring club to excite the local hockey fans. Perreault {{was regarded as a}} smooth skater and tremendous stickhandler. [...] Perreault was chosen to be the franchise player around which a team could be built and succeed. [...] Although Martin and Perreault had played two years together with the Montreal Junior Canadiens (Perreault even lived with Martin's family during the 1969–70 season), they had never played on the same line before being paired in Buffalo. [...] Since Martin {{was one of the few}} who could keep up with Perreault as a skater they were paired together after the Sabres drafted Martin. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> during the 1971–72 season that Perreault and Martin were a natural pairing. [...] Sabres coach Joe Crozier felt the two just needed a third player who would stay high and check. [...] Sabres coach quickly teamed Robert with Perreault and Martin after the trade. [...] The two players complemented Perreault and became a dynamic combination that dazzled fans. [...] They were dubbed the French Connection by writer Lee Coppola as a reference to the Academy Award-winning film and their heritage via the Buffalo Auditorium message board. [...] The pair played together as a regular line through the 1974–75 season. [...] At times, they were split up during the last four seasons. [...] When they played together they often faced the opposition's top defensive lineups. [...] Since the trio were tremendous skating scoring threats these opponents would concentrate on checking them and staying on top of them. [...] For example, against the Montreal Canadiens Bob Gainey's line would oppose them. [...] Rick Martin once said about this line [...] "I had Jimmy Roberts between me and my shadow." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{reviewing}} {{the facts of}} the case, and the contrasting responses of the circuits, Marshall explained the justices' reasoning. He admitted that the legislative history of the FAA did not offer any guidance as to how a court might handle a case with both arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims, much less suggest that they had even considered the problem. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that while Congress and its drafters had expressed some concern about the effect of delays in dispute resolution, [...] "the purpose behind its passage was to ensure judicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2015, the Under the Gun Theater created [...] Swarm of Spoilers, {{a parody}} show based on [...] George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones series. The comedic play recaps the {{previous}} four seasons of television show and premiered the Friday before HBO aired the first episode of its fifth season. Kevin Mullaney, who directed Swarm of Spoilers, stated: [...] "I'm somebody who's very sensitive about spoilers, so I {{wanted to make sure}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> from the title." [...] The final production included 45 of the series' characters, and was played by an 18-person ensemble.|$|E
2500|$|With Prisoner of Azkaban, {{production}} of the Harry Potter films switched to an eighteen-month cycle, which producer David Heyman explained was [...] "to give each [...] the time it required." [...] Chris Columbus, {{the director of the}} previous two films, decided not to return to helm the third instalment as he [...] "hadn't seen [...] own kids for supper in the week for {{about two and a half}} years." [...] Even so, he remained on as a producer alongside Heyman. Guillermo del Toro was approached to direct, but considered the film [...] "so bright and happy and full of light, that [...] wasn't interested." [...] Marc Forster turned down the film because he had made Finding Neverland and did not want to direct child actors again. M. Night Shyamalan was considered to direct but turned it down because he was working on his own film, The Village. Warner Bros. then composed a three-name short list for Columbus's replacement, which comprised Callie Khouri, Kenneth Branagh (who played Gilderoy Lockhart in Chamber of Secrets) and eventual selection Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón was initially nervous about accepting as he had not read any of the books, or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct, as he had immediately connected to the story. Cuarón's appointment pleased J. K. Rowling who loved his film Y Tu Mamá También and was impressed with his adaptation of A Little Princess. Heyman found that [...] "tonally and stylistically, [...] was the perfect fit." [...] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuarón assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón recalls, [...] "Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.' That was the most important piece of acting work that we did on Prisoner of Azkaban, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that everything they put in those essays was going to be the pillars they were going to hold on to for the rest of the process." ...|$|E
