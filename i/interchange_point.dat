25|$|The CPRR {{eventually}} purchased 53 {{miles of}} UPRR-built grade from Promontory Summit (MP 828) to Ogden, U.T. (MP 881), {{which became the}} <b>interchange</b> <b>point</b> between trains of the two roads. The transcontinental line was popularly known as the Overland Route after the principal passenger rail service that operated over {{the length of the}} line until 1962.|$|E
25|$|The {{station is}} an <b>interchange</b> <b>point</b> between the Midland Main Line (MML) from London St Pancras to Leeds and {{services}} on the Cross Country Route from Birmingham through Cambridge to Stansted Airport and Norwich. Until the mid twentieth century, {{the station was}} host to through trains from Manchester and Glasgow to London, Norwich to Liverpool and Grimsby to Shrewsbury and Llandudno.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, in {{the western}} portion of Fayette County, Col. Page formed a small logging railroad, Loup Creek and Deepwater Railway which {{extended}} from an <b>interchange</b> <b>point</b> at Deepwater, West Virginia with the C on the south bank of the navigable Kanawha River about four miles (6km) up a steep grade into the mountainous terrain southward, following the winding Loup Creek to reach a sawmill at Robson. Col. Page, who had been involved with building the C and more recently in developing some of its coal branches, arranged for the larger railroad to operate his short line to the sawmill on the Loup Creek Estate under a verbal agreement which was to last until 1903.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultimate}} {{result was}} that the Northern Pacific was left without a direct connection to Chicago, the primary <b>interchange</b> <b>point</b> {{for most of the}} large U.S. railroads. Fortunately, the Northern Pacific was not alone. James J. Hill, controller of the Great Northern, which was completed between the Twin Cities and Puget Sound in 1893, also lacked a direct connection to Chicago. Hill went looking for a road with an existing route between the Twin Cities and Chicago which could be rolled into his holdings and give him a stable path to that important interchange. At the same time, Edward Henry Harriman, head of the Union Pacific Railroad, was also looking for a road which could connect his company to Chicago.|$|E
2500|$|While never very busy, Verney Junction {{was a local}} <b>interchange</b> <b>point</b> for {{a century}} from which {{excursions}} as far as Ramsgate could be booked. Situated [...] from Baker Street, the station is one of London's disused Underground stations and, although it never carried heavy traffic, the Aylesbury line was important in {{the expansion of the}} Metropolitan Railway into what became Metro-land.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station is}} an <b>interchange</b> <b>point</b> between the Midland Main Line from [...] to [...] and long-distance {{services}} on the Cross-Country route from [...] through [...] to [...] or [...] (the zero milepost {{on the latter}} route is {{at the south end}} of platform 1). Until the mid twentieth century, the station was also served by through trains from Manchester and Glasgow to London.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the stations to handle passenger demand. High volumes of passengers on vehicles required large bus stations at busy <b>interchange</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
30|$|Stations with {{charging}} {{devices are}} {{spread in the}} pedestrian area and its border, possibly closed to <b>interchange</b> <b>points.</b> PICAV are available at stations and {{should be returned to}} stations.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1925 SAL {{operated}} 3,929 {{miles of}} road, not including its flock of subsidiaries; {{at the end of}} 1960 it reported 4,135 miles. The main line ran from Richmond via Raleigh, North Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia to Jacksonville, Florida, a major <b>interchange</b> <b>point</b> for passenger trains bringing travelers to the Sunshine State. [...] From Jacksonville, Seaboard rails continued to Tampa, St. Petersburg, West Palm Beach and Miami.|$|E
2500|$|The current route, about [...] long, {{includes}} {{infrastructure that}} is more than 100 years old. The system operates at capacity during peak hours—23 trains per hour—and limits speed for safety reasons. The new route would run parallel to the current right-of-way, enabling dispatching alternatives, potential speed increases, and up to 25 more trains per hour. There are no plans for Amtrak to stop at Secaucus Junction, the only intermediate station and a major <b>interchange</b> <b>point</b> in the NJT system.|$|E
2500|$|Rigby Yard (Yard 13) {{was built}} in 1922 at the South Portland {{junction}} of the eastern and western routes of Boston & Maine's Portland division. [...] Rigby became the busiest New England rail yard north of Boston as car storage and locomotive servicing facilities were eliminated from older yards in Portland. [...] Maine Central and Boston & Maine freight trains originated or terminated in Rigby Yard. [...] Yard 12 became the <b>interchange</b> <b>point</b> for Sanford and Eastern trains.|$|E
50|$|Goodmayes and Chadwell Heath {{were the}} <b>interchange</b> <b>points</b> with the {{existing}} main line network; {{at that time the}} Great Eastern main line was already quadruple track, and extensive goods sidings were available at Goodmayes.|$|R
50|$|The railway was {{immediately}} successful, and road coaches from points further west altered their routes {{so as to}} connect with the new railway at convenient <b>interchange</b> <b>points,</b> although goods traffic was slower to develop.|$|R
50|$|Cove is an unincorporated {{community}} in Perry County, Pennsylvania. It {{is a former}} borough and a railway junction <b>interchanging</b> <b>point</b> with the Norfolk Southern Harrisburg Line. A post office existed here from 1870 to 1967.|$|R
2500|$|Cincinnati {{was a major}} {{center of}} {{railroad}} traffic in the late 19th and early 20th century, especially as an <b>interchange</b> <b>point</b> between railroads serving the Northeastern and Midwestern states with railroads serving the South. [...] However, intercity passenger traffic was split among no fewer than five stations in Downtown Cincinnati, requiring the many travelers who changed between railroads to navigate local transit themselves. [...] The Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which operated through sleepers with other railroads, was forced to split its operations between two stations. [...] Proposals to construct a union station began {{as early as the}} 1890s, and a committee of railroad executives formed in 1912 to begin formal studies on the subject, but a final agreement between all seven railroads that served Cincinnati and the city itself would not come until 1928, after intense lobbying and negotiations, led by Philip Carey Company president George Crabbs. [...] The seven railroads: the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad; the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad; the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway; the Louisville and Nashville Railroad; the Norfolk and Western Railway; the Pennsylvania Railroad; and the Southern Railway selected a site for their new station in the West End, near the Mill Creek.|$|E

50|$|Turning {{loops of}} the Toronto {{streetcar}} system serve as termini and turnback points for streetcar routes in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The single-ended streetcars require track loops {{in order to}} reverse direction. Besides short off-street track loops these can also be larger <b>interchange</b> <b>points,</b> having shelters and driver facilities, or {{be part of a}} subway station structure for convenient passenger interchange.|$|R
50|$|Since all of Toronto's current streetcars are single-ended, turning loops are {{provided}} at the normal endpoints of each route and at likely intermediate turnback locations.A routing on-street around {{one or more}} city blocks {{may serve as a}} loop, but most loops on the system are wholly or partly off-street. Many of these are also <b>interchange</b> <b>points</b> with subway or bus services.|$|R
5000|$|These {{principles}} {{provide a}} good reason for preferring to use a [...] "symmetric" [...] term for the incidence relation. Thus instead of saying [...] "a point lies on a line" [...] one should say [...] "a point is incident with a line" [...] since dualizing the latter only involves <b>interchanging</b> <b>point</b> and line ("a line is incident with a point").|$|R
