40|$|Over {{the last}} eight years we have been {{developing}} advanced MRF tools and techniques to manufacture meter-scale optics for use <b>in</b> <b>Megajoule</b> class laser systems. These systems call for optics having unique characteristics that can complicate their fabrication using conventional polishing methods. First, exposure to the high-power nanosecond and sub-nanosecond pulsed laser environment in the infrared (> 27 J/cm{sup 2 } at 1053 nm), visible (> 18 J/cm{sup 2 } at 527 nm), and ultraviolet (> 10 J/cm{sup 2 } at 351 nm) demands ultra-precise control of optical figure and finish to avoid intensity modulation and scatter that can result in damage to the optics chain or system hardware. Second, the optics must be super-polished and virtually free of surface and subsurface flaws that can limit optic lifetime through laser-induced damage initiation and growth at the flaw sites, particularly at 351 nm. Lastly, ultra-precise optics for beam conditioning are required to control laser beam quality. These optics contain customized surface topographical structures that cannot be made using traditional fabrication processes. In this review, we will present {{the development and implementation of}} large-aperture MRF tools and techniques specifically designed to meet the demanding optical performance challenges required in large-aperture high-power laser systems. In particular, we will discuss the advances made by using MRF technology to expose and remove surface and subsurface flaws in optics during final polishing to yield optics with improve laser damage resistance, the novel application of MRF deterministic polishing to imprint complex topographical information and wavefront correction patterns onto optical surfaces, and our efforts to advance the technology to manufacture large-aperture damage resistant optics...|$|R

40|$|In {{the captive}} Indian {{rhinoceros}} (Rhinoceros unicornis), two disease complexes {{with a high}} incidence-chronic foot problems and uterine leiomyomas-may be linked to excess body weight (BW). In this study, intake and digestion trials were conducted (by means of 7 -day weigh-backs, and 5 -day total fecal collections, respectively) with I I Indian rhinoceroses at four zoological institutions in Europe and the United States to quantify energy and mineral nutrition on conventional or roughage-only diets. Diets comprising a variety of forages (grass hay only, a combination of grass hay and grass silage, straw, or a mixture of grass and legume hay) were offered as the roughage source, along with various concentrates, produce, and supplements. Water intake was quantified, and urine samples were obtained opportunistically. The animals consumed 0. 5 - 1. 1 % of their BW in dry matter (DM) daily, with calculated digestible energy (DE, <b>in</b> <b>megajoules</b> MJ) values ranging from 0. 27 to 0. 99 MJ DE/kg BW 0. 75 /day compared to an estimated requirement of 0. 49 - 0. 66 MJ DE/kg BW 0. 75 /day. Seven of 11 rhinos (64 %) fed restricted levels of concentrate plus forage consumed DE in excess of this estimate. Even on roughage-only diets, some individuals consumed energy well above the presumed metabolic requirements. Hence, restriction of both concentrates and roughage may be important for weight management in this species. Water intake ranged from 30 to 49 mL/kg BW daily (3. 4 - 5. 2 L/kg ingested DM), similar to values that have been reported for domestic equids. Excretion amounts and patterns also resembled those found in horses. Endogenous fecal losses measured for Ca, P, Cu, Fe, and Zn indicate that the maintenance requirements of these minerals should be met in Indian rhinoceroses by diets that meet recommendations for domestic horses. It is particularly important to evaluate dietary adequacy in mineral nutrition in this species {{in concert with the}} need for restricted energy intake, especially with regard to the hypothetical involvement of a low Zn supply in chronic foot problems...|$|E
40|$|The metric and U. S. {{customary}} {{systems of}} measure differ in terminology for fluid volume, mass, temperature, pressure, power and energy. The {{relationships between the}} metric and U. S. customary system for these units are described and illustrated graphically in the following text. Fluid Volume- Fluid volumes are usually measured in milliliters or liters. Small quantities of liquid products are expressed as milliliters or as cubic centimeters. Gasoline, milk and other similar sized volumes are measured in liters. Mass - Mass {{is the amount of}} matter in an object and is normally referred to as weight. The common metric units of mass are milligram, gram, kilogram and tonne (1, 000 kilograms). Medicine, vitamins and other small objects are measured in milligrams. Several food products are measured in grams. Heavier objects, including larger food quantities and humans, have masses expressed in kilograms. A truck load of material and other large quantities of matter are measured in tonnes. Mass and volume are related in the metric system. A milliliter of water at 4 °C (39. 2 °F) and at sea level is equal to a cubic centimeter of water and has a mass of one gram. A liter of water equal to 1, 000 cubic centimeters has a mass of one kilogram, and a cubic meter of water has a mass of one tonne. Temperature - Temperature in the metric system is measured in degrees Celsius (formerly called centigrade). Water freezes at 0 °C (32 °F) and boils at 100 °C (212 °F). Normal body temperature is 37 °C (98. 6 °F). A temperature of - 5 °F is equal to - 20. 5 °C. Pressure - Pressure, which is force per unit area, is measured in pascals. One pascal is a very small pressure, so kilopascal is the preferred unit for most commercial and industrial applications. Standard atmospheric pressure of 14. 7 pounds per square inch is equal to 101 kilopascals. Power- The unit of power in the metric system is the watt. Conventionally, we use entirely different units for power in mechanical, thermal and electrical systems. In the metric system, however, all power is measured in watts. A tractor rated at 100 horsepower in the U. S. customary system will have a rating of 74. 6 kilowatts in the metric system. Energy, Quantity of Heat - All forms of energy in the metric system are ex-pressed as joules. The nutrition calorie, which equals one kilocalorie, is replaced by the kilojoule, with one kilocalorie being equal to approximately four kilojoules. Larger heat quantities such as furnaces and air conditioners are measured <b>in</b> <b>megajoules</b> (1, 000 kilo joules). Kilowatt-hour, a commonly used measure of energy, is replaced with the megajoule. One kilowatt-hour equals 3. 6 megajoules...|$|E

As of October 7, 2013, this facility is understood to have achieved an important milestone towards commercialization of fusion, namely, {{for the first time}} a fuel capsule gave off more energy than was applied to it. This is a major step forward. A similar large-scale device <b>in</b> France, Laser <b>Mégajoule,</b> was officially inaugurated in October 2014.

40|$|Neutron Imaging {{is a key}} {{diagnostic}} for use in {{inertial confinement}} fusion (ICF) experiments, and has been fielded on experiments at Omega and Z. It {{will also be a}} key diagnostics at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and eventually at the Laser <b>Megajoule</b> <b>in</b> France. Most systems are based on a neutron pinhole array placed at the target chamber while it is imaged by a scintillating fiber block. The light output of this scintillator is coupled via a reducer to a fiber bundle which transports the image to a CCD camera. Alternatively some systems use optical lens assemblies to focus the light onto a camera. For ICF applications the neutron imaging systems will primarily look at 14. 2 MeV neutrons. However, 2. 2 MeV and 20 + MeV neutrons will also be present and will potentially provide key information...|$|R
40|$|Millisecond pulse-forming {{networks}} {{are used to}} generate an energy pulse of up to several <b>Megajoules</b> <b>in</b> a defined pulse shape and time span. Passive pulse-shaping methods are often used. An alternative is to use switches to commutate energy from a storage medium into the load. The type of storage medium and the power levels used define the switch type. For capacitive storage, one requires a turn-on switch, for inductive storage, a turn-off switch is required, and for battery storage, a turn-on/turn-off switch is generally required. Such a system usually requires a staged energy transfer. In order to shape the pulse, either a final pulse-shaping stage can {{be included in the}} system or a modular system can be employed. This paper discusses the use of PWM to approximate the pulse shape as required. This allows the reduction of the number of modules and greater control over the discharge pulse shape. Results using a two-module system are presented and a comparison is made to a four-module system not using PWM. Articl...|$|R
40|$|As {{the size}} of optics increases, {{such as in the}} optical {{coatings}} being developed for the National Ignition Facility in US and the Laser <b>MegaJoules</b> <b>in</b> France, the difficulty also increases in measuring and defining their laser damage threshold. Measuring the threshold on small witness samples ({le}cm) rather than full aperture optic (=m) is advantageous, and in this article, the threshold of large-area components is addressed in two ways. First, a model based on the R-on-l threshold distribution is shown to predict the threshold of a large optic {{with a high degree of}} confidence. The average R-on-l threshold provides a reliable, accurate value to evaluate coatings. An automated damage test bench has been developed at CEA. Secondly, the damage threshold has to be defined according to final use of the component. LLNL has defined a functional damage threshold to set limits on maximum damage size. An empirical power law dependence of average damage size on peak fluence was found; this can be used to predict the damage behavior of large-aperture optics exhibiting the same damage morphology...|$|R
40|$|CMOS image sensors (CIS) are {{promising}} candidates {{as part of}} optical imagers for the plasma diagnostics devoted {{to the study of}} fusion by inertial confinement. However, the harsh radiative environment of Megajoule Class Lasers threatens the performances of these optical sensors. In this paper, the vulnerability of CIS to the transient and mixed pulsed radiation environment associated with such facilities is investigated during an experiment at the OMEGA facility at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE), Rochester, NY, USA. The transient and permanent effects of the 14 MeV neutron pulse on CIS are presented. The behavior of the tested CIS shows that active pixel sensors (APS) exhibit a better hardness to this harsh environment than a CCD. A first order extrapolation of the reported results to the higher level of radiation expected for Megajoule Class Laser facilities (Laser <b>Megajoule</b> <b>in</b> France or National Ignition Facility in the USA) shows that temporarily saturated pixels due to transient neutron-induced single event effects will be the major issue for the development of radiation-tolerant plasma diagnostic instruments whereas the permanent degradation of the CIS related to displacement damage or total ionizing dose effects could be reduced by applying well known mitigation techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of efficient X-ray sources for radiography on the LMJ (Laser <b>MégaJoule)</b> <b>in</b> the multi-kJ/ns range was demonstrated on the OMEGA laser facility (Univ.

We significantly enhanced the conversion efficiency of titanium (4 – 6 keV), copper (8 – 10 keV) and germanium (9 – 13 keV) foils {{by using an}} optimized pre-pulse/pulse combination. Since higher X-ray energy and therefore electronic temperature need hydroconfinement, plastic cylindrical hohlraums internally coated with titanium, copper and germanium with various OMEGA beam configurations were successfully tested from 2005 to 2009 [3 – 5]. In addition, many shots with metal-doped aerogel (Ti, Fe, Ge) were tested on OMEGA [6]. Recently we tested a new concept of “HYBRID sources” based on {{the combination of a}} thin titanium foil at the exit hole of a plastic cylinder filled with very low density SiO 2 aerogel (2 and 5 mg/cc). The benefit of the underdense medium is, first, to transport the laser energy to the titanium foil after its conversion into a supersonic ionization front and, second, to prevent foil expansion and excessive kinetic energy losses by longitudinal hydroconfinement...|$|R
40|$|The Centurion – Halite {{experiment}} {{demonstrated the}} feasibility of igniting a deuterium – tritium micro-explosion with an energy of not {{more than a few}} megajoule, and the Mike test {{the feasibility of}} a pure deuterium explosion with an energy of more than 10 6 <b>megajoule.</b> <b>In</b> both cases the ignition energy was supplied by a fission bomb explosive. While an energy of a few megajoule, to be released in the time required of less than 10 - 9 sec, can be supplied by lasers and intense particle beams, this is not enough to ignite a pure deuterium explosion. Because the deuterium-tritium reaction depends on the availability of lithium, the non-fission ignition of a pure deuterium fusion reaction would be highly desirable. It is shown that this goal can conceivably be reached with a “super Marx generator”, where a large number of “ordinary” Marx generators charge (magnetically insulated) fast high voltage capacitors of a second stage Marx generator, called a “super Marx generator”, ultimately reaching gigavolt potentials with an energy output in excess of 100 megajoule. An intense 10 7 Ampere-GeV proton beam drawn from a “super Marx generator ” can ignite a deuterium thermonuclear detonation wave in a compressed deuterium cylinder, where the strong magnetic field of the proton beam entraps the charged fusion reaction products inside the cylinder. In solving the stand-off problem, the stiffness of a GeV proton beam permits to place the deuterium target at a comparatively large distance from the wall of a cavity confining the deuterium micro-explosion. ...|$|R
40|$|The meteoroids {{and debris}} {{environment}} {{play an important}} role in the reduction of spacecraft life time. Ejecta or secondary debris, are produced when a debris or a meteoroid impact a spacecraft surface. These ejecta can contribute to a modification of the debris environment: either locally by the occurrence of secondary impacts on the component of complex and large space structures, or at long distance by formation of small orbital debris. This double characteristic underlines the necessity to model the damages caused by an HVI as well as the material ejection caused by the impact. Brittle materials are particularly sensitive to hypervelocity impacts because they produce features larger than those observed on ductile targets and the ejected fragments total mass including ejectas and spalls is in the order of 100 times bigger than the impacting mass. The French atomic energy commission (CEA) faces to the same problem <b>in</b> the Laser <b>MégaJoule</b> project (LMJ). The various instruments used in the experiment chamber will undergo many aggressions resulting from target disassembly. Thus the lasers optics will be bombarded as hypervelocity debris and shrapnel. In this study, the authors only focus on potential impacts of debris and shrapnel on fused silica optical debris shields. These Main Debris Shields called MDS are 20 mm thick fused silica plates placed in front of each lasers way out. 2 mm thick Disposable Debris Shields, DDS, located in front of the MDS might be used to stop vapour, particulate, droplets and substantially reduce very small shrapnel cratering on the main debris shields.
