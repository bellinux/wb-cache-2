One of its subdisciplines, dental <b>informatics,</b> is beginning to emerge as its own entity. While {{there is a growing}} cadre of trained dental informaticians, dental faculty and administrators in general are not very familiar with dental <b>informatics</b> as an area of scientific inquiry. Many confuse <b>informatics</b> with information technology (IT), are unaware of its scientific methods and principles, and cannot relate dental <b>informatics</b> to biomedical <b>informatics</b> as a whole. This article delineates <b>informatics</b> from information technology and explains the types of scientific questions that dental and other informaticians typically explore. Scientific investigation in <b>informatics</b> centers primarily on model formulation, system develop-ment, system implementation, and the study of effects. <b>Informatics</b> draws its scientific methods mainly from information science, computer science, cognitive science, and telecommunications.

50|$|<b>Informatics</b> {{refers to}} the science of information, the {{practice}} of information processing, and the engineering of information systems. <b>Informatics</b> underlies the academic investigation and practitioner application of computing and communications technology to healthcare, health education, and biomedical research. Health <b>informatics</b> {{refers to the}} intersection of information science, computer science, and health care. Health <b>informatics</b> describes the use and sharing of information within the healthcare industry with contributions from computer science, mathematics, and psychology. It deals with the resources, devices, and methods required for optimizing the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in health and biomedicine. Health <b>informatics</b> tools include not only computers but also clinical guidelines, formal medical terminologies, and information and communication systems. Medical <b>informatics,</b> nursing <b>informatics,</b> public health <b>informatics,</b> pharmacy <b>informatics,</b> and translational bioinformatics are subdisciplines that inform health <b>informatics</b> from different disciplinary perspectives. The processes and people of concern or study are the main variables.|$|R
