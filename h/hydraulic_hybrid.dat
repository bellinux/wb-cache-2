50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>hybrid</b> vehicle systems {{consists}} of four main components: the working fluid, reservoir, pump/motor (in parallel hybrid system) or in-wheel motors and pumps (in series hybrid system), and accumulator.

In an electric hybrid system, energy is stored in the battery and is delivered to the electric motor to power the vehicle. During braking the kinetic energy of the vehicle is used {{to charge the battery}} through the regenerative braking. In <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hybrid</b> system, the pump/motor extracts the kinetic energy during braking to pump the working fluid from the reservoir to the accumulator. Working fluid is thus pressurized, which leads to energy storage. When the vehicle accelerates, this pressurized working fluid provides energy to the pump/motor to power the vehicle. For a parallel hybrid system, fuel efficiency gains and emissions reductions result from reduced mechanical load on the internal combustion engine due to the torque provided by the hybrid system.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2014. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Rajesh Rajamani. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvi, 259 pages, appendices A-D. The {{amount of energy}} being consumed is increasing each year, with the highest sector being the transportation industry. Within the transportation sector, the highest area of oil consumption is in the small and lightweight vehicle category. With increasing oil prices and decreasing supply, methods of reducing oil consumption have been studied. One is by developing a hybrid vehicle, which combines {{the internal combustion engine}} with an additional power source. For lightweight vehicles, electric hybrid vehicles have been thoroughly studied. While <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hybrids</b> have been studied for larger applications such as delivery trucks and buses, little research has been done in the area of small, lightweight vehicles. Hydraulics have a higher power density than electronics, so <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hybrids</b> can get better performance than electric hybrids while reducing fuel consumption. In this research, a series and power-split architecture is studied for a passenger vehicle. Because of the additional hydraulic power source along with energy storage, the optimal way to control these vehicles is not known. Therefore, an energy management strategy must be developed to determine the optimal strategy for splitting the power between the engine and the hydraulics. Three different methods are used to develop the energy management strategy - a rule-based strategy based on dynamic programming results, stochastic dynamic programming, and model predictive control. An experimental hardware-in-the-loop setup is used to replicate a series hybrid in which the different energy management strategies are tried. Through simulation and experimentation, it was found that not one strategy works best in all scenarios, and variables such as knowledge of duty cycle and energy storage {{must be taken into account}} when developing the strategy. An input-coupled power-split hybrid was also studied, which combines the mechanical efficiency of the parallel hybrid with the engine management of a series hybrid. Through a series of simulations, a strategy that declutched the engine from the drivetrain while the vehicle is stopped gave a significant reduction in fuel consumption. Another advantage of the power-split architecture is the ability to operate the vehicle in different modes by declutching the engine and removing hydraulic units by the use of valves. By using this strategy, the fuel economy can be almost doubled over a baseline strategy which operates only in power-split mode. Finally, the size of the accumulator can have an effect on the fuel consumption, with a smaller accumulator leading to less fuel consumed; however, if the accumulator is too small, the performance starts to degrade with a downsized engine. The results of this research can be used to develop a toolbox that can be used for developing energy management strategies by having the user enter a model, objective function, and duty cycle for a system. By using other information, such as knowledge of duty cycle, the toolbox can determine the best method of developing the control strategy, reducing the amount of time and resources for developing an optimal control strategy...|$|R

This model allows a designer to compare noise sources for various configurations and to design compact and inherently quiet solutions. The model describes dynamics of the system by coupling lumped parameter pump and motor models with a one-dimensional unsteady compressible transmission line model. ^ The model has been verified with dynamic pressure measurements in the line over a wide operating range for several system structures.

The drive system will utilize new enabling technologies such as the INNAS Floating Cup pump/pump motors and the Toshiba Super Charge Ion Batteries (SCiB). The proposed architecture initially included a hydraulic-electric system, where the high power braking power is absorbed by the hydraulic system while energy is slowly transferred from both the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) drive train and the hydraulic drive train to the electric accumulator for storage. Simulations were performed to demonstrate the control method for the hydraulic system with in-hub pump motors. Upon preliminary analysis it is concluded that the electric system alone is sufficient. The final design is an electric system that consists of four in-hub motors. Analysis is performed on the system and MATLAB Simulink is used to simulate the full system.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of fossil fuel consumption {{has been a significant}} issue over the last decade. Mainly because of public awareness, increased fuel cost and stricter legislation. Today’s technological improvements have reduced fuel consumption and also emission of vehicles considerably. One of the most important solutions to this problem is hybridization. Hybridization in vehicle is using two or more distinct power sources. Additionally, the main objective of hybridization in vehicle is improving the fuel consumption and reducing hazardous air pollutants without lowering vehicle performance and other satisfaction criteria. Development of hybridization systems can be fallen into two categories: electric and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hybrids.</b> This project illustrates performances of HHV (<b>hybrid</b> <b>hydraulic</b> vehicles) and HEV (hybrid electric vehicles) in NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) and 10 - 15 mode (Japanese Driving cycle) by using simulation models, which has been done by the LMS Imagine Lab Amesim rev 7 thand 8 th. The following paper compares HRB (hydraulic regenerative braking system) as a hydraulic system and a parallel hybrid electric system (HEV) with the Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery on the light weight vehicle (1 ton). Results show higher performance in HEV, about 13. 7 % during NEDC and 25. 4 % during (10 - 15) improvement in fuel consumption although high energy density and low power density are inherent battery characteristics. Also, all the evidence point to high cost components and short- life time. The HRB model saves around 11 % during NEDC and 23. 3 % during 10 - 15 Mode in fuel consumption in addition to high power density and low energy density. In other words, limitation for accumulating energy is an intrinsic system character. However, high response, low component cost and weight with long life time are advantages of HRB. Two problems exiting in HRB model are: firstly, the necessity of using big size pumps for fully charging hydraulic accumulators that would be impossible in a light vehicle; and secondly the limitation of capturing huge amount of energy in accumulators. In this paper the attempt is made to explicate some of the brand new solutions to alleviate some of these weak points...|$|R
