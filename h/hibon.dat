5000|$|In 2005, Ben <b>Hibon,</b> with Stateless Films and Blinkink, {{created an}} {{animation}} for MTV Asia's weekly film show called MTV Screen. After {{a very good}} response, MTV Asia commissioned his company to produce a short film {{on the back of}} it. “As I was creating concepts drawings,” explains Ben <b>Hibon,</b> “MTV Asia was starting to plan their annual Music Awards. They then {{came up with the idea}} of ‘launching’ our project by using it to brand the show; posters, banners, trophy design and intro/bumper animations. So the brief changed from ‘short film’ to ‘branding package’ for the MTV Awards show.” It formed into a seven-minute prologue / intro animation to the world of ‘Codehunters’, an ongoing MTV/BLINKINK project launched around the MTV Asia Awards 2006 in Bangkok.This was obviously a great opportunity for the project to be in front of such a big audience. There was going to be about 400 million people watching the show! There was the challenge of making an animation that would have to work as one film, but also broken into nine scenes to be used throughout the show as a prologue animation, setting the tone, pace and style for a bigger story. Blinkink's Ben Hibon's was contacted with directing and Bart Yates producing an animation for MTV Asia to be show at the MTV Music Awards. Scriptwriting and storyboarding happened simultaneously, as the company had a very short lead time for pre-production. “We started the production based on the boards, creating concepts and artworks on the way,” Ben explains. “Production time was tight, so we had to be creative throughout the whole process, both with creation of assets, techniques and solutions. Although the vision of ‘Codehunters’ was very much defined from the start, the process of making it was very organic, which made it fun and exciting for everyone involved with the project.” European TV was full of cheap programs in the early 80s and Ben <b>Hibon</b> was also a big fan of European graphic-novelists like Bilal, Moebius, Mattoti or Liberatore. “I think that my inspiration lies there”, he begins, “in the middle of two totally different narrative worlds; between the more static illustrative style of the west and the fast-moving stylised techniques of the East. ‘Codehunters’ is an accumulation of those ideas, where characters and worlds are not so culturally defined; it exists in between those genres and styles.‘The main visual ideal for this film was to try to make the CG feel textured and warm, just like an inked illustration on paper,’, says <b>Hibon.</b> ‘We tried to create a different look by reproducing the ink lines and the hand-drawn feel directly onto the CG models. I also wanted to approach the direction/animation style differently, by applying 2D techniques to CG; not use motion capture or realistic animation, but work with stylised motions, key frames and parallaxes. I think the end result has got a definite feel; a combination of all those ideas.”The crew were going for a stylised look in the texturing and the rendering, so the use of 3D with a 2D feel created a very original finish. “It was also important for the sets desert and the city to feel vast and open. Converting to 3D allowed us to create such scale, including camera movements and depth,” explained <b>Hibon.</b> “The original 2D drawings for the characters were intricate and very detailed, from shapes to textures. We tried to retain those details in the modeling process, for the characters to stay truthful to their original concepts. Those are things that would have been difficult to achieve in 2D, and almost impossible to that level of detail.”The modeling and the texturing of the characters/elements was the most important and difficult stage in translating the animation. <b>Hibon</b> worked closely with Axis's modeler Sergio Caires, who got the feel for the characters straight away. The texturing/line art style was then meticulously reproduced on each model, matching the original artworks using different drawing/3D packages. “It was a great process to see 2D concepts become ‘real’,” “For the environments, we decided to keep the modeling easy to render, but instead spend a lot of time designing or drawing intricate textures for each specific item, to bring as much detail and richness as possible to the backgrounds and keep that 2D/3D contrast. It was a great process to see the layers of ink, dirt, hand-drawn details and painted textures dress the 3D world and make it come to life.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{style of}} the {{animated}} series differs from the graphics of the game itself. The animated series relies on a simple and stylized 2D look, which allowed director Ben <b>Hibon</b> to [...] "create a complete visual re-interpretation {{of the world and}} its inhabitants". The videos were produced using a combination of Adobe Photoshop, Flash and After Effects. Initial reference frames were created with Photoshop, which were then animated in Flash and exported as separate layers into After Effects. The layers were composed onto a 3D stage with multiple foreground, middle ground and background elements, which allowed the use of 3D cameras and lighting to give depth and movement to the video.|$|E
50|$|Borderlands runs on a {{modified}} Unreal Engine 3. The developers decided that their original, cel shaded-style concept artwork would suit the game {{better than a}} more realistic, polished method. This method produces cartoon-like action visuals and also enables the landscape and weapons to be highly detailed. The original art director was so disappointed at her work being scrapped that she left the company. It was later acknowledged by Randy Pitchford that the art style was not entirely original to Gearbox, and was inspired by Ben Hibon's short film Codehunters. <b>Hibon</b> has stated {{that while he was}} contacted by Gearbox to possibly work on artwork for Borderlands, nothing ever came of the talks.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{organizers}} of the M3-Competition did contact researchers in the area of artificial neural networks to seek their participation in the competition, only one researcher participated, and that researcher's forecasts fared poorly. The reluctance of most ANN researchers to participate at the time was due to the computationally intensive nature of ANN-based forecasting and the huge time series used for the competition. In 2005, Crone, Nikolopoulos and <b>Hibon</b> organized the NN-3 Competition, using 111 of the time series from the M3-Competition (not the same data, because it was shifted in time, but the same sources). The NN-3 Competition found that the best ANN-based forecasts performed comparably with the best known forecasting methods, but were far more computationally intensive. It was also noted that many ANN-based techniques fared considerably worse than simple forecasting methods, despite greater theoretical potential for good performance.|$|E
50|$|Since their {{pioneering}} use by Lotte Reiniger {{in silent}} films, silhouettes {{have been used}} for a variety of iconic, graphic, emotional, or conversely for distancing, effects in many movies. These include many of the opening credit sequences of the James Bond films. The opening sequence of the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents features a silhouetted profile of Alfred Hitchcock stepping into a caricatured outline of himself, and in his movie Psycho the killer in the shower scene manifests as a terrifying silhouette. A scene from E.T. showing the central characters on a flying bicycle silhouetted against the full moon became a well-known movie poster. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 contains an animated sequence in silhouette illustrating a short story The Tale of the Three Brothers that is embedded in the film.

The accuracy (or error) between actual and estimated (external) data is then measured using one or more performance metrics.

We combine the DSA method Winters' Exponential smoothing.

40|$|Neural {{networks}} have been advocated {{as an alternative}} to traditional statistical forecasting methods. In the present experiment, time series forecasts produced by neural networks are compared with forecasts from six statistical time series methods generated in a major forecasting competition (Makridakis et al.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that statistically simple extrapolative forecasting methods provide more accurate ex ante forecasts, than do ones that are statistically sophisticated. The problem is that scholars attempting to develop new, more accurate forecasting methods have all but ignored this knowledge on forecast accuracy, (Fildes and Makridakis 1995, Fildes et al, 1998, Makridakis <b>Hibon,</b> 2000. Makridakis and <b>Hibon,</b> (2000), Fildes (2001) and Small and Wong (2002) suggest that what is needed are new statistically simple extrapolative forecasting methods that are robust to the fluctuations that occur in real-life business data. This research discusses the development and validation of the Direct Set Assignment (DSA) extrapolative forecasting method. The DSA method is a new, statistically simple, non-linear, rule based fuzzy logic extrapolative forecasting method that was developed within the Mamdani Development Framework, and has been hypothesized to provide more accurate ex ante forecasts than alternative statistically simple extrapolative methods. The relative forecast accuracy of the DSA method was established in three forecasting competitions that relied on the procedures, standards and {{a subset of the}} time series used in the M 3 International Forecasting Competition. The DSA method, and the DSA method in combination with Winter 2 ̆ 7 s Exponential Smoothing, together provided the highest observed forecast accuracy in seven of the nine subcategories and two of the three categories of time series as well as for all one hundred thirty time series, examined in this study. Also, the DSA method in combination with Winter 2 ̆ 7 s Exponential Smoothing provided the highest observed accuracy for the time series in this study in which a statistically significant trend was present. It can be concluded from these findings that the DSA method provides forecasts that are at least as accurate as the alternative extrapolative methods compared in this study. These finding however cannot be generalized beyond this study due to the limitation inherent in the forecasting competition methodology. The next step to advance the DSA method is to develop the means for the a priori identification of the DSA methods fuzzy set parameter. ...|$|E
30|$|In a somehow {{different}} direction, Papacharalampous et al. (2017 c) {{conduct a}} multiple-case study, i.e. {{a synthesis of}} 50 single-case studies, by using monthly precipitation and temperature time series of various lengths observed in Greece. Some important points regarding the comparison of univariate time series forecasting methods and additional concerns introduced when implementing the machine learning ones (hyperparameter optimization and lagged variable selection) in one- and multi-step ahead forecasting are illustrated in the latter study. Nevertheless, only large-scale forecast-producing studies could provide empirical solutions to several problems appearing {{in the field of}} (geophysical) time series forecasting. Such studies are rare in the literature. Beyond geoscience, Makridakis and <b>Hibon</b> (2000) use a real-world dataset composed by 3003 time series, mainly originating from the business, industry, macroeconomic and microeconomic sectors, to assess the one- and multi-step ahead forecasting accuracy of 24 univariate time series forecasting methods. In geoscience, on the other hand, there are only four recent studies, all companions of the present, to be subsequently discussed.|$|E
