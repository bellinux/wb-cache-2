40|$|Because of {{differences}} in case-mix across states, state-level case-mix-adjusted end-stage renal disease (ESRD) <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> are reported in each United States Renal Data System Annual Data Report to make the across-state comparisons valid. The adjusted rates were estimated by the direct adjustment method, a widely used method for adjusted event rate calculation, based on observed category-specific ESRD <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> in each state (called the observation-based method). However, when some adjusting categories in a state are small, the adjusted rate and the standard error for this state as estimated by this method may be inaccurate. This report proposes a model-based method that can overcome the disadvantages of the observation-based method and can be extended to continuous adjusting variables. National ESRD incident data and national population data from 1990 to 1999 were used. State-level adjusted ESRD <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated by both the observation- and the model-based methods. For the model-based method, a Poisson regression model was used to estimate category-specific ESRD <b>incident</b> <b>rates.</b> For large-population states, both observation- and model-based methods produced similar estimates for adjusted ESRD <b>incident</b> <b>rates.</b> For small-population states, however, the observation-based method produced year-to-year estimates of adjusted ESRD <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> that varied considerably and also had very large standard errors. In contrast, the model-based method produced stable estimates. The model-based method can overcome the disadvantages of the observation-based method for estimating state-level adjusted ESRD <b>incident</b> <b>rates,</b> especially for small states...|$|R
40|$|Aim.   This paper reports an {{examination}} of the relationship between adverse <b>incident</b> <b>rates,</b> the arrival of new junior staff on wards, and days of the week on acute psychiatric wards. Background.   Incidents of violence, absconding and self-harm in acute inpatient services pose risks to patients and staff. Previous research suggests that the arrival of inexperienced new staff may trigger more adverse incidents. Findings on the relationship between incidents and the weekly routine are inconsistent. Method.   A retrospective analysis was conducted of formally reported <b>incident</b> <b>rates,</b> records of nursing student allocations and junior doctor rotation patterns, using Poisson Regression. Variance between days of the week was explored using contingency table analysis. The data covered 30 months on 17 psychiatric wards, and were collected in 2002 – 2004. Findings.   The arrival of new and inexperienced staff on the wards was not associated with increases in adverse <b>incident</b> <b>rates.</b> Most types of incidents were less frequent at weekends and midweek. <b>Incident</b> <b>rates</b> were unchanged on ward-round days, but increased rates were found on the days before and after ward rounds. Conclusion.   Increased patient tension is associated with raised <b>incident</b> <b>rates.</b> It may be possible to reduce <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> by moderating stimulation in the environment and by mobilizing support for patients during critical periods...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Reports of violence, and {{injuries}} to both staff and patients, in acute psychiatric inpatient settings, {{have led to}} {{the development and implementation of}} training courses in the Prevention and Management of Violence and Aggression. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the training of acute psychiatric ward nursing staff, and officially reported violent <b>incident</b> <b>rates.</b> Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of training records (n = 312 course attendances) and violent <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> (n = 684 incidents) over two and a half years on fourteen acute admission psychiatric wards (n = 5384 admissions) at three inner city hospitals. Results: A positive association was found between training and violent <b>incident</b> <b>rates.</b> There was weak evidence that aggressive <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> prompt course attendance, no evidence that course attendance reduces violence, and some evidence that update courses trigger small short term rises in rates of physical aggression. Course attendance was associated with a rise in physical and verbal aggression whilst staff were away from the ward. Conclusions: The failure to find a drop in <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> after training, coupled with the small increases detected, raises concerns over its efficacy as a preventative strategy. Alternatively the results are consistent with a threshold effect, indicating that once adequate numbers of staff have been trained, further training maintains a low <b>rate</b> of <b>incidents...</b>|$|R

40|$|Using 2014 and 2015 {{data from}} the UK Near Miss Project, this paper {{examines}} the stability of self-report <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> for cycling near misses across these two years. It further examines {{the stability of the}} individual-level predictors of experiencing a near miss, including what influences the scariness of an incident. The paper uses three questions asked for only in 2015, which allow further exploration of factors shaping near miss rates and impacts of incidents. Firstly, a respondent's level of cycling experience; secondly, whether an incident was perceived as deliberate; and finally, whether the respondent themselves described the incident as a ‘near miss'(as opposed to only a frightening and/or annoying non-injury incident). Using this data, we find a decline of almost a third in <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> in 2015 compared to 2014, which we believe is likely to be largely an artefact due to differences in reporting rates. This suggests caution about interpreting small fluctuations in subjectively reported near miss rates. However, in both years near miss rates are many times more frequent than injury collisions. In both years of data collection our findings are very similar in terms of the patterning of incident types, and how frightening different incident categories are, which increases confidence in these findings. We find that new cyclists experience very high <b>incident</b> <b>rates</b> compared to other cyclists, and test a conceptual model explaining how perceived deliberateness, near-miss status, and scariness are connected. For example, incidents that are perceived to be deliberate {{are more likely to be}} experienced as very frightening, independent of their ‘near miss’ status...|$|R
