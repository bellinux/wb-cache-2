5|$|Large {{brick and}} stone {{factories}} near Pier 6, {{such as the}} Acadia Sugar Refinery, disappeared into unrecognizable <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> rubble, killing most of their workers. The Nova Scotia cotton mill located 1.5km (0.93 mile) from the blast was destroyed by fire {{and the collapse of}} its concrete floors. The Royal Naval College of Canada building was badly damaged, and several cadets and instructors maimed.|$|E

40|$|A few typos {{have been}} corrected, {{including}} {{the statement of}} Theorem 8. International audienceGiven two finite sets of integers S⊆∖{ 0 } and D⊆∖{ 0, 1 },the impartial combinatorial game (S,D) is played on a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> tokens. From a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> n tokens, each player can moveeither to a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> n-s tokens for some s∈ S, or to a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> n/d tokensfor some d∈ D if d divides n. Such games {{can be considered as}} an integral variant of -type games, introduced by Elwyn Berlekamp and Joe Buhlerand studied by Aviezri Fraenkel and Alan Guo, for which it is allowed to move from a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> n tokensto a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> n/d tokens for any d∈ D. Under normal convention, it is observed that the Sprague-Grundy sequence of the game (S,D) is aperiodic for any sets S and D. However, we prove that, in many cases, this sequence is almost periodic and that the set of winning positions is periodic. Moreover, in all these cases, the Sprague-Grundy value <b>of</b> a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> n tokens can be computed in time O(n). We also prove that, under misère convention, the outcome sequence of these games is purely periodic...|$|R
50|$|Zero tokens are {{not counted}} as a heap. Thus the digit dn is odd if a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> n tokens may be removed entirely, and even otherwise. The {{specification}} of one-heap results in dn applies to removing n tokens from a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> more than n. The two-heap results in dn apply to removing n tokens from a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> at least n+2, and separating the remainder into two nonempty heaps.|$|R
5|$|Further up the ridge, A Company—under Major Ben O'Dowd—faced {{a tougher}} task, and came under heavy attack. The first probes began at 21:30, {{targeting}} 1 Platoon {{which was the}} lowest of the three platoons on the west flank. The initial moves were then followed up by major Chinese assaults from three sides {{over the next three}} hours. Despite suffering many casualties the Chinese continued their attack, closing in and attacking the Australians with hand grenades. The Australians also suffered numerous casualties, with more than half the platoon killed or wounded, including all three Bren gunners. Fighting back with small arms fire, they held against repeated assaults, which increased in frequency and strength as the Chinese assaulted over <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> their own dead and wounded. By 01:00 O'Dowd ordered the survivors of 1 Platoon to withdraw through Company Headquarters into a new position in between 2 and 3 Platoons. For his leadership Lieutenant Frederick Gardner was later Mentioned in Despatches. The Chinese attacks then continued against 3 Platoon, lasting until 04:30, although they were not made with the same weight as the previous assaults.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution, the River Beal was used to power large weaving mills. Within one {{generation}} during the late-19th century, and following a boom in nearby Oldham, Milnrow's staple industry changed from wool weaving to cotton spinning. Soon, distinctive rectangular brick-built mills dominated Milnrow's landscape. Milnrow, the location of some of the earliest ring spinning companies, had many of the characteristics of a company town. The <b>Heaps</b> <b>of</b> Milnrow exercised significant deferential and political influence in the local area. Following the Great Depression, the region's textile sector experienced a decline until its eventual demise in the mid-20th century. Milnrow's last cotton mill was Butterworth Hall Mill, demolished in the late 1990s. Milnrow experienced population growth and suburbanisation {{in the second half of}} the 20th century, spurred by the construction of the M62 motorway through the area, making Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire commutable. Milnrow Metrolink station opened as part of Greater Manchester's light-rail Metrolink network on 28 February 2013.|$|E
5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Cornish mining {{industry}} went into decline, public opposition to the use of female and child labour in mines was rising. The Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act 1872 brought the mines of Cornwall under the provisions of the Mines Act 1842, which had previously applied only to coal mines, limiting the use of child labour in the mines and thus increasing costs. The Act prohibited women from working underground, which the bal maidens did not do, but it also forbade any child under ten from working in any mine, even on the surface. The passing of the Factory and Workshop Act 1878 drastically limited the use of female and child labour. The employment of children under 10 was banned outright, the maximum working hours for children aged 10–14 were drastically restricted, and women were banned from working over 56 hours per week. The sudden loss of cheap child labourers made the already weakened mining industries of Cornwall and West Devon even less profitable, and more than half the mines in the area went out of business in the following decade. Some bal maidens continued to work in surviving mines and in tin-streaming, but instability in the metal markets made what remained of the mining industries increasingly unviable. In the 1880s William Ewart Gladstone's Liberal government tried to ban female labour from mines altogether; although the Bill was defeated, the number of bal maidens continued to fall. At the 1891 census the number of working bal maidens had fallen to around half its 1850s–60s peak. By 1895 only 23 mines remained operational compared to 307 in 1873, and in 1901 Devon Great Consols, the last significant copper mine in Devon and Cornwall, closed. Electrification and the introduction of Frue Vanners at the surviving mines replaced most of the jobs still done by women, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few bal maidens remained in employment. With wartime shortages of raw materials and many younger men in the armed forces, some bal maidens were temporarily rehired to dress potash ore at a re-opened mine at St Austell, and to re-dress the existing spoil <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> defunct mines for wolfram and arsenic.|$|E

25|$|After more quarrels {{with the}} Portuguese high command to get {{supplies}} to his men, Schomberg and the British brigade pressed {{ahead in the}} next campaign. The following year the siege of Valencia de Alcántara took place from10 June and a fortnight later after a breach {{had been in the}} defences - the English who bore the brunt leading the main assault suffered heavy casualties but forced the surrender of the Spanish garrison. The Portuguese soon realized their mistake in the mistrust and sent <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> praise upon Schomberg and the English. The Count of Castelo Melhor made a comment soon after the surrender of Valencia de Alcantara.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Isabella went almost unnoticed and even {{approved}} by society {{according to the}} code of honour of the 16th century, and Diego Sandoval's murder was hardly investigated. Her year of death is not known with certainty but it was most likely 1545 or 1546, though other studies suggest she died in 1547 or 1548. It is believed that she {{was buried in the}} local church of San Fabiano but no grave and no trace leading to her have been found. While visiting Valsinni, Croce tried to discover Isabella's tomb but renovations in the church had destroyed all traces of the di Morra family burials, and his exploration behind an underground wall revealed only <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> bones.|$|E

25|$|The {{time and}} {{circumstances}} of its final extinction are wholly unknown, but {{the site is}} now desolate, and the whole neighbouring district, once celebrated {{as one of the}} most fertile in Italy, was by the mid-19th century almost wholly uninhabited. The position of the ancient city may nevertheless be clearly identified; and though no ruins worthy of the name are still extant, large <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> rubbish and foundations of ancient buildings mark the site of Heraclea near Policoro, about 5km from the sea, and a short distance from the right bank of the Aciris. Numerous coins, bronzes, and other relics of antiquity have been discovered on the spot. A medieval town, Anglona, was founded on the site; however, once a bishopric, now itself is but a heap of ruins, among which are those of an 11th-century church.|$|E
25|$|During {{the main}} season of its activity, May through September, the {{entrance}} to the nesting sites of P. gibbosus can be characterized by the scattered <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> sand or soil around their supporting structure, usually bricks or tree roots. The sand heaps are very low and spread out. In building these sand heaps, females can be observed backing out of the burrow with moist sand or soil that is spread around into the heaps using jerks of her front legs. While burrowing, P. gibbosus stands on its hind legs. In order to dig the actual burrow, P. gibbosus uses its tarsi and mandibles to dig a shaft that is at least two feet in length. The shaft culminates in an oval shaped cell in which eggs are provisioned. Other oval shaped cells line the shaft which are smaller in size and contain the skeletons of other bees that were killed and fed to the larvae as nutrients.|$|E
25|$|According to Efraim Karsh, {{before the}} {{fighting}} started, the IDF used loudspeakers broadcasting in Arabic {{to urge the}} locals to evacuate the camp, and he estimates that some 11,000 left. Stephanie Gutmann {{also noted that the}} IDF used bullhorns and announcements in Arabic to inform the residents of the invasion, and that the troops massed outside the camp for a day because of rain. She estimated that 1,200 remained in the camp, but {{that it was impossible to}} tell how many of them were fighters. After the battle, Israeli intelligence estimated that half the population of noncombatants had left before the invasion, and 90% had done so by the third day, leaving around 1,300 people. Others estimated that 4,000 people had remained in the camp. Some camp residents reported hearing the Israeli calls to evacuate, while others said they did not. Many thousands did leave the camp, with women and children usually permitted to move into the villages in the surrounding hills or the neighbouring city. However, the men who left were almost all temporarily detained. Instructed by Israeli soldiers to strip before they were taken away, journalists who entered Jenin following the invasion remarked that <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> discarded clothing in the ruined streets showed where they were taken into custody.|$|E

25|$|Bellefonte Furnace {{closed on}} December 21, 1910, and Nittany Furnace in 1911. Their last {{contribution}} to the railroad's prosperity was the huge <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> slag accumulated at the furnace sites: this was shipped over the Bellefonte Central to the PRR for use in construction projects. While the loss of furnace traffic would ultimately prove fatal to the Central RR of PA, the Bellefonte Central had found new sources of revenue. The McNitt-Huyett Lumber Company opened a mill at Waddle in 1909 and built an extensive network of 36inch (91.44cm) gauge track into the Scotia area, dual-gauging the Scotia branch and making use of the abandoned rights-of-way from the area's iron-mining heyday. The local timber was soon exhausted, and the branches to Mattern Bank and Scotia were abandoned in 1915. However, McNitt-Huyett built further extensions, and continued to haul logs to the Waddle mill until about 1919. Furthermore, high calcium limestone deposits in Bald Eagle Mountain, {{on the north side}} of the Buffalo Run valley, were now being exploited, much of their production going to steel mills in Pittsburgh. These quarries, eventually consolidated under the management of the Chemical Lime Company, would replace the iron furnaces as the principal generators of traffic on the Bellefonte Central.|$|E
25|$|The living {{conditions}} in Mokattam Village, {{and the other}} Zabbaleen settlements, are poor. According to Assad, in the 1970s, “the streets were so stacked with <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> assorted refuse {{that some of them}} could not be located. The air was heavily polluted by the smoke generated from fires that were either lit deliberately to dispose of unwanted waste, or resulted from the spontaneous combustion of organic residues.” There have been frequent fires in Mokattam, two of which were particularly severe and devastated the settlement in the 1970s. In its early years, the Mokattam Settlement lacked basic services; there were no health centers, pharmacies, or schools. Basic amenities such as piped water, sewage networks, and electricity were also missing. During the beginning decades of the Mokattam settlement, the community suffered from “high mortality and morbidity rates (especially among children), poor environmental conditions, and low income.” In 1983, the average household income per month was estimated at LE 70(approximately US$11.50 in January 2005) within the lowest 10th percentile of national urban income levels, with an average large household size of 8 persons. However, the {{living conditions}} of the Mokattam settlement improved after the Mokattam settlement received significant funding from the World Bank, in its upgrading program known as the Zabbaleen Environmental Development Program (ZEDP) in 1981 and from other international donors.|$|E
