5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease</b> {{in which}} the insulating covers of nerve cells {{in the brain and}} spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.|$|E
25|$|Progressive {{multifocal}} leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease</b> of {{the central}} nervous system that is caused by reactivation of a latent papovavirus (the JC polyomavirus) infection, that can cross the BBB. It affects immune-compromised patients and it is usually seen with patients suffering from AIDS.|$|E

50|$|<b>Demyelinating</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{traditionally}} classified in two kinds: <b>demyelinating</b> myelinoclastic <b>diseases</b> and <b>demyelinating</b> leukodystrophic <b>diseases.</b> In {{the first group}} a normal and healthy myelin is destroyed by a toxic, chemical or autoimmune substance. In the second group, myelin is abnormal and degenerates. The second group was denominated dysmyelinating diseases by Poser Therefore, since Poser <b>demyelinating</b> <b>diseases</b> normally refers to the myelinoclastic part.|$|R

Here we analysed and foccused on the etiology, prevalance, incidence and age of these demyelinating disorders. Clinical attention and various diagnostic tests are needed to adequately assess all these possibilities...|$|R
25|$|Not {{long after}} {{her high school}} {{graduation}} in 1985, Vega began complaining of extreme weakness and lack of sensation, particularly on her lower body. This prompted her parents to bring her to a private hospital. She was later diagnosed with a form of <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease,</b> which was highly suspected to be either Guillain–Barré syndrome or multiple sclerosis. As Vega’s condition became worse, her parents were forced to have her confined to the Quezon Institute as {{they could no longer}} afford the increasing amount of her hospital bills. Sometime after her confinement there, she contracted bronchopneumonia, making her condition even worse than before.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} is {{an inflammatory}} <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease</b> of the CNS in which activated immune cells invade {{the central nervous}} system and cause inflammation, neurodegeneration and tissue damage. The underlying condition that produces this behaviour is currently unknown. Current research in neuropathology, neuroimmunology, neurobiology, and neuroimaging, together with clinical neurology provide support for the notion that MS is not a single disease but rather a spectrum ...|$|E

40|$|Inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>diseases</b> {{comprise}} {{a spectrum of}} disorders affecting the myelin of the central and peripheral nervous system. These diseases can usually be differentiated {{on the basis of}} clinical, radiological, laboratory and pathological findings. Recent studies have contributed to current awareness that inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>diseases</b> are not restricted to the adult age group, but are more common in pediatric age than previously believed. Some of pediatric inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>diseases</b> carry an unfavorable long-term prognosis but appropriate treatments can improve the outcome. The possibility of physical and cognitive disability resulting from these diseases, highlights the urgent need for therapeutic strategies for neurorehabilitation, neuroregeneration, and neurorepair.

50|$|Below {{are various}} methods/techniques used to {{diagnose}} <b>demyelinating</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The role of {{prolonged}} cortical myelination {{in human}} evolution has been implicated as {{a contributing factor}} in some cases of <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease.</b> Unlike other primates, humans exhibit a unique pattern of postpubertal myelination, which {{may contribute to the}} development of psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases that present in early adulthood and beyond. The extended period of cortical myelination in humans may allow greater opportunity for disruption in myelination, resulting in the onset of <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease.</b> [...] Furthermore, it has been noted that humans have significantly greater prefrontal white matter volume than other primate species, which implies greater myelin density. [...] Increased myelin density in humans as a result of a prolonged myelination may therefore structure risk for myelin degeneration and dysfunction. Evolutionary considerations for the role of prolonged cortical myelination as a risk factor for <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease</b> are particularly pertinent given that genetics and autoimmune deficiency hypotheses fail to explain many cases of <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease.</b> As has been argued, diseases such as multiple sclerosis cannot be accounted for by autoimmune deficiency alone, but strongly imply the influence of flawed developmental processes in disease pathogenesis. [...] Therefore, the role of the human-specific prolonged period of cortical myelination is an important evolutionary consideration in the pathogenesis of <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
50|$|PML is a <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease,</b> {{in which}} the myelin sheath {{covering}} the axons of nerve cells is gradually destroyed, impairing the transmission of nerve impulses. It affects the subcortical white matter, particularly that of the parietal and occipital lobes. PML destroys oligodendrocytes and produces intranuclear inclusions. PML is similar to another <b>demyelinating</b> <b>disease,</b> multiple sclerosis, but progresses much more quickly. The breakdown of myelin is commensurate with the degree of immunocompromise.|$|E
