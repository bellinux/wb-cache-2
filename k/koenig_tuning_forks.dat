40|$|When a <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> is sounded {{and held}} in the air, the sound is weak due to the poor {{acoustic}} coupling between the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> and the air. If the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> is struck and acoustically coupled to a box of the proper size, as in Figure 1, the box functions as a resonator at {{the frequency of the}} <b>tuning</b> <b>fork,</b> the sound of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> is much louder, as can be heard on the video.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Rinne test {{generally}} detects large air-bone gaps; {{this approach}} decreases {{the value of}} <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> as a screening tool. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of simple <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> modifications to increase the sensitivity of the Rinne test. MATERIALS and METHODS: Two different modifications were performed with 128 and 256 Hz <b>tuning</b> <b>forks.</b> Fifteen healthy subjects with otolaryngology specialist training backgrounds were enrolled in the measurement of <b>tuning</b> <b>fork,</b> sound-intensity output at their bone conduction threshold. RESULTS: The reductions in the threshold gap required for the Rinne test to turn from positive to negative for 128 Hz <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> were not statistically significant. The threshold gap was reduced by 3. 85 ± 3. 88 dB when 256 Hz <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> were modified through metal disk attachment (p= 0. 001). CONCLUSION: The modified 256 Hz <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> effectively reduced the subjective loudness gap between the two ends of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> in the Rinne test. The modification theoretically increases the sensitivity of the Rinne test, which may increase the value of <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> as hearing loss screening tools...|$|R

Its increased use in low-temperature experiments {{and a number of}} puzzling results obtained in the past have led to many questions concerning the interaction of multiple <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> or the interaction of <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> with other oscillators. We report measurements performed in He II at low temperatures around 360 mK, on the mutual interaction of <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> placed in the same volume of fluid, and examine the responsible mechanisms in an effort to discriminate between acoustic coupling and interaction via quantized vortices. To this end, the interaction of two <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> is investigated by analyzing their recorded resonance curves, looking for any nonelectrical crosstalk. Further, the forcevelocity characteristics of a detector <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> are measured for different operating velocities of a generator <b>tuning</b> <b>fork.</b> As a complementary measurement, the intensity of sound waves is recorded using a set of miniature receivers.

It is desired that the driving signal has very high frequency stability and amplitude stability on the operation of the quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork.</b> But, the quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> resonant frequency of the reference mode may change with temperature, and if the driving signal frequency can’t automatically track the resonant frequency of the reference mode, the error signal will appear in the output angular rate signal. Based on the severe nonlinearity drift error induced by temperature change, a practical and precise composite model was proposed to compensate the error caused by temperature change. The double-H quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> gyroscope temperature modeling was set up by test experiment and data processing at full temperature range, the accuracy of the double-H quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> gyroscope was improved greatly by utilizing temperature compensation, and the experiment results indicate that the method is useful and feasible...|$|R

40|$|We have {{performed}} an experimental {{characterization of the}} dynamics of oscillating quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> which are being increasingly used in scanning probe microscopy as force sensors. We show that <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> can be described as a system of coupled oscillators. Nevertheless, this description requires the knowledge of the elastic coupling constant between the prongs of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork,</b> which has not yet been measured. Therefore <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> have been usually described within the single oscillator or the weakly coupled oscillators approximation that neglects the coupling between the prongs. We propose three different procedures to measure the elastic coupling constant: an opto-mechanical method, a variation of the Cleveland method and a thermal noise based method. We find that the coupling between the quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> prongs has a strong influence on the dynamics and the measured motion is in remarkable agreement with a simple model of coupled harmonic oscillators. The precise determination of the elastic coupling between the prongs of a <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> allows to obtain a quantitative relation between the resonance frequency shift and the force gradient acting at the free end of a <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> prong.

40|$|Watson type gyro-sensor is {{composed}} of orthogonal-arm type <b>tuning</b> <b>fork,</b> and its two flexural vibration modes, related to the Corioli 2 ̆ 7 s force, are utilized. It is considered that the mechanical coupling between such two resonance modes in this type <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> is smaller {{than that of a}} normal <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> because one half pair of arms vibrates for driving and the other vibrates for sensing, independently.
