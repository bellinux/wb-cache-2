5|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian turned Bounty eastward {{in search of a}} remote haven on which he and the mutineers could settle. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the island of Tubuai, 300miles south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement. As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|Matthews was {{appointed}} general manager at Stoke's rivals Port Vale in July 1965, alongside good friend Jackie Mudie; Matthews was unpaid, though was given expenses. The pair {{had a plan}} of bringing through talented schoolboys and selling one or two off every so often to improve the club's bleak financial picture, whilst {{at the same time}} advancing through the leagues; in his autobiography he said that what Dario Gradi later achieved at Crewe Alexandra is what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for the Vale. Matthews concentrated his search in North East England and Central Scotland, where he discovered talented striker Mick Cullerton, though overlooked a teenage Ray Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Kỳ {{specifically}} said {{nine or ten}} {{other officers}} should be dismissed for involvement in the coup, but refused to identify who <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Some observers accused Kỳ and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before putting it down in order to embarrass Khánh and allow themselves to gain prominence and prestige on the political stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the northern town of Da Nang, claimed that during a meeting with Kỳ and Thi {{a few days before}} the coup, the officers had discussed their plans for overthrowing Khánh. Another conspiracy claim was propagated by General Trần Văn Đôn, who conjectured that Khánh had tried to provoke or bait rival generals, such as Khiêm, into revolting against him so he could defeat and remove them from the scene, thereby strengthening himself and boosting his political image.|$|E
5|$|Once interested, Soichiro Honda began {{developing}} the Super Cub {{on his return}} to Japan. The following year Honda displayed a mockup to Fujisawa that finally matched what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30,000 per month, half again as many as the entire monthly two-wheeler market in Japan. His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country like the United States. To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959. In 1961 a sales network was established in Germany, then in Belgium and the UK in 1962, and then France in 1964.|$|E
5|$|To {{transport}} the raiders to the island, two tugs, Vulcan and Nuneaton, {{were provided by}} the Governor of Nigeria, Sir Bernard Bourdillon. The raiding force would consist of 32 men, four SOE agents, 11 commandos from the SSRF and 17 men recruited from the local population to crew the two tugs. The mission suffered a blow when the British General Officer Commanding (GOC) West Africa Command, General Sir George Giffard refused to support the mission and would not release the 17 men required, stating it would compromise some unnamed plans <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> and the act of piracy would have repercussions. Responding {{to the concerns of}} the GOC West Africa, the Admiralty suspended the operation. The Foreign Office was also not in favour of the operation, and neither was the British Embassy in Madrid, which was concerned about the possible reactions of the Spanish government. The final go ahead, eventually supported by the Foreign Office, was not given until 6 January 1942, on the grounds that suspicion of British involvement in the raid was inevitable; what counted was the avoidance of any tangible proof. As a safeguard the Admiralty also dispatched , a , to intercept the vessels at sea, which would provide the cover story that they had been intercepted while trying to make their way home to Europe.|$|E

25|$|Ellis {{wanted to}} write a Stephen King-style ghost story novel, which would {{eventually}} become Lunar Park; finding it difficult at the time, he began work on the other novel which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> This was a Robert Ludlum-style thriller, with the intention of using one of his own vapid characters who lack insight as the narrator.|$|E
25|$|As he matured, Franklin {{began to}} concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he first devised a scheme for The Academy, Charity School, and College of Philadelphia. However, the person <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> {{to run the}} academy, Rev. Richard Peters, refused and Franklin put his ideas away until 1749, when he printed his own pamphlet, Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania.

6000|$|Sensation for Emotion. [...] "The play {{caused a}} great {{sensation}}." [...] "A sensational newspaper." [...] A sensation {{is a physical}} feeling; an emotion, a mental.

500|$|Iman {{plays the}} role of Martia, a shapeshifting alien on the prison planet Rura Penthe who leads Kirk and McCoy into a trap. When Flinn {{originally}} developed the character, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> a space pirate which he described as the [...] "dark side of Han Solo". Flinn imagined an actress like Sigourney Weaver in the role, who was [...] "as different as night and day" [...] from Iman. Meyer described Martia as [...] "Kirk's dream woman", and when the makeup artists learned Iman was cast for the role they decided to enhance her graceful bird-like appearance with feathers. Yellow contact lenses completed the look.|$|E
500|$|Edward caused unease in {{government}} circles with actions that were interpreted as interference in political matters. His comment during {{a tour of}} depressed villages in South Wales that [...] "something must be done" [...] for the unemployed coal miners {{was seen as an}} attempt to guide government policy, though it has never been clear what sort of remedy <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Government ministers were reluctant to send confidential documents and state papers to Fort Belvedere, because it was clear that Edward was paying little attention to them, and it was feared that Simpson and other house guests might read them, improperly or inadvertently disclosing information that could be detrimental to the national interest.|$|E

500|$|U2's 1987 song [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] from The Joshua Tree was {{inspired}} after lead vocalist Bono visited El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War and witnessed how {{the conflict between}} rebels and the U.S.-backed government affected local civilians. During a spoken word passage of the song, he speaks of being approached by a man, [...] "his face red like a rose on a thorn bush, like all the colors of a royal flush, and he's peeling off those dollar bills, slapping them down, 100, 200". Bono said the person <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> while writing these lyrics was Reagan, whose administration backed the military regimes in Central and South America that Bono encountered on his trip.|$|E
500|$|The {{manuscript}} {{length of}} A Feast for Crows eventually surpassed A Storm of Swords. Martin {{was reluctant to}} make the necessary deep cuts to get the book down to publishable length, as that would have compromised the story <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Printing the book in [...] "microtype on onion skin paper and giving each reader a magnifying glass" [...] was also not an option for him. On the other hand, Martin rejected the publishers' idea of splitting the narrative chronologically into A Feast for Crows, Parts One and Two. Being already late with the book, Martin had not even started writing all characters' stories and also objected to ending the first book without any resolution for its many viewpoint characters as in previous books.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Flotilla {{came from a}} {{combination}} of [...] "sci-fi like Star Wars and submarine movies". Chung explained that he [...] "figured there was enough games about little fighter jets", and that what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> was [...] "a jumbo battleship floating in space". Animals, instead of aliens, are featured as characters in the game. Chung explained that he did so because [...] "any fantastical creature design I came up with would pale in comparison to already-existing designs made by other people." [...] Therefore, instead of trying {{to solve the problem of}} creating compelling alien characters, he switched to animals: [...] " [...] have certain built-in characteristics, they were fairly unique in how they weren't typically associated with space adventures." [...] In an interview with SquareGo, Chung revealed that board games such as Axis and Allies and Arkham Horror had an influential role in the game's development process.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{script to}} A New Hope describes Jabba as a [...] "fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers {{and a huge}} ugly mouth", but Lucas stated {{in an interview that}} the initial character <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> was much furrier and resembled a Wookiee. When filming the scene between Han Solo and Jabba in 1976, Lucas employed Northern Irish actor Declan Mulholland to stand-in for Jabba the Hutt, wearing a shaggy brown costume. Lucas planned to replace Mulholland in post-production with a stop-motion creature. The scene was meant to connect Star Wars to Return of the Jedi and explain why Han Solo was imprisoned at the end of The Empire Strikes Back. Nevertheless, Lucas decided to leave the scene out of the final film on account of budget and time constraints and because he felt that it did not enhance the film's plot. The scene remained in the novelization, comic book, and radio adaptations of the film.|$|E
500|$|At about 08:00 the French {{artillery}} {{on their}} right wing opened fire, answered by Colonel Blood's batteries. The guns were heard by Baden in his camp before Ingolstadt, [...] "The Prince and the Duke are engaged {{today to the}} westward", he wrote to the Emperor. [...] "Heaven bless them." [...] An hour later Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin climbed Blenheim's church tower to finalise their plans. It was settled that the Elector and Marsin would hold the front from the hills to Oberglauheim, whilst Tallard would defend the ground between Oberglauheim and the Danube. The French commanders were, however, divided {{as to how to}} utilise the Nebel: Tallard's tactic – opposed by Marsin and the Elector who felt it better to close their infantry right up to the stream itself – was to lure the allies across before unleashing their cavalry upon them, causing panic and confusion; whilst the enemy was struggling in the marshes, they would be caught in crossfire from Blenheim and Oberglauheim. The plan was sound if all its parts were implemented, but it allowed Marlborough to cross the Nebel without serious interference and fight the battle <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
