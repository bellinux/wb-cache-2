5|$|At {{around the}} time Batch's {{squadron}} was working up for the summer cruise, Henry Abbott, the German consul in Salonika, then in the Ottoman Empire, was murdered. Further attacks on German citizens living in the area were feared, and so Batsch was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean Sea to stage a naval <b>demonstration</b> <b>in</b> June 1876. After arriving with the four ironclads, he was reinforced by three unarmored vessels. After {{the threat of violence}} subsided in August, Batsch departed with Kaiser and Deutschland; the other two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean {{for the rest of the}} summer.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{students}} in Nashville {{had a chance to}} formalize their plans, events elsewhere brought renewed urgency to the effort.

Although Lawson and other adult organizers argued for delay, the student leaders insisted that the time had come for action.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned only a {{few years}} before the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the ships had limited service careers.

After 1915, their participation in the war became minimal. All three ships were handed over to Italy {{after the end of the}} war, and broken up for scrap between 1920 and 1926.|$|E

5|$|In 1905 Janáček {{attended}} a <b>demonstration</b> <b>in</b> {{support of a}} Czech university in Brno, where the violent death of František Pavlík (a young joiner) {{at the hands of}} the police inspired his 1. X. 1905 piano sonata. The incident led him to further promote the anti-German and anti-Austrian ethos of the Russian Circle, which he had co-founded in 1897 and which would be officially banned by the Austrian police in 1915. In 1906 he approached the Czech poet Petr Bezruč, with whom he later collaborated, composing several choral works based on Bezruč's poetry. These included Kantor Halfar (1906), Maryčka Magdónova (1908), and Sedmdesát tisíc (1909).|$|E

5|$|Sensing {{that there}} was growing {{frustration}} among Bolshevik supporters, who were agitating for armed insurrection, Lenin suggested an armed political <b>demonstration</b> <b>in</b> Petrograd to test the government's response. However, Lenin's health had deteriorated as he experienced headaches and insomnia and possibly began to experience the miniature heart attacks which would later afflict him. Nadezhda helped care for him, but was in poor health herself. He left Petrograd for the Finnish village of Neivola, where he visited his friend Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|Students {{initiated}} a major <b>demonstration</b> <b>in</b> 1968 over two main issues. The first was Columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring Morningside Park; this {{was seen by}} the protesters to {{be an act of}} aggression aimed at the black residents of neighboring Harlem. A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in the Pentagon's weapons research think-tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside Low Library, Hamilton Hall, and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.|$|E
