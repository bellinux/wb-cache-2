40|$|By moving rather belatedly {{towards a}} {{controlled}} democratization of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe's</b> political regimes, Gorbachev {{and his team}} sought {{to carry out a}} vast and ambitious plan to transform the international order in Europe, a plan which was to yield considerable benefits for the USSR. The process having got out of hand, the USSR did not step in to preserve the objectives of its European policy which, at the same time, was seriously compromised. It attempted to adjust to <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe's</b> new political situation by making, over more than a year, great efforts to preserve the existence of a transformed and renewed Warsaw Pact, seeing in it an indispensable transitory instrument for its new European policy. The collapse of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe's</b> regimes and the progressive disintegration of the Warsaw Pact largely contributed to Gorbachev's losing control of the political situation in the USSR and greatly accelerated its breakup...|$|R

These changes from Latin to the new languages took many centuries. Greek remained {{the language of the}} Byzantine Empire, but the migrations of the Slavs added Slavic languages to <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E
