5|$|Sigismund Báthory's {{maternal}} uncle, Stephen Bocskai, {{and other}} commanders of the Transylvanian army, persuaded the prince {{to get rid}} of those who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> Holy League. Balthasar Báthory and his allies were captured and murdered in late August 1594. Sigismund also confiscated Andrew's Transylvanian estates. The Diet confirmed the prince's acts, convicting Andrew and his brother, Stephen, of treason.|$|E
5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion.|$|E

5|$|The long tail of Kentrosaurus {{results in}} a {{position}} of the center of mass that is unusually far back for a quadrupedal animal. It rests {{just in front of the}} hip, a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs. However, the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E
5|$|The {{moderate}} Conservatives were Conservatives in name only, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> saquarema {{ideology and}} leadership. During {{the years following}} 1857, successive cabinets quickly collapsed, unable to muster {{a majority in the}} Chamber of Deputies, as the two Conservative wings undercut each other in a fight for dominance. The Emperor asked Caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 March 1861. Among his ministers were José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco), whom Caxias had met and befriended during the Platine War while serving as secretary to Paraná.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Dworkin opposed LEAF's position, {{arguing that}} feminists should not support or attempt to reform {{criminal}} obscenity law. In 1993, copies of Dworkin's book Pornography were held for inspection by Canada Customs agents, fostering an urban legend that Dworkin's own books had been banned from Canada under {{a law that}} she herself had promoted. However, the Butler decision did not adopt Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance, Dworkin <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> decision, and her books (which were released shortly after they were inspected) were held temporarily {{as part of a}} standard procedural measure, unrelated to the Butler decision.|$|E

5|$|Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star was {{released}} on May 10, 1994 by DGC, which also released the band's previous two albums. The album peaked at No. 34 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and No. 39 on the UK Albums Chart. It was the band's highest position on the US charts until their 2009 album The Eternal reached No. 18. The album also charted in several other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, The Netherlands and Sweden. The band <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> album with a tour due to Gordon's advanced pregnancy at the time. As of 2005, the album had sold 246,000 copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} coup, {{officers}} loyal to Umran and the Aflaqites were purged from the armed forces, being imprisoned alongside Umran at Mezze prison. One {{of the first}} acts of Jadid's government was to appoint Assad Minister of Defence. Assad however, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> coup, and told Mansur al-Atrash, Jubran Majdalani, and other Aflaqites {{that he did not}} support Jadid's actions. Later, in an interview with Le Monde, Assad claimed that the military's intervention was regrettable because the Ba'ath Party was democratic, and that the disputes should have been resolved in a democratic manner. However, Assad did view the actions as necessary, as it put an end, in his view, to the dictatorship of the National Command.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson.

5|$|Of the 14 men in {{contention}} for the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates {{leading up to}} the convention were Ulysses S. Grant, James G. Blaine, and John Sherman. Grant had served two terms as President from 1869 to 1877, and was seeking an unprecedented third term in office. He was backed by the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party, which supported political machines and patronage. Blaine was a senator and former representative from Maine who was backed by the Half-Breed faction of the Republican Party. Sherman, the brother of Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman, was serving as Secretary of the Treasury under President Rutherford B. Hayes. A former senator from Ohio, he was backed by delegates who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> Stalwarts or Half-Breeds.|$|E
5|$|One of Glynne's main {{interests}} was mountaineering {{and rock}} climbing, although her family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> hobby, as her mother's cousin, Owen Glynne Jones {{died at the}} age of 32 in a climbing accident on Dent Blanche. Despite this, Glynne climbed throughout her life, including in Australia and New Zealand whilst she was touring there. She recorded the second ever ascent of Mount Spencer in New Zealand, the first by a woman. When she returned to Europe, she climbed major Alpine peaks such as Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, La Meije and Aiguille du Dru in the 1930s. She carried on climbing into her 60s, ascending Mount Fuji in Japan in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} brought after Jeffrey Heffernan, a detective with the Paterson, New Jersey police force, {{went to a}} {{distribution}} center {{and picked up a}} lawn sign for the candidate challenging the city's incumbent mayor in the 2005 election (Heffernan's mother had wanted a sign, so he was getting one for her). While Heffernan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> challenger, after other officers saw him with the sign they told senior officers, including the police chief, who strongly supported the mayor. For his apparent public support of the other candidate, they demoted Heffernan to beat patrol work as a uniformed officer.|$|E

5|$|The king, while Catholic, {{was very}} {{tolerant}} and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> more aggressive {{policies of the}} Counter-Reformation. When he took power, the Senate of Poland had 6 Protestant members; {{at the time of}} his death, it had 11. Despite his support for religious tolerance, he did fail, however, to resolve the conflict stemming from the Union of Brest split. Despite his support for the Protestants, he did not stop the growing tide of intolerance, either in Poland or abroad, as shown by the fate of the Racovian Academy, or an international disagreement between the faiths. Neither did he get involved with the disagreement about the Orthodox Cossacks, a group that he respected and counted on in his plans.|$|E
5|$|A 2010 study {{compared}} mDNA {{sequences of}} modern wolves {{with those from}} 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000 and 1,200 years before present (YBP). The {{study found that the}} sequences could be allocated into two haplogroups. Haplogroups 1 and 2 could be found among wolves across Eurasia but only haplogroup1 could be found in North America. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup2, indicating its predominance in this region for over 40,000 years, {{both before and after the}} Last Glacial Maximum. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicates that in Europe haplogroup2 became outnumbered by haplogroup1 over the past several thousand years, but in North America haplogroup2including the Beringian wolfbecame extinct and was replaced by haplogroup1 after the Last Glacial Maximum. However, a 2016 study <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> existence of two wolf haplogroups.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín kept a {{regulation}} from the dictatorship {{that allowed him}} to regulate the level of wages. He authorized wage increases every three months, to keep them up to the inflation rate. The CGT rejected this, and proposed instead that wages be determined by free negotiations. Alfonsín allowed strike actions, which were forbidden during the dictatorship, which gave the unions another way to expand their influence. There were thirteen general strikes and thousands of minor labor conflicts. However, unlike similar situations in the past, the CGT sided with Alfonsín during the military rebellions, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> removal of a non-Peronist president. The conflicts were caused by high inflation, and the unions requested higher wages in response to it. The unions got the support of the non-unionized retirees, the church and left-wing factions. Popular support for the government allowed it to endure in spite of opposition from the unions.|$|E

5|$|Churchill <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> government, however. In July, he {{had advised}} the King's legal counsel, Walter Monckton, against the divorce, but his advice was ignored. As {{soon as the}} affair became public knowledge, Churchill started to {{pressure}} Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted. In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of The Times newspaper, Churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because, given time, the King might fall out of love with Simpson. Baldwin rejected the request for delay, presumably because he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly. Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin, Geoffrey Dawson, and Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire {{on the grounds of}} heart disease, but he eventually accepted, on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph, that Baldwin's heart was sound.|$|E
5|$|Heureuse Réunion {{responded to}} the cannonade in kind. During the engagement, Gaspard {{repeatedly}} attempted to board Southampton, where his vastly superior numbers could overwhelm the British crew. Yeo was aware of his enemy's intentions, and repeatedly manoeuvered out of the way, his more disciplined and agile vessel easily able to remain out of contact with the overloaded Haitian ship. Within half an hour the highly efficient gunners on Southampton had knocked down the main and mizen masts on Heureuse Réunion, leaving her unable to manoeuvre and vulnerable to repeated pounding at close range. Despite the severe damage the Haitian ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship. The two smaller Haitian vessels <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near Petit Goâve to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed Heureuse Réunion to discover {{whether or not she}} had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person who gave the surrender is not known.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E
