40|$|Electro-thermal poling {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on a bioactive glass, and the kinetics of the Na+ <b>ion</b> <b>depletion</b> layer formation under the anode was studied in-situ by means of ac impedance spectroscopy. One important finding is a linear relation between the depletion layer thickness and the applied voltage, which {{is in contrast to}} the predictions of standard space charge theory. The average electric field in the layer is independent of the voltage and is close to the dielectric breakdown field of alkali ion conducting glasses. Furthermore, we observe that the thickness of the depletion layer is established on a much shorter time scale than the resistance. We explain these results by assuming that the huge electric fields created under the anode during Na+ <b>ion</b> <b>depletion</b> lead to a strong increase of the electronic mobility in the layer and to charge compensation via extraction of electrons. It is shown that in the initial stages of the depletion process, a relative Na+ <b>ion</b> <b>depletion</b> of only 400 ppm is sufficient to generate electric fields of the order of the dielectric breakdown field...|$|E
40|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{and ground}} based observations of comet Halley inner coma showed a localized <b>ion</b> density <b>depletion</b> region whose origin {{is not well}} understood. Although it {{has been linked to}} a thermal instability associated with negative ions, the photodetachment lifetime of negative ions (approximately 1 sec) is too short compared to the electron attachment time scale (approximately 100 sec) for this process to have a significant effect. A mechanism for the <b>ion</b> density <b>depletion</b> based on the thermal instability of the cometary plasma due to the excitation of rotational and vibrational levels of water molecules is proposed. The electron energy losses due to these processes peak near 4000 K (0. 36 eV) and at temperatures higher than this value a localized cooling leads to further cooling (thermal instability) due to the increased radiation loss. The resulting increase in recombination leads to an <b>ion</b> density <b>depletion</b> and the estimates for this depletion at comet Halley agree with the observations...|$|R

Apparent ion composition waves displayed a horizontal wave length of about 650 km. Enhanced layers of ionization appeared to be newly separated from the bottomside midnight F layer; its ions were primarily NO(+) and O 2 (+) without significant densities of metallic ions, an indication that metallic ions {{are not required to}} produce the layers at altitudes above 140 km.

In order to characterize the influence of extracellular calcium concentration changes in the small unstirred lumina of the transverse tubular system (TTS) on {{the time course of}} the slow L-type calcium current (I(Ca)), we have combined experimental measurements of I(Ca) with quantitative numerical simulations of Ca 2 + depletion. I(Ca) was recorded both in calcium-buffered and unbuffered external solutions using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique (2 -MVC) on short murine toe muscle fibers. A simulation program based on a distributed TTS model was used to calculate the effect of <b>ion</b> <b>depletion</b> in the TTS.

40|$|AbstractThe crystal {{structure}} of the sobemovirus Ryegrass mottle virus (RGMoV) has been determined at 2. 9  Å resolution. The coat protein has a canonical jellyroll β-sandwich fold. In comparison to other sobemoviruses the RGMoV coat protein is missing several residues {{in two of the}} loop regions. The first loop contributes to contacts between subunits around the quasi-threefold symmetry axis. The altered contact interface results in tilting of the subunits towards the quasi-threefold axis. The assembly of the T= 3 capsid of sobemoviruses is controlled by the N-termini of C subunits forming a so-called β-annulus. The other loop that is smaller in the RGMoV structure contains a helix that participates in stabilization of the β-annulus in other sobemoviruses. The loss of interaction between the RGMoV loop and the β-annulus has been compensated for by additional interactions between the N-terminal arms. As a consequence of these differences, the diameter of the RGMoV particle is 8  Å smaller than that of the other sobemoviruses. The interactions of coat proteins in sobemovirus capsids involve calcium <b>ions.</b> <b>Depletion</b> of calcium <b>ions</b> results in particle swelling, which is considered a first step in disassembly. We could not identify any density for metal ions in the proximity of the conserved residues normally involved in calcium binding, but the RGMoV structure does not show any signs of swelling.

40|$|We {{report on}} a new {{approach}} for studying fragmentation channels in Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS), which we name primary <b>ion</b> <b>depletion</b> kinetics (PIDK). PTR-MS is a chemical ionization mass spectrometric (CIMS) technique deploying hydronium ions for the chemical ionization. Induced by extremely high concentrations of analyte M, depletion of the primary ions in the drift tube occurs. This is observed as quasi zero concentration of the primary ion H 3 O and constant MH+. Under these non-standard conditions, we find an overall changed fragmentation. We offer two explanations. Either the changed fragmentation pattern {{is the result of}} secondary proton transfer reactions. Or, alternatively, the fast depletion of H 3 O + leads to reduced heating of H 3 O + in the drift field, and consequently changed fragmentation following protonation of the analyte M. In any case, we use the observed changes in fragmentation as a successful new approach to fragmentation studies, and term it primary <b>ion</b> <b>depletion</b> kinetics, PIDK. PIDK easily yields an abundance of continuous data points with little deviation, because they are obtained in one experimental run, even for low abundant fragments. This is an advantage over traditional internal kinetic energy variation studies (electric field per number density (E/ N) variation studies). Also, some interpretation on the underlying fragmentation reaction mechanisms can be gleamed. W...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between two dielectric plates immersed in an electrolyte solution is examined {{by using a}} variational perturbation approximation for the grand partition function. This approach differs from previous treatments in that the screening length between the plates is treated as a variational parameter. A key finding is that adjacent to each plate is a layer of <b>ion</b> <b>depletion</b> with thickness given by about one-half of a Bjerrum length. Consequently, for plate-plate separations less than the Bjerrum length, nearly all the electrolyte is excluded from between the plates, and the interaction is given by the sum of a van der Waals interaction and an attractive osmotic depletion force. In contrast to the predictions of previous theories, the {{interaction between}} the plates at short range increases with increasing electrolyte concentration and may provide an important contribution to the salt-induced attraction, commonly referred to as salting out. Because the range of the osmotic depletion force is roughly equal to the Bjerrum length, it increases with the square of the valency of the electrolyte. At larger plate-plate separations, the van der Waals interaction is screened as electrolyte enters the space between the plates, leading to an exponential decay of the interactions, as has been previously observed. However, this interaction is slightly stronger than that previously predicted, due to <b>ion</b> <b>depletion</b> {{from the surface of the}} interface, also this effect increases with increasing electrolyte concentration...|$|E

40|$|The careful {{regulation}} of calcium ion entry by the cell {{is essential for}} activation of numerous signal transduction cascades.

This effect is known as RIE lag and is caused by the depletion of etching ions and radicals or inhibiting neutrals during their trench passage. In order to decide which source is the main cause, we constructed special "horizontal trenches" where only radicals are controlling the etching. The experiment showed that radicals are not responsible for RIE lag. Inhibitor depletion will result in inverse RIE lag.
