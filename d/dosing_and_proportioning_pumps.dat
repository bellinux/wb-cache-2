40|$|A new {{automated}} {{colorimetric method}} is described for {{the determination of}} serum or plasma tri-glycerides. The samples are extracted with 2 -propanol containing activated alumina. An Auto-Analyzer Sampler II <b>and</b> <b>Proportioning</b> <b>Pump</b> II are used in combination with a Gilford Model 300 N spectrophotometer and Model 3091 -A debubbler flow cell. Following on-line saponification, glycerol is oxidatively cleaved with sodium metaperiodate. The resulting formaldehyde is reacted with 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone (M BTH) under mild conditions to produce the correspond-ing azine. Further reaction of MBTH with the azine {{in the presence of}} an oxidizing agent results in the formation of a blue cationic adduct. Beer’s law is obeyed, at 670 nm, to a triglyceride con-centration of 400 mg/ 100 ml. Because of the high sensitivity of the MBTH reaction, short incubation periods, high sampling rates (60 /h), and low flow rates can be used. The results correlate well with those obtained by the Kessler-Lederer method and by a totally enzymatic method.

40|$|Background. There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} potential role of adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy to accel-erate tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Sputum culture conversion is an important biomarker predictor of durable TB cure. Methods. This study used meta-regression analysis {{to examine the relationship}} between corticosteroid <b>dose</b> <b>and</b> sputum culture conversion, using published data from controlled clinical trials including 1806 corticosteroid-treated TB patients. Results. Linear models with 2 or 3 variables, including corticosteroid <b>dose</b> <b>and</b> the <b>proportion</b> of culture positive control subjects, predicted therapeutic benefit of corticosteroids at 1 and 2 months. The 3 -variable model predicted that 134 mg of prednisolone per day, given together with standard 4 -drug TB chemotherapy, would reduce the proportion of positive culture at 2 months from 15 % to 2 %. The estimate accounts for a 50 % reduction in steroid exposure due to rifampin. A proportion of 2 % of subjects with positive cultures at 2 months has been proposed as a target for new 4 -month TB regimens. Conclusions. These positive findings must be tempered by recognition that the metabolic and cardiovascular risks of corticosteroids administered at this dose for this duration are unlikely to be acceptable when examined from a patient-level benefit-risk perspective.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2012, the World Health Organization {{recommended}} {{the addition of}} single low-dose primaquine (SLDPQ, 0. 25  mg base/kg body weight) to artemisinin combination therapies to block the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum without testing for glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. The targeted group was non-pregnant patients aged[*]≥[*] 1  year (later changed to[*]≥[*] 6  months) with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria, primarily in countries with artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum (ARPf). No dosing regimen was suggested, leaving malaria control programmes and clinicians in limbo. Therefore, we designed a user-friendly, age-based SLDPQ regimen for Cambodia, the country most affected by ARPf. METHODS: By reviewing primaquine's pharmacology, we defined a therapeutic dose range of 0. 15 - 0. 38  mg base/kg (9 - 22. 5  mg in a 60 -kg adult) for a therapeutic index of 2. 5. Primaquine doses (1 - 20  mg) were tested using a modelled, anthropometric database of 28, 138 Cambodian individuals (22, 772 healthy, 4119 with malaria and 1247 with other infections); age distributions were: 0. 5 - 4 years (20. 0  %, n[*]=[*] 5640), 5 - 12 years (9. 1  %, n[*]=[*] 2559), 13 - 17 years (9. 1  %, n[*]=[*] 2550), and[*]≥[*] 18  years (61. 8  %, n[*]=[*] 17, 389). Optimal age-dosing groups were selected according to calculated mg base/kg <b>doses</b> <b>and</b> <b>proportions</b> of individuals receiving a therapeutic dose. RESULTS: Four age-dosing bands were defined: (1) 0. 5 - 4 years, (2) 5 - 9 years, (3) 10 - 14 years, and (4) ≥ 15  years to receive 2. 5, 5, 7. 5, and 15  mg of primaquine base, resulting in therapeutic doses in 97. 4  % (5494 / 5640), 90. 5  % (1511 / 1669), 97. 7  % (1473 / 1508), and 95. 7  % (18, 489 / 19, 321) of individuals, respectively. Corresponding median (1 st- 99 th centiles) mg base/kg doses of primaquine were (1) 0. 23 (0. 15 - 0. 38), (2) 0. 29 (0. 18 - 0. 45), (3) 0. 27 (0. 15 - 0. 39), and (4) 0. 29 (0. 20 - 0. 42). CONCLUSIONS: This age-based SLDPQ regimen could contribute substantially to malaria elimination and requires urgent evaluation in Cambodia and other countries with similar anthropometric characteristics. It guides primaquine manufacturers on suitable tablet strengths <b>and</b> <b>doses</b> for paediatric-friendly formulations.

40|$|Background: Vasopressin {{is widely}} used for {{vasopressor}} support in septic shock patients, but experimental evidence suggests that selective V 1 A agonists are superior. The initial pharmacodynamic effects, pharmacokinetics, and safety of selepressin, a novel V 1 A-selective vasopressin analogue, was examined in a phase IIa trial in septic shock patients. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial in 53 patients in early septic shock (aged ≥ 18 years, fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressor support) who received selepressin 1. 25 ng/kg/minute (n = 10), 2. 5 ng/kg/minute (n = 19), 3. 75 ng/kg/minute (n = 2), or placebo (n = 21) until shock resolution or a maximum of 7 days. If mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg was not maintained, open-label norepinephrine was added. Co-primary endpoints were maintenance of MAP > 60 mmHg without norepinephrine, norepinephrine <b>dose,</b> <b>and</b> <b>proportion</b> of patients maintaining MAP > 60 mmHg with or without norepinephrine over 7 days. Secondary endpoints included cumulative fluid balance, organ dysfunction, pharmacokinetics, and safety. Results: A higher proportion of the patients receiving 2. 5 ng/kg/minute selepressin maintained MAP > 60 mmHg without norepinephrine (about 50 % and 70 % at 12 and 24 h, respectively) vs. 1. 25 ng/kg/minute selepressin and placebo (p < 0. 01). The 7 -day cumulative doses of norepinephrine were 761, 659, and 249 μg/kg (placebo 1. 25 ng/kg/minute and 2. 5 ng/kg/minute, respectively; 2. 5 ng/kg/minute vs. placebo; p < 0. 01). Norepinephrine infusion was weaned more rapidly in selepressin 2. 5 ng/kg/minute vs. placebo (0. 04 vs. 0. 18 μg/kg/minute at 24 h, p < 0. 001), successfully maintaining target MAP <b>and</b> reducing norepinephrine <b>dose</b> vs. placebo (first 24 h, p < 0. 001). Cumulative net fluid balance was lower from day 5 onward in the selepressin 2. 5 ng/kg/minute group vs. placebo (p < 0. 05). The selepressin 2. 5 ng/kg/minute group had {{a greater proportion of}} days alive and free of ventilation vs. placebo (p < 0. 02). Selepressin (2. 5 ng/kg/minute) was well tolerated, with a similar frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events for selepressin 2. 5 ng/kg/minute and placebo. Two patients were infused at 3. 75 ng/kg/minute, one of whom had the study drug infusion discontinued for possible safety reasons, with subsequent discontinuation of this dose group. Conclusions: In septic shock patients, selepressin 2. 5 ng/kg/minute was able to rapidly replace norepinephrine while maintaining adequate MAP, and it may improve fluid balance and shorten the time of mechanical ventilation.

40|$|Even {{though the}} primary goal of a Phase I {{clinical}} trial is to determine the dosing schedule of a new treatment subject to toxicity or other safety concerns, treatment efficacy often remains an important secondary consideration. In such settings, the trial may collect both information on final efficacy as well as a surrogate efficacy marker that is obtained more easily, quickly, or both. Extended versions of Bayesian continual reassessment methods (CRMs) offer an attractive approach for a principled combination of all three sources of information, but the precise shape of the doseresponse curve may be difficult to specify, especially with the small sample sizes typical of early phase studies. In this paper, we propose flexible semi- and non-parametric link functions for a trivariate binary outcome CRM that allows for differential weighting of the outcomes, or even within outcome (say, higher penalties for over- rather than under-shooting toxicity).

Patients were randomly assigned 500, 1000, or 1500 mg/day of tauroursodeoxycholate for six months. Biliary and serum bile acids were measured before and during treatment by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and by high performance liquid chromatography. During tauroursodeoxycholate administration, the proportion of total ursodeoxycholate in bile reached mean (SEM) 34. 4 (4. 5) %, 32. 8 (2. 8) %, and 41. 6 (3. 0) % with doses of 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/day, respectively. Significant decreases in the <b>proportions</b> of chenodeoxycholate <b>and</b> cholate resulted. The glycine/taurine ratio of the biliary bile acid pool decreased from 1. 9 at baseline, to 1. 1 with the highest dose. Ursodeoxycholate in bile was conjugated with glycine and taurine, indicating that tauroursodeoxycholate undergoes significant deconjugation and reconjugation during its enterohepatic recycling. The proportion of lithocholate in bile remained unchanged. Fasting serum conjugated ursodeoxycholate concentration positively correlated with the tauroursodeoxycholate <b>dose,</b> <b>and</b> the increased <b>proportion</b> of ursodeoxycholate was accompanied by substantial decreases in the endogenous bile acids.

40|$|MnPO neurons play a {{critical}} role in hydromineral homeostasis regulation by acting as sensors of extracellular sodium concentration ([Na+]out). The mechanism underlying Na+-sensing involves Na+-flow through the NaX channel, directly regulated by the Na+/K+-ATPase α 1 -isoform which controls Na+-influx by modulating channel permeability. Together, these two partners form a complex involved in the regulation of intracellular sodium ([Na+]in). Here we aim to determine whether environmental changes in Na+ could actively modulate the NaX/Na+/K+-ATPase complex activity. We investigated the complex activity using patch-clamp recordings from rat MnPO neurons and Neuro 2 a cells. When the rats were fed with a high-salt-diet, or the [Na+] in the culture medium was increased, the activity of the complex was up-regulated. In contrast, drop in environmental [Na+] decreased the activity of the complex. Interestingly under hypernatremic condition, the colocalization rate and protein level of both partners were up-regulated. Under hyponatremic condition, only NaX protein expression was increased and the level of NaX/Na+/K+-ATPase remained unaltered. This unbalance between NaX <b>and</b> Na+/K+-ATPase <b>pump</b> <b>proportion</b> would induce a bigger portion of Na+/K+-ATPase-control-free NaX channel. Thus we suggest that hypernatremic environment increases NaX/Na+/K+-ATPase α 1 -isoform activity by increasing the number of both partners and their colocalization rate, whereas hyponatremic environment down-regulates complex activity via a decrease in the relative number of NaX channels controlled by the pump...|$|R

This {{study was designed to}} investigate the age specific serologic evidence of antibodies against pertussis, and to offer information regarding the existence of pertussis infection in Zhejiang Province, China. A cross-sectional serosurvey was carried out in 6 counties of Zhejiang Province during September and October of 2014. The immunoglobulin G-pertussis toxin (IgG-PT) levels were measured quantitatively with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antibody activities were expressed in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -U/ml and a level ≥ 30 FDA-U/ml was considered seropositive. An IgG-PT > 80 FDA-U/ml indicated recent pertussis infection if the patient had not received immunization with the pertussis vaccine within the last year. The mean IgG-PT seropositivity rate among the 2107 subjects was 33. 32 % with a geometric mean concentration of 17. 73 (95 % confidence interval: 16. 90 - 18. 60) FDA-U/ml. The difference in the seropositivity rates reached significant means among the different age groups (waldχ 2 = 198. 41, P< 0. 0005), and children aged 3 years had the highest percentage (63. 24 %) of undetectable IgG-PT level. Of the 1707 subjects ≥ 3 years of age, 169 (9. 90 %) had evidence of a recent infection. The highest proportion of IgG-PT levels ≥ 80 FDA-U/ml was found in ≥ 60 years age group followed by 11 - 15 and 16 - 25 years age groups.

The current study aimed to determine the use and determinants of asthma medication in West Sweden and to assess changes during the last two decades. Methods: From a random population sample participating in a survey on respiratory symptoms, 2000 individuals were randomly selected for clinical examinations and structured interviews, 1172 participated. All subjects reporting asthma (n Z 1524) were also invited, and 834 participated. In total, 964 subjects with asthma participated. Asthma medication use was assessed in the general population and among two severity categories of asthma: multi-symptom asthma (MSA) and “other” asthma (having fewer symptoms). Current data, from 2010, was compared with data from 1992. Results: Asthma medication was used by 11 % of the population, 4. 4 % used ICS with concurrent use of LABA, 3. 3 % used ICS without LABA, while 3. 2 % only used SABA. Compared with 1992, the prevalence of asthma medication use had increased with 54 %, and use of ICS had increased from 1. 5 % to 7. 7 %.

40|$|Current {{models to}} {{estimate}} radiation risk use the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort that received high <b>doses</b> <b>and</b> high <b>dose</b> rates of radiation. Transferring risks from these high dose rates {{to the low}} <b>doses</b> <b>and</b> <b>dose</b> rates received by astronauts in space {{is a source of}} uncertainty in our risk calculations. The solid cancer models recommended by BEIR VII [1], UNSCEAR [2], and Preston et al [3] is fitted adequately by a linear dose response model, which implies that low <b>doses</b> <b>and</b> <b>dose</b> rates would be estimated the same as high <b>doses</b> <b>and</b> <b>dose</b> rates. However animal and cell experiments imply there should be curvature in the dose response curve for tumor induction. Furthermore animal experiments that directly compare acute to chronic exposures show lower increases in tumor induction than acute exposures. A <b>dose</b> <b>and</b> <b>dose</b> rate effectiveness factor (DDREF) has been estimated and applied to transfer risks from the high <b>doses</b> <b>and</b> <b>dose</b> rates of the LSS cohort to low <b>doses</b> <b>and</b> <b>dose</b> rates such as from missions in space. The BEIR VII committee [1] combined DDREF estimates using the LSS cohort and animal experiments using Bayesian methods for their recommendation for a DDREF value of 1. 5 with uncertainty. We reexamined the animal data considered by BEIR VII and included more animal data and human chromosome aberration data to improve the estimate for DDREF. Several experiments chosen by BEIR VII were deemed inappropriate for application to human risk models of solid cancer risk. Animal tumor experiments performed by Ullrich et al [4], Alpen et al [5], and Grahn et al [6] were analyzed to estimate the DDREF. Human chromosome aberration experiments performed on a sample of astronauts within NASA were also available to estimate the DDREF. The LSS cohort results reported by BEIR VII were combined with the new radiobiology results using Bayesian methods...|$|R

40|$|Giardia duodenalis is a {{zoonotic}} protozoan parasite {{with public}} health importance worldwide. While articles about animal model infectivity {{have been published}} for G. duodenalis, the studies have used diverse protocols and parameters to evaluate the infectivity of this protozoan parasite. Hence, the objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) conduct a meta-analysis of published literature for cyst shedding and diarrhea outcomes in animal models and (2) develop recommendations to help standardize experimental dose response studies. Results showed that, for the outcome of cyst shedding in faeces, the covariates of infective stage (cyst versus trophozoite), Giardia <b>dose,</b> <b>and</b> the interactions between <b>doses</b> <b>and</b> infective stage, as well as <b>dose</b> <b>and</b> species of experimental host, were all significant (P value ≤ 0. 05). This study suggests inoculation of the experimental host with cysts rather than trophozoites and administration of higher doses of Giardia will most likely result in cyst shedding. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, the infective stage (cyst versus trophozoite), parasite <b>dose,</b> <b>and</b> the interactions between <b>dose</b> <b>and</b> infective stage, as well as <b>dose</b> <b>and</b> species of experimental host, should be considered when designing experimental dose response studies that will assist in the study of zoonotic neglected tropical diseases globally...|$|R
