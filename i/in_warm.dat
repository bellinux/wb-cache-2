5|$|Drywood {{termites}} thrive <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> climates, {{and human}} activities can {{enable them to}} invade homes since they can be transported through contaminated goods, containers and ships. Colonies of termites have been seen thriving <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> buildings located in cold regions. Some termites are considered invasive species. Cryptotermes brevis, the most widely introduced invasive termite species in the world, has been introduced to all the islands in the West Indies and to Australia.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now clear}} that the common {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later evolved into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E
5|$|Segregation by sex {{and size}} {{does not seem}} to occur. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their instinct is to follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses.|$|E
25|$|Gobies <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> waters reach {{adulthood}} {{in a few}} months, while gobies in cooler environments reach adulthood in two years. The total lifespan of goby {{varies from}} one to ten years, again with the species <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> waters generally living longer.|$|R

Zonta set the fastest time, a 1:40.032. Both McLaren drivers {{maintained}} their good pace from qualifying—Häkkinen was second, just off Zonta's pace; Coulthard had the fourth-fastest time. They were separated by Michael Schumacher.|$|E
5|$|The {{rates of}} {{metabolism}} of Brachiopoda are between one third and one tenth {{of those of}} bivalves. While brachiopods were abundant <b>in</b> <b>warm,</b> shallow seas during the Cretaceous period, they have been outcompeted by bivalves, and now live mainly in cold and low-light conditions.|$|E
5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E

5|$|Another ice {{famine in}} 1870 then {{impacted}} both Boston and the Hudson, with a further famine following in 1880; {{as a result}} entrepreneurs descended on the Kennebec River in Maine as an alternative source. The Kennebec, along with the Penboscot and Sheepscot, was widely opened up for the ice industry, becoming an important source, particularly <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> winters, {{for the rest of}} the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} were found <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical {{waters of the}} Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E
5|$|Citygarden's plants, {{including}} various {{grasses and}} wildflowers, were {{selected by the}} Missouri Botanical Garden.

At {{the time of its}} opening, Citygarden comprised a total of 240 trees, 1,100 shrubs, 4,000 perennials, 8,000 bulbs, and 13,000 groundcovers. A garden spokesperson later said that hungry rabbits have forced workers to alter some of the plant choices.|$|E

Sindy's senior designer Jane Braithwaite travelled to Paris each month to research fashion trends for Sindy's clothing {{in an attempt to}} reverse declining sales. As an example of Sindy's continually updated fashions, during this period the doll's footwear included kitten heels, sandals, knee-high boots, ankle boots, trainers, slippers, court shoes and slingbacks.|$|E

50|$|Recently, the {{occurrence}} of particulate Cl-PAHs has been investigated.

5|$|Mantas {{are found}} <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters. Both species are pelagic; M. birostris migrates across open oceans, singly or in groups, while M. alfredi {{tends to be}} resident and coastal. They are filter feeders and eat large quantities of zooplankton, which they swallow with their open mouths as they swim. Gestation lasts over a year and mantas give birth to live pups. Mantas may visit cleaning stations {{for the removal of}} parasites. Like whales, they breach, for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> to hot greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|The Hydrophiinae, {{commonly}} known as sea snakes or coral reef snakes, are a subfamily of venomous elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for {{most or all of}} their lives. Most are extensively adapted to a fully aquatic life and are unable to move on land, except for the genus Laticauda, which has limited land movement. They are found <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and are closely related to venomous terrestrial snakes in Australia.|$|E

5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. <b>In</b> <b>warm</b> regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier {{than they have in}} the past.|$|E

During the final quarter, Virginia Tech scored its second touchdown of the game, giving the Hokies a 20–7 lead that lasted until time expired.|$|E
