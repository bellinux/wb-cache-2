The starvation does not take place in ordinary years, but in seasons of scarcity, which in those states of society are much more frequent and more extreme than Europe is now accustomed to. (2.) In a more improved state, few, even among {{the poorest of the}} people, are limited to actual necessaries, and to a bare sufficiency of those: and the increase is kept within bounds, not by <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths,</b> but by limitation of births.(124) The limitation is brought about in various ways. In some countries, it is the result of prudent or conscientious self-restraint. There is a condition to which the laboring-people are habituated; they perceive that, by having too numerous families, they must sink below that condition, or fail to transmit it to their children; and this they do not choose to submit to.|$|E

5000|$|A {{long-term}} population {{decline is}} typically caused by sub-replacement fertility, {{coupled with a}} net immigration rate that fails to compensate the <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> over births. [...] A long-term decline is accompanied by population aging and creates {{an increase in the}} ratio of retirees to workers and children. [...] When a sub-replacement fertility rate remains constant, population decline accelerates over the long term, however short term baby booms, healthcare improvements, among other factors created can cause flip-flops of trends. Population decline trends have seen long term reversals in places such as Russia, Germany, Ireland, and the UK, the latter two seeing declines as early as the 1970s, yet the UK now is growing more rapidly than any year since it first tipped into declines. [...] In spite of more recent declines, it is very uncommon for population to have dipped under the levels of the early post-world war 2 years. Bulgaria and Latvia are the only nations with a net population decline since 1950, and half of all nations worldwide have more than quadrupled their populations. UAE's current population is over 120 times that of 1950, and Qatar's population has grown over 80 times the 1950s level.|$|E
50|$|The population, {{which was}} 306,775 in 1871 and 423,384 in 1881, had in 1901 reached {{a total of}} 572,249. As in former years, the {{increase}} was solely due to immigration, more especially of Chinese, though {{a considerable number of}} Tamils and other natives of India settled in the Straits Settlements. The total number of births registered in the colony in 1900 was 14,814, and the ratio per 1,000 of the population during 1896, 1897, and 1898 respectively was 22-18, 20-82 and 21-57; while the number of registered deaths for the years 1896-1900 gave a ratio per 1000 of 42-21, 36-90, 30-43, 31-66 and 36-25 respectively, the number of deaths registered during 1900 being 23,385. The cause to which the <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> over births is to be attributed {{is to be found in}} the fact that the Chinese and Indian population, which numbered 339,083, or over 59 percent of the whole, was composed of 261,412 males and only 77,671 females, and a comparatively small number of the latter were married women and mothers of families.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} important {{causes of}} premature mortality among Aboriginal {{adults in the}} Northern Territory (NT), 1979 - 1991. METHODS: All <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> NT Aboriginal residents aged 15 - 64 years which occurred in the NT between 1979 and 1991 and which were recorded by the Registry <b>of</b> Births, <b>Deaths</b> and Marriages were included. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were {{used to compare the}} number <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> observed among Aboriginals in the NT to those expected, based on overall Australian rates. Years of potential life lost before age 65 (YPLL 65) were estimated for specific causes <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> RESULTS: Aboriginal women (overall SMR, 5. 5) and Aboriginal men (SMR, 4. 7) experienced a high burden <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> mortality from almost every cause <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> This <b>excess</b> increased over time, especially for Aboriginal women. Among Aboriginal men, the most important causes <b>of</b> premature <b>death</b> were motor vehicle accidents (11 % <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>deaths</b> and 17 % of YPLL 65), ischaemic heart disease (10 % <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>deaths</b> and 10 % of YPLL 65), pneumonia and influenza (8 % <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>deaths</b> and 6 % of YPLL 65), and homicide (7 % <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>deaths</b> and 8 % of YPLL 65). For Aboriginal women, the most important causes included homicide (7 % <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>deaths</b> and 11 % of YPLL 65), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10 % <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>deaths</b> and 5 % of YPLL 65), rheumatic heart disease (7 % <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>deaths</b> and 8 % of YPLL 65), and ischaemic heart disease (6 % <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>deaths</b> and 5 % of YPLL 65).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} hazards {{at an early}} phase of the growing {{epidemic}} <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> from tobacco in China. DESIGN: Smoking habits before 1980 (obtained from family or other informants) of 0. 7 million adults who had died of neoplastic, respiratory, or vascular causes were {{compared with those of}} a reference group of 0. 2 million who had died of other causes. SETTING: 24 urban and 74 rural areas of China. SUBJECTS: One million people who had died during 1986 - 8 and whose families could be interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tobacco attributable mortality in middle or old age from neoplastic, respiratory, or vascular disease. RESULTS: Among male smokers aged 35 - 69 there was a 51 % (SE 2) <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> neoplastic <b>deaths,</b> a 31 % (2) <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> respiratory <b>deaths,</b> and a 15 % (2) <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> vascular <b>deaths.</b> All three excesses were significant (P / 70 there was a 39 % (3) <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> neoplastic <b>deaths,</b> a 54 % (2) <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> respiratory <b>deaths,</b> and a 6 % (2) <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> vascular <b>deaths.</b> Fewer women smoked, but those who did had tobacco attributable risks of lung cancer and respiratory disease about the same as men. For both sexes, the lung cancer rates at ages 35 - 69 were about three times as great in smokers as in non-smokers, but because the rates among non-smokers in different parts of China varied widely the absolute <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> lung cancer in smokers also varied. <b>Of</b> all <b>deaths</b> attributed to tobacco, 45 % were due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 15 % to lung cancer; oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, tuberculosis, stroke, and ischaemic heart disease each caused 5 - 8 %. Tobacco caused about 0. 6 million Chinese deaths in 1990 (0. 5 million men). This will rise to 0. 8 million in 2000 (0. 4 million at ages 35 - 69) or to more if the tobacco attributed fractions increase. CONCLUSIONS: At current age specific death rates in smokers and non-smokers one in four smokers would be killed by tobacco, but as the epidemic grows this proportion will roughly double. If current smoking uptake rates persist in China (where about two thirds of men but few women become smokers) tobacco will kill about 100 million of the 0. 3 billion males now aged 0 - 29, with half these deaths in middle age and half in old age...|$|R

50|$|When the {{historical}} maximum was reached in 1990 (less than 5,1 million) {{the whole country}} has already teetered {{on the brink of}} political and economic collapse. The first year when the city has restored its original name, St. Petersburg (1991) was the first in the most lengthy period of the steady population reduction in the city history. By 2003 the city population was less than 4,5 million, or at a level of 1977. Among the reasons of this demographic degradation were the increase of death rate and decrease of birth rate; halting of inflow of workers due to shutdowns of many of the city’s industries; increased emigration out of the country; closure of many military educational institutions. At the same time a certain inflow to the Leningrad Oblast (a region surrounding the city) in the 2000s was influenced with the migration from Russia and other ex Soviet Republics, the relocation of officers and their families from places of the overseas deployment of the Soviet Army. The relevant suburban housing construction was supported both with private and state funding. The long-term <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> over births has brought a noticeable population ageing. The average age is about 40 years, and people of 65 years and older comprise more than 20% of the population, while the life expectancy in Russia has fallen under 60 years.|$|E

Later that year came the German occupation following large scale evacuations to the United Kingdom, the size of this movement being apparent from the figures given by the count of the civilian population made after the German Military Authorities had installed themselves. This count indicated that the overall reductions between mid-1939 and the latter part of 1940 were about 10,000 persons for Jersey and double that number for Guernsey. In the occupation period itself, 1940 to 1944, there was a steady reduction in the population of the islands due to the <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> over births and deportations to the continent by the Germans. After the liberation the increase in population was rapid. At mid-1945 the population of Jersey was estimated at 45,000 and that of Guernsey at 25,500 representing rises of 1,000 and 3,000 respectively since mid-1944. In the next 12 months the increases were 9,700 and 12,500 respectively. Both islands continued to gain rapidly in population until 1948, and in Jersey the population surpassed its pre-war numbers before mid-1947.” (Census, 1951, P.xi)The report went on to suggest that in the whole of the period 1931-51 there was net migration into Jersey of over 5,000 people.|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} use nationwide linked electronic routine healthcare data from primary and secondary care alongside the national death registry data to report such estimates. METHODS: We identified from the linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and English Hospital Episode Statistics adults with an incident diagnosis of liver cirrhosis linked to the Office for National Statistics between 1998 and 2009. Age-matched controls from the CPRD general population were selected. We calculated the cumulative incidence (adjusting for competing risks) and <b>excess</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>death</b> by 5 years from diagnosis for different causes <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> stratified by etiology and stage of disease. RESULTS: Five thousand one hundred and eighteen patients with cirrhosis were matched to 152, 903 controls. Among compensated patients, the 5 -year <b>excess</b> risk <b>of</b> liver-related <b>death</b> was higher than that of any other cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> for all patients, except those of unspecified etiology. For example, those of alcohol etiology had 30. 8 % <b>excess</b> risk <b>of</b> liver-related <b>death</b> (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 27. 9 %, 33. 1 %) compared with 9. 9 % <b>excess</b> risk <b>of</b> non-liver-related <b>death.</b> However, patients <b>of</b> unspecified etiology had a higher <b>excess</b> risk <b>of</b> non-liver-related compared with liver-related death (10. 7 % vs. 6. 7 %).

Age, sex, calendar year and country-specific mortality rates for the populace of England and Wales (n= 56. 9 million) were matched to cases of STEMI and NSTEMI. Flexible parametric survival models were used to calculate excess mortality rate ratios (EMRR) after multivariable adjustment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 02591576). Results Over 1. 94 million person-years follow-up including 120, 568 (18. 9...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{certified as}} due to cerebral hemorrhage among the {{brothers and sisters}} of 180 index patients with a proved cerebral hemorrhage has been compared with its frequency in {{the population of the}} same age and sex at the same decennium of the century as given by the Registrar General. There was no statistically significant <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> certified as due to cerebral hemorrhage except among the brothers of female index patients (p < 0. 05). The significance of this finding is discussed.
