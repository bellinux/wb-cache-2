5000|$|Heglig is the Arabic {{name of the}} [...] "desert date", {{the fruit}} of the Balanites aegyptiaca tree, which is found in most parts of Africa and the Middle East. Sudanese Sufis use heglig (lalob) seeds to make rosaries. Lalob is also a {{favorite}} food for camels, goats, sheep and cattle. South Sudan does not recognize the name Heglig for the town. During the 10-day occupation by the SPLA, South Sudan restored the name of the town Panthou, a Dinka translation of the word heglig. Panthou is a combination of two words in Dinka; Pand which mean the area or home and Thou for the tree (<b>desert</b> <b>dates),</b> in which Panthou is mean land or home of <b>desert's</b> <b>date.</b> There are many places around the Dinka areas that have the name of Panthou.

40|$|Even in {{the most}} arid conditions, the <b>desert</b> <b>date</b> has much to offer: fruit, wood, oil, leaves and flowers. It is a species which deserves {{attention}} from researchers. After the droughts of the nineteen-seventies and eighties, the Sahel : looked like a graveyard for dead trees. The shea, acacia and locust bean had all succumbed to lack of water. 'All but one, the <b>desert</b> <b>date,</b> Balanites aegyptiaca, 'points out Hubert Gillet, Assistant Director of the Paris Natural History Museum. 'It can live longer than other desert trees, more than 100 years, {{and it is the}} most resistant to drought. ' Adapted to adversity Nature has given the <b>desert</b> <b>date</b> a whole armoury of weapons against the conditions it has to endure. The species, which rarely exceeds 10 metres in height, is widespread throughout the Sahel. Its leaves are thick and tough, with a glossy coating that provides protection from the dry air. Its double root system acts vertically and horizontally, finding water up to seven metres below the surface and within a radius of up to 20 metres from the trunk. This root system also helps the tree to resist the sandstorm damage that can uproot other species. Should the leaves fall, photosynthesis continues through the branches and spines and is enough to ensure the tree's survival. And, as a further example of its amazing adaptability, a coating of sand surrounds each root, maintaining an insulation layer of air which helps to even out temperature fluctuations and reduce evaporation. From the top of the tree to its roots, the <b>desert</b> <b>date</b> is well adapted to survive the extreme conditions of the desert. The tree is thought by some to be the home of spirits, and sacrifices may be offered in its shade. However there are many other reasons why the <b>desert</b> <b>date</b> has long been revered by local people. Like Acacia albida, the <b>desert</b> <b>date</b> comes into leaf before the beginning of the rainy season, turning green in March or April. The leaves provide valuable fodder and are a godsend for the livestock, which have little else to eat {{at the end of the}} dry season. The tree's spines make it essential that the herdsmen take the precaution of collecting the forage themselves before giving it to the animals. But these spines have a use as pins, for surgical sutures or as muzzles. The <b>desert</b> <b>date</b> has other useful attributes: the wood is hard enough to be used for mortars, tool handles and even roof frames, since it is also resistant to damage by termites. The <b>desert</b> <b>date</b> is also valued for its fruits. These used to be referred to as 'slave dates' because they are of poorer quality than true dates, but they now enjoy more respect, a reflection of the current hardship of life in: the region. According to Marie Jos 2 Tubiana, a research scientist at the Centre National de Recherches Scientifiques (CNRS) 'shepherds and children suck the raw fruit but it can also be cooked in order to extract the sugar which can be added to porridge or used for making sweetmeats. There are many different local recipes. ' Another use has been recorded by Paul Cr 2 ac'h, a pharmacist who worked for the colonial army in the 1930 s. In the hungry season or during food shortages, when the store of millet had been exhausted, women mixed the date fruit pulp in a mortar with a few handfuls of millet. You can still often see this being done today. Cr 2 ac'h also noted of the leaves and bark, which ` were used as a disinfectant or as a treatment for rheumatism or jaundice. Even today, sucking desert dates is strongly recommended for anyone suffering from A chill. According to Marie Jos 2 Tubiana 'it is the qualities of the kernel whichis most important. ' This has an oil content of 40 - 60...|$|E
30|$|Nigeria is in {{the tropics}} and borders the Sahara <b>Desert.</b> <b>Date</b> palms are {{abundant}} in Northern Nigeria. Large quantities of date palm nuts are consumed in Nigeria either directly as food or indirectly as raw material in food and agro-based industries (AbdulQadir et al. 2011). Information on date palm production levels in nine states in Nigeria reveals that date palm production is increasing. The states are Bauchi 6, 000 metric tons, Adamawa 600 metric tons, Borno 1, 000 metric tons, Gombe 1, 500 metric tons, Jigawa 5, 000 metric tons, Kano 6, 000 metric tons, Plateau 100 metric tons, Taraba 200 metric tons and Yobe 2000 metric tons (Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research 2008). As the level of production of date palm increases, the waste from it increases as well. The conversion of the waste to useful material will whittle down {{the impact of the}} waste to the environment. Again, the geographic location of date palm may influence the property of the resultant composite. In this work, particle size and particle loading were varied since mechanical properties depend strongly on them (Shao-Yun et al. 2008).|$|E

40|$|Lack of an {{appropriate}} equipment to crack balanites aegyptica nuts {{to obtain the}} kernels, which are rich in oil and proteins, have limited their use and popularity. The manual method, which involves cracking with stone {{on top of another}} stone or metal, is slow and risky. In order to design appropriate processing equipment, sufficient knowledge of the mechanical properties of the different varieties is very important. The need to get sufficient information on the mechanical properties of balanites aegyptiaca nuts led {{to the study of the}} effect of moisture content and loading orientation on six mechanical properties of the one end tapered oblong and spheroidal accessions of balanites aegyptiaca (<b>desert</b> <b>date)</b> nuts. Four moisture levels and two compressive loading orientations (axial and longitudinal) were used to test the nuts of the two accessions in a universal-testing machine. The ranges of moisture content used were 4. 7 – 26. 4 % (d. b.) for the oblong accession and 4. 7 – 24. 2 % (d. b.) for the spheroidal accession.

The {{objectives}} of the research were to evaluate the efficacy of leaf powders of six plants, compare their effectiveness with the a synthetic insecticide (pirimiphos-methyl) and determine the most effective application rates for controlling Tribolium castaneum in stored millet grain (Variety-Sosat). The leaf powders of the plants and the pirimiphos-methyl dust were tested at 2. 5 g, 5. 0 g and 7. 5 g/ 25 g of sound and broken millet grain. The experiment was laid in a completely randomized design and each treatment was replicated three times. The result show that plants leaf powders and pirimiphos-methyl dust treatments {{were significantly higher than}} control. Pirimiphos-methyl dust caused significantly higher adult mortality of 3. 17 adults at 22 hours after treatment (HAT) and 1. 83 adults which was comparable to mortalitycaused by sugar apple at 72 hours after treatment (HAT).

40|$|Underutilized {{fruit trees}} {{play a vital}} role in food {{security}} and economy of the rural population in a number of African countries. Beside the significant important of the underutilized fruit trees in food security and livelihood of the local population many applications can be summarized such as using of leaves for fodder, branches for fencing materials, fire wood and charcoal making, timber for furniture and constructing huts, controlling soil erosion and competing desert encroachments. In spite of their great potential little attention has been given to this species. Balanites aegyptiaca “soap berry tree; thorn tree, desert date” is an important multipurpose trees species in dry land Africa. The tree is a potential source of medicines, pesticides, edible oil, animal feed, nuts, soap, and fuel wood. The edible fruits are rich in saturated fatty acids which are used as cooking oil. The fruit also contains Stereoids (Saponins, Sapogenins, and Disogenins) which are used as row materials for industrial production of contraceptive pills and other sexual hormones. The excessive uses of the tree for fruit production and for other uses combined with scarcity of natural regeneration lead to drastic depletion of this species. The <b>desert</b> <b>date</b> tree is adapted to dry and hot climatic environment which are characterized by increasing of land and water resources. However, little information is available about propagation and domestication of this valuable tree species; therefore, studies are needed for sustainable use of underutilized fruit trees in general and for Balanites aegyptiaca in particular. This article aims at highlighting and summarizing information on different aspect of B. aegyptiaca to stimulate the scientist interest in this valuable tree species which is of economical importance for rural inhabitants of western Sudan and other African countries.
