40|$|Almost {{one-third of}} the {{population}} in developing countries is under age 15. Hence improving the effectiveness of policy interventions that target adolescents might be especially important. We analyze the intention to participate in training programs of adolescent girls in Uganda, a country with perhaps the most skewed age distribution anywhere in the world. The training program we focus on is BRAC's Adolescent Development Program, which emphasizes the provision of life skills, entrepreneurship training, and microfinance. We find that <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more likely to benefit from the program are more likely to intend to participate. The program attracts <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> likely to place a high value on financial independence: single mothers and <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> alienated from their families. The program attracts <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more likely to benefit from training: <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> believe they could be successful entrepreneurs but currently lack the quantitative skills to do so. Reassuringly, <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in school full-time are less likely to intend to participate. We also find that the program attracts girls from poorer villages but we find no evidence that poorer girls within each village are more likely to want to participate. Finally, <b>girls</b> from villages <b>who</b> have previously <b>been</b> exposed to NGO projects are less likely to intend to participate...|$|R

5|$|Riefenstahl {{produced}} and directed {{her own work}} called Das Blaue Licht ("The Blue Light") in 1932, co-written by Carl Mayer and Béla Balázs. This film won the Silver Medal at the Venice Film Festival, but was not universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, {{many of whom were}} Jewish. Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of Balázs and Sokal, both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl's behest. In the film, Riefenstahl played an innocent peasant <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> hated by the villagers because they think she is diabolic and cast out.

In the anime, she is very much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. Both she and Hikari {{are members of the}} St. Spica Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other Spica students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by many of the students from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention. In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves.

In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, she, like Yaya, is not a prominent character.
