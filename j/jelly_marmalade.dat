These would be eaten while standing and drinking warm, spiced wines (known as hypocras) or other drinks known to aid in digestion. One must remember that sugar in the Middle Ages or Early Modern Period was often considered medicinal, and used heavily in such things. This was not a course of pleasure, though {{it could be as}} everything was a treat, but one of healthful eating and abetting the digestive capabilities of the body.

40|$|Levulose (D-fructose, fruit sugar), C 6 H 12 O 6 {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} ketohexose. This sugar has distinctive properties {{which make}} it of commercial interest. It is more costly than ordinary table sugar (sucrose). Levulose {{is characterized by a}} high degree of sweetness (6), great solubility (20), and medical usefulness when administered intravenously. Joslin (21) and Root and Baker (32) found levulose to be of great value in the treatment of diabetes. According to Daniel (8), it is assimilated and oxidized more quickly than sucrose, supplying the necessary energy requirements for the human system. Additional uses of levulose have been reported by McGlumphy and Eichinger (27), which include its application to improve the quality and the flavor of jams, <b>jellies,</b> <b>marmalades,</b> canned fruits, carbonated beverages, and corn sugar. Plants of the family compositae contain large amounts of levulose polymers, but the dahlia, chicory, and Jerusalem artichoke are the most promising sources because of the high levulose content and the ease of production (13). The tubers of Jerusalem artichoke were used in this study because they offer an inexpensive and prolific source from which levulose can be extracted. Since most of the levulose units in the artichoke tubers are linked together to form inulin or carbohydrate intermediate compounds between inulin and levulose, it is necessary to hydrolyze the material in order to free the levulose. Several investigators have reported the use of acid compounds. Anderson and Greaves (1) used H 2 SO 4 for hydrolysis, while Yamasaki (41) used HC 1 for the same purpose. Kleiderer and Englis (23) obtained complete hydrolysis of inulin by use of CO 2 and SO 2 at a pressure of 1000 pounds per square inch at 150 o C. for 60 minutes. As fare as can be determined from the literature, little work was done prior to 1953 using radioactive material to study peaceful uses of atomic energy. Since that time, a law was passed by the United States Congress authorizing the use of radioactive material for peaceful purposes, thereby making it possible to use atomic energy for this study. Since previous work has shown that gamma rays can convert starch to simple sugar (33), it was therefore, assumed that the inulin and other carbohydrate intermediates of Jerusalem artichoke upon hydrolysis by beta or gamma rays might yield fructose (35). The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of beta and gamma rays on inulin and other carbohydrate intermediate compounds present in the Jerusalem artichoke tubers and to compare the results with those obtained by hydrolysis with radiation plus hydrochloric acid...|$|R

Bubblegum songs are also defined as having a catchy melody, simple chords, simple harmonies, dancy (but not necessarily danceable) beats, repetitive riffs or [...] "hooks" [...] and a vocally-multiplied refrain. The song lyrics often feature themes of romantic love and personal happiness, with references to sunshine, platonic love, toys, colors, nonsense words, etc. They are also notable for their frequent reference to sugary food, including sugar, honey, butterscotch, <b>jelly</b> and <b>marmalade.</b> Cross-marketing with cereal and bubblegum manufacturers also strengthened the link between bubblegum songs and confectionery.

At their urging, she began to manufacture the sauce and in 1981, began Marie Sharp’s Fine Foods. Her first product was called [...] "Melindas" [...] after the farm owned by her husbands family. For ten years, she worked to build the brand, expanding into jams, <b>jellies,</b> and <b>marmalades</b> made with tropical fruit. In 1988, {{with the help of}} the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the United States Agency for International Development, she attended Clemson University, studying food packaging. Sharp found a distributor in the United States and began to market the product internationally. It was the first Belizean-made export product to gain wide acceptance and the only habanero-based sauce on the market at that time. In a marketing move, the distributor filed a trademark on the name. When Sharp found out in 1991 that the distributor had trademarked her product, she hired a lawyer. Because of the cost involved, travel constraints and the fact that as her sole distributor she could not work, Sharp eventually gave up the name to her sauce in exchange for a release of her contractual obligations, after a five-year struggle.|$|R

Studied the gelation process of jelly masses. Investigated rheological characteristics of jelly mass with fruit and pureed fruits of chokeberry. Determined that the effective viscosity of marmalade mass decreases with increasing shear rate, with adding fructose. The greater the content of fructose in the formulations, the less the viscosity change with increasing shear rate. Replacing sugar with fructose allows to get jelly masses with lower viscosity.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increased}} consumption of fruit juice as consumers have {{become aware of the}} nutritional and health benefits of fruit juices. This increased consumption goes together with the growth of varieties of fruit juices and beverages offered for sale. Among these products is roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) juice, or drink, which is a good source of anthocyanins, vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, ascorbic acid) and minerals (Ca, P, Fe). In addition, roselle is also used as flavouring for sauces, <b>jellies,</b> <b>marmalades,</b> soft drinks and as colorant for foods. Roselle extract has low sugar content, and is acidic, so addition of sweetening products like sugar or blending with tropical fruit juices can help to reduce the sourness and improve the sweetness of the juice. The use of roselle extract mixed with tropical fruit juices is also a way of reducing post-harvest losses of fruits which occurs due to lack of good knowledge in processing, preservation, packaging and proper transport systems in most developing countries like Tanzania. Blending of roselle extract with different proportion of tropical fruit juices (mango, papaya and guava) produces roselle-fruit juice blends with improved levels of anthocyanins, vitamin C, total phenolics/phenols, minerals (Ca, Mg, P, Fe and Zn). The amount of vitamin C and Fe were enough to provide recommended daily requirements for adults according to WHO/FAO recommendation while amount of anthocyanins provide enough to meet recommendation of 82 mg and 12. 5 mg per day per person in Finland and United States. The roselle-fruit juices found to be high in glucose and fructose. However, as the concentration of roselle extract in the blends increased, the amount of sugars also decreased. Organic acids (malic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid) increased also with increased concentration of roselle extract in the blends, while the amount of citric acidic increased with increased concentration of tropical fruit juices. The sensory evaluation of the roselle fruit juice blends resulted in the highest acceptance of the roselle-fruit juices with 20 % roselle followed by blends with 40 % roselle. This was probably due to the reduced acidic taste by adding these low concentrations of roselle to the tropical fruit juices. Colour play a very important role in the acceptability of foods as {{it is one of the}} principal characteristics perceived by the senses. The strong colour is due to the presence of anthocyanins in the roselle extract, which imparted the red colour in the blends. The colour of the roselle-fruit juice blends with 80 % roselle scored highest among all the sensory parameter evaluated. Storage temperature of the roselle-fruit juice blends showed to have high effect on the anthocyanin content, total phenolic content, vitamin C with significantly losses at higher temperatures. Lower temperature is therefore recommended for long-term storage. Packaging material did not have significant influence on the physicochemical properties of the roselle-mango juice blends. Losses in total monomeric anthocyanins, total phenols and vitamin C were higher in blends stored in plastic bottles compared to glass bottles in higher temperatures. Storage in glass bottles at lower temperatures is therefore recommended for storage of roselle-fruit juice blends...|$|R
