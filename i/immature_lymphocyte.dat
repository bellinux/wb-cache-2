Previous studies established that glucocorticoid-induced alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis promote apoptosis, but the mechanism by which glucocorticoids disrupt calcium homeostasis is unknown. Through gene expression array analysis, we found that dexamethasone induces a striking elevation of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R) levels in two murine lymphoma cell lines, WEHI 7. 2 and S 49. A 2. IP 3 R elevation was confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels. However, {{there was not a}} strong correlation between IP 3 R elevation and altered calcium homeostasis in terms of either kinetics or dose response. Moreover, IP 3 R knockdown, by either antisense or small interfering RNA, did not prevent either calcium disruption or apoptosis. Finally, DT 40 lymphoma cells lacking all three IP 3 R isoforms were just as sensitive to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis as wild-type DT 40 cells expressing all three IP 3 R isoforms. Thus, although alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis contribute to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, these calcium alterations are not directly attributable to IP 3 R elevation...|$|E
40|$|The {{finding of}} peanut {{agglutinin}} (PNA) binding capacity, {{supposed to be}} a marker of immature lymphocytes, within the T-cell population of the human thymus (58 %) and tonsil (10 %) prompted the comparison of maturation stages of PNA binding (PNA+) and nonbinding (PNA-) T cells in both organs. The proliferative response after mitogenic stimulation of purified PNA+ fractions was significantly less than that of purified PNA- fractions. The results of mitogen dose-response experiments, of variation in time of culture harvest, and of addition of irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood non-T cells indicated the intrinsic mitogen unresponsiveness of cells in the PNA+ fractions. The mitogen response of tonsil fractions was higher than that of thymocyte fractions. Cells with an immature immunologic phenotype were enriched in the thymocyte PNA+ fraction, and almost absent in the tonsil fractions. Both tonsil fractions contained cells with the immunologic phenotype of mature T cells, and showed a purine interconversion enzyme makeup comparable to mature T lymphocytes. It is concluded that the tonsil PNA+ T cell is a functionally <b>immature</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> which is in a further maturation stage than PNA+ or PNA- thymocytes. The presence of PNA+ T cells outside the thymus is of relevance for the clinical evaluation of PNA binding assays and suggests the occurrence of T-cell maturation within the tonsil environment...|$|E

Over the last decade a number of recurrent chromosome aberrations has been disclosed and some correlations with well defined histologic subsets of B-cell NHL has been established. Five important cytogenetic-histologic associations has been documented, well defined by combined cytologic, immunologic and genetic investigations: t(14; 18) (q 32;q 21) and NHL of follicle centre cell origin, frequently with follicular histologic pattern; t(8; 14) (q 24;q 32) and Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma or the equivalent small non-cleaved cell category of the "working formulation system"; t(3; 22) (q 27;q 11) and diffuse large cell lymphoma; t(11; 14) (q 13;q 32) and mantle zone lymphoma; trisomy 12 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and well-differentiated small lymphocytic lymphoma. Molecular genetic studies elucidated some mechanisms operating during the normal lymphocyte differentiation which may be held responsible for the illegitimate recombination between the immunoglobulin genes and some oncogenes normally located on other chromosome regions.

40|$|Background: Natalizumab, a humanized anti-alpha 4 {{integrin}} monoclonal antibody, reduces relapses {{and disease}} progression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Whereas its presumed mode of action is inhibition of T cell/monocyte entry into the brain, {{little is known about}} its specific effect on B cells, which are increasingly recognized to participate in MS pathogenesis. Methods: We obtained serial blood samples from 17 patients before and during natalizumab therapy for relapsing-remitting MS for up to 16 months, and blood samples from 10 untreated patients with MS and 13 healthy donors. We determined numbers of mature and <b>immature</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subsets by flow cytometry for CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 19, CD 138, and CD 10 in 111 samples. We analyzed marker transcripts for immature hematopoietic cells by quantitative PCR for CD 34, Vpre beta 1 (pre-B lymphocyte gene 1), and DNTT (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase) in 65 samples. Results: Natalizumab therapy increased CD 19 (+) mature B cells more than other lymphocytes/monocytes in blood (2. 8 -fold versus 1. 3 - 1. 8 -fold increase in cells/mu L; p < 0. 01). Even greater was the increase of immature CD 19 (+) CD 10 (+) pre-B cells (7. 4 -fold; p < 0. 01). This pattern remained stable during treatment for up to 16 months. Transcripts of lymphocyte precursors (Vpre beta 1 and DNTT) were elevated more than transcripts for CD 34. Conclusions: Circulating B cells and especially pre-B cells are most prominently elevated among the studied immune cell subsets, raising the possibility that the effects and side effects of natalizumab are partly mediated by actions on B cells.

40|$|The {{response}} of B lymphocytes to stimulation through surface immunoglobulin (sIg) is developmentally regulated. While mature B lymphocytes from the adult mouse spleen enter S {{phase of the}} cell cycle in response to sIg stimulation, <b>immature</b> B <b>lymphocytes</b> from the neonatal mouse spleen or adult mouse bone marrow undergo cell cycle arrest, and then death by apoptosis when given the same stimulus. It is thought that this negative {{response of}} <b>immature</b> B <b>lymphocytes</b> to in vitro sIg stimulation translates to clonal deletion {{in the event that}} cognate antigen is encountered in vivo. Previous work in our laboratory has uncovered two characteristics of tolerance-sensitive immature B lymphocytes: the inability to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) in response to sIg stimulation, and the lack of src family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) p 59 fyn and p 55 fgr expression. To further characterize sIg signaling pathways in mature and <b>immature</b> B <b>lymphocytes,</b> genetic and molecular approaches were employed. B lymphocytes from p 59 fyn- and p 55 fgr-deficient mice were studied to determine whether the absence of either p 59 fyn or p 55 fgr could cause disruptions of sIg signaling pathways. Signaling and cell cycle entry in both p 59 fyn- and p 55 fgr-deficient B lymphocytes was normal. We concluded that there is redundancy among the substrates of the B lymphocyte sIg-activated PTKs. Also, the inability of <b>immature</b> B <b>lymphocytes</b> to proliferate following sIg stimulation is not due to the absence of either p 59 fyn or p 55 fgr. To investigate the lack of PIP 2 hydrolysis in sIg-stimulated <b>immature</b> B <b>lymphocytes,</b> we first needed to identify the PTK which activates phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) the enzyme which hydrolyzes PIP 2 following mature B lymphocyte sIg stimulation.

We determined that p 72 syk from lysates of resting and sIg-stimulated B lymphocytes interacts with the SH 2 domains of PLCγ 1. PLCγ 1 and p 72 syk were also co-immunoprecipitated from lysates of resting and sIg-stimulated B lymphocytes. From these results we conclude that p 72 syk can associate with PLCγ in B lymphocytes. We also attempted to map the parts of the p 72 syk molecule required for interaction with PLCγ. ...|$|R

Three-color flow cytometry was performed with anti-CD 3, CD 4, and CD 8 antibodies to identify infiltrated lymphocytes, while tumor histology was evaluated with hematoxylin-eosin staining. The weight ratios of the entire thymic tissue including thymoma as compared to the BUF/Mna and BUF/Mna-Rnu/+ rat bodies were 0. 8 ± 0. 8 % and 1. 2 ± 1. 8 %, respectively. Histological findings for both rat congenic strains showed abundant lymphocytes surrounding large polygonal neoplastic thymic epithelia, which was compatible with the type B 1 classification of the World Health Organization for human thymoma. CD 4 +CD 8 + T cells accounted for 73. 7 ± 8. 0 % of the cells in tumors from BUF/Mna and 67. 2 ± 9. 4 % in those from BUF/Mna-Rnu/+ rats. Further, CD 3 -CD 4 -CD 8 + T cells, intermediate between CD 4 -CD 8 -and CD 4 +CD 8 + cells, accounted for 47. 7 ± 17. 5 % and 38. 0 ± 14. 0 % of the cells in tumors from the BUF/Mna and BUF/Mna-Rnu/+ strains, respectively. Thus, the proportion of developing thymic lymphocytes in and histology of thymomas from BUF/Mna and BUF/Mna-Rnu/+ rats were similar. These results suggest that both BUF/Mna and BUF/ Mna-Rnu/+ strains are suitable animal models for human thymoma to understand the development of <b>immature</b> thymic <b>lymphocytes...</b>|$|R
