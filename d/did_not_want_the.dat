5|$|In 1974, {{staff at}} Canada Post's Montreal office were noticing a {{considerable}} number of letters addressed to Santa Claus entering the postal system, and those letters were being treated as undeliverable. Since employees handling those letters <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> writers, mostly young children, to be disappointed at the lack of response, they started answering the letters themselves.|$|E
5|$|The band did not {{consider}} the album to be important and only Glover and Paice showed up to mix it. According to Birch, Gillan and Blackmore have never heard the finished album. The band <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> album to be released outside Japan and wanted full rights to the tapes, but it was released worldwide anyway.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> character to be that young.|$|E

5|$|Burton Pynsent House is a {{historic}} country-house in Britain, situated in the parish of Curry Rivel, Somerset, England. It is a Grade II* listed building. The house was built in stages between 1565 and 1765, when it was bequeathed to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham by William Pynsent, who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> house to go to Lord North. Pitt had an additional wing built to a design by Lancelot Brown, and the subsequent owner demolished everything but this wing in 1805.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} and co-writer George Lucas {{decided to make}} the film a prequel as he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> Nazis to be the villains again. After three rejected plot devices, Lucas wrote a film treatment that resembled the film's final storyline. Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas's collaborator on Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned down the offer to write the script, and Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz were hired as his replacements, with the screenplay partly based upon the 1939 film Gunga Din.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's {{precarious}} {{health was}} {{a constant source of}} worry to his mother. His death, in 1700 at the age of eleven, precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was the only individual remaining in the Protestant line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. The English Parliament <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> throne to revert to a Catholic, and so passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on Electress Sophia of Hanover, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.|$|E

5|$|However, the King <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> house himself, and {{he offered}} it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew George, who declined, objecting to {{the high cost of}} maintenance. Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the things}} that Spector wanted to achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create a}} better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E
5|$|Over Ross's protests, {{the men of}} the Sixth Regiment {{elected him}} colonel in 1862. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> {{responsibility}} of the position and had not wanted to embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General Charles W. Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross's actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862, he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit {{was the only one of}} the 810 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses.|$|E

5|$|The Dissenters {{proposed}} Robert Webb, who {{had previously}} served as the member for Taunton from 1747 until the general election in 1754, to fill the vacancy. The recent history of the elections in Taunton suggested that no opposition would be offered: the last contested election had been in 1741. That however proved {{not to be the}} case, and a group of Tories put forward their own candidate, Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet of Shute in Devon. Webb <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> expense of a contested election, and withdrew, leaving the Dissenters without a candidate. Unable to find a suitable candidate, the Dissenters appealed to Lord Egremont to locate someone to stand for the Whiggish interest. The Mayor, Henry Manly, was sent to London to meet with the Whig Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, to try and secure a candidate. Manly reported that the Duke of Newcastle <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> seat to go to a Tory, and was willing to fund the election from the secret service account (more accurately the King's private money, a fund which was not accountable to Parliament). Eventually, through communication with both Lord Egremont and the Duke of Newcastle, Robert Maxwell came forward as the Whig candidate. Maxwell offered to spend up to £3,000 on the election, in addition to the money promised from the secret service fund.|$|E
5|$|The list of {{the dead}} was not {{released}} as the victims' families wanted privacy. Authorities said {{more than one-third of}} the families <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> names of the deceased published. However, several newspapers listed some of the names of the dead. The artist Ai Weiwei compiled an unofficial {{list of the}} victims' names by contacting their relatives, along with officials and journalists. He claimed that the actual death toll was two more than the official count, but authorities did not provide access to the list of casualties.|$|E
5|$|A gas-station scene {{within the}} episode {{was meant to}} {{establish}} what the brothers and the series are about—bantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared {{that it would be}} cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. He also <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker, but combined it with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization. The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting of an older actress.|$|E

5|$|Cook and Lemish {{speculate}} that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials within the military and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised; second, {{there was a need}} for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, the creation of a top-level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{member and}} lead singer Peter Gabriel {{decided to leave}} Genesis in late 1974, midway through the tour for the album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The other members hoped he would reconsider, as {{they were still in}} debt and felt his {{departure}} could destroy the band's future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members felt they still wanted to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Keyboardist Tony Banks had been close to Gabriel personally, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> band to split up on top of seeing less of one of his best friends. He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's death destabilised the succession, as {{his mother}} {{was the only person}} {{remaining}} in the Protestant line to the throne established by the Bill of Rights 1689. Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted in a child who survived more than briefly after birth. The English parliament <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> throne to revert to a Catholic, so it passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant heirs. Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son George ascended the throne as the first British monarch of the House of Hanover.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the American Kennel Club {{explored}} {{the possibility of}} recognising the Jack Russell terrier. This move was opposed by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America as they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> breed to lose its essential working characteristics. The Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed's admission was granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, {{the size of the}} breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard, {{and the name of the}} AKC recognised Jack Russell terrier was changed to Parson Russell terrier, with the Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 1553, {{at the age}} of 15, Edward VI {{died from}} a lung infection, {{possibly}} tuberculosis. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> crown to go to Mary, because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms {{as well as those of}} Henry VIII, and so he planned to exclude her from the line of succession. His advisers, however, told him that he could not disinherit only one of his sisters: He would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and perhaps others, Edward excluded both of his sisters from the line of succession in his will.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} events to take place in Hyde Park was the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Crystal Palace was constructed {{on the south side of}} the park. The public <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> building to remain after the closure of the exhibition, and its architect, Joseph Paxton, raised funds and purchased it. He had it moved to Sydenham Hill in South London. Another significant event was the first Victoria Cross investiture, on 26 June 1857, when 62 men were decorated by Queen Victoria in the presence of Prince Albert and other members of the Royal Family, including their future son-in-law Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia, later Emperor Frederick III.|$|E
