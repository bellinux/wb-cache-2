5|$|The Whitefish Bay National Forest Scenic Byway is a National Forest Scenic Byway {{that runs}} along Whitefish Bay in the Hiawatha National Forest in the U.S. state of Michigan. The byway mostly follows Federal Forest Highway42 (FFH42) through Chippewa County in the Upper Peninsula. As a forest highway, it is {{maintained}} {{jointly by the}} Chippewa County Road Commission (CCRC) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The route of the byway first existed as an <b>earth</b> <b>road</b> by the 1930s; it was improved into a gravel road in the 1940s and paved between the 1950s and the 1980s. The byway designation was created in 1989.|$|E
5|$|What is now MS 5 {{originally}} existed as an unnumbered {{unpaved road}} by 1928. The MS 5 designation was assigned by 1932 {{for the road}} running from US 78 in Hickory Flat to the Tennessee border in Michigan City, where it connected to SR 18. This road was a gravel road south of Ashland and an <b>earth</b> <b>road</b> north of Ashland. Two years later, the portion north of Ashland became a gravel road. In 1943, the northern terminus of MS 5 was cut back to its current location at US 72, with MS 7 connecting to SR 18 at the Tennessee border. By 1948, the portion of route south of Ashland was paved. The remainder of the route was paved three years later. Since then, the route has not undergone any alignment changes.|$|E
25|$|The Old Alpine Rd. {{portion of}} the route has a much longer history with the state highway network. US67 {{designation}} was extended westward from Dallas to Presidio in 1932. The portion of US67 between Alpine and Fort Stockton was constructed as an unpaved <b>earth</b> <b>road</b> sometime between 1933 and 1936 and was also designated as State Highway10 (SH10). The SH10 designation did not survive the 1939 redescription of the state highway system, and US67 was realigned off of the Old Alpine Rd. when its more westward current roadway was constructed in 1947.|$|E

25|$|Fingerboard Road from Urbana to Centerville {{just east}} of modern Carriage Hill Drive was built as a treated <b>earth</b> <b>road</b> between 1933 and 1935. This semi-modern road was {{completed}} east to MD 75 in 1936. The final section of MD 80 from Buckeystown to Urbana was constructed as a concrete road around 1938. The UrbanaFingerboard highway was widened and resurfaced between 1950 and 1952. MD 80's interchange with the new Washington National Pike (now I-270) was also constructed in that time span. Shortly thereafter, MD 80 was widened between US 240 and the new freeway. The old highway with which MD 80 passed {{through the center of}} Urbana became US 240 Alternate in 1954 and MD 355 in 1955.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, the {{province}} of Manitoba had a segment in Lynn Lake of road that was paved with gravel from the junction with the Canadian National Railway. The road went through downtown Lynn Lake and followed modern day PR394's route up to a section {{to the east of}} Zed Lake. After Zed Lake, the route fell to a trail out to Garth Lake in Saskatchewan, south of modern-day Kinoosao. By the next year, the gravel road had been extended to the Saskatchewan provincial line at Co-Op Point to modern-day Kinoosao. In 1963, the section from Zed Lake to Co-Op Point was turned into an improved <b>earth</b> <b>road,</b> and by 1966, the route had become designated as PR394 as far as Vandekerckhove Lake. The junction with PR398 was also designated at the same time.|$|E
25|$|By 1933 the SH 20 {{designation}} {{was dropped}} over the Fredericksburg to Kerrville highway and extended instead over the auxiliary route SH 20A. That year {{the road was}} described between Fredericksburg and Hempstead as paved except for the portion in Hays County around Dripping Springs and a short portion west of Elgin that were described as surfaced. The portion west of Fredericksburg toward Junction was graded earth. In 1935, US 290 was routed over SH 20 except for the portion between Austin and Paige where US 290 was routed further south through Bastrop. By 1936, the formerly surfaced portion west of Elgin had been paved, but the Hays County portion remained merely surfaced. West of Fredericksburg, the Gillespie County portion had been surfaced while the Kimble County portion remained as an improved <b>earth</b> <b>road.</b> On September 26, 1939, the SH 20 designation was dropped along all portions of the route running along US 290 {{as a result of}} that year's general redescription of the state highway system leaving SH 20 as a greatly shortened route running from Austin to US 290 near Paige. On May 23, 1951, US 290 was relocated away from Bastrop northward along SH 20 which was then decommissioned.|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out to gather, review, {{summarize}} literature in order to prepare a set of recommendation tor design and maintenance of gravel road for Sri Lanka, Paved roads are all weather while <b>earth</b> <b>roads</b> are not. The cost of construction and maintenance of paved roads are very high compared to <b>earth</b> <b>roads.</b> A need has always been there for all weather gravel roads {{to bridge the gap between}} paved <b>roads</b> and <b>earth</b> <b>roads,</b> in order to accommodate low volume of traffic on agricultural and rural roads. In this study, the available literature and practices were studied and revived by the author. who has considerable field experience in this subject, spanning a period of about two decades. It was possible after the study to present suitable recommendations, for most required items in design and maintenance of gravel roads. The surveys carried out reveal that magnitude of traffic and their composition can be accommodated with suitably designed, constructed and maintained gravel roads. The outcome of the study presents recommendations on selection of sites for gravel roads, essential geometric standards, drainage, selection of material, design procedure for pavement structure, maintenance requirements, items of maintenance and their frequencies, and the cost aspects of construction and maintenance. The study of cost aspect reveal that the gravel roads require one third of the cost that would require for traditional bitumen surfaced aggregate base (metaled and tarred) roads. Maintenance of gravel roads could be carried out on self-help basis. This would further help to bridge the gap with respect to cost, between traditional paved <b>roads</b> and <b>earth</b> <b>roads...</b>|$|R
6000|$|Plank Roads.--"Miry, boggy {{lines of}} road, along which {{people had been}} seen for months {{crawling}} like flies across a plate of treacle, are suddenly, and I may almost say magically, converted into a road as hard and good as Regent Street by the following simple process, which is usually adopted {{as soon as the}} feeble funds of the young colony can purchase the blessing. A small gang of men, with spades and rammers, quickly level one end of the <b>earth</b> <b>road.</b> As fast as they proceed, four or five rows of strong beams or sleepers, which have been brought in the light wagons of the country, are laid down longitudinally, four or five feet asunder; and no sooner are they in position than from other wagons stout planks, touching each other, are transversely laid upon them. From a third series of wagons, a thin layer of sand or grit is thrown upon the planks, which instantly assume the appearance of a more level McAdam road than in practice can ever be obtained. Upon this new-born road the wagons carrying the sleepers, planks, and sand, convey, with perfect ease, these three descriptions of materials for its continuance. The work advances literally about as fast as an old gouty gentleman can walk; and as soon as it is completed, there can scarcely exist a more striking contrast than between the two tenses of what it was and what it is. This 'plank road,' as it is termed in America, usually lasts from eight to twelve years; and as it is found quite unnecessary to spike the planks to the sleepers, the arrangement admits of easy repair, which, however, is but seldom required."
