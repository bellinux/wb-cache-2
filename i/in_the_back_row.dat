As a {{freshman}}, he sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>row</b> {{of the chamber}} next to fellow freshman Harry Truman, and the pair quickly became friends. Minton was made {{a member of a}} special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.|$|E

One of the 5th-century frescoes in this cave also shows children at a school, with those in the front rows paying attention to the teacher, while those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>row</b> are shown distracted and acting.|$|E
25|$|Canopies {{for each}} cardinal-elector were once used during conclaves—a sign of equal dignity. After the new Pope accepts his election, {{he would give}} his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug on a rope {{attached}} to their seats to lower their canopies. Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. Paul VI abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, {{the population of the}} College of Cardinals had increased so much {{to the point that they}} would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E
25|$|First, {{the seating}} {{arrangement}} (four parts in a square, facing each other) is clearly {{intended for the}} singers, not for external listeners.

25|$|Jugan {{was born}} in Glassport, Pennsylvania on October 16, 1957. He became {{interested}} in pro wrestling as a child after attending a live event at the McKeesport Palisades. Jugan later became a regular studio audience member on the famed Saturday night television program Studio Wrestling. Although the show was restricted to people over 18, Jugan was often sneaked in {{through the back door}} of the WIIC-TV studio by Bruno Sammartino's manager and sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>row</b> of the bleachers. Jugan was studying photography in school at the time and began taking pictures at the matches. An official ringside photographer during the final years of Studio Wrestling, he eventually started submitting photos and writing for various wrestling magazines and newsletters. He was also president of a fanclub for Luis Martinez.|$|E
25|$|Before {{a battle}} begins, the player usually has {{the choice to}} retreat, giving them time to prepare. For every battle, the player may choose only three combatants out of a {{possible}} five, and a positioning scheme for them. The player can either choose the Attack or Magic formation. The Attack formation allows Attack based moves a shorter recharge time, and there will be two characters in the front row, and a single character <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>row.</b> In Magic formation, Magic users have a shorter recharge time and positioning is reversed. Following that decision the player must choose the items to bring. Only sixteen items can be held at any time, and there are no methods of storage. The player may only bring four of those sixteen items into battle for all three characters to use. However, for every item, each character has a different attack; where, with a staff, Cierra might do great damage with a magical attack, Fia would heal an ally.|$|E

500|$|With {{the end of}} the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the {{subsequent}} accession of Deng Xiaoping, many of the purged figures of earlier years were rehabilitated, and the authorities in 1979 decided to bring more historical accuracy to the painting. [...] Dong had died in 1973; his family strongly opposed anyone altering the original painting, and the government respected their wishes. [...] Jin was on a tour outside China, so the government assigned Yan Zhenduo to make changes to the replica. [...] He placed Liu, Lin Boqu and Gao in the painting and made other changes: a previously unidentifiable man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>row</b> now resembles Deng Xiaoping. [...] The replica painting was restored to the Museum of the Chinese Revolution.|$|E
500|$|Enemies {{are confronted}} on the overworld map and in dungeons through both random {{encounters}} and staged battles. Battles {{are governed by}} a turn-based system: the player's and enemy's parties each get a turn during which they can perform available actions. The player party is arranged in a three-by-two grid, with their positioning effecting how they can attack enemies: for instance, short-ranged attacks are made less effective if the selected party member is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>row.</b> The player has access to multiple commands in battle: [...] "Sword", [...] "Gun", [...] "Magic" [...] and [...] "Extra". Items {{can also be used}} in battle, and the player can choose to escape from most encounters aside from key boss battles. An [...] "Auto" [...] option is also available, where the entire party is commanded using the game's artificial intelligence. At the end of each successful battle, experience points are distributed among party members depending on the strength of the enemy, and the protagonist is given Ability Points to assign to six different attributes which affect his performance in battle.|$|E
500|$|Right away, Jackson {{noticed that}} Springsteen {{was a very}} {{particular}} critic of his own concert sound. At every new venue, Springsteen would take [...] "BJ" [...] around to various seats in the concert venue, sitting in every section, even the last row of seats, {{and listen to the}} band play. He asked Jackson why the sound was not so good far away as it was up close, and if the audio crew could do anything about it. Jackson said, [...] "we can do a lot about it", and worked with Clair Brothers to design a ring of delay loudspeakers positioned closer to the farthest seats to augment the high frequencies lost over distance by sound waves travelling through air. This made the hi-hat sound more [...] "crisp and clean", with higher quality sound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>row</b> than previously experienced in such large venues. Throughout Jackson's years with him, Springsteen maintained his interest in delivering high quality sound to every seat, and the solutions grew in size and complexity until by 1984 there were eight rings of delays set up for the largest venues.|$|E

500|$|In 1915, Grant won a {{scholarship}} to attend Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol, although his father could barely {{afford to pay for}} the uniform. With his good looks and acrobatic talents Grant became a popular figure among both girls and boys. Able at most academic subjects, he excelled at sports, particularly fives; he developed a reputation for mischief, and frequently refused to do his homework. A former classmate referred to him as a [...] "scruffy little boy", while an old teacher remembered [...] "the naughty little boy who was always making a noise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>row</b> and would never do his homework". His evenings were spent working backstage in Bristol theatres, and in 1917, at the age of 13, he was responsible for the lighting for the magician David Devant at the Hippodrome. Grant began hanging around backstage at the theatre at every opportunity. In the summer he volunteered for work as a messenger boy and guide at the military docks in Southampton, to escape the unhappiness of his home life. The time spent at Southampton strengthened his desire to travel; he was eager to leave Bristol and tried to sign on as a ship's cabin boy, but learned he was too young.|$|E

2500|$|The prisoners ran out {{of places}} to hide sand, and snow cover then made it {{impractical}} to scatter it undetected. However, under {{the seats in the}} theatre there was a large empty space, but when it was built the prisoners had given their word not to misuse the materials; the parole system was regarded as [...] Internal [...] "legal advice" [...] was taken, and the SBOs decided that the completed building did not fall under the parole system.

The two main balconies—which are unusually close to the ground and gently sloped—seat a total of 1,200. There are six shallow balconies which are normally used for celebrity guests.

Butch Leake and former Ink Spot Grant Kitchings replaced Sheppard and Thomas. Fredricks was replaced by Clyde Brown the next year, and Kitchings by Billy Lewis the year after. Leake was replaced by Joe Blunt in 1976, making the lineup Johnny Moore, Clyde Brown, Joe Blunt, and Billy Lewis. This year, Faye Treadwell renamed the group's management company Treadwell Drifters Inc.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, Jackson and Jack Ryder of the Cincinnati Enquirer {{organized}} the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). [...] The BBWAA {{was established in}} response to ongoing disputes over working conditions in, and control over, press boxes. [...] The press boxes at many fields were cramped, and team owners had begun to offer seating in the press boxes to actors, friends and others who were not members of the working press. [...] Frequently, {{there was no room}} for reporters from the visiting team. The issue came to a head during the 1908 World Series between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs when visiting baseball writers in Chicago were seated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>row</b> of the grandstand and in Detroit [...] "were compelled to climb a ladder to the roof of the first base pavilion and write in the rain and snow".|$|E

Rowe would lose the 1937 election to Mitchell Hepburn, and eventually give up the post in 1938. Gardiner's outward role in the election was to give speeches. One of Gardiner's first speeches was a rally for Leslie Frost, older brother of Cecil Frost, who organized the 1937 campaign. Cecil Frost and Gardiner would become {{the president and first}} vice-president, respectively, of the party in 1938. Gardiner, who had decided not to run for provincial politics in 1938, also chose not to run for federal politics in the 1939 federal election, although the South York nomination was his, if he wanted it.
