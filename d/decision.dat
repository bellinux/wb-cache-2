5|$|The Ontario provincial {{government}} has quarrelled with 407ETR over toll rates and customer service, but is largely tied {{down by the}} lease contract. On February 2, 2004, the government delivered notice to 407ETR that they {{are considered to be}} in default of their contract because of 407ETR's <b>decision</b> to raise toll rates without first obtaining provincial clearance. The court's initial <b>decision</b> sided with 407ETR: on July 10, 2004, an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407ETR has the ability to raise toll rates without first consulting the government. The government filed an appeal of this <b>decision</b> but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court <b>decision</b> released on January 6, 2005; however, a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13, 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the <b>decision.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court of Indiana has {{original}} and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas, including {{the practice of}} law, discipline or disbarment of judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the state.

40|$|According to Unconscious Thought Theory, {{people make}} better <b>decisions</b> after {{unconscious}} than after conscious thought (Dijksterhuis, Bos, Nordgren, & van Baaren, 2006 a).

Third, unconscious <b>decisions</b> should be superior to conscious <b>decisions,</b> even if unconscious <b>decisions</b> are deliberated while having access to information.

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of standing prevents applicants from burdening {{the court with}} frivolous or vexatious claims. This minimizes disruption in the administrative process. When an administrative <b>decision</b> by a public authority is challenged, implementation of the <b>decision</b> by the authority may be delayed. Therefore, the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging the <b>decision.</b> Furthermore, since the courts' resources are limited, restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial resources are appropriately allocated.|$|E
5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a <b>decision</b> by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the <b>decision</b> is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a <b>decision</b> if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords <b>decision</b> Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the <b>decision</b> to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a <b>decision</b> is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the <b>decision.</b> Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's <b>decision</b> even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the <b>decision</b> had been made on national security grounds.|$|E
