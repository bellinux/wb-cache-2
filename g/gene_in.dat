5|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} an RNA thermometer motif is the FourU thermometer found in Salmonella enterica. When exposed to temperatures above 45°C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration {{has also been shown}} to affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA thermometer is found in the rpoH <b>gene</b> <b>in</b> Escherichia coli. This thermosensor upregulates heat shock proteins under high temperatures through σ32, a specialised heat-shock sigma factor.|$|E

5|$|New genes can be {{generated}} from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function. This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system; one <b>gene</b> <b>in</b> the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.

5|$|People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{are born}} with one mutated copy of the FLCN <b>gene</b> <b>in</b> each cell. Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the <b>gene</b> <b>in</b> a subset of cells. When this occurs, {{the result is that}} these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes. FLCN {{has been found to be}} overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys. Furthermore, the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor tissue from both humans and mice.|$|E

40|$|Dothistromin (DOTH) is a {{secondary}} metabolite {{produced by the}} fungal peanut pathogen Passalora arachidicola and pine needle pathogen Dothistroma septosporum. The chemical structure of DOTH {{is similar to a}} precursor of aflatoxin (AF) and sterigmatocystin (ST), which are secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus species. A size fractionated genomic library was made and 11 putative DOTH <b>genes</b> were identified <b>in</b> P. arachidicola. The DOTH <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> P. arachidicola were compared to DOTH <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> D. septosporum as well as to AF and ST <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> Aspergillus species.

The DOTH biosynthesis <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> P. arachidicola had similar gene organization and direction of transcription to DOTH biosynthesis <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> D. septosporum and is similar in that 11 putative DOTH genes are separated into three mini-clusters. This differs from the AF/ST clusters in which 25 AF/ST genes are tightly clustered in a 70 kb region. Identification of transcription factor binding sites upstream of DOTH <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> P. arachidicola and D. septosporum suggested similar co-regulation of DOTH <b>gene</b> expression <b>in</b> P. arachidicola and D. septosporum. Tandem and inverted repeat sequences were identified in intergenic regions in the P. arachidicola DOTH gene cluster, but the distribution of those repeats appears to be random. This suggests that the fragmentation of the DOTH biosynthesis gene cluster is not due to retrotransposon activity or recombination between repeat sequences. The DOTH biosynthesis <b>gene</b> clusters <b>in</b> P. arachidicola and D. septosporum could be ancestral to AF/ST biosynthesis clusters in Aspergillus species...|$|R

5|$|Animals used by {{laboratories}} {{are largely}} supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied {{from a few}} main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly.

5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch more likely to occur in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this <b>gene</b> <b>in</b> any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E

By accurately partitioning of this genome, we observed that <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> the less fractioned subgenome (LF) were dominantly expressed over the <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> more fractioned subgenomes (MFs: MF 1 and MF 2), while the <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> MF 1 were slightly dominantly expressed over the <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> MF 2.

5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a duplication event within the genome. For gene duplication events, if a <b>gene</b> <b>in</b> an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous.

Examples include the Homeobox (Hox) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole genome duplications. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are clustered across multiple chromosomes with the HoxA-D clusters being the best studied.|$|E

Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this <b>gene</b> <b>in</b> plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans.

Housekeeping <b>genes</b> are involved <b>in</b> basic functions in the cells and {{are assumed to be}} expressed at relatively constant levels across different cell types and experimental conditions. Based on these features, housekeeping genes are frequently used as controls <b>in</b> calibration of <b>gene</b> expression data. Commonly used housekeeping <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> somatic tissues have shown to vary notably in human embryonic stem cells and are therefore inappropriate as reference <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> this unique cell type.

In addition, a novel set of 20 genes was identified as very stably expressed during the differentiation towards the cardiac lineage.
