40|$|BACKGROUND: Apoptosis, {{a process}} of normal {{embryonic}} development, is enhanced in blastocyst from diabetic rats. Nevertheless, glucose seems {{not to be the}} only factor involved. Activin A, a TGF-beta family member, is also increased in maternal serum from diabetic pregnancy. METHODS: <b>Flushing</b> <b>medium,</b> blastocysts and uterine cells were obtained from 5 day old pregnant rats. The presence of activin A in <b>flushing</b> <b>medium</b> was investigated by western blotting. RT-PCR was used to test for the presence of activin betaA subunit mRNA in cultured uterine cells. Blastocysts were stained by immunohistochemistry for activin receptor types IIA and IIB, and chromatin degradation (apoptosis) was investigated by terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling in blastocysts exposed in vitro to activin. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate the presence of activin A protein in fluid from rat uterine horns at day 5 of pregnancy, as well as the presence of activin A receptors type IIB in the trophectoderm and inner cell mass and activin A receptor type IIA in trophectoderm cells only. Activin A increases the chromatin degradation level in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Activin A protein was found in fluid from uterine horns, and mRNA expression of betaA activin subunit in cultured uterine cells suggests probable secretion from decidual cells. Moreover, activin A increases specifically the apoptosis level in rat blastocyst in vitro...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficiency of non-surgical embryo collection in goats. Five lactating Saanen goats were tested alternately in a cross-over design for two treatments (T 1 and T 2). In both treatments, intravaginal progesterone devices were inserted (day 0 / 6 p. m.) and removed six days later (day 6 / 18 : 00 p. m.) and 22. 5 μg cloprostenol were administered by intravulvosubmucosal via (day 0). From day 4 (18 : 00 p. m.), goats received six decreasing doses of FSH (250 – 400 IU) at 12 h interval. Three doses of 50 mg flunixin meglumine were administered on days 9, 10, and 11. In T 1 and T 2, animals received two doses of saline or 250 mg of rbST on day 0 and on first detection of estrus, respectively. Goats were mated until the end of estrus and uteri were flushed by cervical route seven days after first mating. The embryo collection interval was 60 days. Percentage of <b>flushing</b> <b>medium</b> recovered was close to 100 % in both treatments. Total number of ova (18. 4 ± 9. 4 and 15. 7 ± 11. 0) and viable embryos (13. 4 ± 4. 1 and 8. 2 ± 3. 0) were similar (P> 0. 05) for T 1 and T 2, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{an experimental}} and theoretical study of sorbed contaminant removal from a column (or reactor) by flushing. This removal may take place by either volatilization or rinsing, and nonlinear sorption is {{accounted for by}} employing a Freundlich relationship. A one-dimensional nonequilibrium transport model is proposed which describes the unsteady mass transfer between <b>flushing</b> <b>medium</b> and soil phases in the column, using a linear chemical transfer model. The moving boundary problem is transferred, and a perturbation method is employed to obtain an approximate solution of the governing equations for a small Merkel number Me (this dimensionless number comprises the product of fluid residence time and the mass transfer coefficient). The solution reveals {{the effect of the}} various parameters, such as the Freundlich parameter n, on the contaminant transport in fluid phase and decay in solid phase. Applying the model to various experimental data results in values for the overall mass transfer coefficients, which are useful for engineering computations. Furthermore, the model enables the prediction of the initial soil contamination level as well as the parameter n solely from the measured exit contaminant concentrations in the flushing fluid. A thorough comparison of this prediction with the measured soil concentration (prior to the experiments) yields good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Fresh and post-thaw {{parameters}} (motility, morphology and viability) of stallion epididymal spermatozoa {{that have}} been and have not been exposed to seminal plasma were evaluated, and directly compared to fresh and post-thaw parameters of ejaculated spermatozoa. Six sperm categories of each stallion (n= 4) were evaluated for motility, morphology and viability. These categories were fresh ejaculated spermatozoa (Fr-E), fresh epididymal spermatozoa that {{had been exposed to}} seminal plasma (Fr-SP+), fresh epididymal spermatozoa that had never been exposed to seminal plasma (Fr-SP−), frozen–thawed ejaculated spermatozoa (Cr-E), frozen–thawed epididymal spermatozoa that had been exposed to seminal plasma prior to freezing (Cr-SP+) and frozen–thawed epididymal spermatozoa that had never been exposed to seminal plasma (Cr-SP−). Results show that seminal plasma stimulates initial motility of fresh epididymal stallion spermatozoa while this difference in progressive motility is no longer present post-thaw; and that progressive motility of fresh or frozen–thawed ejaculated stallion spermatozoa is not always a good indicator for post-thaw progressive motility of epididymal spermatozoa. This study shows that seminal plasma has a positive influence on the incidence of overall sperm defects, midpiece reflexes and distal cytoplasmic droplets in frozen–thawed stallion epididymal spermatozoa while the occurance of midpiece reflexes is likely to be linked to distal cytoplasmic droplets. Furthermore, seminal plasma does not have an influence on viability of fresh and frozen–thawed morphologically normal epididymal spermatozoa.

40|$|Embryo {{recovery}} rate in superovulated cows after uterine flushing {{is lower than}} the ovulation rate, which contributes to the relative inefficiency of the conventional cervical recovery procedure. A simple and easy alternative to improve embryo {{recovery rate}} is the uterine re-flushing procedure. To evaluate the effect of re-flushing and the influence of breed and operator on bovine embryo recovery rate, 38 Nelore and 19 Jersey females were stimulated using FSH, with embryos being collected by one of two trained operators. At the end of flushing, the catheter was sealed and maintained into the uterine body, filled with <b>flushing</b> <b>medium,</b> while females were released to a paddock for 30 to 50 min, to be submitted to the re-flushing procedure by the same operator. A total of 599 structures were recovered out of 57 procedures, from which 423 (70. 6 %) were obtained in the first flushing and 176 (29. 4 %) after re-flushing. Mean recovery rates of 7. 4 and 3. 1 structures were obtained after the first and second flushing, respectively, for a total of 10. 5 structures per cow. Structures were obtained in 73. 6 % (42 out of 57) of the re-flushing procedures. No breed effect was observed on total ova or embryo recovery, with 10. 9 total ova collected from Jersey and 10. 3 from Nelore females.

At 19 to 23 days postpartum, cows were allotted to receive a norgestomet implant for 9 days (normal luteal phase) or to serve as untreated controls (short luteal phase). Calves were weaned 7 days after initiation of treatment to induce behavioral estrus in cows for mating. In 25 cows, growth of the ovulatory follicle was monitored by ultrasonography. On Day 6 after estrus, embryos were recovered nonsurgically, and live embryos were transferred into recipient cows exhibiting normal estrous cycles. The medium used to flush the embryos from the uterus of each donor cow was assayed for prostaglandin F,, (PGF,,). Days from calf removal to estrus and size of ovulatory follicles at ovulation (4. 1 0. 3 days and 16. 7 + 0. 7 mm, respectively) did not differ between NORMAL and SHORT cows. Interval from detection of the ovulatory follicle to ovulation was longer in NORMAL (10 ± 0. 7 days) than in SHORT cows (8 0. 6 days; p < 0. 05). Rates of recovery of an embryo or ovum (64 %), rates of fertilization (65 %), and quality or stage of development of Day 6 embryos did not differ between SHORT and NORMAL cows. Overall pregnancy rate from recovered oocytes was 13 % for SHORT and 32 % for NORMAL cows (p = 0. 06); survival of fertilized oocytes was 23 % for SHORT and 47 % for NORMAL cows (p = 0. 08). Survival rate of transferred embryos (65 %) did not differ with respect to length of the luteal phase. Concentrations of PGF,, in <b>flushing</b> <b>medium</b> were higher in SHORT (577 + 68 pg/ ml) than in NORMAL cows (337 + 65 pg/ml; p < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{potential}} {{for using the}} crop maize (Zea mays) {{for the production of}} biogas in simple anaerobic leach beds was evaluated. The results showed that leach beds coupled to high-rate methanogenic reactors performed better than other systems on a specific methane yield per gram of substrate added basis while their performance on a volumetric gas yield basis was poorer. Initial experiments using a single stage digester showed rapid acidification due to the low buffering capacity of the system. To overcome this problem, leach beds were used as part of a two-phase system in which the intermediate metabolic products were flushed out and used as substrate for a second stage methanogenic reactor. Further experiments simulated the effect of a hydraulic flush in the leach bed using clean water as the flush liquid. Methane potential of the leachate was estimated based on the cumulative soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) production. Under this operation mode, the effect of substrate to inoculum ratio, fresh substrate load (FSL), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and buffer and trace element addition was tested. The performance of the leach bed was found to be poor compared to conventional digesters where the methane yield is ~ 0. 35 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded and volatile solids (VS) destruction is ~ 85 % and this was thought to be due to the low pH in the reactor. Increasing the FSL improved methane yield but the maximum value obtained was 0. 12 l CH 4 g- 1 VS. Decreasing the HRT allowed the leach bed to operate at a slightly higher pH. In this case, a volatile solids destruction of ~ 50 % and a methane yield of 0. 17 l CH 4 g- 1 VS was achieved using a HRT of 2. 6 days. The addition of buffer (NaHCO 3) to maintain pH ~ 6. 5 increased VS destruction to 89 % and methane yield to 0. 37 l CH 4 g- 1 VS at an HRT of 1. 5 days. This performance was similar at a HRT of 28 days despite the high VFA concentrations. Acid production increased with the addition of buffer as 75 - 97 % of SCOD was converted to this form. Buffering was also shown {{to increase the number of}} culturable anaerobic cellulolytic microorganisms. VS degradation and methane potential were further enhanced by the addition 0. 5 mg l- 1 of cobalt to the buffered <b>flush</b> <b>medium</b> giving an apparent VS destruction of 115 % and a methane yield of 0. 46 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded, which indicated that a proportion of the inoculum was also degraded. In the final part of the research the leach beds were coupled to methanogenic reactors and trials were conducted using different feed cycle durations, in which all the digestate and leachate from the preceding run was used as inoculum, and only the solids destroyed were replaced with fresh feed material. The effect of the methanogenic reactor was multi-fold as it not only stripped out intermediate compounds, according to its primary design function, but also played an important role in stabilising pH, maintaining nutrients and retaining the microbial population in the system. The leach bed operated with a 7 -day feed cycle showed higher substrate degradation and was able to receive a higher OLR of 2. 4 gTS l- 1 reactor d- 1 than the 14 -day feed cycle at 1. 7 gTS l- 1 reactor d- 1 and the 28 -day feed cycle at 1. 3 gTS l- 1 reactor d- 1. This provided a higher volumetric methane yield the shorter the feed cycle, 0. 839 lCH 4 l- 1 d- 1, 0. 618 lCH 4 l- 1 d- 1 and 0. 482 lCH 4 l- 1 d- 1 in the 7 -day, 14 -day and 28 -day feed cycle, respectively. However, the specific methane yield obtained from the system was slightly higher in the 14 -day and 28 -day cycles at 0. 434 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded while in the 7 -day cycle it was 0. 418 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded. The retention of the digestate and leachate over successive cycles for a period of ~ 160 days appeared, however, to cause an accumulation of suspended solids (SS) and total and soluble COD in the leachate. This was especially the case in the higher loaded 7 -day feed cycle reactor and was probably the cause of the lower methane production. Initially the methanogenic reactors were responsible for most methane production but with progressive cycles the leach beds themselves became methanogenic and eventually accounted for more than 50 % of the methane generated in the system. The methanogenic and cellulolytic bacteria were shown to be present in the leachate from both reactors and suggested a synergy between them in exchange of microbial consortia.

40|$|International audienceGiven {{increasing}} anthropogenic and climatic {{pressures on}} water resources, groundwater and surface water {{need to be}} better managed and preserved. As these two water stocks can be connected to each other, their evolutions are linked {{and need to be}} considered as such. However, interactions between lakes and groundwater are not well understood and, most of the time, are not taken into account. Therefore, establishing a comprehensive approach to quantify groundwater and lakes’ hydrogeochemical interactions in various settings is of foremost importance for assessing the sensitivity of lakes to groundwater evolution. In this study, small kettle lakes set in fluvioglacial deposits and that are most likely well connected to shallow unconfined aquifers are specifically targeted. Geochemistry and isotopic results highlight that groundwater flux to the lakes is generally the dominant parameter of the lake water budget. The 222 Rn results in particular suggest that 38 % of the studied lakes have a high proportion of groundwater in their balances. It appears that the different tracers are complementary: geochemistry is influenced by groundwater inflows, reflecting its quality and the local geology, whereas water stable isotopes correspond directly to the volumetric lake water budget, and both of these tracers are impacted by in-lake processes. Moreover, the third tracer considered, 222 Rn, highlights the location of groundwater inputs in space and time. Finally, the studied kettle lakes are characterized by a short to <b>medium</b> <b>flushing</b> time by groundwater. As a result, these lakes can be highly sensitive to environmental and climate changes affecting groundwater...|$|R

Owing to the thermo-rheological properties of the contrast media, the primary aim of this work is to present an in vitro experimental impact study concerning {{the impact of the}} temperature level on flushing efficiency after contrast medium injection. Moreover, we report experimental data that confirms the role of needle bevel orientation. The secondary aim is to answer the following questions: Is there significant device contrast medium trapping after contrast medium injection? Is saline flushing efficient? And, finally, is it safe to inject contrast medium through an indwelled port catheter?Results: The experimental results show that in addition to hydrodynamics, temperature is a key parameter for the efficiency of device <b>flushing</b> after contrast <b>medium</b> injection. It appears that this is the case when the cavity is incompletely rinsed after three calibrated flushing volumes of 10 mL saline solution, even by using the Huber needle bevel opposite to the port exit. This leads to a potentially important trapped volume of contrast medium in the port, and consequently to the possibility of subsequent salt precipitates and long term trisubstituted benzene nuclei delivery that might impair the solute properties, which may be further injected via the power port later on. Conclusion: We thus suggest, in TIVADS patients, the use of a temporary supplementary intravenous line rather than the port to perform contrast medium injections in daily radiology routine practice.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of endogenous ileal amino acid excretion under conditions of peptide alimentation was refined and evaluated with studies involving the laboratory rat. The refined method was used to investigate aspects of endogenous ileal amino acid flow in the pig. Five studies were conducted, three with rats and two involving the growing pig. 1. Preliminary investigations evaluated the filtration efficiency of ultrafiltration devices, and examined three pre-filtration treatments for rat ileal digesta: trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and perchloric acid (PCA) precipitation, and centrifugation (SPIN). The recovery of nitrogen following ultrafiltration (molecular weight exclusion limit 10, 000 Daltons) of fifteen purified protein, peptide and amino acid solutions indicated an effective filtration (> 90 %) on nominal molecular weight by the ultrafiltration devices. Determination of nitrogen and amino acids in the resulting fractions following TCA and PCA precipitation and centrifugation of rat ileal digesta indicated that PCA was the most effective precipitant. Endogenous ileal amino acid excretions in the growing rat fed an enzymically hydrolysed casein (EHC) based diet with subsequent treatment of the digesta using the ultrafiltration technology were then determined. Twelve 100 g male rats were fed either an EHC-based diet or a protein-free diet and samples of digesta were collected after slaughter. The digesta from the 6 EHC-fed rats were ultrafiltered after centrifugation and the high molecular weight fraction added to the precipitate. The protein-free fed rats had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower amino acid flows than those rats fed the EHC-based diet with subsequent treatment of the digesta. 2. The proportions of endogenous protein-, peptide- and free amino acid nitrogen (N) in digesta N from the distal ileum of the rat immediately after collection or following storage frozen (- 20 °C and - 196 °C) were compared. Eighteen growing rats were given a protein-free diet for 6 days, euthanased and samples of digesta were collected from the terminal 20 cm of ileum. The storage of digesta did not significantly affect the proportions of N-containing substances in the precipitate plus retentate or ultrafiltrate fractions. On average, 67 % of the total digesta N was in the precipitate plus retentate fraction and 33 % of total digesta N was in the ultrafiltrate fraction. Free amino acid N and peptide N were 10. 4 and 10. 6 % of total digesta N, respectively. 3. The effect of using different flushing media for the collection of ileal digesta on the composition of endogenous N was examined. Twelve growing rats were given a protein-free diet and samples of ileal digesta were collected from the euthanased animal using either distilled water or physiological saline as the <b>flushing</b> <b>medium.</b> There was no significant effect of collection method on the levels of N-containing substances in rat endogenous ileal digesta. 4. The effects of state of body nitrogen balance {{and the presence of}} dietary peptides and protein in the digestive tract on the excretion of endogenous amino acids from the ileum of the pig were investigated. Endogenous lysine excretion was determined for pigs given a protein-free diet, an EHC-, a zein- or a synthetic amino acid-based diet. Endogenous flows for amino acids other than lysine were determined for pigs on the protein-free and EHC-based diets. Six male pigs (15 kg liveweight) were allocated to each of the four diets and received the diet for 10 days. The mean endogenous ileal lysine flows for the zein and EHC fed pigs were not significantly different but were higher (P< 0. 05) than those for the protein-free and synthetic amino acid fed pigs whose mean flows were not significantly different from each other. The mean endogenous ileal flows for amino acids other than lysine were higher (P< 0. 05) for the EHC fed pigs compared to the animals on the protein-free diet, except for proline, glycine and arginine. 5. The effect of food dry matter intake on endogenous ileal amino acid excretion of the pig under peptide alimentation was determined. Sixteen male pigs (50 kg liveweight) each fitted with a T-cannula in the terminal ileum were fed at 8 levels of food dry matter intake for periods of 8 days. The experiment involved two trials of 8 pigs each, comprising a cross over design. Each trial involved 4 pairs of pigs with each pair receiving one of 4 sequences of treatment. Each sequence comprised 4 levels of food dry matter intake arranged in a Latin square. The food dry matter intakes were 0. 06, 0. 08, 0. 10 and 0. 12, and 0. 05, 0. 07, 0. 09 and 0. 11 metabolic liveweight (W 0. 75) day- 1 for the first and second trials, respectively. There was an increase in ileal excretion of amino acids, nitrogen and dry matter with increasing food dry matter. There were significant (P< 0. 05) linear relationships between endogenous ileal amino acid and nitrogen excretion and food dry matter intake except for lysine, glutamic acid and phenylalanine which increased in a curvilinear manner. These relationships, determined under physiologically more normal conditions than under protein-free alimentation, provide preliminary data on the magnitude of small intestinal amino acid losses in the pig...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the number of embryo dead cells after 6 and/or 24 h of cooled {{preservation}} in three different media. Day 8 embryos were collected by uterine flushing with Ringer Lactate at 37 °C in an Ez-Way Filter (PETS, Canton, TX, USA) from 17 Standardbred mares artificially inseminated with fresh or frozen semen. Embryo quality, stage and diameter were evaluated before embryos were randomly allocated to one of these treatments: Emcare Holding Solution (ICPbio Repro- duction, USA), 24 h (EHS 24; n = 6), using the standard protocol (control); Emcare Flushing Solution (ICPbio Reproduction, USA), 6 h (EFS 6; n = 6) and 24 h (EFS 24; n = 4); Ringer Lactate, 6 h (RL 6; n = 7). In EFS’s and RL 6 groups, the recovered embryos were kept in the filter and rinsed with 1 l of EFS or RL, which replaced the <b>medium</b> <b>flushed</b> from the uterus. Fluid filled filters were then placed in the Equitainer® and after cooling for the due time, the embryos were incubated with the cells stain DAPI and the dead cells were counted using epifluorescence UV- illumination on a Leica DM LB microscope. Embryo’s total cell number was estimated using the correlation: n = 0. 0106 d 2 + 2. 0542 d- 375. 28 (n = cells number, d = embryo diameter in μm) (Moussa et al., 2004; 160). The effects of treatment and diameter group (1000 μ) on the percentages of dead cells/estimated total embryo cells were evaluated by ANOVA (GLM). All the recovered embryos were excellent or good quality blastocysts. No differences in proportion of dead cells were observed between diameter and treatment. Holding for 24 h or in RL for 6 h, 8 days old, good quality equine embryos in EFS didn’t increase the proportion of dead cells compared to cooling in EHS for 24 h. If in vivo studies will confirm the absence of major embryo damage, these protocols will simplify equine embryo cooling and shipping, before transfer...|$|R
40|$| MED probe to blue frame {{should be}} brief. If {{the surface of}} the probe is still hydrophobic, repeat brief {{exposure}} with cooling after each exposure. Please refer to Movie 1. - 6, Collagen coating of the MED probe should be done on cold pack or ice block to coat it uniformly. Avoid forming bubbles in collagen solution. - 11, Mechanical stress to the brain slice, such as <b>flushing</b> with <b>medium</b> or touching with forceps, should be minimized while setting the slice on the electrodes of the MED probe. - 13, Of critical importance, adjust the medium volume so that the slices is kept wet but not submerged in medium. ### Anticipated Results The protocols and results present the relationship between clock gene expression and its output signal, neuronal activity rhythms, in the SCN slice. This methods enable us to measure gene expression and neuronal activity of neuron of interest simultaneous at real-time for several weeks without medium exchange. Responses of the two parameters can also be monitored simultaneously to various kind stimuli, e. g. by passing electric currents of desired frequency and amplitude to the selected electrode and by applying drugs. Optical tools can also be applied, such as caged compounds and optogenetics. ### References 1. Moore, R. Y. & Eichler, V. B.
