25|$|Sulfur dioxide (SO2), {{nitrogen}} dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) {{are some of}} the most common types of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants</b> found within collections and can result in the catalyzation of deletrious chemical reactions. The chemical reactions caused by these gases can result in the breakdown of inorganic and organic materials, or the tarnishing of metal objects. Other objects contain intrinsic elements that may begin to break down over time causing a damaging condition known as off-gassing. The storage of construction materials and basic housekeeping within a collection area may also be a source of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The hazardous fumes given off by strong cleaning products such as bleach or ammonia can transfer to objects causing deterioration, and construction materials such as adhesives, paints, and sealants may off-gas resulting in additional damages.|$|E
25|$|Air pollution: {{the release}} of {{chemicals}} and particulates into the atmosphere. Common <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants</b> include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Photochemical ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their micrometre size PM10 to PM2.5.|$|E
25|$|Waste {{polycarbonate}} will degrade at {{high temperatures}} to form solid, liquid and <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants.</b> A {{study showed that}} the products were about 40–50 wt.% liquid, 14–16 wt.% gases, while 34–43 wt.% remained as solid residue. Liquid products contained mainly phenol derivatives (∼75wt.%) and bisphenol (∼10wt.%) also present. Therefore, burning of these discs is also not a viable method of disposal.|$|E
50|$|High gas {{velocities}} {{through these}} devices reduce the gas-liquid contact time, thus reducing absorption efficiency.

50|$|Heterogeneous {{catalysis}} has {{the catalyst}} {{in a different}} phase from the reactants. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a discipline which includes a large variety of reactions: mild or total oxidations, dehydrogenation, hydrogen transfer, 18O2-16O2 and deuterium-alkane isotopic exchange, metal deposition, water detoxification, <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> removal, etc.|$|R

25|$|Incineration {{is carried}} out both {{on a small scale}} by {{individuals}} and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain hazardous waste materials (such as biological medical waste). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{test program}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of four flame stabilizer designs on the performance and <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> levels of an experimental full-annular swirl-can combustor. Combustor operating parameters, including inlet-air temperature, reference velocity, and fuel-air ratio, were set to simulate conditions in a 30 : 1 pressure ratio engine. Combustor inlet total pressure was held constant at 6 atm due to the facility limit. Combustor performance and <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> levels were strongly affected by the geometry and resulting total pressure loss of the four flame stabilizer designs investigated. The addition of shrouds to two designs produced an 18 to 22 % decrease in the combustion chamber pressure loss and thus resulted in doubling the exit temperature pattern factor and up to 42 % higher levels of oxides of nitrogen. A previously developed oxides of nitrogen correlating parameter agreed with each model within an emission index of plus or minus 1 but was not capable of correlating all models together...|$|R
40|$|A gas {{sampling}} probe and traversing mechanism {{were developed to}} obtain detailed measurements of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentrations in the primary and mixing regions of combustors {{in order to better}} understand how pollutants are formed. The {{gas sampling}} probe was actuated by a three-degree-of-freedom traversing mechanism and the samples obtained were analyzed by an on-line gas analysis system. The pollutants in the flame zone of two different swirl-can combustor modules were measured at an inlet-air temperature of 590 K, pressure of 6 atmospheres, and reference velocities of 23 and 30 meters per second at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 02. Typical results show large spatial gradients in the <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentration close to the swirl-can module. Average concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide decrease rapidly in the downstream wake regions of each module. By careful and detailed probing, the effect of various module design features on pollutant formation can be assessed. The techniques presently developed seem adequate to obtain the desired information...|$|R

30|$|Density is a {{property}} that can indicate the contamination degree of biodiesel. High biodiesel density can increase fuel consumption and generate higher amounts of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions and particulate {{matter to the}} atmosphere. Also, the biodiesel density is an important parameter for storage and transportation as it can vary the fuel volume with varying temperature at a given pressure. The biodiesel viscosity must be minimized to avoid reduced engine power due to difficult flow through the filters and injectors of the fuel system. The biodiesel density and viscosity were determined according to ASTM D 7042 - 12 standard.|$|R

A possible scenario of the power system composition is considered including an assumed scenario for electricity export.

Two types of the genetic algorithm are used for optimization. The unit commitment and generation dispatch are solved {{as part of the}} power generation scheduling problem.

40|$|The {{computer}} model {{presented in this}} paper is designed to estimate the uptake of air pollutants by forests. The model utilizes submodels to describe atmospheric diffusion immediately above and within the canopy, and into the sink areas within or on the trees. The program implementing the model is general and can be used with only minor changes for any <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant.</b> To illustrate the utility of the model, estimates are made of the sink strength of forests for sulfur dioxide. The results agree with experimentally derived estimates of sulfur dioxide uptake in crops and forest trees. (auth...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{necessary}} to identify a <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> source rapidly so that prompt actions can be taken, {{but this is one}} of the difficulties in the inverse problem areas. In this paper, an approach to identifying a sudden continuous emission pollutant source based on single sensor information is developed to locate a source in an enclosed space with a steady velocity field. Because the gravity has a very important influence on the <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> transport and the source identification, its influence is analyzed theoretically and a conclusion is drawn that the velocity of fluid is a key factor to effectively help weaken the gravitational influence. Further studies for a given 2 -D case by using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method show that when the velocity of inlet is less than one certain value, the influence of gravity on the pollutant transport is very significant, which will change the velocity field obviously. In order to quantitatively judge the practical applicability of identification approach, a synergy degree of the velocity fields before and after a source appearing is proposed as a condition for considering the influence of gravity. An experimental device simulating pollutant transmission was set up and some experiments were conducted to verify the practical application of the above studies in the actual gravitational environment. The results show that the proposed approach can successfully locate the sudden constant source when the experimental situations meet the identified conditions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA process {{coupling}} {{absorption of}} a <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> in an organic phase and biodegradation {{was considered to}} treat hydrophobic volatile organic compounds (VOC). The purpose of this work was to choose the best solvent for the absorption of some VOC (dimethylsulfide, dimethyldisulfide, and toluene) and to examine solvent biodegradability as well as VOC biodegradation by activated sludge. Some experiments were carried out on some selected solvents leading to select di- 2 -ethylhexyl-adipate (DEHA) and poly-di-methyl-siloxane (PDMS) for their high absorption capacity. Biodegradation experiments showed that toluene and DMDS can be removed in solvent on water emulsions, while DMS removal by biodegradation remains to confirm owing to its high volatility. However, experiments showed DEHA biodegradation, contrarily to PDMS which was therefore selected for subsequent experiments...|$|R
