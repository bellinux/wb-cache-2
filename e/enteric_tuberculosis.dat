40|$|The authors reports two {{patients}} with operated from <b>enteric</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Tuberculosis involving the intestinal tract {{may be due}} to either Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. bovis. In the former situation, the disease is primary to the lungs and is carried to the intestinal tract by swallowing sputum. The latter organism produces infection associated with swallowed nonpasteurized milk. This condition is extremely unusual in most western countries, since pasteurization of milk is standardized. The diagnosis was performed through laparotomy because of symptoms suggestive of intestine obstruction. Inflammatory reactions were observed on the small intestine (jejunum-ileum) in both cases. The presence of tuberculosis of the lungs was observed in one patient. The chemotherapic treatment was estabilished after the histopathologic diagnosis. The distinction between tuberculosis and Crohn's disease may not be possible by radiography or endoscopy. Videolaparoscopy {{has been found to be}} an useful procedure for the early diagnosis of <b>Enteric</b> <b>Tuberculosis.</b> In spite of the epidemiology knowledge, clinical control and improvement in treatment, extra pulmonary tuberculosis rate from concealed focus has been increased, due to AIDS poverty in certain populational groups and immigration from Asia to wertern countries. Compared with immunocompetent patients, the proportion of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is much higher in patients with AIDS, justfying the increased frequency of reports of intestinal tuberculosis in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculous liver abscess is a {{rare disease}} entity even in endemic areas of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is usually {{accompanied}} by pulmonary tuberculosis or <b>enteric</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Further, an isolated tuberculous liver abscess is extremely rare. The disease is diagnosed by laparotomy or postmortem autopsy in most cases, and some authors adopted a 9 -month antituberculosis regimen. We herein report a case of an isolated tuberculous liver abscess that initially manifested as persistent fever and general malaise, which was diagnosed by liver biopsy and treated successfully with a 6 -month antituberculosis regimen and percutaneous abscess drainage...|$|E
40|$|On June 14 - 19, 2015, the IUPHAR Section of Immunopharmacology and the Cuban Society of Pharmacology, {{together}} with the Latin- American Association of Pharmacology (ALF), Finlay Vaccine Institute and other prestigious Cuban scientific institutions, organized the Congress VACCIPHARMA 2015 (3 rd International Congress on Pharmacology of Vaccines), held {{as part of the}} First International Convention IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY–VACCIPHARMA 2015 (Meliá Marina Varadero Hotel, in Varadero beach, Cuba) VACCIPHARMA 2015 was organised into two large Workshops, addressing topics related to the research, development, clinical evaluation, production and quality control of Therapeutic and Prophylactic Vaccines, respectively. At the same time the Workshop on Prophylactic Vaccines was integrated by several Symposiums, focused on meningococcal, pneumococcal, <b>enteric,</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> and pertussis vaccines. About 250 delegates, including 100 international researchers from 15 countries, attended this meeting. The Congress had a remarkable Opening Session, with a Key Lecture given by the outstanding scientist Professor Dr. Shiv Pillai (United States of America), who talked about the changing views in the field of the immunology of vaccination and the challenges ahead. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the main topics discussed in the Prophylactic Vaccines Workshop, not as a complete narration of the events, but to provide an update of the latest state of the art and methodologies being applied to prophylactic vaccines with an expert commentary on the invited speakers...|$|E

50|$|The {{first full}} Professor of Pathology, Georges Dreyer, a Dane, was {{appointed}} in 1907 and remained in post {{until he died}} in 1934. He had a mathematical bent and carried {{out some of the}} earliest quantitative assays on immunological reactions to infection. His special interest was in the immunology of <b>enteric</b> infections and <b>tuberculosis</b> and he was deeply involved in efforts to produce vaccines for these diseases. He was responsible for the design and manufacture of the earliest oxygen masks worn by pilots in WWI.|$|R
50|$|The International Congress on Infectious Diseases (ICID) was {{established}} in 1983 as a scientific assembly for the exchange of research and clinical information of infectious diseases. The ICID takes place every {{two years in a}} different region of the world to ensure the meeting is accessible to all persons interested in attending. The congress is committed to assisting colleagues from low-resource countries, and draws physicians and microbiologists from a range of backgrounds and countries. Approximately 2,500 clinicians, researchers, academics, public health practitioners, experts and leaders from over 100 countries attend these meetings. Attendees are updated concerning advances and challenges in the area of HIV, respiratory infections including pneumonia and <b>tuberculosis,</b> <b>enteric</b> infections, emerging infectious diseases, diagnostic advances, infection control, antimicrobial resistance, malaria, and neglected infectious diseases. Congress events include plenary speakers, symposia, meet-the-expert and poster sessions, all of which provide a platform to network, exchange research findings, and collaborate on problem-solving strategies in the area of global infectious diseases.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Ileal {{perforation}} peritonitis is {{a common}} surgical emergency in the Indian subcontinent and in tropical countries. It is reported to constitute the fifth common cause of abdominal emergencies due to high incidence of <b>enteric</b> fever and <b>tuberculosis</b> in these regions. Methods. Sixty proven cases of ileal perforation patients admitted to Surgical Emergency were taken up for emergency surgery. Randomisation was done by senior surgeons by picking up card from both the groups. The surgical management was done as primary repair (group A) and loop ileostomy (group B). Results. An increased rate of postoperative complications was seen in group A when compared with group B with 6 (20 %) patients landed up in peritonitis secondary to leakage from primary repair requiring reoperation as compared to 2 (6. 67 %) in ileostomy closure. A ratio of 1 [*]:[*] 1. 51 days was observed between hospital stay of group A to group B. Conclusion. In cases of ileal perforation temporary defunctioning loop ileostomy plays an important role. We recommend that defunctioning ileostomy should be preferred over other surgical options in cases of ileal perforations. It should be recommended that ileostomy in these cases is only temporary and the extra cost and cost of management are not more than the price of life...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDAfter {{suffering}} {{almost total}} collapse. Rwanda has made impressive post-genocide progress. Many children of school going age are now attending school, but regrettably, only half complete primary school. High numbers of orphans, disabled {{children and a}} growing number of children from child-headed households still suffer the consequences of the poverty inherited from the past. Health problems include HIV/Aids, STIs, malaria, <b>tuberculosis,</b> <b>enteric</b> diseases, mental health problems, hunger and malnutrition. Use of drugs and substance abuse, unwanted pregnancies, lack of support services, unavailability of teaching and learning materials, inflexible curricula and poor teaching methodologies also contribute to learning breakdown. It is against this background that this thesis was conducted to investigate the development of a health-promoting schools model to provide an appropriate strategy to address barriers to learning and to promote healthy development of school children in Rwanda. Two research questions were the focus of this research, first, how does a health-promoting schools model provide an appropriate strategy to address barriers to learning and to promote healthy development of school-aged children in Rwanda and second, what are the participants’ views on and understanding of the model and its potential use in their schools? A mixed methods research design that employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches was used. The study followed sequential implementation: Phase 1 was concerned with the identification of the components for the model. It was a case study of four schools, two rural schools and two urban schools in Kigali City. The sample included 60 teachers, pupils, principals and parents from schools and nine key informants who were policymakers from the Ministries of Education and Health and Social Welfare, line institutions and the UNICEF. Data collection strategies included focus group discussions, semi-structured, in-depth individual interviews, a transect walk and observations. Data analysis was through content analysis. Eight themes emerged out of the data: school leadership and management; school health policies; pupil wellbeing; school partnership with parents, families and local communities; school health services; factors affecting teaching and learning for all children; teacher wellbeing; and a healthy physical school environment. These themes became the components that informed the development of a health-promoting schools model. In Phase 2, the degree of understanding of this proposed model and its components were investigated in each school community...|$|R
