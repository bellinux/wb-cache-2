40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Business Science-Financial Economics at Strathmore UniversityOne {{of the most important}} measures of efficiency of any tax system in public finance is tax buoyancy which is simply the total response of tax revenue to changes in national income. Tax revenue in Africa have been relatively low on average as a percentage of GDP. Since buoyancy echoes the capacity of a tax structure to generate revenues during economic growth, in this study an attempt was made to estimate the buoyancies of income tax, value added tax, import tax, excise tax and total tax revenues in using annual data from 1972 to 2014 in the largest economies in the eastern and southern parts of Africa. It applies the error correction model to measure the short run <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> buoyancy, the long run <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> buoyancy and the level of convergence between the short run estimate and the long run estimate.

Following Revenue Agency suggestions, we use in a VECM the time series of the concealed VAT base {{as a proxy for}} the size of “unreported production”, and define a regular GDP measure constructed as GDP net of government expenditure and evaded VAT base. The results reveal that we cannot rely upon the estimates of fiscal policy multipliers in countries with a sizeable unreported production unless the dynamics of the hidden and regular components of the GDP are disentangled. Changes in public spending and the tax rate generate a reallocation from underground to the regular economy which contributes to obscure the spending and tax effect on total GDP. In this setup the spending multiplier shows large long-run effects, considerably stronger than those registered in a model with no attention paid to unreported production. The drop in regular output, after an increase in the effective tax rate, tends to be considerable after one year, producing long-lasting effects and a significant increase in unreported production and tax evasion. fiscal policy, VECM, fiscal multipliers, unreported GDP, tax ratio, effective tax rate...|$|E

From a practical perspective, {{more and more}} traditional industrial clusters cooperate with Alibaba and other Internet leading enterprises to carry out training of transformation and upgrading by e-business, build e-business service system, and strive to build virtual e-business clusters. In 2016, the initial <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> contribution generated by Alibaba group and the Ant Financial Gruop’s upstream production and wholesale increments and logistics increments increased by over 200 billion yuan. The development of virtual agglomeration has promoted the vertical division of labor between upstream and downstream professional sectors, {{as well as the}} horizontal division between the professional departments in the production chain, thereby increasing the roundabout degree of production and the degree of professional diversification. It can be seen that the development of the virtual cluster of e-business may be an effective way to cultivate new industries and to realize the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries. Different from the local fission in the traditional cluster entrepreneurship conduction and the expansion {{of the relationship between the}} upstream and downstream of the industrial chain, in fact, the virtual industry cluster of e-business is no longer binding on the association of upstream and downstream enterprises in a single industry, but the e-business enterprise itself and the organic integration of all kinds of manufacturing, supporting, and service enterprises around its business on the Internet platform. David [1] pointed out that the loose network relationships of open innovation and structures in the cluster provide a new activity environment for innovation, and dynamic multiple network relationships make innovation and imitation easier to happen. Thor and Sylvie [2] believed that cluster networks have promoted innovation and imitation, even a new enterprise. Therefore, the formation and development of virtual e-business industry cluster is closely related to the particularity of the conduction of entrepreneurship.|$|E

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{momentum}} of the "devolution" movement has slowed, federal intergovernmental grants will probably be cut substantially during the next five to ten years. Federal tax reform could further erode federal assistance by eliminating the deduction for state and local personal income and property taxes.

In the language of economics, deductibility reduces the marginal "tax price" of state and local public goods.

After {{a decade}} of high growth, all segments of the Russian economy are experiencing a slowdown caused by the global financial crisis. To boost growth and living standards, {{and to ensure that}} Russia emerges from this global crisis, the need for a correct and comprehensive economic policy response is of high importance these days. This dissertation addresses two important economic issues in Russia: tax evasion and tariff reform. Though these topics have been studied intensively over the last century, there have been only a few attempts made in the economics field that give a direct <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> evasion and tariff elimination for the Russian economy. The primary reason for preventing a direct estimate is a lack of reliable and representative data. This dissertation uses the most recent industry data from Russia not previous used and provides a theoretical and quantitative analysis of tax compliance and tariff reform in Russia. The first chapter of this dissertation starts with an assessment of the role of taxation as a macroeconomic tool. It then reviews the problematic issues facing the tax system of developing countries such as tax evasion and tariff liberalization. The second chapter explores tax compliance behavior of companies in Russia. I develop a static industry model of tax evasion with heterogeneous producers to investigate the key determinants that give rise to tax evasion in Russia. Assuming that the probability of detection depends on the level of production, the model explains why small firms evade taxes. My quantitative experiments allow me to estimate how much the model economy gains if the tax burden, penalties, and probability of detection were changed. The third chapter discusses potential effects of trade liberalization on the Russian economy. I construct a static applied general equilibrium model and perform a series of numerical experiments, such as a partial and complete tariff elimination scenario. I construct a social accounting matrix for 2003 for Russia. I find that tariff elimination reform has a positive effect in terms of trade diversification, but a negative effect in terms of consumer and social welfare...|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of the underground economy in this work is a legal economic activity that is not reported {{for the purpose of}} avoiding the payment of taxation; the tax defaulter thus increasing his own personal benefit. Tax evasion is an unlawful manner of reducing the tax liability: for example, underreporting the income made or by stating inflated business deductions. In the case of tax avoidance, however, the taxpayer simply makes use of the opportunities provided in the law for the reduction of his or her tax liability. The consequence of an increase in evasion is the erosion of the tax base. A shortfall in revenue collected will result in a deficit that can be financed either by a further increase in taxation, which ultimately deepens the size of the underground economy and the inclination to evasion, or by borrowing, placing an extra burden on future taxpayers. The stability of the tax system {{is an important factor in}} the reduction of tax evasion. The transitional environment, however, with its dynamics and a number of changes in the tax and economic systems has a negative effect on a reduction in the extent of tax evasion. In the environment of the adjustment of taxation systems to the market economy, the broadening of the tax base, the introduction of new and the abolition of old taxes and of changes in the tax rates, it is hard to make reliable conclusions about the extent of tax evasion. Through a separate analysis of the evasion of some direct and indirect taxes for the 1994 - 2000 period, two estimates have been obtained: the lower <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> evasion, which approximately follows the trend in the underground economy (UE) as a percentage of GDP, and ranges about 5. 5 % of GDP; and the upper estimate, which partially follows the trend in the overall tax burden of the economy, and was considerably reduced after 1998 with a reduction of the payroll taxes, that ranges from about 11 to about 7. 5 % of GDP in 2000. A decision to resort to evasion is very easily taken in an unstable environment, while for an irreversible process, though promising, tax defaulters need a critical mass of positive reforms and a relatively long period of time. tax evasion, tax avoidance...|$|E
40|$|In a very {{influential}} paper, Piketty (2011) finds that inherited wealth is of increasing importance in France. He describes a U-shaped {{pattern in the}} long-run development of inheritance flows. Two driving factors in this development are the relative ratio of wealth of the deceased to wealth of the living, and the wealth-income ratio. In periods with high economic growth, wealth {{of the past is}} weakened and inheritances as share of national income decreases. As soon as growth declines, however, the wealth inherited from one s parents and grandparents strengthens its significance and may end up dominating new wealth. This thesis concludes that Norway seems to be a European outsider also {{when it comes to the}} importance of inheritances. Whereas France and the UK have experienced sharply increasing inheritance flows over the past decades and are facing ratios of inheritances to national income between 8 and 15 percent, the inheritance flow in Norway from 1998 - 2012 is stable at a much lower level. Using the official inheritance tax register, the flow is around 1 percent. The official inheritance register is not reliable, however. Since only tax liable transfers are registered, a large amount of inheritances are excluded from the tax records. In addition, the thresholds for exemptions and tax rates have been altered over the period so that the inheritance data from year to year are not comparable. Using register data including also tax exempt transfers, the inheritance flow increases slightly. Adjusting the inheritance flow by an <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance found by investigating the development of wealth and wealth assets during the last period of life yields an inheritance flow between 1, 5 and 2 percent. Piketty's way of estimating the inheritance-income ratio is used as an upper bound of tax avoidance. Combining a slightly decreasing mortality rate, an increasing wealth-income ratio and a stable wealth of the deceased to wealth of the living ratio results in an estimated Norwegian inheritance flow around 3, 5 percent. Even if there does not seem to be an increase in the Norwegian inheritance flow from 1998 to 2012, this does not mean that the long-run development is stable. Applying the r > g logic, an important reason for Norway s rather unique position in the European context is that the country has maintained income growth during a period where most other countries have suffered from a recession. If this growth comes to a halt or declines, one cannot exclude the possibility of increasing inheritance flows also here...|$|E

40|$|In many {{countries}} fiscal decentralization characterizes {{the relationship among}} different levels of government. In those countries, local authorities have the prerogative to tax their constituencies. However, fiscal decentralization is seldom balanced in terms of tax and expenditure assignments. In order to equalize tax capacities, to internalize spillovers or to achieve national policy objectives, central governments often provide transfers to lower levels of government. These transfers may affect the incentives to manage or to improve fiscal performance. Specifically, according to Litvack, Ahmad and Bird (1998), such transfers may induce low `tax effort' in the regions. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate theoretically and empirically this relationship between intergovernmental transfers and local tax effort. An initial problem to deal with is the definition of `tax effort' in itself. First, one can associate tax effort to high tax rates. Smart (1998) asserted that such association is inadequate. Second, one can measure tax effort using actual tax revenues or the difference between actual the predicted value of tax revenues. This approach has been mainly adopted by the empirical literature on the relationship between intergovernmental transfers and local tax effort [Baretti, Huber and Lichtblau (2000), Von Hagen and Hepp (2000), Jha, Mohanty, Chattergee and Chitkara (1999), Sagbas (2001) ]. Although tax revenue is an accurate and observable variable, still one can hardly say that it is a good <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> effort. The reason is for a given region in a given time period tax revenue is affected by many potential variables outside the control of local governments (like idiosyncratic shocks to some specific tax bases) which are seldom well controlled for in estimates of tax capacity. In practice local tax effort encompasses a broad set of actions. One of them is clearly the battle against tax evasion. In spite of its importance, this problem has been only recently addressed by the local public finance literature. Bordignon, Manasse and Tabellini (1996), presented a model where a local government exerts costless effort to catch tax evader workers and they showed how intergovernmental transfers affect tax enforcement. The drawback of this model is that, in reality, tax enforcement is not costless and the cost depends upon other variables chosen by local authorities, like the efficiency of the local tax administration. Although Prud'homme (1995) and Tanzi (1996) have informally signaled the possible inefficiencies of the local tax administrations, this feature has not been raised by the theoretical or the empirical literature. The {{purpose of this paper is}} precisely to incorporate such dimension in the assessment of the relationship between intergovernmental transfers and local tax effort. The theoretical framework assumes that in each region there is one representative habitant and a local government. The habitant posses a low or a high-valued property. The local government maximizes tax revenues. In a first period, the local government invests resources to improve the efficiency of the tax administration or to lobby the central government in order to obtain discretionary transfers. This decision is affected by the political cost of reforming the tax administration and on the ability of the local government to negotiate with the central government. Thus, in our model, intergovernmental transfers are endogenous and simultaneously determined with the reform of the local tax system. In a second period, the local government sets the property tax schedule. But, as the local government is unable to observe the value of the property, it has to rely on the habitant announcing this value. Finally, in the third period, the local government decides to enforce the tax law by randomly auditing such announcement. If the habitant is discovered having misreported, the local government sets the corresponding property tax and imposes a penalty. We assume that audit is perfect but costly; the cost depending on the efficiency of the local tax administration. We solve the model backwards. As the local government cannot commit to the auditing probability when it designs its tax policy, the equilibrium of the audit-report game is in mixed strategies, with auditing and tax evasion. Then we find the optimal tax schedule. In order to reduce the stake for tax evasion, the local government distorts downwardly the high-valued property tax. Finally, we solve for the decision of the local government regarding how much resources to invest for improving the efficiency of the tax administration. We find that this decision is negatively associated with the domestic political costs and positively with the ability to negotiate with the Federal Government. The predictions of the model are empirically tested using data for Argentina. The theory suggests a two-step approach. In a first stage we run a probit estimation where the probability of a certain province to reform its tax system (or receiving discretionary transfers) in a given year will be correlated with domestic political variables (e. g. divided government) and also with variables describing its bargaining power vis a vis the federal authorities (e. g. political representation at the National Congress, political party of the President vis a vis that of the Governor). In a second stage, we include this exogenous instrument of tax reform in a regression where the evolution of actual provincial tax receipts are regressed against this variable plus other controls like population, density, provincial income distribution and production structure. Notice that this two stage empirical approach allow us to deal with a frequent problem encountered in the empirical literature given by the endogeneity bias affecting some of the variables of interest, like federal transfers (e. g. Jha, Mohanty, Chattergee and Chitkara (1999), Sagbas (2001)). local tax effort - discretionary transfers - tax enforcement...|$|E

This paper outlines a conceptual framework for exploring {{the conditions under which}} investable tax credits may be the most effective mechanism to deliver a production subsidy and discusses the desirability <b>of</b> employing investable <b>tax</b> credits in other policy domains. <b>Estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> expenditures under this program are provided and efficiency costs, distributional issues, and the likely effects <b>of</b> reforms to <b>tax</b> provisions such as the AMT are considered. ...|$|R

In {{the first part of}} the text, the term "tax evasion " is defined. In the second part of the paper, direct and indirect methods <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> the <b>tax</b> gap are explained with the references to studies and reports where these methods are used. These methods include in particular tax audits and the so called "top-down " methods using the discrepancy between the data from two sources. Furthermore, the article reviews the existing papers and studies quantifying the tax gap in various countries and years. The data on VAT gap in 24 European countries in the years 1993 to 2006 are summarised in a table. The <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> VAT gap produced in two studies are compared and the differences between them analysed. Finally there are recommendations regarding the suitable methods <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> the <b>tax</b> gaps for the VAT, income tax and excise duty...|$|R
