The method avoids uncontrolled contamination, resulting in better reproducibility of the films.

40|$|The {{gas phase}} {{synthesis}} of nanosized titania powders was experimentally investigated by oxidation of titanium tetrachloride in an induction plasma reactor. The product titania particle size {{as well as}} their phase composition were controlled mainly by the relative amounts of oxygen to TiCl[indice inférieur 4] in the flame, the nature and the rate of the quenching gas. Spherical particle morphology was predominant in the powders produced with a mean particle diameter in the range of 10 to 100 nm. The rote of silica as dopant in the formation of ultra-fine titania was also studied in the induction plasma reactor. Titania was produced by the <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> <b>oxidation</b> of TiCl[indice inférieur 4] in the presence of dopant silicon tetrachloride vapour. The presence of silica decreased the particle sizes of the produced powders and increased their specific surface area. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) showed retardation in the phase transformation from anatase to rutile in the presence of silica doping of the powder. The effects of different amount of silica dopants on titania phase composition and particle size are presented. An evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of powders produced was evaluated for the destruction of phenol in water. This application is important in wastewater treatment. The results of the tests are compared with commercially available ultra-fine titania powders, Degussa P 25. The powders obtained with a higher TiCl[indice inférieur 4] flow rate showed higher photoactiviy than those produced at lower TiCl[indice inférieur 4] flow rates, for the same plate power...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Use of {{essential}} oils for controlling Candida albicans growth has gained significance {{due to the}} resistance acquired by pathogens towards a number of widely-used drugs. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the antifungal activity of selected essential oils against Candida albicans in liquid and <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> and to determine the chemical composition and mechanism of action of most potent essential oil. Methods Minimum Inhibitory concentration (MIC) of different essential oils in liquid phase, assayed through agar plate dilution, broth dilution & 96 -well micro plate dilution method and <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> activity evaluated through disc volatilization method. Reduction of C. albicans cells with vapour exposure was estimated by kill time assay. Morphological alteration in treated/untreated C. albicans cells was observed by the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) /Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and chemical analysis of the strongest antifungal agent/essential oil has been done by GC, GC-MS. Results Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus) essential oil exhibited the strongest antifungal effect followed by mentha (Mentha piperita) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) essential oil. The MIC of lemon grass essential oil in liquid phase (288 mg/l) was significantly higher than that in the <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> (32. 7 mg/l) and a 4 h exposure was sufficient to cause 100 % loss in viability of C. albicans cells. SEM/AFM of C. albicans cells treated with lemon grass essential oil at MIC level in liquid and <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> showed prominent shrinkage and partial degradation, respectively, confirming higher efficacy of <b>vapour</b> <b>phase.</b> GC-MS analysis revealed that lemon grass essential oil was dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes (78. 2 %); α-citral or geranial (36. 2 %) and β-citral or neral (26. 5 %), monoterpene hydrocarbons (7. 9 %) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (3. 8 %). Conclusion Lemon grass essential oil is highly effective in <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> against C. albicans, leading to deleterious morphological changes in cellular structures and cell surface alterations. </p...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} is to compare quality of <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> {{reflowed}} solder joints soldered on different printed circuit board (PCB) surface finishes. <b>Vapour</b> <b>phase</b> reflow soldering guarantees the highest reliability, quality of processing and process safety. The big advantage of heat transfer in <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> soldering (VPS) is the extremely efficient transfer of latent heat through the condensing vapour of a chemically inert liquid. The heat transfer process is about ten times faster than hot air and about eight times faster than infra red heat. The condensation mediums used are perfluorocarbon, perflouropolyeter, flouriertes phenandren or perflouramin liquids, which are clear and colourless, have no odour, no taste, are non-flammable, non-corrosive and non-ozone depleting. For lead free soldering a boiling point of 230 °C of these liquids is recommended. The temperature of any saturated vapour cannot exceed the temperature of the boiling liquid, therefore the temperature of the PCBs and components can never be higher than that of the vapour in the machine. As the liquid boils, a layer of saturated vapour forms above the fluid creating a 100 % inert atmosphere – it allows use of less aggressive flux than in other forms of reflow. The reflow in inert gas atmosphere defines an own unique standard. As there is no danger of overheating, {{there is no need to}} set temperature profiles. <b>Vapour</b> <b>phase</b> provides probably the best possible solder reflow conditions with only minimal temperature differences across the PCB. <b>Vapour</b> <b>phase</b> is independent of size, shape or geometry with the maximum surface area exposed and every component part seeing precisely the same temperature.
