40|$|Not So) Still Life {{presents}} novel {{ways that}} contemporary artists are transforming the still life genre {{to engage with}} current culture. As a subject, the still life gained popularity in the Early Renaissance {{as an alternative to}} landscape, portraiture or religious subjects. Compositions of natural and inanimate objects were often presented with allegorical connotations. Today, artists are creating new variations by working in photography and sculpture to conflate interior space with landscape, or by using video and animation to convey still life in motion. Several artists will be creating new works that respond to the domestic interior of Glyndor Gallery, once a private home. Artists include Adam Brent, <b>Elizabeth</b> Bryant, Nicole <b>Cohen,</b> Ori Gersht, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, Sue Johnson, Laura Letinsky, Beth Lipman, Erin O’Keefe, Donna Sharrett, Nicolas Touron, Michael Vahrenwald, Rodrigo Valenzuela and Alex Verhaest.

5000|$|Special Agent <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Cohen</b> She is a {{beautiful}} African-American woman. Her along with her partner Special agent Nathan aka Nate, have been pursuing Conrad alias Redmond {{for a number of}} years. She is deceived by Audrey, to get her to Italy, so she can convince the Italian police to raid The Italian Mafia safehouse. She is not aware she is a pawn to get Conrad's team in to rob the paintings. She is held at gunpoint by The Italian Mafia's insider Captain Velenti. Conrad manages to save her only to be arrested. As she is interrogating Conrad with much anger for being used as a decoy, her boss Beverly Shannon walks in and tells her to leave. She states to Conrad that she will face disciplinary action, she is also under criminal investigation by the Italian police for killing one of their own. She is now described as a [...] "rogue agent pursuing a personal vendetta" [...] according to sources close to the case. She has been dismissed from the Bureau. For a couple of months she has been chain smoking, and drinking away her sorrows. After seeing a news report about her dramatic exit from the bureau, she has a moment of clarity and applies for a private investigator's license {{to make up for lost}} time, vowing to not let Redmond win.|$|E
5000|$|Lola He is {{the leader}} of a Mexican Cartel. He comes to San Diego to [...] "clean house" [...] after {{learning}} that the San Diego branch was dismantled by the F.B.I. which was under Cristo's management. This was due to Emma calling <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Cohen.</b> Lola is concerned that his men could be compromised and decides to take action. He has Augustus and Conrad kidnapped {{in the aftermath of the}} raid. With Augustus and Conrad captured, he kills his loyal men brutally in front of them. He proceeds to tell them that they have caused him much trouble. He blackmails Conrad by stating that if he doesn't receive ten million dollars in one month, he will murder the entire Paulson family. This leads Conrad to go to Arno to let him know that he is back on the Venice job. During the heist, Conrad reveals that they're going to make the Mafia think that the Cartel was responsible. In the aftermath of the heist, Arno has Lola meet with him at his mansion to pay the ten million on Conrad's behalf. It is then revealed that Arno gave up the whereabouts of Augustus all in an end-a-round to get Conrad to pull off the Venice job he had invested into three years ago. Arno questions Lola about an eyebrow on his keychain. The story of how it explains his name, is still a mystery.|$|E

It featured newly recorded and released songs, notably [...] "Words Don't Mean a Thing" [...] and [...] "We Got Love", {{as well as}} reworked and updated versions of many of her classic hits, plus two club mixes of [...] "Sugar Me" [...] and [...] "Getting a Drag". This was a CD-only release on the Music DeLuxe label. That year, she also released a single [...] "There's No Place Like London", her version of the song she had written for Shirley Bassey, featuring an all-star cast that included Frankie Vaughan, Patti Boulaye, Gareth Hunt, Kenny Lynch, Rula Lenska, Gwen Taylor, Lionel Blair, Lorraine Chase, Pam St. Clement, Harry Fowler, Polly James, Larry Adler, Rose Marie, Victor Spinetti, Gorden Kaye and the St Joan of Arc School Choir and credited to Lynsey & Friends. The song was the winning record for the LBC London Parade and it went on sale {{to raise money for}} the Variety Club. In an LBC radio programme, de Paul discussed how it came about and how it got its title. Lorraine Chase who sang on the track, also discussed her role. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Cohen</b> of Nonsuch High School and David Burditch of St Joan of Arc School in Rickmanshaw, described how their schools became involved in the recording.

50|$|Beverly Shannon She is a red-haired {{woman that}} is both Cohen and Nate's superior. She {{appears to be a}} cool and relaxed person, but when her temper flares up, she has a mouth like a sailor. She has a son named Micah. She is upset with Cohen for making a {{wrongful}} arrest on Conrad, for which the Bureau has to settle with Conrad for four million dollars, not to mention that she discovered that Cohen had gotten an unauthorized warrant to approach Conrad again. After Chase, Gardin, Chen, and Henry are released from holding due to Arno being part of the plan in stealing the heroin from the Feds, Beverly reprimands Cohen for going for Augustus Paulson without her permission, effectively relieving her of field duty. Cohen later goes to her based on a tip from her informant Emma, who is being held by Cristo's San Diego cartel. Bev states to Cohen that she out of second chances, and to be sure that she wants to gamble her career on this. This leads to the Feds rescuing Emma and shutting down the San Diego cartel. She flies to Venice immediately after finding out <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Cohen</b> followed Conrad, and killed Captain Velenti. She tells Elizabeth to leave the interrogation room. She speaks to Conrad explaining Cohen will face disciplinary action. She attempts to bribe Conrad with an expedited check for four million dollars from Cohen's previous wrongful arrest to keep quiet. Conrad responds to this by laughing in front of her face, knowing that he just pulled of the Venice job for millions, plus with this new harassment, he can sue to bureau for a lot more than the four million dollar settlement.|$|E

40|$|The Oregon Mathematics Leadership Institute (OMLI) project served 180 Oregon teachers, and 90 administrators, {{across the}} K- 12 grades from ten partner districts. OMLI offered a residential, three-week summer institute. Over {{the course of}} three {{consecutive}} summers, teachers were immersed {{in a total of}} six mathematics content classes– Algebra, Data 2 ̆ 6 Chance, Discrete Mathematics, Geometry, Measurement 2 ̆ 6 Change, and Number 2 ̆ 6 Operations—along with an annual collegial leadership course. Each content class was designed and taught by a team of expert faculty from universities, community colleges, and K- 12 districts. Each team chose a few “big ideas” on which to focus the course. For example, the Algebra team focused on algebraic structure and properties of the concept of a group, while the Data 2 ̆ 6 Chance team centered their activities on the exploration of ideas of central tendency and variation using statistics and data analysis software packages. The content in all of the courses was addressed through deep investigation of the mathematics of tasks that had been selected and adapted from resources for K- 12 mathematics classrooms. In addition to mathematics content, the courses were designed with specific attention to socio-mathematical norms, issues of status differences among learners, and the selection and implementation of group-worthy tasks for group work. The faculty attended sessions grounded in the work of <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Cohen</b> on strategies for working with heterogeneous groups of learners (Cohen, 1994; Cohen et al, 1999) which was central to the OMLI design and implementation. Institute faculty modeled these strategies in the Institute classrooms and made their moves as transparent as possible, so that the teachers would be able to grapple with these strategies during the Institute and plan for implementation in their own classrooms. The Data 2 ̆ 6 Chance course also modeled uses of technology in instruction using Tinkerplots. Generalization and justification were emphasized as mathematical ways of learning and knowing, and institute faculty conducted classroom discussions that intentionally modeled pushing for generalization and justification...|$|E
