5000|$|In {{the common}} law, <b>emblements</b> are annual crops {{produced}} by cultivation legally {{belonging to the}} tenant with the implied right for its harvest, and are treated as the tenant's property.|$|E
50|$|The {{doctrine}} chiefly {{comes into}} play in the law of landlord and tenant, or in the foreclosure of mortgages and other legal situations that place the rights of another party in contention with those of a farmer who has planted a crop yet to be harvested. In these situations, the doctrine of <b>emblements</b> operates to guarantee the farmer's right to reap and carry away the fruits of his labor even if he loses title to the land on which they are grown.|$|E
40|$|Professor Brown {{has written}} a book on those {{segments}} of the law which are traditionally grouped in the law schqol course under the heading, Personal Property. Here the author has treated problems connected with the original acquisition of property in things, the acquisition of property by finding, by adverse possession, by accession and confusion, by gift, by sale, and by judgment and its satisfaction.

Its main divisions and titles {{are those of the}} standard casebooks. There is an opening chapter (the least imaginative and least adequate of the book) on the nature of law, general definitions, and property classifications. This is followed by eight chapters on the acquisition and transfer of rights in personal property: original acquisition, finding, adverse possession, judgment and satisfaction of judgment, accession and confusion, gift (of chattels and of choses in action), sale (largely of the rights of the bona fide purchaser). Next come six chapters on questions arising 2 ̆ 2 when one person has a limited interest in the personal property of another: 2 ̆ 2 bailments (nature and distinctions, rights and duties, special types—including common carriers and innkeepers), liens (parties possessed and enforcement, transfer, and loss), and pledges. Two concluding chapters— 2 ̆ 2 chiefly the product of work of Professor Jacob H. Beuscher 2 ̆ 2 —are on topics 2 ̆ 2 athwart the fields of personal and real property: 2 ̆ 2 fixtures and <b>emblements...</b>|$|E
