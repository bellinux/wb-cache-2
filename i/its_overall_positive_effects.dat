ABSTRACT: This paper examined the impact of rural road connectivity and accessibility on farming activities in Akoko South-West Local Government Area of Ondo State. Using graph measurement analysis to determine the relationship between structure of transport network, flow of traffic {{to and from the}} hinterlands as well as to measure the accessibility of the routes within the study area. A grids of 20 km by 20 km were first superimposed on a larger-scale route map of the study area of scale 1 cm to represent 20 km. Thereafter, the length of the routes in each grid was measured and summed up and the answer was placed in the centre of each grid as the accessibility index for the concerned grids which was later subjected to the Beta index network analysis of Kansky (1964). The result obtained was B = 0. 98, this shows that road network is not well connected to support highly integrated farming activities in the study area. This does not only, has negative impact on food crop production but has seriously reduced the economic status of 'the rural farmers. The paper recommends that both state and local governments should attach much importance to the improvement of rural road network accessibility such that farm sites in different locations can be well connected for easy means of food passage and raw materials to the people and industries in urban centres as well as <b>its</b> <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on the rural famers in the study area...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of ambitious {{entrepreneurship}} (entrepreneurs expecting to grow their firm) and high-growth firms (firms that have actually realized high growth rates) on subsequent macroeconomic growth in a sample of high and low-income countries, in the period 2002 - 2005. Our empirical evidence shows that once we control for the share of ambitious entrepreneurs the <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> of entrepreneurship on macroeconomic growth disappears. Growthoriented entrepreneurship seems to contribute heavily to macroeconomic growth in both low- and high-income countries. In low-income countries, the <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> of entrepreneurship on macroeconomic growth does not disappear after introducing the share of ambitious entrepreneurs into the statistical model. In contrast to ambitious entrepreneurship in nascent and young businesses, established high-growth firms do not seem to contribute to macroeconomic growth. These established high-growth firms seem to flourish in countries with high levels of entrepreneurship in general, while {{there appears to be no}} connection between the rate of high-growth firms and the share of ambitious entrepreneurs. �...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of organic}} soil amendments, such as green manures, animal manures, composts or slurries, {{certainly}} has many advantageous aspects for soil quality and is suggested as a promising {{tool for the}} management of plant-parasitic nematodes. However, during a recent literature survey we also found numerous studies reporting an increase of plant-parasitic nematodes after the use of organic amendments. Therefore, we critically re-evaluated the usefulness of organic amendments for nematode management and suggest possible mechanisms for a stimulation of plant-parasitic nematodes, as well as mechanisms that might be causing a reduction of plant-parasitic nematodes. In addition, we also elucidate a possible mechanism that might be responsible for the observed <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> of organic amendments on crop yields. It is likely that a significant part of this is, inter alia, due to the proliferation of non-pathogenic, free-living nematodes and their <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on soil microbial populations, organic matter decomposition, nutrient availability, plant morphology and ecosystem stability...|$|R
40|$|The {{link between}} {{economic}} growth and natural hazards has long been studied {{to better understand the}} effects of natural hazards on local, regional, and country level growth patterns. However, relatively little generalizable research has focused on wildfires, {{one of the most common}} forest disturbances in the western United States (US). We examined the effect of large wildfires on employment growth across sectors and time in the western US. We matched wildfire occurrences from 2004 to 2008 and their duration with monthly employment data to identify the effect of wildfire on employment growth. Wildfires generally tended to exhibit <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on employment during the periods that suppression efforts were active. However, the <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> maskswinners and losers across sectors — such as natural resources and mining and leisure and hospitality, respectively. The <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> then transitioned to a negative drag on local employment growth for a period of up to two years following the wildfire. We explore reasons why some sectors win while others lose and explanations for the lingering effects of a large wildfire on the economy as a whole...|$|R

However, consistent with theories of banking arguing that competition may reduce the availability of credit to informationally opaque firms, it also finds that asymmetric information limits the <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> of bank competition on firm creation. Indeed, bank competition is less favorable to the emergence of new firms in industrial sectors where informational asymmetries are more important, and in extreme cases has a negative effect.

Furthermore, the impact of illiquidity on the credit crunch is stronger for less solvent banks.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the buffering {{effect of}} social support and relationships during the transition to unemployment in Germany. I distinguish two possible mechanisms. The first assumes that social support and closeness have an <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on life satisfaction (social undermining and distance in relationships – negative effect), and states that the networks respond to the transition to unemployment by providing more support and closeness, and by decreasing social undermining and distance. The second mechanism assumes that social support and closeness have an <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on life satisfaction, and states that this effect becomes even more positive during the transitions to unemployment. I use German Family Panel (pairfam) data, which contain 70 measures {{of social support}}, social undermining, closeness, and distance in relationships. I investigate the relationships with parents, partner, relatives and non-relatives networks, and estimate the effects separately for men and women, and for people experiencing the transition to unemployment from employment, from schooling, and from homemaking. I use the statistical method of first difference models, which is conceptually equivalent to fixed-effects models. The results support both mechanisms, {{but only for a}} limited number of support / relationship variables. The relationship that provides more support and less conflict in response to transition to unemployment is mainly the relationship with the partner. On the other hand, support and relationship with parents and socializing networks gain importance during the transition to unemployment...|$|R

40|$|This study {{challenges}} {{the idea that}} perceived employability boosts job performance: perceived employability may indirectly decrease employees’ performance through reduced affective organizational commitment. We define performance broadly in terms of task, helping, and creative behaviors. Results are based on cross-lagged structural equation modeling involving two-wave data from 791 Flemish (i. e., Dutch-speaking Belgian) employees. Perceived employability had a negative cross-lagged effect on commitment. In turn, commitment had a <b>positive</b> cross-lagged <b>effect</b> on all three components of job performance. The cross-lagged effect of perceived employability on performance was non-significant. Our results suggest that perceived employability could entail a ‘dark side’: it might decrease affective organizational commitment, which, in turn, may compromise job performance. This may defy earlier assumptions on the <b>overall</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> associated with perceived employability. status: publishe...|$|R
