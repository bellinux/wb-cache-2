25|$|Motor imagery {{involves}} {{the imagination of}} the movement of various body parts resulting in sensorimotor cortex activation, which modulates sensorimotor oscillations in the EEG. This can be detected by the BCI to infer a user's intent. Motor imagery typically requires a number of sessions of training before acceptable control of the BCI is acquired. These training sessions may take a number of hours over several days before users can consistently employ the technique with acceptable levels of precision. Regardless of the duration of the training session, users are unable to master the control scheme. This results in very slow pace of the gameplay. Advance machine learning methods were recently developed to compute a subject-specific model for detecting the performance of motor imagery.

Orthogonal <b>filter</b> <b>banks</b> {{are represented by}} paraunitary matrices in the polyphase domain. We define special paraunitary matrices as paraunitary matrices with unit determi-nant. We show that every paraunitary matrix can be characterized by a special paraunitary matrix and a phase factor. Therefore, the design of paraunitary matrices (and thus of orthogonal <b>filter</b> <b>banks)</b> becomes the design of special paraunitary matrices, which requires a smaller set of nonlinear equations. Moreover, we pro-vide a complete characterization of special paraunitary matrices in the Cayley domain, which converts nonlinear constraints into linear constraints.
