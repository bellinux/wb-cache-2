40|$|A 1 / 6 -scale {{model of}} the Republic XF- 12 {{vertical}} tail with stub fuselage, stub horizontal tail, and a <b>de-icing</b> <b>air</b> duct was tested in the Langley stability tunnel. The investigation consisted of {{a study of the}} effects of the duct, with and without air flow, on the aerodynamic characteristics of the model. The model tested was a revision of a model previously tested in the Langley stability tunnel. The revised model differed from the original model in that it incorporated a <b>de-icing</b> <b>air</b> duct, included a dorsal fin, and had a larger stub fuselage. A comparison of data obtained form tests of the original and revised models was made. The results of the investigation indicated that the air duct had very little effect on the aerodynamic characteristics of the model. A small change occurred in the variation of rudder hinge-moment coefficient with angle of attack but it is believed that this change can be corrected by a properly applied spring tab...|$|E
5000|$|Modified B-25C with {{insulated}} electrical coils mounted {{inside the}} wing and empennage leading edges {{to test the}} effectiveness as a de-icing system. The hot <b>air</b> <b>de-icing</b> system tested on the XB-25E {{was determined to be}} the more practical of the two. (Number made: 1, converted.) ...|$|R
2500|$|XB-26Dâ€”Modified B-26 {{used to test}} hot <b>air</b> <b>de-icing</b> equipment, {{in which}} heat {{exchangers}} transferred heat from engine exhaust to air circulated to the {{leading and trailing edges}} of the wing and empennage surfaces. This system, while promising, was not incorporated into any production aircraft made during World War II. (One converted) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} uses conventional hot <b>air</b> <b>de-icing</b> {{using engine}} bleed air. Its sea level {{is equivalent to}} 2,400 m (8,000 ft) {{above mean sea level}} and thereafter reducing to the equivalent of 2,400 m (8,000 ft) to cruise altitude. It was originally built with no automatic oxygen masks; emergency supply comprises hatrack-housed oxygen bottles and masks for manual distribution to passengers by cabin crew. Since 1997, most aircraft have been retrofitted with automatic oxygen supply systems with drop-down masks.|$|R
25|$|A {{series of}} {{improvements}} have been projected for the aircraft, {{such as the}} integration of an autopilot to enable single-pilot operations. Other prospective improvements include {{the adoption of a}} glass cockpit, <b>de-icing</b> equipment, and <b>air</b> conditioning systems. Early production aircraft are intended to be compatible with the retrofitting of these improvements later on. According to Dornier Seawings, the Seastar's flight endurance can be extended by cruising on only a single engine to around 11 flight hours for surveillance missions. It is also claimed that the Seastar is one of the fastest flying boats on the market.|$|R
5000|$|The American Elm {{cultivar}} Ulmus americana ''''American Liberty'''' {{is in fact}} a {{group of}} six genetically distinct cultivars under a single name, although they are superficially similar. The Liberty elm is reportedly suitable for street planting, being tolerant of <b>de-icing</b> salts and <b>air</b> pollution. However, examples included in 10-year trials at Atherton, California to evaluate replacements for Californian elms lost to disease did not perform well. The late Professor Eugene Smalley summarized 'American Liberty' as [...] "not as resistant as the Asian hybrids, but it still has the look of a classic American Elm" [...] http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DC163AF936A35751C1A96F948260&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=all ...|$|R
5000|$|Continental Airlines Flight 1713 was {{scheduled}} to depart Denver at 12:25, but many flights out of Denver that day were delayed by inclement weather. At 13:03, Flight 1713 taxied from its gate to the <b>de-icing</b> pad; <b>air</b> traffic controllers were not aware that Flight 1713 had departed the gate because the flight crew did so without requesting taxi clearance. De-icing was completed at 13:46. At 13:51, Flight 1713 contacted the clearance delivery controller for permission to [...] "taxi from the ice pad." [...] The clearance delivery controller, believing that Flight 1713 was still at the gate and requesting to proceed to deicing, instructed the flight to switch to ground controller frequency. Ground controllers then cleared Flight 1713 to taxi to the de-icing pad. Flight 1713, already at the de-ice pad, taxied from the pad to hold {{at the end of}} runway 35L and await takeoff clearance. At 14:05, Flight 1713 was lined up on the number one position {{at the north end of}} the runway, and the crew was ready for take off. After several minutes of holding without receiving takeoff clearance, Flight 1713 notified air traffic controllers that they were holding and awaiting takeoff instructions.|$|R
50|$|The XB-46's {{first flight}} {{occurred}} 2 April 1947 {{after a month}} of taxi testing, and lasted ninety minutes as the bomber departed the Convair plant in San Diego, California for Muroc Army Airfield in the high desert. The pilot praised its handling qualities. Basic flight testing took place for five months, and by September 1947 it was concluded after 127 hours aloft on 64 flights by both the Convair company and AAF test pilots. Stability and control were excellent but there were engineering problems with engine <b>de-icing,</b> the cabin <b>air</b> system, and vertical oscillations caused by harmonic resonance between the wing and spoilers. There was also concern regarding {{the ability of the}} three man crew to exit the aircraft in case of an emergency, since the exit plan relied on the pneumatic system to hold the main door open against the airstream. The aircraft was accepted on 7 November and delivered on 12 November 1947.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} done within the master program in energy systems {{engineering}} at Uppsala University and {{in cooperation with}} OX 2. The aim was to compare the operation and performance of three different de- and anti-icing systems for wind turbines during the winter 2014 / 2015. The systems evaluated were de-icing with heating resistances, <b>de-icing</b> with warm <b>air</b> and anti-icing with heating resistances. Inconsistency {{in the operation of}} the wind turbines and the systems as well as lack of information made it hard to compare the efficiencies of the systems. The systems showed tendencies to improve the production. Especially examples during single ice events where the systems increased the power output were found, but the examples also showed possible improvements regarding the size of the systems and the duration of the de-or anti-icing cycles. Based on the approximated gain in production, during the studied time period, none of the systems could be determined to be profitable. The gain in production does however not have to be especially large for the systems to become profitable, and the results could be very different in a year with more ice, higher electricity prices or a more consistent operation of the systems. Important characteristics of the systems were found to be the duration of a cycle, the energy required for the operation of the system and the trigger-point for activation of the system. Additional benefits like for instance decreased loads, risk for standstill and ice throws could also be provided by the system...|$|R
