He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E
25|$|Fai's {{real name}} is , and {{he was born with}} his {{identical}} twin brother, Fai, in Valeria Country. The birth of twins in the country was a bad omen, which led to many misfortunes upon the country. The king imprisoned them within a tower, just before he killed <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Eventually, Fei-Wang Reed appeared and offered to free one of them. Fai chose to save Yūi, resulting in Fai being thrown from the tower to his death, though Fei-Wang tampered with Yūi's memory to make him think that he chose his own life over Fai. Promising to return Fai to life if Yūi becomes his pawn, Fei-Wang bestowed two curses upon him. The curses are to kill whoever is a stronger magician than he is, and another curse will use his magic to collapse the world around them. He was soon found by Ashura-ō, who took in Yūi, having adopted the name Fai. Ashura conforted Fai, and gave him his tattoo to suppress the first curse. Fai eventually learned that Ashura's purpose was to be killed by Fai's first curse, as Ashura killed people in order to make his magic stronger.|$|E

After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of {{football}} and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a [...] "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." [...] Gary Lineker said, [...] "It is a sad day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." [...] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a [...] "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison. I can think of no more fitting epitaph." ...|$|E

The father of the Strauss family was a very {{successful}} businessman, who did well even <b>in</b> times when <b>everybody</b> else <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> was doing badly.

60|$|The {{fact that}} <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> {{man and woman}} alike, will be entitled, with {{scarcely}} any exception, to an old-age pension from the State {{at the age of}} seventy--that fact makes it ever so much cheaper to insure against invalidity or infirmity up to the age of seventy. And, with the various insurance schemes which are in preparation, {{we ought to be able}} to set up a complete ladder, an unbroken bridge or causeway, as it were, along which the whole body of the people may move with a certain assured measure of security and safety against hazards and misfortunes. Then, if provision can be arranged for widows and orphans who are left behind, that will be a powerful remedy against the sweating evil; for, as you know, these helpless people, who in every country find employment in particular trades, are unable to make any fair bargain for themselves, and their labour, and this consequently leads to the great evils which have very often been brought to the notice of Parliament. That, again, will fit in with the Anti-Sweating Bill we are passing through Parliament this year.|$|E
6000|$|I {{am amazed}} and I am amused when I {{read in the}} {{newspapers}} the silly and fantastic rumours which obtain credence, or at any rate currency, from day to day. One day {{we are told that}} it is the intention of the Government to seek a dissolution of Parliament before the Budget reaches the House of Lords--in other words, to kill the child to save its life. The next day we are told the Government have decided to have a referendum--that is to say, they will ask <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> to send them a postcard to say whether they would like the Budget to become law or not. Another day we are told that the Government are contemplating a bargain with the House of Lords to alter the Budget to please them, or that we should make a bargain with them that if they pass the Budget we should seek a dissolution in January. Why should we make a bargain with the House of Lords? Every one of those rumours is more silly, more idiotic, than the other. I wish our Conservative friends would face the facts of the situation. [...] "Things are what they are, and their consequences will be what they will be." [...] The House of Lords has no scrap of right to interfere in finance. If they do, they violate the Constitution, they shatter the finances, and they create an administrative breakdown the outcome of which no man can foresee. If such a situation should occur a Liberal Government can look only to the people. We count on you, and we shall come to you. If you sustain us we shall take effectual steps to prevent such a deadlock ever occurring again. That is the whole policy of his Majesty's Government--blunt, sober, obvious, and unflinching.|$|E
60|$|To own the truth, {{the peace}} found us all very poor, {{as was the}} case with almost <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> but a few {{contractors}}. It was not the contractors for the American army that were rich; they fared worse than most people; but the few who furnished supplies to the French did get silver in return for their advances. As for the army, it was disbanded without any reward but promises, and payment in a currency that depreciated so rapidly that men were glad to spend recklessly their hard-earned stock, lest it should become perfectly valueless in their hands. I have heard much in later years of the celebrated Newburgh letters, and of the want of patriotism that could lead to their having been written. It may not have been wise, considering the absolute want of the country, to have contemplated the alternative toward which those letters certainly cast an oblique glance, but there was nothing in either their execution or their drift which was not perfectly natural for the circumstances. It was quite right for Washington to act as he did in that crisis, though it is highly probable that even Washington would have felt and acted differently had he nothing but the keen sense of his neglected services, poverty, and forgetfulness before him in the perspective. As for the young officer who actually wrote the letters, it is probable that justice will never be done to any part of his conduct, but that which is connected with the elegance of his diction. It is very well for those who do not suffer to prate about patriotism; but a country is bound to be just, before it can lay a high moral claim to this exclusive devotedness to the interests of the majority. Fine words cost but little, and I acknowledge no great respect for those who manifest their integrity principally in phrases. This is said not in the way of personal apology, for our regiment did not happen to be at Newburgh at the disbandment; if it had, I think my father's influence would have kept us from joining the malcontents; but at the same time, I fancy his and my own patriotism would have been much strengthened by the knowledge that there were such places as Satanstoe, Lilacsbush, Mooseridge, and Ravensnest.

40|$|The role {{of energy}} in the Scottish economy is of crucial importance. As a basic input to {{industrial}} production it represents a major cost and indeed the price of energy was the key factor in the recent closure of the Invergordon aluminium smelter. Domestic consumption of various forms of energy are an important item of personal spending, particularly given the harshness of the climate. In addition, the energy industries are a major employer and the capital investments involved are substantial. The ubiquitous nature of 'energy' means that the policy decision influencing the supply and demand of energy will affect practically <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> This paper examines some of the issues surrounding energy policy within Scotland. The first section provides a background on recent trends in energy supply and demand; the second assesses the principal influences and problems related to energy forecasting.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the census {{was to determine the}} size of the population its composition and distribution, levels and trends of fertility, mortality, information on housing, economic activity and migration. This was the fourth census in the history of census undertaking in Zambia. The other three censuses were carried out in 1969, 1980 and 1990. This volume of the report is one in the series of volumes presenting the 2000 population census results. It presents an analysis of the housing situation and household characteristics of the population based on data collected from the entire household population. The census was preceded by a mapping exercise that was launched in 1998 for the purpose of updating the maps in readiness for the census. A pilot census was also conducted in order to test the data collection instruments and computer data capturing system. The 2000 census was using scannable questionnaires for the first time. Therefore, the procedures for collecting and entering data into the computer were completely new and inevitably required a pilot. A census of population is a massive and costly exercise involving nearly <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> The 2000 census operations were undertaken with the use of Grade 11 pupils as enumerators and primary school teachers as supervisors.

40|$|Skripsie (MEd (Onderwysbestuur)) [...] PU vir CHO, 1995 The apartheid-era which {{preceded the}} {{democratisation}} in South Africa {{was not only}} the cause of the crisis in black education but also of the crisis in education as a whole. The elections in April 1994 brought about a new government that promised equality for all in the country. The government identified education as one of the starting points for the Reconstruction and Development Programme. "Education and training is one of the central activities of our society. It is of vital interest to every family and the health of our national economy. The government's policy for education and training is therefore a matter of national importance second to none" (Professor Bengu). This statement by the minister of Education is indicative {{of the importance of the}} success of the new education system. Unless <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> has access to the same standard of education, the educationally deprived won't ever catch up to be useful to the national economy. In the beginning of 1995 schools started taking in children of all the cultural groups. The question that arises is whether these schools with their multi-cultural composition really cater for the children's needs according to the model of cultural pluralism? The study conducted proves the contrary. The headmaster who wishes to change his school from a mono- to a multi-cultural school will undoubtedly experience problems that he will find very daunting. The purpose of this study is to describe the management of change when a school changes from a mono-to a multi-cultural school. A field study has been conducted to determine whether there is a correlation between practice and literature. Recommendations have been made as to how this change process can be streamlined. These recommendations enable the headmaster who wants to implement change to work according to guidelines so that known pitfalls can be avoided. Master...|$|E
