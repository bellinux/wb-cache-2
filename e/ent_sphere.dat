40|$|The {{epidemic}} form of Kaposi's sarcoma {{is associated}} with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Cutaneous and mucosal manifestations are frequently reported in the <b>ENT</b> <b>sphere,</b> mostly involving the oral cavity. The external and middle ear are only rarely concerned with only one case of a mastoid lesion within extension to {{the external auditory canal}} (EAC) being reported to this day. The present article describes the first case of involvement of the EAC with extension to adjacent structures. This patient presented other Kaposi lesions and had been treated by systemic hormonal therapy. Thereafter local injection of a cytotoxic agent was given without effect. Finally, radiotherapy resulted in a 50 % regression of the tumour mass. The epidemiologic factors and therapeutic modalities with their results are described.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of the <b>ENT</b> <b>sphere</b> in HIV infections is fairly common, but the relative manifestations, though not to be considered atypical, are not pathognomonic. The present study {{has been set up}} for the otoiatric assessment of a group of HIV patients and the correlation of ENT symptoms with the various stages of the disease. To this end, 60 patients were examined (35 belonged to groups 2 - 3 and 25 to group 4) of whom 50 % were drug addicts, 36 % homosexuals and 14 % heterosexuals. All patients underwent a complete ENT examination as well as the assessment of hearing and vestibular function, of olfactory and taste functions, of respiratory and nasal mucociliary functions along with an anti-HIV antibody check of nasal secretion. Results showed a prevalence of otologic and rhinosinusal symptoms as well as cervical-facial swelling. Testing revealed a hearing loss of mainly conductive origin caused by otitis and tubal stenosis; vestibular hyporeflexia; mixed hyposmia and hypogeusia owing to the {{involvement of}} multiple cranial nerves; respiratory and mucociliary changes due to rhinitis and hypertrophy of the nasal mucosa. In all cases anti-HIV antibodies were found in nasal secretion. From a diagnostic point of view there was a prevalence of specific pathologies: oropharyngeal candidosis, stage 4; cervical lymphoadenopathy, stages 2 - 3; chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal vestibulitis and nosebleed; mainly chronic otitis media. All such manifestations suggest a marked involvement of ENT organs, which {{can be attributed to the}} anatomical characteristics of the area, with the relative diagnostic and prognostic implications of HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Inhalation {{injury is}} an {{important}} determinant of outcome in patients with major burns. However the diagnostic criteria remain imprecise, preventing objective comparisons of published data. The aims were to evaluate the utility of an inhalation score based on mucosal injury, while assessing separately the oro-pharyngeal <b>sphere</b> (<b>ENT)</b> and tracheobronchial tree (TB) in patients admitted to the ICU with a suspicion of inhalation injury. METHODS: Prospective observational study in 100 patients admitted with suspicion of inhalation injury among 168 consecutive burn admissions to the ICU of a university hospital. Inclusion criteria, endoscopic airway assessment during the first hours. ENT/TB lesion grading was 1 : oedema, hyperemia, hypersecretion, 2 : bullous mucosal detachment, erosion, exudates, 3 : profound ulcers, necrosis. RESULTS: Of the 100 patients (age 42 ± 17 years, burns 23 ± 19 %BSA), 79 presented an ENT inhalation injury ≥ENT 1 (soot present in 24 %) : 36 had a tracheobronchial extension, 33 having a grade ≥TB 1. Burned vibrissae: 10 patients "without" suffered ENT injury, while 6 patients "with" had no further lesions. Length of mechanical ventilation was strongly associated with the first 24 hrs' fluid resuscitation volume (p< 0. 0001) {{and the presence of}} inhalation injury (p= 0. 03), while the ICU length of stay was correlated with the %BSA. Soot was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation (p= 0. 0115). There was no extubation failure. CONCLUSIONS: The developed inhalation score was simple to use, providing a unified language, and drawing attention to upper airway involvement. Burned vibrissae and suspected history proved to be insufficient diagnostic criteria. Further studies are required to validate the score in a larger population...|$|R
