5|$|Fortune {{published}} many {{articles in}} Inner Light magazine, {{a number of}} which were collected together and published in books. In 1930, the first such collection was published as Mystical Meditations upon the Collects, in which Fortune emphasised her Christian commitments. In 1931 a number of <b>her</b> <b>Inner</b> Light articles on Spiritualism appeared as Spiritualism in the Light of Occult Science. In this book Fortune expressed reservations about Spiritualism. She drew a distinction between normal Spiritualist mediums and 'cosmic mediums' such as herself who contacted the Ascended Masters, also arguing that {{the spirits of the}} dead should not be contacted without good reason, a view that generated controversy among the occult milieu. In 1934, she assembled a number of <b>her</b> <b>Inner</b> Light articles on Glastonbury as Avalon of the Heart, while further Inner Light articles were assembled as Practical Occultism in Daily Life, a book aimed at a general reader.|$|E
5|$|Princess Kassandra of Troy is the story's protagonist, {{and it is}} {{told from}} her perspective. It begins when an elderly Kassandra tiredly agrees to correct the Homeric version of the Trojan War that is told by a {{traveling}} minstrel. Kassandra recounts her life experiences at Troy and Colchis, how she came to balk at the gender roles dictated by Trojan culture, and <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> turmoil over whether she should be serving the Goddess or Apollo.|$|E
5|$|The 1955 {{portrait}} {{was popular}} with the public and liked by the Queen but criticised for its romantic treatment and for prioritising Elizabeth's role as the monarch over insights into <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> life. The 1969 portrait continued the theme of emphasising the royal role by placing Elizabeth against a featureless background that symbolised her sole responsibility as monarch. It was un{{popular with the}} public.|$|E

5|$|In the 2012 film , the Pyramid Head, {{once more}} portrayed by Roberto Campanella, {{is both a}} monster and a guardian. More than once, it saves Sharon from the forces of Silent Hill. This is {{explained}} by its loyalty to Alessa: since Heather is the good half of Alessa's soul, it sees them as the same being and is thus bound to protect both from harm. Pyramid Head is also seen controlling the carousel where Heather and Alessa face off against each other, then it kills the cult leader Claudia Wolf after the amulet shows <b>her</b> <b>inner,</b> monstrous nature.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} that summer, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that she was too frail to hold her birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating {{back to the days of}} the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her as she lay in bed. On the morning of November 11, Liliʻuokalani died at the age of seventy-nine at her residence at Washington Place.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sulan kills Durst and grafts {{his face}} {{over his own}} to appear more {{appealing}} to the Klingon Torres. Klingon Torres escapes from Sulan's laboratory, and rescues her human version. After arguing about their respective weaknesses, and past expulsion from Starfleet Academy, the two halves formulate a plan. Human Torres suggests shutting down the shields for the complex so that Voyager can transport them to the ship, while the Klingon Torres deals with guards. Chakotay, disguised as a Vidiian guard {{with the help of}} , breaks into the facility at the same time Torres deactivates the shields. Klingon Torres sacrifices herself to protect {{the rest of the crew}} members from Sulan. Transported back to Voyager, Klingon Torres refuses medical help to die an honorable death. The Doctor explains that Human Torres would not survive without her Klingon half and restores her to her original self by reintegrating the Klingon DNA. Human Torres admits to feeling incomplete without her Klingon half. After being restored, she realizes that she will spend the rest of her life dealing with <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> conflict.|$|E

5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E

25|$|In early 1918, Mihail Kogălniceanu was {{converted}} to a coastal monitor. Her bow was fitted with a breakwater, the distribution of <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> cargo was evened to prevent listing, her deck was made waterproof and more instruments required for sea navigation were brought from the cruiser Elisabeta. By the beginning of March 1918, the monitor was ready to sail at sea.|$|E

25|$|In late 2012, it was {{determined}} the wood hull behind the fiberglass sheathing (installed during the 1996–98 rebuilding) contained significant rotting. Therefore, the ship was again put in dry dock and, over a 6-month period, was rebuilt with fresh (and chemically treated to resist rotting) wood planking during 2014–2015. The rebuilt ship was returned to <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> harbor berth in late March 2015. Her rigging was completed by May 2015, and she is now again open to the public.|$|E
25|$|She {{originally}} {{received her}} nickname Chara {{in junior high}} school, after a teacher called her this. She was so well known by this name that not even some of her friends knew her real name. She continues to use this name as she believes it brings out <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> child. After finishing high school, Chara went to Tokyo to a vocational school, majoring in music and specialising in piano. However, she dropped out one year into her two-year degree.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} his jealousy and pride, Norton {{encouraged}} his wife to use her connections to advance his career. It was entirely due to her influence that in 1831 he was made a Metropolitan Police Magistrate. During these years, Caroline turned to prose and poetry {{as a means of}} releasing <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> emotions and earning money. Her first book, The Sorrows of Rosalie (1829), was well received. The Undying One (1830), a romance founded upon the legend of the Wandering Jew, soon followed.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{returning}} to their hotel room, Hilde reflects on her daughter. <b>Her</b> <b>inner</b> thoughts display envy toward Erika's privilege of being educated and her ability to choose her career. Hilde reveals that she {{had always wanted to}} be a nurse, however her dreams of a nursing career were shattered the day her village was bombed during air raids. She had watched her brother Stephen die as she was swallowed by mounds of earth. The raid had made her weak and incapable of dealing with trauma later in her life.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} areas of nursing practice, {{psychiatric}} mental health nursing works within nursing models, utilizing nursing care plans, and seeks {{to care for the}} whole person. However, the emphasis of mental health nursing is on the development of a therapeutic relationship or alliance. In practice, this means that the nurse should seek to engage with the person in care in a positive and collaborative way that will empower the patient to draw on his or <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> resources in addition to any other treatment they may be receiving.|$|E
25|$|According to Vega, she {{particularly}} liked singing {{because it}} is through this medium that {{she is able to}} best express <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> thoughts and feelings. This became especially true after the loss of her brother Joey, to whom she was particularly very close. Joey was stabbed to death in a car by hired killers, who mistook him for another person they were hired to look for and then kill, while hanging out with his friends in 1983. His untimely death at the age of 22 proved to be devastating for the young Julie, who then repeatedly wished to join him in death.|$|E

Christine Cook played Louise in the first two series—Margan Hallett took over in the third--"a woman dealing with her husband, kids, an elaborate ensemble of notable characters, and <b>her</b> ... humorously overactive <b>inner</b> voice".

25|$|In The Gestalt Theory of Motivation (1960), {{the social}} {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem proposed the self-perception theory whereby {{people do not}} think much about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person {{is in the same}} position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s Lewis kept Froanna in the background, {{and many}} of his friends were simply unaware of her existence. It seems that Lewis was {{extraordinarily}} jealous and protective of his wife, owing to her youth and beauty (she was eighteen years his junior). They lived together for ten years before marrying. Froanna was patient and caring toward her husband through financial troubles and his frequent illnesses. She was the model for some of Lewis’s most tender and intimate portraits, {{as well as a number}} of characters in his fiction. In contrast to his earlier, rather impersonal portraits, which are purely concerned with external appearance, the portraits of Froanna show a preoccupation with <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> life.|$|E
25|$|Frost, Sebastian Shaw and Donald Pierce are {{targeted}} by Selene for betraying her {{years ago in}} her plan to ascend to godhood. Additionally, Selene is also angry over Frost using the Black Queen moniker when she was leading the Dark X-Men. She resurrects the Hellions and sends them to attack and taunt Frost.> Their appearance is enough, to leave Frost in a horrified state of shock and guilt. Once Selene's inner circle appears on Utopia Frost recognizes Blink and stops Wolverine from killing Wither. However, in the aftermath Selene's inner circle succeed in capturing Warpath, injuring Angel and ruthlessly killing Onyxx and Diamond Lil before returning to Necrosha. Frost recognizes that the threat will not end until Selene and <b>her</b> <b>inner</b> circle are permanently stopped, and orders X-Force to travel to Necrosha and kill them all, including Wither.|$|E

60|$|But Nature's poetry {{was more}} {{beautiful}} than man's. The wind and the beam loved the rose so well that they made the rose--or rather, the rose took {{the wind and the}} beam, and built up out of them, by <b>her</b> own <b>inner</b> life, <b>her</b> exquisite texture, hue, and fragrance.|$|R
50|$|Hon's clean, {{absurd and}} {{abstract}} style {{has been compared}} to Franz Kafka, and her intensely psychological stories often reflect <b>her</b> characters’ <b>inner</b> struggles for freedom, against the futility of attempts to find meaning in everyday existence; to Hon’s characters, the “way out” lies in transformation that comes from overturning established identities.|$|R
