According to Stella, Nickell took four Extra-Strength Excedrin {{capsules}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> in their home for his headache and collapsed minutes later. Nickell died shortly thereafter at Harborview Medical Center, where treatment had failed to revive him. His death was initially ruled to be by natural causes, with attending physicians citing emphysema.|$|E
5|$|Some {{robotics}} {{research is}} exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle.</b> It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen {{standing in front of}} a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E

25|$|Babies feed {{differently}} {{with artificial}} nipples {{than from a}} breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. Drinking <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> takes less effort and the milk may come more rapidly, potentially causing the baby to lose desire for the breast. This is called nursing strike, nipple strike or nipple confusion. To avoid this, expressed milk can be given by means such as spoons or cups.|$|E

25|$|Warner Music Japan {{received}} {{criticism by}} the , due to scenes depicting Kyary Pamyu Pamyu rapidly drinking. The group noted the video's heavy rotation at karaoke venues frequented by youth, the group felt the video was inappropriate after {{the deaths of}} six university students in 2012 from intoxication. In {{an open letter to}} Warner Music Japan, the association asked Warner Music to edit out scenes from the video which depicted Kyary Pamyu Pamyu drinking straight <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle,</b> as well as other drunken scenes. Warner responded by adding a disclaimer against fast drinking and underage drinking to the description box of the YouTube video, and released a statement in the media stating that the video was not meant to promote alcohol to minors.|$|E
25|$|In October 2000, {{he escaped}} from his court-mandated drug {{treatment}} facility and spent one month as a fugitive.

He then appeared onstage at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York drinking <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> at the record release party for The W, the third Wu-Tang Clan album. In late November 2000, while still a fugitive, he was arrested outside a South Philadelphia McDonald's (at 29th and Gray's Ferry Ave.), after he drew a crowd while signing autographs. He spent several days in a Philadelphia jail and was later extradited to New York City. A Manhattan court sentenced him to two to four years incarceration.|$|E
25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> of acid that a film technician had set {{next to his}} soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|E

500|$|Some of the {{elements}} were suggested by other staff members, with Robert Wolfe naming Colonel Anastasia Komananov and Behr changing Suzie Luvsitt to Mona Luvsitt. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was later not pleased with the James Bond-style approach, and when Bashir's spy program appeared in the later episode [...] "A Simple Investigation", the references were more generic. Dennis Madalone managed to save some time during the production {{as one of the}} shots involved Bashir seeing Falcon approach him from behind by seeing his reflection in a bottle of champagne. After time was already scheduled to attempt the shot, Madalone explained to the director that he could take the filmed sequence and digitally manipulate it onto the bottle. Madalone was also responsible for firing a cork <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> at Colm Meaney's head from off screen to make it appear as if Bashir did it, and managed to do it on the first take.|$|E

2500|$|Gladwell {{reports that}} other market {{researchers}} have criticized Coke for {{not realizing that}} much of its success as a brand came from what they call sensation transference, a phenomenon first described by marketer Louis Cheskin in the late 1940s: tasters unconsciously add their reactions to the drink's packaging into their assessment of the taste.

2500|$|The term [...] (from the Ancient Greek [...] "ἀνάκλιτος", anaklitos – [...] "for reclining") {{refers to}} primitive, {{infantile}} needs and tendencies directed toward a pre-genital love object. Developed by two London psychoanalysts, Joyce Martin and Pauline McCririck, {{this form of}} treatment is similar to psycholytic approaches as it is based largely on a psychoanalytic interpretation of abreactions produced by the treatment, but it tends to focus on those experiences in which the patient re-encounters carnal feelings of emotional deprivation and frustration stemming from the infantile needs of their early childhood. As a result, the treatment was developed with the aim to directly fulfill or satisfy those repressed, agonizing cravings for love, physical contact, and other instinctual needs re-lived by the patient. Therefore, the therapist is completely engaged with the subject, {{as opposed to the}} traditional detached attitude of the psychoanalyst. With the intense emotional episodes that came with the psychedelic experience, Martin and McCririck aimed to sit in as the [...] "mother" [...] role who would enter into close physical contact with the patients by rocking them, giving them milk <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle,</b> etc.|$|E
