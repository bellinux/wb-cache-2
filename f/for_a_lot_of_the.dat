500|$|Frusciante's {{new musical}} {{approach}} met a mixed response from fans and critics. AllMusic's Fred Thomas {{in his review}} of PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone stated: [...] "The ever-winding path of John Frusciante's solo career is a confusing one to say the least. [...] The thing is, there's no doubt that Frusciante is sincere in his expression with this incredibly warped music. There's no easy explanation for these sounds, no context <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choices he makes with the rapid-fire style changes and jarring production choices that come one after another after another on almost every song here." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, some users also {{alleged that}} their Windows 7 and 8.1 devices had {{automatically}} begun upgrading to 10 without their consent. In June 2016, the GWX dialog's behavior changed to make closing the window imply a consent to a scheduled upgrade. Despite this, an Infoworld editor disputed the claims that upgrades had begun without any consent at all; testing {{showed that the}} upgrade to Windows10 would only begin once the user accepts the end-user license agreement (EULA) presented by its installer, and that not doing so would eventually cause Windows Update to time out with an error, thus halting the installation attempt. It was concluded that these users may have unknowingly clicked the [...] "Accept" [...] prompt without full knowledge that this would begin the upgrade. In December 2016, Microsoft chief marketing officer Chris Capossela admitted {{that the company had}} [...] "gone too far", by using this tactic, stating that [...] "we know we want people to be running Windows 10 from a security perspective, but finding the right balance where you’re not stepping over the line of being too aggressive is something we tried and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year I think we got it right." ...|$|E
500|$|John [...] "DJ" [...] Desjardin {{served as}} the visual {{supervisor}} for Man of Steel, with Weta Digital, MPC, and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film. Zack Snyder wanted the film to [...] "appear very natural because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team {{had to make it}} as easy as possible for them to do so." [...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previs we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel [...] developed for that miniseries, where {{we want to make sure}} if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense. Unless the action is so over the top, like in the end where Superman is beating up Zod—we had to break it a bit." ...|$|E

Barrichello pushed {{on to win}} the race, and close the gap on Button to 18 points. Martin Brundle felt that Button was struggling with the pressure of leading the world championship, writing: [...] "He has tightened up in the car and his natural instincts behind the wheel are being restricted." [...] The following race at Spa-Francorchamps, Button had his first retirement of the season after a collision with Romain Grosjean during the first lap. This meant Button had scored only 11 points from his previous five races, and with five races left his lead was down to 16 points over Barrichello, and 19 and 20.5 over Vettel and Webber respectively.|$|E
