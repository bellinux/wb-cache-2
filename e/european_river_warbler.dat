50|$|Highly {{protected}} {{bird species}} here include the bittern, marsh harrier, crane, kingfisher and <b>river</b> <b>warbler</b> {{as well as}} the middle spotted woodpecker, red kite, red-backed shrike.

50|$|There are 604 {{species of}} birds {{throughout}} the country (data from BirdLife International, 2013). None of these are endemic but some such as the Dja <b>River</b> <b>warbler,</b> Verreaux's batis, African river martin and black-chinned weaver are restricted to Central Africa and have only small ranges. The grey-necked picathartes and Loango weaver are classed as vulnerable species by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|Other birds {{found in}} Järveküla Nature Reserve include: the Barn swallow (the {{national}} bird of Estonia), Eurasian wryneck, Eurasian golden oriole, Icterine <b>warbler,</b> <b>River</b> <b>warbler,</b> Spotted flycatcher, Eurasian tree sparrow, Common chaffinch, European greenfinch, European pied flycatcher, Eurasian skylark, Fieldfare, White wagtail, Yellowhammer, Hooded crow, Garden warbler, Grey heron, Eurasian blue tit, Eurasian blackcap, Common rosefinch, European goldfinch and Common chiffchaff among others.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a dozen}} couples of {{northern}} lapwing and eastern yellow wagtail, together with couples of meadow pipit, whinchat, red-backed shrike, bearded reedling, goshawk, spotted nutcracker, Eurasian wryneck, European honey buzzard, thrush nightingale, long-tailed tit, lesser spotted woodpecker, wood warbler, hawfinch, and Eurasian hobby. In the night time sedge warbler and reed warbler are regularly heard, while grasshopper <b>warbler,</b> <b>river</b> <b>warbler,</b> marsh warbler, and great reed warbler are reported now and then. Osprey are regularly seen fishing in the lake. Uncountable numbers of resting species are reported by the lake, including various swans, hawks, eagles, cormorants, and sparrows.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>river</b> <b>warbler</b> (Locustella fluviatilis) is an Old World warbler in {{the grass}} warbler genus Locustella. It breeds in east and central Europe into western Asia. It is migratory, {{wintering}} in east Africa. The genus name Locustella is from Latin and is a diminutive of locusta, [...] "grasshopper". This refers to {{the song of the}} common grasshopper warbler and some others in this genus. The specific fluviatilis is Latin for [...] "of a river".|$|R
50|$|Doxey Marshes {{lies within}} the {{floodplain}} of the River Sow and periodically it breaches its banks and subjects the marshes to flooding. Wading birds love the shallow pools and muddy edges this flooding leaves behind {{as a source}} of food. In the autumn and spring during the migration period, Doxey can attract a variety of rare birds. Rarities recorded in recent years include <b>river</b> <b>warbler,</b> marsh warbler, purple heron, cattle egret, spoonbill, European bee-eater and bluethroat.|$|R
50|$|This small {{passerine}} bird {{is found}} in reed beds, usually with some bushes. Three to six eggs are laid in a nest in reeds. The adult has an unstreaked grey-brown back, whitish grey underparts {{and a lack of}} throat streaks, which is a distinction from the <b>river</b> <b>warbler.</b> The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous. This is not a shy species, but can be difficult to see in the reeds except sometimes when singing.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are to offer an {{exploratory}} review {{of the extent to}} which the leading <b>European</b> <b>river</b> cruise companies are publicly addressing their environmental, social and economic impacts and reporting on their sustainability strategies and achievements and to offer some reflections on sustainability within the <b>European</b> <b>river</b> cruise industry. The paper begins with brief outline of river cruising and of the characteristics of sustainability. The information on which the paper is based is drawn from the river cruise associations' and the leading <b>European</b> <b>river</b> cruise companies' corporate web sites. The findings of the paper reveal that the leading <b>European</b> <b>river</b> cruise companies have done little to publicly address the sustainability of their operations. More critically the authors argued that the <b>European</b> <b>river</b> cruise companies' commitments to sustainability are driven by the search for efficiency gains and are couched within existing business models centred on continuing growth rather than on maintaining the viability of natural ecosystems and communities. As such the leading <b>European</b> <b>river</b> cruise companies are, at best, currently pursuing a 'weak' rather than a 'strong' model of sustainability. The paper provides an accessible exploratory review of sustainability reporting in the <b>European</b> <b>river</b> cruise industry and as such it will interest professional working in the river cruise industry and more generally in the hospitality industry as well as academics and students interested in tourism and sustainability...|$|R

30|$|The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{requires}} {{the achievement of}} good ecological and chemical status in <b>European</b> <b>river</b> basins. However, evidence is increasing {{that a majority of}} European water bodies will not achieve this goal. Nutrient emissions and related eutrophication together with hydromorphological alterations have been suggested as the major driving forces of this insufficient ecological status. MODELKEY (511237 GOCE, FP 6) provides strong evidence that toxic chemicals also affect the ecological status of <b>European</b> <b>rivers.</b> This was demonstrated in the case study rivers Elbe, Scheldt and Llobregat on different scales.|$|R

40|$|Despite their {{relatively}} small drainage areas, <b>European</b> <b>rivers</b> reflect {{a wide variety}} of hydrologic regimes, although with very few exceptions they have been strongly affected by human activity. Scandinavian rivers (particularly those draining Iceland and western Norway) can have high runoff, and, except for those draining Iceland, all have very low suspended and dissolved sediment loads. Northern and western <b>European</b> <b>rivers</b> have somewhat lower runoff, among the lowest suspended sediment yields in the world, and anthropogenically enhanced dissolved solid loads. Annual discharge of many of these rivers appears to vary inversely with the North Atlantic Oscillation index. Rivers discharging from the southern Alps into the Mediterranean Sea have relatively high runoff, high suspended sediment yields (reflecting younger, more easily erodable rocks as well as generally smaller drainage basins), and high dissolved yields, although presumably with somewhat less human influence. <b>European</b> <b>rivers</b> and their estuaries tend to reflect the terrestrial environments of their drainage basins (i. e. climate, landscape geomorphology, geology), but they also display strong anthropogenic signatures. Sediment erosion increased dramatically in the last several millenia in response to deforestation, farming and mining. In the past 50 years, however, increased soil conservation and local reversion of agricultural land to forest, as well as river diversion and dam construction, have decreased the suspended sediment loads of many <b>European</b> <b>rivers.</b> Improved mining and manufacturing techniques, as well as more effective use of fertilizers and improved waste treatment, almost surely will result in lower dissolved solids and nutrient fluxes to the coastal environments, which presently are the highest in the world. The long-range effects of changed land use on estuarine and coastal environments remain to be seen, although decreased sediment loads in the past 20 - 40 years have already resulted in increased shoreline erosion. Decreased nutrient fluxes almost certainly will affect water quality in European coastal waters, and decreased silicate delivery by some dammed rivers may result in proliferation of new (and perhaps harmful) estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Everything points to further changes as <b>European</b> <b>rivers</b> and their drainage basins continue to change in the coming years...|$|R

40|$|Background. Extensive {{monitoring}} {{programs on}} chemical contamination are run in many <b>European</b> <b>river</b> basins.
