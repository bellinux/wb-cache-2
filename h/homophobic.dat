5|$|Julia Gasper is an English {{independent}} academic specialising {{in historical}} literature, and a right-wing political activist {{affiliated with the}} English Democrats. She formerly belonged to the UK Independence Party (UKIP). A vociferous critic of LGBT rights, she has generated controversy with comments widely deemed <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} week of the program several HouseGuests made {{controversial}} remarks during several arguments on the live Internet feeds. Many <b>homophobic</b> comments made by Jeff during an argument with Russell after the first Power of Veto ceremony were edited out of the first Tuesday broadcast episode while the comments remained uncensored online.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, with Paul's {{increased}} support, {{the controversy}} over racist and <b>homophobic</b> statements in several Ron Paul newsletters in the 1980s and early 1990s once again gained media attention. During this time Paul supporters asserted that he was continually ignored by the media despite his significant support, citing examples of where television news shows would fail to mention Paul in discussions of the Republican presidential hopefuls {{even when he was}} polling second.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics {{praising the}} ensemble cast, and each lead {{being singled out}} for their performances across reviews. The plot received a more mixed response; some reviewers felt that its dark, humorous premise was explored well, while others felt the jokes were racist, <b>homophobic</b> and misogynistic. A sequel, Horrible Bosses 2, was released on November 26, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a <b>homophobic</b> world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E
5|$|As a character, Scar has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, who greeted Irons' {{performance with}} equal enthusiasm. However, Scar's violence, dark color palette and allegedly effeminate mannerisms were initially met with mild controversy, perceived {{by some as}} racist and <b>homophobic.</b> Nevertheless, Scar continues to be revered as one of Disney's greatest villains by various media publications, topping The Huffington Posts list and ranking within the top ten of similar lists published by Yahoo! Movies, the Orlando Sentinel, E! and CNN. Scar has also been ranked among the greatest villains in film history by Digital Spy and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Williamson {{was murdered}} in his {{apartment}} by an acquaintance, Dwight Hayden, whom he had been aiding with financial handouts. Police believed that Hayden's motive was robbery, although J-FLAG also suggested that homophobia {{may have played a}} part in the killing. Hayden was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. Upon learning of the murder, a crowd assembled in New Kingston to celebrate Williamson's death, chanting <b>homophobic</b> slogans and lyrics. Conversely, the Jamaican LGBT community held a secret memorial for him, while protests against the killing were held by LGBT rights groups in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) asks Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) to the prom; Blaine {{reveals that}} he was beaten up after a formal dance at his old school shortly after coming out, but agrees to go. He and Kurt's father Burt (Mike O'Malley) express misgivings about Kurt's daring {{homemade}} prom outfit, which includes a skirt, but Kurt is determined to be himself and wear it. Pleased by the sudden absence of <b>homophobic</b> bullying at school, Kurt suggests that his former tormentor Karofsky should consider coming out. Karofsky refuses, but makes a tearful apology to Kurt.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and <b>homophobic</b> views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|Buczynski welcomed {{a number}} of friends and flatmates, {{including}} Geraci, into the Huntington coven, and later stated his desire to personally initiate Geraci up to the third degree; Saperton disagreed, citing the traditional Gardnerian prohibition on anyone initiating {{a member of the}} same sex. Buczynski thought that her attitude was <b>homophobic,</b> and subsequently abandoned both her and Gardnerian Wica. Meanwhile, he and Geraci moved out of their crowded apartment into a new flat in Middle Village. Despite same-sex marriage not being legally recognised at the time, they undertook a private wedding ceremony to marry one another, although were non-monogamous, and would go together to gay bath houses to partake in sexual activity with other patrons, resulting in Buczynski's contraction of several sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Chris was a {{high school}} student who befriended the soap's other teens. He became the captain of the school's {{basketball}} team and he began dating Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas). However, Chris developed a crush on Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) and subsequently revealed that he was gay. Chris initially struggled with his sexuality and the reactions of his friends, family and team mates. Upon finding employment at the local garage, Chris was faced with Warren Burrell (Tony Rickards), a <b>homophobic</b> customer. In August 2011, a love interest for Chris was introduced in the form of Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) and they formed Neighbours first gay couple. After a break-up and reunion, Chris and Aidan split for good in January 2013. Chris became the focus of a coward punch storyline in 2014 and agreed to have a baby with his friend Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell).|$|E
5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as <b>homophobic,</b> and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E
5|$|Lester Burnham is {{a middle-aged}} {{advertising}} executive and magazine writer who despises his job. He is unhappily married to Carolyn, a neurotic yet fiercely ambitious {{real estate broker}} who grows red roses in their yard; their teenage daughter, Jane, abhors her parents and has low self-esteem. The Burnhams' new neighbors are the Fitts family, consisting of a <b>homophobic</b> retired U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts, his near-catatonic wife, Barbara, and their teenage son, Ricky, who constantly films his surroundings with a camcorder, collecting hundreds of recordings on videotapes in his bedroom. His part-time job as a bar caterer and waiter serves as a front for his secret marijuana dealings. Frank is a strict disciplinarian who previously sent Ricky to a military school and briefly committed him to a psychiatric hospital. Jim Olmeyer and Jim Berkley, a gay couple who live nearby, welcome the Fitts family to the neighborhood. On the way to school, Frank reveals his homophobia while he angrily discusses the incident with Ricky.|$|E
5|$|The True Directions {{kids are}} {{encouraged}} to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann), who take the campers to a local gay bar where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all picket Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting <b>homophobic</b> abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} marked the {{introduction}} of Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) and Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). They were initially cast as recurring characters, but both were given star billing {{at the opening of}} the third season. Ramirez was cast after ABC executives offered her a role in the network show of her choice, Dane had previously auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in the pilot episode. Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) also joined the show in season two, after making a guest appearance in season one. In October 2006, Washington allegedly insulted Knight with a <b>homophobic</b> slur, during an on-set altercation with Dempsey, and ABC terminated Washington's contract at the end of the third season. Washington also made a guest appearance in season 10. At the conclusion of the third season, Walsh also departed the show to pursue the Grey's Anatomy spin-off, Private Practice, but continues to make guest appearances.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{started his}} new club season 2010–11 as a first-team regular, playing against Manchester United {{on the opening}} day. On Barton's and Newcastle's second match, he scored against Aston Villa in a 6–0 victory for Newcastle. Immediately after the match, Barton removed a {{moustache}} which he had pledged to not shave until Newcastle United had won a match in the new season. On 10 November, in a 2–1 defeat to Blackburn, Barton again acted violently, punching Morten Gamst Pedersen in the chest. He was not punished during the match as the officials {{did not see the}} incident, but after reviewing the evidence, the FA again charged Barton with violent conduct. Barton apologised, accepted the charge, and was banned for three matches. Barton courted controversy once again during Newcastle's 3–1 win over Liverpool on 11 December 2010, when he appeared to direct <b>homophobic</b> remarks and a lewd gesture at Fernando Torres. Barton scored two penalties against Arsenal on 5 February 2011 as Newcastle came from a 4–0 deficit to draw 4–4. He was involved in an altercation with Abou Diaby, which led to a straight red card for Diaby. Diaby took offence to Barton's strong challenge and retaliated by grabbing Barton by the neck and shoving him to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior; sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a <b>homophobic</b> setting.|$|E
25|$|<b>Homophobic</b> rhetoric, {{including}} by officials, {{and rising}} <b>homophobic</b> violence accompanied debate about these laws. Three <b>homophobic</b> murders {{were reported in}} various regions of Russia in May 2013.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Sol Campbell {{received}} <b>homophobic</b> {{abuse from}} Tottenham Hotspur fans while playing for Portsmouth. Campbell is married, {{and his brother}} was jailed for 12 months in 2005 after assaulting a classmate who suggested that the defender was gay.

25|$|Additionally, Hilton {{has been}} known to speak out {{publicly}} against the discriminatory behavior of celebrities and other public figures. For instance, he called for the firing of Isaiah Washington from ABC television series Grey's Anatomy for making <b>homophobic</b> remarks and called for his readers to do the same. However, in early 2007, he was criticized by The Hollywood Gossip blog for ignoring racist and <b>homophobic</b> remarks made by Paris Hilton.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 {{paper by}} the Australia Institute, Mapping Homophobia in Australia, found that 35% of people aged 14 or above {{considered}} homosexuality to be immoral, with Queensland and Tasmania having {{the highest levels}} of anti-gay sentiment and Victoria the lowest. Overall the most <b>homophobic</b> areas in the study were the Moreton area of country Queensland (excluding the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast), Central and South-West Queensland and the Burnie/Western district of Tasmania, where 50% considered homosexuality to be immoral, while the least <b>homophobic</b> were inner-city Melbourne (14%), central Perth (21%) and central Melbourne (26%).|$|E

25|$|There is no Belarusian {{law that}} refers {{specifically}} to perpetrators of crimes motivated by homophobia. In the Criminal Code, homosexuals are only singled {{out when they}} are the “subjects” of a crime (e.g., when they are the perpetrators), and not when they are “objects” (e.g., victims of a crime). Judicial and police organs do not express any eagerness to collect evidence about the <b>homophobic</b> motives of those who perpetrate crimes. Judges are not obliged to consider such motives as aggravating the circumstances of guilt, or to impose more severe punishments when <b>homophobic</b> motives are present. LGBT people are in danger to face discrimination and violence.|$|E
25|$|Because LGBT {{people have}} {{historically}} been marginalized as sexual minorities, {{coming out of the}} closet remains a challenge for most of the world's LGBT population and can lead to a backlash of heterosexist discrimination and <b>homophobic</b> violence.|$|E
