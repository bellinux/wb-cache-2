5000|$|Sub-nival: The highest {{zone that}} {{vegetation}} typically exists. This area {{is shaped by}} the frequent frosts that restrict extensive plant colonization. Vegetation is patchy and is restricted to only the most favorable locations that are protected from the heavy winds that often characterize this area. Much of this region is patchy grassland, sedges and <b>rush</b> <b>heaths</b> typical of arctic zones [...] Snow is found in this region {{for part of the}} year.|$|R

It was so strange, to have that gay Italian bay, with all its memories,--the orgies of Baiae, and the unburied wrecks of ancient towns, with the smoking crater far above; and the world-famous Nile-mouths and those great old wars, big with the destinies of the world; and those great old heroes, with their awful deeds for good and evil, all brought so suddenly and livingly before me, up there in the desolate moorland, where the deer, and birds, and <b>heath,</b> and <b>rushes</b> were even as they had been from the beginning.

50|$|Dagenham {{is located}} {{approximately}} 11.5 mi east of Charing Cross in Central London. A {{large part of}} Dagenham is within the Becontree estate; however, the area also includes Becontree <b>Heath,</b> part of <b>Rush</b> Green, Old Dagenham village, and the southern section around Dagenham Dock and adjacent to the River Thames.

5000|$|Castro de Rei {{is located}} in the comarca of the Terra Cha. This factor determines the most of their {{socioeconomic}} characteristics. Its average altitude is between 400 and 500 meters. In the east the terrain becomes more rugged due to its proximity to the eastern mountains. The elevation of the Montes dos Millares is 620 meters and the Pedras Albas has an elevation of 619 meters Pedras Albas. The Minho river and several of its tributaries irrigate the lands. The Minho runs through the municipality and derives secondary manifolds, which are Azúmara, the Lea, and Anllo. Climatically, Castro de Rei has a temperate climate with abundant rainfall in the winter months. The region is characterized by its plains and its vast wetlands, home to waterfowl and large communities of amphibians. Associated with these wetlands appears a landscape mosaic, ecologically rich with color and an ample variety of habitats: grasslands, crops, forests, <b>heath</b> and <b>rushes.</b> The functional organization of the territory follows a monocentric structure with three main comarcs: Vilalba, Guitiriz and Castro de Rei. Castro de Rei has three mountain ranges: ...|$|R

5000|$|Vegetation in the Pennines {{is adapted}} to subarctic climates, but {{altitude}} and acidity are also factors. For example, on Sutton Moor the millstone grit’s topsoil below 275 m has a soil ph that is almost neutral, ph 6 to 7, and so grows good grazing. But above 275 m it is acidic, ph 2 to 4, and so can grow only bracken, heather, sphagnum, and coarse grasses such as cottongrass, purple moor grass and <b>heath</b> <b>rush.</b> However dressing it with lime produces better quality grass for sheep grazing. Such is named [...] upland grazing. This suggests that early pastoral farming on millstone grit soil flourished in areas where lime was most easily available.|$|E

Starting at the light station, they include a short trails to the east [...] "landing", a loop trail to the west [...] "landing" [...] {{as well as a}} longer trail {{down the center of the}} island to the {{boathouse}} and dock at the south end. [...] To the east is an old engine house that was used to haul supplies up from the landing. The building, thought to have been finished in 1901, is the only one built of sandstone quarried from the island. The bulldozer that was used to make these trails can be found along the trail to the west landing. A rare <b>heath</b> <b>rush</b> (grass) found on Devil's Island is thought to have been carried to the island on the tracks of the army surplus bulldozer which was once used in Greenland.|$|E
