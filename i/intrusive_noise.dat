This study compared the acoustics of four different Kindergarten classrooms: an enclosed classroom with 25 students, a double classroom with 44 students, a linear fully open plan triple classroom with 91 students, and a semi-open plan K- 6 classroom with 205 students. Ambient noise levels, <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise</b> levels, occupied background noise levels, and teacher’s speech levels were recorded during different activities.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} how <b>intrusive</b> <b>noises</b> affect local university {{students in their}} communities. The Community Noise Survey solicited information about types of bothersome noises, how often these noises were bothersome, activities intruded upon by these noises, feelings elicited by noise intrusions, and what participants did to abate the noises. Noise pollution in South Florida has become a pervasive issue in recent times due {{to an increase in}} population that has led to an expansion of local airports, increased traffic and construction. Noise pollution is defined as unwanted noise (Berglund & Lindvall, 1995) and has been shown to have negative psychological and physiological effects on those affected most (Blomberg, 2000; Bronzaft, 1998; Staples, 1996). Recent literature has indicated that airplane noise pollution was the most intrusive by those surveyed (Staples, 1996). Noise pollution legislation was passed in the 1970 ’s but was repealed in the early 1980 ’s, and the problem has not been revisited, mostly due to lack of political and financial support (Bronzaft, 1998; Staples...|$|R
40|$|Annoyance due to {{relatively}} {{high levels of}} sound and noise, above 50 dB, {{has been well documented}} in noise assessment literature. The potential for annoyance or disturbance from low amplitude sound, below 50 dB to the threshold of an individual’s hearing, is not as well documented. The thesis presents a new approach to the measurement and assessment of <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise</b> and low amplitude sound. Acoustical and sound quality measures are integrated with measures of loudness, pitch, dissonance and tonality to provide physical measures of sound. Individual amenity is assessed with respect to personal noise sensitivity and personal attitudes to sound in the environment, the environment itself and the perceived qualities of the audible sound. A decision-support methodology to integrate perceived noise with noise performance indicators, annoyance criteria, personal noise sensitivity and amenity is presented. A method for rating <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise</b> is derived. Designs for sound measurement and calibration instrumentation are described.

40|$|PURPOSE: Open-plan {{classroom}} {{styles are}} increasingly being adopted in Australia despite evidence that their high <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise</b> levels adversely affect learning. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a new Australian speech perception task (the Mealings, Demuth, Dillon, and Buchholz Classroom Speech Perception Test) and use it in an open-plan classroom to assess how <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise</b> affects speech perception. METHOD: The first part of this article describes how the online 4 -picture choice speech perception task materials were created. The second part focuses on the study involving twenty-two 5 - to 6 -year-old children in an open-plan classroom who completed the task while other classes engaged in quiet and noisy activities. RESULTS: Children's performance accuracy, number of responses, and speed were lower in the noisy condition compared with the quiet condition. In addition, children's speech perception scores decreased the farther away they were seated from the loudspeaker. Overall, the children understood and were engaged in the task, demonstrating that it is an appropriate tool for assessing speech perception live in the classroom with 5 - to 6 -year-old children. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the Mealings, Demuth, Dillon, and Buchholz Classroom Speech Perception Test is a helpful tool for assessing speech perception in classrooms and that it would be beneficial to use in future research investigating how classroom design and noise affect speech perception. 13 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Gross {{measures}} of community annoyance with <b>intrusive</b> <b>noises</b> {{have been made}} in a number of real environment surveys which indicate that aircraft noise may have to be reduced 30 - 40 EPNdb before it will generally be considered acceptable. Interview studies, however, cannot provide the precise information which is needed by noise abatement engineers of the variable human response to different types and degrees of noise exposure. A new methodological field-survey approach has been developed to provide such information. The integrated attitudes and experiences of a random sample of subjects in the real environment are obtained by a prior field survey. Then these subjects record their more precise responses to controlled noise exposures in a new realistic laboratory. The laboratory is a sound chamber furnished as a typical living room (18 ft x 14 ft) and subjects watch a color TV program while they judge simulated aircraft flyovers that occur at controlled levels and intervals. Methodological experiments indicate that subjects in the laboratory have the sensation that the airplanes are actually moving overhead across the ceiling of the chamber.

40|$|Open plan classrooms, {{where several}} class bases {{share the same}} space, have {{recently}} re-emerged in Australian primary schools. This paper compiled the results of three recent studies to compare both the acoustic parameters and speech perception test results in four different Kindergarten classrooms (an enclosed classroom with 25 students, a double classroom with 44 students, an untreated linear fully open plan triple classroom with 91 students, and a purpose-built semi-open plan K- 6 classroom with 205 students) with the children's ratings about how well they could hear their teacher. Compiling these results allowed a regression analyses to be undertaken to establish the acoustic limits needed for children to rate they could hear their teacher 'well' (here defined as the 'hear well' criteria). Ambient noise levels, <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise</b> levels, and teacher's speech levels were recorded during different activities and room impulse responses were recorded for different teaching scenarios. From these recordings average noise levels, signal-to-noise ratios, speech transmission index scores, and reverberation times were calculated. These parameters were compared to the current Australian/New Zealand acoustic standards for classrooms (AS/NZS 2107 : 2000), the acoustic recommendations in the literature for classrooms with 5 - 6 -year-old children, and the derived 'hear well' criteria. The results revealed much higher <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise</b> levels in the two largest open plan classrooms (especially the untreated triple classroom), resulting in signal-to-noise ratios and speech transmission index scores to be well below the 'hear well' criteria. Results from the speech perception task also revealed poorer scores and slower response times in the triple open plan classroom {{compared to the other}} classrooms. Additionally, children's speech perception abilities decreased the further away they were seated from the teacher in the classrooms with higher noise levels resulting in scores outside the 'hear well' criteria. These results suggest students may have difficulty listening and learning in open plan classrooms and teachers are likely to strain their voice from needing to speak above a comfortable level to be heard. Additionally, the regression analysis results from the children's questionnaires confirmed that the acoustic recommendations suggested in the literature need to be met in order for the children to be able to hear their teacher 'well'. These results suggest that it may be beneficial for Australia to implement acoustic standards for unoccupied and occupied classrooms and have enforced criteria for classroom designs to ensure they meet these standards so children are comfortable and able to learn effectively in every educational setting. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Open plan classrooms, {{where several}} classes {{are in the}} same room, have {{recently}} re-emerged in Australian primary schools. This paper explores how the acoustics of four Kindergarten classrooms [an enclosed classroom (25 children), double classroom (44 children), fully open plan triple classroom (91 children), and a semi-open plan K- 6 " 21 st century learning space" (205 children) ] affect speech perception. Twenty-two to 23 5 - 6 -year-old children in each classroom participated in an online four-picture choice speech perception test while adjacent classes engaged in quiet versus noisy activities. The noise levels recorded during the test were higher the larger the classroom, except in the noisy condition for the K- 6 classroom, possibly due to acoustic treatments. Linear mixed effects models revealed children's performance accuracy and speed decreased as noise level increased. Additionally, children's speech perception abilities decreased the further away they were seated from the loudspeaker in noise levels above 50 dBA. These results suggest that fully open plan classrooms are not appropriate learning environments for critical listening activities with young children due to their high <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise</b> levels which negatively affect speech perception. If open plan classrooms are desired, they need to be acoustically designed to be appropriate for critical listening activities. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Residual {{environmental}} sound can mask intrusive 4 (unwanted) sound. It is {{a factor}} that can affect noise impacts and must be considered both in noise-impact studies and in noise-mitigation designs. Models for quantitative prediction of sensation level (audibility) and psychological effects of <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise</b> require an input with 1 / 3 octave-band spectral resolution of environmental masking noise. However, the majority of published residual environmental masking-noise data are given with either octave-band frequency resolution or only single A-weighted decibel values. A model has been developed that enables estimation of 1 / 3 octave-band residual environmental masking-noise spectra and relates certain environmental parameters to A-weighted sound level. This model provides a correlation among three environmental conditions: measured residual A-weighted sound-pressure level, proximity to a major roadway, and population density. Cited field-study data were used to compute the most probable 1 / 3 octave-band sound-pressure spectrum corresponding to any selected one of these three inputs. In turn, such spectra {{can be used as}} an input to models for prediction of noise impacts. This paper discusses specific algorithms included in the newly developed computer program ENMASK. In addition, the relative audibility of the environmental masking-noise spectra at different A-weighted sound levels is discussed, which is determined by using the methodology of program ENAUDIBL...|$|E

They can suffer from sleep disturbance, especially at night, but they are often too ill {{to cope with the}} poor environment. This article investigates the acoustic environment of typical intensive care wards in the UK, based on long period nocturnal measurements, and examines the differences between singlebed and multibed wards, using statistical analysis. It has been shown that the acoustic environment differs significantly every night. There are also significant differences between the noise levels in the singlebed and multibed wards, where acoustic ceilings are present. Despite the similar background noises in both ward types, more <b>intrusive</b> <b>noises</b> tend to originate from the multibed wards, while more extreme sounds are likely to occur in the single wards. The sound levels in the measured wards for each night are in excess of the World Health Organization′s (WHO) guide levels by at least 20 dBA, dominantly at the middle frequencies. Although the sound level at night varies less than that in the daytime, the nocturnal acoustic environment is not dependant on any specific time, thus neither the noisiest nor quietest period can be determined. It is expected that the statistical analysis of the collected data will provide essential information for the development of relevant guidelines and noise reduction strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} “quiet ” as an “environmental value ” in terms of amenity and wellbeing from a legislative context. Critical review of two pieces of environmental legislation from Australia and New Zealand forms {{the basis of the}} paper. The Australian legislation is Queensland’s Environmental Protection Act, and the New Zealand legislation is that nation’s Resource Management Act. Quiet is part of the psychoacoustic continuum between a tranquil and an intrusively noisy sound environment. As such, quiet possesses intrinsic value in terms of overall sound within the environment (soundscape) and to individuals and communities. In both pieces of legislation, guidance, either directly or indirectly, is given to “maximum ” sound levels to describe the acoustic environment. Only in Queensland is wellbeing and amenity described as environmental values, while in the New Zealand approach, amenity is identified as the core value to defend, but guidance is not well established. Wellbeing can be related to degrees of quietness and the absence of <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise,</b> the character of sound within an environment (“soundscape”), as well as the overall level of sound. The quality of life experienced by individuals is related to that person’s physical and mental health, sense of amenity and wellbeing.

Due to its potential to reduce energy consumption and thus reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, this technology has been well established in many countries in the world. It is still at a development stage in the United Kingdom (UK), but the UK market is growing rapidly with an ever increasing number of installations each year. It is also considered that the heat pump technology can make important contributions to the UK’s CO 2 target, which is cutting CO 2 emissions by 34 % of 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 % by 2050. This thesis mainly discusses the application of heat pump systems in residential buildings. It introduces how the system works, heat pump systems’ types, the current and potential deployment {{of the system and}} its cost, design and installation. Although heat pump systems are being increasingly installed around the world, {{there are only a few}} current studies on their actual performance. Therefore, this study analyzes the effectiveness of heat pump systems by providing reasonable comfort at an affordable cost in comparison to conventional heating systems through a field study. It indicates that the GSHP system provides the highest comfortable level of heat, with relatively low energy consumption (cost affordability) and CO 2 emission. The only negative aspect is the higher installation cost when compared to conventional heating systems. To find whether the GSHP users are satisfied with the system performance and how their operations would impact the system efficiency, a survey was carried out among 162 GSHP users. It is found that GSHP can meet the heating and DHW demand of residential buildings with a relatively low cost. But a sizable amount of users experienced various problems with GSHP, including <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise,</b> slow warm up and so on.

One study {{found that there was}} a modest stress (physiological) increase and diminished motivation caused by typical office noises, including speech. It is recommended that the use of sound masking is {{under the control of the}} worker. Another study suggested that changes in level are an important factor, but that habituation to the noise can occur. In the office, habituation can be interpreted to mean [...] "I’ve grown used to the noise and it no longer distracts me" [...] or [...] "Since I cannot do anything about it, I will have to live with it." [...] Another study point out that the specific information within the speech intrusion is not important nor is the [...] "intensity" [...] (level) of the sound between 48 and 76 dBA. Since the energy level of the louder sound was 1,000 times that of the least, one must assume that distraction occurred for all levels. For arithmetic tasks, both speech and non-verbal <b>intrusive</b> <b>noises</b> caused significant performance decreases. For [...] "prose tasks" [...] it was found that speech caused a greater performance decrease than nonverbal noises. In another study [...] the author added several significant observations. It was found that [...] "during a serial recall task, the accuracy of report decreases 30 to 50%." [...] When the intrusive speech was increasingly filtered to a meaningless mumble, there was a monotonic increase in performance. Finally, the author states: [...] "Perhaps the single feature that makes the irrelevant speech phenomena so fascinating is that the processing of sound is obligatory; it appears beyond the individual’s control." [...] Within the references cited above are further references to earlier works on this subject. There are several implications for a sound masking system. The masking must reduce the difference between the steady background level and the transient levels associated with both speech and other sounds. Motivation and productivity are improved when this is accomplished. The masking sound itself must not change rapidly and should be as meaningless as possible.|$|R
40|$|Rotorcraft Blade-Vortex Interaction (BVI) {{remains one}} of the most {{challenging}} flow phenomenon to simulate numerically. Over the past decade, the HART-II rotor test and its extensive experimental dataset has been a major database for validation of CFD codes. Its strong BVI signature, with high levels of <b>intrusive</b> <b>noise</b> and vibrations, makes it a difficult test for computational methods. The main challenge is to accurately capture and preserve the vortices which interact with the rotor, while predicting correct blade deformations and loading. This doctoral dissertation presents the application of a coupled CFD/CSD methodology to the problem of helicopter BVI and compares three levels of fidelity for aerodynamic modeling: a hybrid lifting-line/free-wake (wake coupling) method, with modified compressible unsteady model; a hybrid URANS/free-wake method; and a URANS-based wake capturing method, using multiple overset meshes to capture the entire flow field. To further increase numerical correlation, three helicopter fuselage models are implemented in the framework. The first is a high resolution 3 D GPU panel code; the second is an immersed boundary based method, with 3 D elliptic grid adaption; the last one uses a body-fitted, curvilinear fuselage mesh. The main contribution of this work is the implementation and systematic comparison of multiple numerical methods to perform BVI modeling. The trade-offs between solution accuracy and computational cost are highlighted for the different approaches. Various improvements have been made to each code to enhance physical fidelity, while advanced technologies, such as GPU computing, have been employed to increase efficiency. The resulting numerical setup covers all aspects of the simulation creating a truly multi-fidelity and multi-physics framework. Overall, the wake capturing approach showed the best BVI phasing correlation and good blade deflection predictions, with slightly under-predicted aerodynamic loading magnitudes. However, it proved to be much more expensive than the other two methods. Wake coupling with RANS solver had very good loading magnitude predictions, and therefore good acoustic intensities, with acceptable computational cost. The lifting-line based technique often had over-predicted aerodynamic levels, due to the degree of empiricism of the model, but its very short run-times, thanks to GPU technology, makes it a very attractive approach...|$|E

The experiment was conducted on a four-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection and turbocharged diesel engine which runs with biodiesel (B 50 and B 100) and pure diesel. The signals of acoustic, vibration and in-cylinder pressure were measured during the experiment. To correlate the combustion process and the acoustic characteristics, both phenomena have been investigated. The acoustic analysis resulted in the sound level being increased with increasing of engine loads and speeds as well as the sound characteristics being closely correlated to the combustion process. However, acoustic signals are highly sensitive to the ambient conditions and <b>intrusive</b> background <b>noise.</b> Therefore, the spectral subtraction was employed to minimize the effects of background noise in order to enhance the signal to noise ratio. In addition, the acoustic characteristics of CI engine running with different fuels (biodiesel blends and diesel) was analysed for comparison. The results show that the sound energy level of acoustic signals is slightly higher when the engine fuelled by biodiesel and its blends than that of fuelled by normal diesel. Hence, the acoustic characteristics of the CI engine will have useful information for engine condition monitoring and fuel content estimation...|$|R

In addition there was a no-training comparison group. Acting performance was evaluated by three experts from both filmed, studio monologues and Hamlet excerpts on the stage of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. Neurofeedback learning reached an asymptote earlier as did identification of the required mental state following training in the ReaCTor training compared with the computer screen, though groups reached the same asymptote. These advantages were paralleled by higher ratings of acting performance overall, well-rounded performance, and especially the creativity subscale including imaginative expression, conviction and characterisation. On the Flow State scales both neurofeedback groups scored higher than the no-training controls on self-ratings of sense of control, confidence and feeling at-one. This is the first demonstration of enhancement of artistic performance with eyes-open neurofeedback training, previously demonstrated only with eyes-closed slow-wave training. Efficacy is attributed to psychological engagement through the ecologically relevant learning context of the acting-space, putatively allowing transfer to the real world otherwise achieved with slow-wave training through imaginative visualisation.

40|$|In this, Part 1 of the paper, {{the sound}} {{generation}} of a diesel engine is modelled {{based upon the}} combustion process, and time-frequency analysis is used to reveal the underlying characteristics of the sound waves. Simulation shows that the frequency bandwidth of the generated acoustic signals is significantly widened around the engine"s top dead center (TDC) positions, with the energy concentrated predominantly at the firing frequency and its harmonics. As anticipated, the model predicts an increase in sound level with increasing engine load and speed, and the model-predicted noise generation is correlated with waveforms extracted from intrusively-monitored cylinder pressure. Real monitored data, taken in an ordinary engine test-bay environment and without special acoustic monitoring precautions, is shown to be highly contaminated due to adverse environmental acoustics and <b>intrusive</b> background <b>noise.</b> The representation of acoustic signals using the smoothed pseudo-Wigner- Ville distribution (SPWVD) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT), however, is found to permit recognition of the adverse influences of the measurement environment.

40|$|Plans {{to design}} future very large {{commercial}} aeroplanes have triggered highly sophisticated research {{in several areas}} of acoustics, one of which pertains to the aerodynamically induced noise of the approaching aeroplane with landing gears and high lift devices deployed. This type of noise, termed "airframe noise" {{has evolved into a}} major source of concern in attempting to meet new stringent ICAO noise limits after the great successes of engine noise reduction. DLR was involved in a number of pertinent substantial research projects to specifically study such sources and find ways for their control. Here excellent large acoustic wind tunnels (the German Dutch Wind Tunnel, DNW, being a prime example) had been indispensable to investigate the relevant aeroacoustics and to develop technically feasible noise reduction measures to reduce landing gear noise and the noise from high-lift devices on wings. In coping with the noise of modern high-speed helicopters, dedicated as well as cooperative DLR research on rotor systems has helped to clarify the complex physical mechanisms responsible for the generation of the highly <b>intrusive</b> impulsive <b>noise</b> ("blade slap"). Means to control the sources of the underlying mechanisms of "high speed impulsive noise" and of "blade vortex interaction noise" have been studied in aeroacoustic wind tunnels and in part successfully transferred to real flight-operational helicopters. Noise from propeller-driven General Aviation aeroplanes has been thoroughly studied in (full-scale) acoustic wind tunnel experiments and new - hitherto unknown - generating mechanisms related to the non-uniform shaft rotation of piston engines which drive the propeller - been identified, amenable to technical control solutions. This keynote survey paper will discuss and exemplify through selected projects and their results DLR's involvement in these various scientific research areas...|$|R
40|$|Public policy {{decisions}} about wind turbine noise face several challenges {{caused by the}} “variability factor. ” Most sound ordinances are based on an average sound level, while neighbor responses are generally based on shorter-term peak noise levels, along with the additional variability in the sound quality of wind turbine noise; increasingly, complaints arise around projects that meet average sound level criteria. At the community scale, different types of communities may {{be more or less}} tolerant of moderately audible wind turbine noise in their rural environments; working farmers and ranchers often consider such noise trivial, while people in towns where more of the population is seeking peace and quiet may find the same <b>noise</b> <b>intrusive.</b> On the landscape scale, of course, atmospheric conditions can have dramatic effects on sound propagation, absorption, and audibility. Perhaps most importantly, real-world source levels of individual turbines can also vary greatly from idealized sound power levels used in sound modeling—minor wear, wind shear (especially directional), and inflow turbulence from nearby turbine wakes or atmospheric turbulence, can all increase the sound output of individual turbines. Both the transient peak sound levels caused b...|$|R
40|$|As a {{rotorcraft}} descends or manoeuvres, {{the interactions}} which occur between the rotor blades and vortical structures within the rotor wake produce highly impulsive loads on the blades and with these a highly <b>intrusive</b> external <b>noise.</b> Brown’s Vorticity Transport Model {{has been used}} to investigate the influence of the fidelity of the local blade aerodynamic model {{on the quality of the}} prediction of the high-frequency airloads associated with blade-vortex interactions and thus on the accuracy with which the acoustic signature of the aircraft can be predicted. Aerodynamic, wake structure and acoustic predictions using the Vorticity Transport Model are compared against the HART II wind tunnel data for an experimental rotor based on the characteristics of the Bo 105 rotor. The model can resolve very accurately the structure of the wake, and allows significant flexibility in the way that the blade loading can be represented. The predictions of two models for the local blade aerodynamics are compared for all three of the HART II flight cases. The first model is a simple lifting-line model and the second is a somewhat more sophisticated lifting-chord model based on unsteady thin aerofoil theory. The predicted positions of the vortex cores agree with measured data to within a fraction of the blade chord, and the strength of the vortices is preserved to well downstream of the rotor, essentially independently of the resolution of the calculation or the blade model used. A marked improvement in accuracy of the predicted high-frequency airloads and acoustic signature of the HART II rotor is obtained when the lifting-chord model for the blade aerodynamics is used instead of the lifting-line type approach. Errors in the amplitude and phase of the loading peaks are reduced and the quality of the prediction is affected to a lesser extent by the computational resolution of the wake. Predictions of the acoustic signature of the rotor are similarly affected, with the lifting-chord model at the highest resolution producing the best representation of the distribution of sound pressure on the ground plane below the rotor.

40|$|Manufacturers of {{business}} jets have {{expressed interest in}} designing and building {{a new generation of}} supersonic jets that produce shaped sonic booms of lower peak amplitude than booms created by the previous generation of supersonic aircraft. To determine if these 2 ̆ 2 low 2 ̆ 2 booms are less <b>intrusive</b> and the <b>noise</b> exposure is more acceptable to communities, new laboratory testing to evaluate people 2 ̆ 7 s responses must occur. To guide aircraft design, objective measures that predict human response to modified sonic boom waveforms and other impulsive sounds are needed. The current research phase is focused on understanding how people will react to booms when heard inside, and must therefore include considerations of house type and the indoor acoustic environment. A test was conducted in NASA Langley 2 ̆ 7 s Interior Effects Room (IER), with the collaboration of NASA Langley engineers. This test was focused on the effects of low-frequency content and of vibration, and subjects sat in a small living room environment. A second test was conducted in a sound booth at Purdue University, using similar sounds played back over earphones. The sounds in this test contained less very-low-frequency energy due to limitations in the playback, and the laboratory setting is a less natural environment. For the purpose of comparison, and to improve the robustness of the human response prediction models, both sonic booms and other more familiar transient sounds were used in the tests. In the Purdue test, binaural simulations of the interior sounds were included to compare responses to those sounds with responses to playback of binaural recordings taken in the IER. Major conclusions of this research were that subject responses were highly correlated between the two tests, and that annoyance models including Loudness, maximum Loudness Derivative, Duration, and Heaviness terms predicted annoyance accurately. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of roads near protected forest areas alters ecosystem function by creating habitat fragmentation and through several {{direct and indirect}} negative effects such as increased pollution, animal mortality through collisions, disturbance caused by excessive noise and wind turbulence. Noise in particular may have strong negative effects on animal groups such as frogs and birds, that rely on sound for communication as it can negatively interfere with vocalizations used for territorial defense or courtship. Thus, birds {{are expected to be}} less abundant close to the road where noise levels are high. In this study, we examined the effects of road traffic noise levels on forest bird species in a protected tropical forest in Costa Rica. Data collection was conducted in a forest segment of the Carara National Park adjacent to the Coastal Highway. We carried out 120 ten minute bird surveys and measured road noise levels 192 times from the 19 th to the 23 rd of April and from the 21 st to the 28 th of November, 2008. To maximize bird detection for the species richness estimates we operated six 12 m standard mist nets simultaneously with the surveys. The overall mist-netting effort was 240 net/h. In addition, we estimated traffic volumes by tallying the number of vehicles passing by the edge of the park using 24 one hour counts throughout the study. We found that the relative abundance of birds and bird species richness decreased significantly with the increasing traffic noise in the dry and wet season. Noise decreased significantly and in a logarithmic way with distance from the road in both seasons. However, noise levels at any given distance were significantly higher in the dry compared to the wet season. Our results suggest that noise might be an important factor influencing road bird avoidance as measured by species richness and relative abundance. Since the protected forest in question is located in a national park subjected to tourist visitation, these results have conservation as well as management implications. A decrease in bird species richness and bird abundance due to <b>intrusive</b> road <b>noise</b> could negatively affect the use of trails by visitors. Alternatives for noise attenuation in the affected forest area include the enforcement of speed limits and the planting of live barriers. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (2) : 969 - 980. Epub 2011 June 01. Las carreteras cerca de bosques alteran la función del ecosistema por fragmentación del hábitat y tienen otros efectos negativos como contaminación, mortalidad de animales y ruido excesivo; sobre todo en animales como ranas y aves que dependen del sonido para comunicarse. Se espera menos abundancia de aves cerca de la carretera donde el ruido es alto. Este estudio evalúa los efectos del ruido por carretera sobre las aves en un bosque tropical de Costa Rica. También realizamos censos de aves y medimos el ruido del 19 al 23 de abril y del 21 al 28 de noviembre 2008. Además, utilizamos redes de niebla para maximizar la detección de aves en la estimación de riqueza de especies. La abundancia de aves así como la riqueza de especies decrecieron significativamente con el incremento del ruido tanto en la estación seca como en la lluviosa. El ruido disminuyó en forma logarítmica con el aumento en la distancia a la carretera y fue más alto durante la estación seca. Nuestros resultados sugieren que las aves tienden generalmente a evitar el ruido del tráfico y tienen implicaciones en la conservación y manejo del área protegid...|$|R
