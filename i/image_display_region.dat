30|$|For animal experiments, the {{institutional}} and national {{guide for the}} care and use of laboratory animals was followed. CD 1 nude mice (n[*]=[*] 36, female, 6  weeks old, 18 – 22  g body weight) were subcutaneously injected in the right thigh with 2 [*]×[*] 106 PC- 3 cells in 300  μl of a medium-to-matrigel solution (50 : 50, v:v, BD Biosciences). After tumor growth (approximately 20  days), mice were divided in four groups (BN 1, BN 4, BN 7, and BN 8). DOTA-PEG 4 -BN conjugates were radiolabelled with 111 In as described elsewhere [26], and 1.85  MBq (0.25  μg, 7.4  MBq/μg in 100  μl NaCl) of radiopharmaceutical was injected in the tail vein of each animal. Injected dose was determined by counting the syringe before and after injection. At 1  h post injection, three mice per group were anesthetized and placed on a horizontal support for planar imaging. The same procedure was repeated at 6  h and 24  h post injection. Images were acquired for 60 to 90  s with a high-resolution scintigraphic camera [27] equipped with a square tungsten collimator integrated with a CsI(Tl) scintillation structure, coupled to a Hamamatsu H 8500 Flat Panel Position Sensitive Photomultiplier Tube (PSPMT), a pure tungsten shielding housing, a charge readout electronics, and a data acquisition system for online <b>image</b> <b>display.</b> <b>Region</b> of interest (ROI) analysis was performed by drawing a region over the visible tumor (target) and copying it to the opposite thigh (background). The counts in the tumor ROI divided by the counts in the background ROI provided tumor-to-background (T/B) ratios. After each imaging session, mice were euthanized. The organs and the tumors were excised and weighed, and the radioactivity was determined using a single well γ-counter. Results were expressed as percentage of injected dose per gram (%ID/g) of tissue.|$|E

Focus plus context screens Many professional computer users, such as chip designers or geographic information specialists, work with visual documents that are too large and detailed to fit on their screens. Consequently, users have to access information sequentially using zooming and panning. Focus plus context screens are {{a new type of}} computer screen that addresses this issue.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the efficacy of using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a non-invasive tool for the monitoring of gene therapy for muscular dystrophy. The clinical investigations for this family of diseases often involve surgical biopsy which limits the amount of information that can be obtained due to the invasive nature of the procedure. Thus, other non-invasive tools may provide more opportunities for disease assessment and treatment responses. In order to explore this, dystrophic mdx 4 cv mice were systemically treated with a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector containing a codon-optimized micro-dystrophin gene. Multi-parametric MRI of T 2, magnetization transfer, and diffusion effects alongside 3 -D volume measurements were then utilized to monitor disease/treatment progression. Mice were imaged at 10 weeks of age for pre-treatment, then again post-treatment at 8, 16, and 24 week time points. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by physiological assays for improvements in function and quantification of expression. Tissues from the hindlimbs were collected for histological analysis after the final time point for comparison with MRI results. We found that introduction of the micro-dystrophin gene restored some aspects of normal muscle histology and pathology such as decreased necrosis and resistance to contraction-induced injury. T 2 relaxation values showed percentage decreases across all muscle types measured (tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus) when treated groups were compared to untreated groups. Additionally, the differences between groups were statistically significant for the tibialis anterior as well. The diffusion measurements showed a wider range of percentage changes and less statistical significance while the magnetization transfer effect measurements showed minimal change. MR <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> hyper-intense <b>regions</b> of muscle that correlated with muscle pathology in histological sections. T 2 relaxation, alongside diffusion and magnetization transfer effects provides useful data towards the goal of non-invasively monitoring the treatment of muscular dystrophy...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} use of film-based periapical radiographs and digital {{panoramic}} <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> on monitor and glossy paper {{in the assessment of}} the periapical status of the teeth. Methodology: A total of 86 subjects were examined. All participants underwent a full-mouth radiographic survey (14 periapical radiographs) and a digital panoramic radiography. The periapical status of all appraised teeth was assessed. Results: Periapical radiographs allowed the assessment of the periapical status of a significantly higher percentage of teeth (87. 4 %) Digital radiography had a significantly reduced potential to allow assessment of the periapical status (p< 0. 01). Only 58. 0 % and 34. 3 % of teeth could be appraised using digital panoramic <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> on monitor and glossy paper respectively (p< 0. 01). The total percentage of teeth with periapical pathosis was four-fold higher when assessed with digital panoramic <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> on glossy paper compared with periapical radiographs (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Periapical radiographs allowed the assessment of a significantly higher percentage of teeth when comparing to digital radiography, which had a significantly lower potency in the assessment of periapical status of the teeth. Digital panoramic <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> on a monitor resulted in a significantly higher percentage of appraised teeth compared to digital <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> on glossy paper.
