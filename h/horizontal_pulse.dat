40|$|With the {{adaptation}} of the FLASH code we simulate magnetohydrodynamic-gravity waves and vortices {{as well as their}} response in the magnetized three-dimensional (3 D) solar atmosphere at different heights to understand the localized energy transport processes. In the solar atmosphere strongly structured by gravitational and magnetic forces, we launch a localized velocity pulse (in horizontal and vertical components) within a bottom layer of 3 D solar atmosphere modelled by initial VAL-IIIC conditions, which triggers waves and vortices. The rotation direction of vortices depends on the orientation of an initial perturbation. The vertical driver generates magnetoacoustic-gravity waves which result in oscillations of the transition region, and it leads to the eddies with their symmetry axis oriented vertically. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>pulse</b> excites all magnetohydrodynamic-gravity waves and horizontally oriented eddies. These waves propagate upwards, penetrate the transition region, and enter the solar corona. In the high-beta plasma regions the magnetic field lines move with the plasma and the temporal evolution show that they swirl with eddies. We estimate the energy fluxes carried out by the waves in the magnetized solar atmosphere and conclude that such wave dynamics and vortices may be significant in transporting the energy to sufficiently balance the energy losses in the localized corona. Moreover, the structure of the transition region highly affects such energy transports, and causes the channelling of the propagating waves into the inner corona.

30|$|Obviously, {{there are}} some {{differences}} in the properties of near- and far-field earthquakes. Therefore, it seems necessary to investigate {{the effects of these}} differences on the buildings and to classify these effects. A distance shorter than 15  km from a fault line is referred to as near-fault zone; otherwise, it is known as far-field zone. In the near-field zone, earthquake effects depend on three main factors, namely (1) rupture mechanism; (2) rupture propagation directions with respect to the site, and (3) permanent displacement due to fault slippage. These factors create two phenomena, which are rupture directivity and step fling. Rupture directivity is also divided into two phenomena, which are forward directivity and backward directivity. Forward directivity effects lead to horizontal oscillations in the direction perpendicular to the fault line {{in the form of a}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>pulse,</b> which has much more significant effects on the structures in comparison with a parallel pulse to the fault line. These pulses lead to an increase in the nonlinear deformation demands of the structures. Near-fault ground motions have short duration with high amplitude and high to medium oscillation periods (International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology 2007; Alavi 2001; Galal and Ghobarah 2006; Stewart et al. 2001). The recorded databases of Kobe and Chi–Chi earthquakes were used to analyse the structures. Regard of FEMA 356, the geotechnical specifications should be taken into account in selection process of the earthquake record databases (Federal Emergency Management Agency 2000). Therefore, the frequency contents, spectrum, effective duration, and type of soil could be varied regard of construction site (Federal Emergency Management Agency 2000).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Structural {{damage to}} r. c. {{buildings}} {{located in a}} near-fault area has been observed during strong ground motions, with long-duration <b>horizontal</b> <b>pulses</b> and high values of the ratio between the peak value of the vertical acceleration and the analogous value of the horizontal acceleration. The design provisions of current seismic codes are generally not very accurate for assessing the structural effects of near-fault ground motions. In the present work, six- and twelve-storey r. c. spatial frames are designed according to {{the provisions of the}} Italian seismic code, considering horizontal and vertical seismic loads in a high-risk seismic region and assuming low and high ductility classes. A lumped plasticity model based on the Haar-Kàrmàn principle is used to describe the inelastic behavior of the r. c. frame members. In particular, the lumped plasticity model for a column includes a piecewise linearization of the bounding surface of the axial load-biaxial bending moment elastic domain, at the end sections where inelastic deformations are expected. Moreover, the lumped plasticity model for a girder takes into account the potential plastic hinges along the span, due to the vertical ground mo-tion, so avoiding the computational effort required by the sub-discretization of the frame member. The nonlinear dynamic response of the test structures is studied with reference to the horizontal and vertical components of near-fault records. The occurrence of a directivity effect at arbitrary orientations is checked rotating the horizontal components of the se-lected motions, rather than considering only fault-normal and fault-parallel orientations...|$|R

The ground motion also changed its character with distance, losing its pulse-like directional characteristic and becoming isotropic. Computed response spectra are presented and the large spectrum ordinates for this shock of relatively small magnitude and moderate destructiveness indicate that in an engineering sense the Parkfield ground motion is in a different class from such large destructive ground motions as El Centro 1940, Tehachapi 1952, and Olympia 1949...|$|R

Optical supercontinuum generation in the proposed fiber using a 1064 nm pump source with peak power of 1 kW has been also presented. Finite difference time domain method (FDTD) has been employed to examine the optical properties such as fiber birefringence, mode field, V-parameter, walk-off and optical nonlinearity, while the Split-step Fourier method is used to solve the nonlinear Schrodinger equation felicitating the study of supercontinuum generation.

5000|$|For a color TV {{to recover}} hue {{information}} from the color subcarrier, it must have a zero phase reference to replace the previously suppressed carrier. The NTSC signal includes a short sample of this reference signal, known as the colorburst, located on the 'back porch' of each <b>horizontal</b> synchronization <b>pulse.</b> The color burst consists of a minimum of eight cycles of the unmodulated (fixed phase and amplitude) color subcarrier. The TV receiver has a [...] "local oscillator", which is synchronized with these color bursts. Combining this reference phase signal derived from the color burst with the chrominance signal's amplitude and phase allows {{the recovery of the}} 'I' and 'Q' signals which when combined with the Luminance information allows the reconstruction of a color image on the screen. Color TV has been said to really be colored TV because of the total separation of the brightness part of the picture from the color portion. In CRT televisions, the NTSC signal is turned into three color signals called Red, Green and Blue, each controlling that color electron gun. TV sets with digital circuitry use sampling techniques to process the signals but the end result is the same. For both analog and digital sets processing an analog NTSC signal, the original three color signals (Red, Green and Blue) are transmitted using three discrete signals (Luminance, I and Q) and then recovered as three separate colors and combined as a color image.|$|R

40|$|The {{elimination}} of shifted and attenuated {{replicas of the}} main image caused by multipath propagation in video transmission has been generating increased interest. We present a delayed least mean squares (DLMS) traversal, systolic pipelined adaptive filter which supports an adequately high sampling rate. We do not introduce any tracking delay for systolization while requiring significantly reduced adaptation delay and silicon area, and providing a sufficient high SNR in the de-ghosted image. Both pre-ghosts and post-ghosts are efficiently cancelled. The modularity of the system permits filter-order scaling without additional design effort or a degradation in the system clock rate. We achieve systolization by first creating an f-slow simulator of the DLMS algorithm, with a system clock rate that is f times the sampling rate, and then folding the adaptation and filtering computations of each tap on to a single multiply-accumulate hardware module. We further pipeline the system {{to the level of}} a 4 → 2 compressor using carry-save arithmetic for both the multiply and the add operations, so that the system sustains a sampling rate of 1 /(ft_A), where t_A is the combinational delay through the compressor. We use the <b>horizontal</b> synchronization <b>pulse</b> as our ghost cancelling reference. This has all the desired features of a good adaptation reference signal and ensures that the system impulse response is updated once in every horizontal retrace.
