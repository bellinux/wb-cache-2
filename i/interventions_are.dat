25|$|Thrombosis prevention, {{also known}} as {{thrombosis}} prophylaxis, are treatments to prevent the formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel. Some people are at a higher risk {{for the formation of}} blood clots than others. Prevention measures or <b>interventions</b> <b>are</b> usually begun after surgery as people are at higher risk due to immobility. There are medication-based interventions and non-medication-based interventions. The risk of developing blood clots can be modified by life style modifications, the discontinuation of oral contraceptives, and weight loss. In those at high risk both <b>interventions</b> <b>are</b> often used. The treatments to prevent the formation of blood clots is balanced against the risk of bleeding.|$|E

25|$|A {{protocol}} {{suggested by}} Mercer and Pignotti uses a taxonomy intended to classify on both research quality and other criteria. In this protocol, evidence-based <b>interventions</b> <b>are</b> those supported by work with randomized designs employing comparisons to established treatments, independent replications of results, blind evaluation of outcomes, {{and the existence}} of a manual. Evidence-supported <b>interventions</b> <b>are</b> those supported by nonrandomized designs, including within-subjects designs, and meeting the criteria for the previous category. Evidence-informed treatments involve case studies or interventions tested on populations other than the targeted group, without independent replications; a manual exists, and {{there is no evidence of}} harm or potential for harm. Belief-based interventions have no published research reports or reports based on composite cases; they may be based on religious or ideological principles or may claim a basis in accepted theory without an acceptable rationale; there may or may not be a manual, and there is no evidence of harm or potential for harm. Finally, the category of potentially harmful treatments includes interventions such that harmful mental or physical effects have been documented, or a manual or other source shows the potential for harm.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacological <b>interventions</b> <b>are</b> used {{to lower}} the sex drive in general, which can ease the {{management}} of pedophilic feelings, but does not change sexual preference. Antiandrogens work by interfering with the activity of testosterone. Cyproterone acetate (Androcur) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) are the most commonly used. The efficacy of antiantrogens has some support, but few high-quality studies exist. Cyproterone acetate has the strongest evidence for reducing sexual arousal, while findings on medroxyprogesterone acetate have been mixed.|$|E

Undergraduates (378 women and 210 men, primarily White) at a central coast California university completed an anonymous questionnaire measuring five barriers identified by the situational model of bystander intervention (Latane and Darley 1970) and bystander intervention behavior. As expected, the barriers were negatively correlated with <b>intervention,</b> <b>were</b> greater for men than for women, and <b>intervention</b> likelihood <b>was</b> affected by perceptions of victim worthiness, especially for men.

2500|$|Applied {{behavior}} analysis (ABA) is {{a scientific}} discipline concerned with developing techniques {{based on the}} principles of learning and applying these to change behavior of social significance. Baer et al. outline two methods that may be used in applied settings to demonstrate control while maintaining ethical standards. These are the reversal design and the multiple baseline design. In the reversal design, the experimenter first measures the behavior of choice, introduces an intervention, and then measures the behavior again. Then, the <b>intervention</b> <b>is</b> removed, or reduced, and the behavior is measured yet again. The <b>intervention</b> <b>is</b> effective {{to the extent that the}} behavior changes and then changes back in response to these manipulations. [...] The multiple baseline method may be used for behaviors that seem irreversible. Here, several behaviors are measured and then the <b>intervention</b> <b>is</b> applied to each in turn. The effectiveness of the <b>intervention</b> <b>is</b> revealed by changes in just the behavior to which the <b>intervention</b> <b>is</b> being applied.|$|R

Along with ordinary parenting styles, such strategies are frequently used by default for treating those with FAS, as the diagnoses oppositional defiance disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, reactive attachment disorder (RAD) often overlap with FAS (along with ADHD), and these are sometimes thought to benefit from behavioral interventions. Frequently, a person's poor academic achievement results in special education services, which also utilizes principles of learning theory, behavior modification, and outcome-based education.|$|E

25|$|Barnett et al. criticizes peacebuilding {{organizations}} for undertaking supply-driven rather than demand-driven peacebuilding; {{they provide the}} peacebuilding services in which their organization specializes, not necessarily those that the recipient most needs. In addition, he argues that many of their actions are based on organizations precedent rather than empirical analysis of which <b>interventions</b> <b>are</b> and are not effective. More recently, Ben Hillman has criticized international donor efforts to strengthen local governments {{in the wake of}} conflict. He argues that international donors typically do not have the knowledge, skills or resources to bring meaningful change to the way post-conflict societies are governed.|$|E
