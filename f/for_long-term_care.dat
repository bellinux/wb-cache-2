40|$|The {{establishment}} of a system <b>for</b> providing appropriate <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> services <b>for</b> older people is a national issue in Japan, and it will likely become a worldwide issue {{in the years to}} come. Under Japanese <b>Long-term</b> <b>Care</b> Insurance System, <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> is provided based on <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> programs, which were designed by care providers on the basis of <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> service plans, which were designed by care managers. However, defined methodology <b>for</b> designing <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> service plans and care programs has not been established yet. In this paper, we propose models <b>for</b> designing <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> service plans and care programs for older people, both by incorporating the technical issues from previous studies and by redesigning the total methodology according to these studies. Our implementation model consists of “Function,” “Knowledge Structure,” and “Action Flow. ” In addition, we developed the concrete knowledgebases based on the Knowledge Structure by visualizing, summarizing, and structuring the inherent knowledge of healthcare/welfare professionals. As the results of the workshop and retrospective verification, the adequacy of the models was suggested, while some further issues were pointed. Our models, knowledgebases, and application make it possible to ensure the quality of <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> older people...|$|R

40|$|Large {{numbers of}} baby boomers and a shift towards home-based <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> {{designate}} {{a need for a}} greater understanding of caregiver attitudes surrounding the financing of <b>long-term</b> home-based <b>care.</b> This study examined more fully the types of home-based <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> services that family caregivers were utilizing for their parents. In addition, the willingness and ability of caregivers to privately fund these services for aging parents were explored. The study utilized a preexisting data set of qualitative interviews that were conducted with 30 family caregivers helping to provide <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> an elderly parent or older-generation relative. Participants in the sample used many home- and community-based services such as home health aides and nurses, physical therapists, cleaning services and adult day centers. Often these services were funded via Medicare, Medicaid, care recipient funds, state programs, and caregiver funds. In addition, caregivers were often willing, but unable to pay <b>for</b> <b>long-term</b> parent <b>care</b> on their own. Many caregivers in the study found paying <b>for</b> <b>long-term</b> parent <b>care</b> unnecessary. Family expectations, moral and religious responsibility, and a high aversion to nursing home care were cited as reasons for willingness to fund <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> at home. Similarly, lack of family support and other personal obstacles were noted as reasons for inability to pay for care. Those who found payment for care unnecessary noted that care recipients had sufficient funds <b>for</b> their own <b>long-term</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R
