50|$|In February 2006, {{the station}} was granted a {{construction}} permit to begin converting operations to digital television. Upon completion, the station would become a <b>digital</b> <b>repeater</b> of TBN, broadcasting all five TBN services at 19.7 kW (though later signed-on at 2.7 kW). The station was also approved for relocation to channel 47 - {{this is due to}} channels 52 to 69 being phased out of television broadcasting.|$|E

50|$|The digipeater {{is used in}} {{channels}} that transmit data by binary digital signals, in which the data {{is in the form}} of pulses with only two possible values, representing the binary digits 1 and 0. A <b>digital</b> <b>repeater</b> amplifies the signal, and it also may retime, resynchronize, and reshape the pulses. A repeater that performs the retiming or resynchronizing functions may be called a regenerator.|$|E
50|$|After the analogue-to-digital {{conversion}} {{which took}} place on August 31, 2011, CBVT-DT stayed at its pre-transition position on channel 12, allowing CBVE-TV, a repeater of CBMT-DT Montreal, to move from channel 5 to channel 11. Because of potential interference from CFCF-DT in Montreal (which moved its digital signal to channel 12 on the transition date) and reception problems, CBVT-DT will move to channel 25 in December 2011. Channel 25 was previously used by CIVQ-DT, a local <b>digital</b> <b>repeater</b> of Télé-Québec.|$|E

In 2008, KSNW acquired low-power station K06LZ (channel 6, the former K18AA) in Salina, to serve as its repeater in central Kansas; that station was replaced in May of that year by a <b>digital</b> <b>repeater,</b> KSNL-LD.|$|E

50|$|Huaptec got {{the first}} patent in February 2010 for SNMPAGENT {{repeater}} monitoring software (SnmpAgent) V1.0. The same year Huaptec patented 4 more software developments such as LCD repeater monitoring software (LCD monitoring) V1.0, OMC repeater topology management software, OMC repeater monitoring center software(OMC) V1.0 and optical repeater monitoring software V1.0. In 2012 Huaptec acquired a patent for invention of multiple system, multiband, multi-carrier <b>digital</b> <b>repeater</b> based on FPGA. All in all the company owns 1 patent for invention, 6 patents for section material and appearance and 14 patents for software.|$|E
50|$|HABET {{was started}} by the Central Iowa Technical Society (CITS) an Amateur Radio organization. CITS {{launched}} four HABET flights, HABET-1 through HABET-4, 1993-1994, from the rural home of Ralph Wallio, W0RPK, in north central Warren County. HABET-1 was a traffic load test on a packet radio <b>digital</b> <b>repeater</b> which was developed to fly on STS (this payload did not fly on STS but it began the process that resulted in ARISS today). Flights HABET-2, -3 and -4 included GPS telemetry, Amateur Radio repeaters (23>70 cm) and numerous experiments.|$|E
50|$|In April and May 2006, TBN {{applied for}} {{construction}} permits {{for each of}} these repeaters to begin converting operations to digital television. Upon completion, each station will become a <b>digital</b> <b>repeater</b> of TBN, broadcasting all five TBN services. Some of these stations will broadcast at a lower power than they did at analog. Two of these will also have new channel reassignments—W56EB would move to channel 31, and W60CE would relocate to channel 51, in which it would become W51DY. This is due to channels 53 to 69 being phased out of television broadcasting.|$|E
5000|$|Huaptec {{offers a}} variety of solutions, so called {{industrial}} cellular repeaters, to help telecommunications carriers expand the capacity of their mobile broadband networks. Two main types of industrial repeaters Huaptec produces are <b>digital</b> <b>repeaters</b> and <b>digital</b> Fiber DAS. To provide mobile networks operators with remote control over industrial repeaters the company developed and later patented OMC and OMT software.|$|R

50|$|Today, utility poles {{may hold}} {{much more than}} the {{uninsulated}} copper wire that they originally supported. Thicker cables holding many twisted pair, coaxial cable, or even fibre-optic, may be carried. Simple analogue repeaters or other outside plant equipment have long been mounted against poles, and often new digital equipment for multiplexing/demultiplexing or <b>digital</b> <b>repeaters</b> may now be seen. In many places, as seen in the illustration, providers of electricity, television, telephone, street light, traffic signal and other services share poles, either in joint ownership or by renting space to each other. In the United States, ANSI standard 05.1.2008 governs wood pole sizes and strength loading. Utilities that fall under the Rural Electrification Act must also follow the guidelines set forth in RUS Bulletin 1724E-150 (from the US Department of Agriculture) for pole strength and loading.|$|R
50|$|KYOU {{operates}} one <b>digital</b> <b>repeater,</b> K30MG-D channel 30 in Kirksville, {{to extend}} its over-the-air coverage; it has a transmitter northwest of that city. KYOU was acquired by Waitt Media in 1999. That company merged with Raycom Media in December 2003. Raycom already owned ABC affiliate KTVO in Kirksville, Missouri {{at the time and}} could not legally keep both stations because the market has too few channels to legally permit a duopoly. As a result, KYOU was spun off to Ottumwa Media Holdings, which eventually changed its name to American Spirit Media.|$|E
5000|$|An {{extensive}} <b>digital</b> <b>repeater,</b> or [...] "digipeater," [...] network provides transport for APRS packets {{on these}} frequencies. Internet gateway stations (IGates) connect the on-air APRS network to the APRS Internet System (APRS-IS), {{which serves as}} a worldwide, high-bandwidth backbone for APRS data. Stations can tap into this stream directly, and a number of databases connected to the APRS-IS allow Web-based access to the data as well as more advanced data-mining capabilities. A number of low-Earth orbiting satellites, including the International Space Station, are capable of relaying APRS data.|$|E
50|$|WINM, VHF {{digital channel}} 12, is a TCT owned-and-operated {{television}} station serving Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States that is licensed to Angola. The station {{is owned by}} Tri-State Christian Television, Inc. WINM's offices are located at 3632 Butler Road in Fort Wayne (in the former studio facility of PBS member station WFWA, channel 39), and its transmitter is located in unincorporated Williams County, Ohio, midway between Butler, Indiana and Edgerton, Ohio. Though {{most of the city}} proper is adequately covered by the main signal, WINM's signal is relayed on Fort Wayne, Indiana on <b>digital</b> <b>repeater</b> station WEIJ-LD (channel 38) in Fort Wayne.|$|E
50|$|CFMT {{shut down}} its {{analogue}} signal, over UHF channel 47, on August 31, 2011, the official date in which full-power television stations in larger Canadian television markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 64, which {{was among the}} high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use {{as a result of}} the transition, to UHF channel 47 for post-transition operations. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analogue channel 47. CFMT's <b>digital</b> <b>repeaters</b> in London and Ottawa also relocated to new channels for the same reason behind the relocation of the main signal; these repeaters would use their former UHF analogue channel numbers (69 and 60) as their virtual channel numbers.|$|R
50|$|Amateur Radio Club (K2CC), {{established}} in 1922 is the University's oldest {{organization that is}} still active today.

5000|$|Bellisio {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, {{received}} the B.S.E.E. degree from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, the S.M.E.E. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and was awarded the Ph.D. from Yale University. He is the originator [...] (US Patents) of the [...] "sliding payload" [...] concept central to SONET/SDH transmission systems, invented the phase-frequency locked timing extractor widely used in baseband <b>digital</b> <b>repeaters,</b> and was the designer and managing engineer of the digital television lightwave system used for {{virtually all of the}} worldwide contribution quality TV feeds at the 1984 Olympic Games, the first compressed digital TV system ever accepted by a prime TV network for program contribution. Bellisio and his staff were the original advocates of Broadband/ATM standardization, HDTV, and video compression. They were the first to propose the ADSL (Asymmetrical digital subscriber line). All of these innovations have developed into massive worldwide profitable industries.|$|R
