There is besides, in totally changing the destination of a capital, so great a sacrifice of established connection, and of acquired skill and experience, that people are always very slow in resolving upon it, and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless.|$|E

To verify this, the reader has only to consider how dreadful a picture he has drawn in his 32nd page, {{of the state of}} this kingdom; such a picture as, I believe, has hardly been applicable, without some exaggeration, to the most degenerate and undone commonwealth that ever existed. Let this view of things be compared with the prospect of a remedy which he proposes in the page directly opposite, and the subsequent. I believe no man living could have imagined it possible, except for the sake of burlesquing a subject, to propose remedies so ridiculously disproportionate to the evil, so full of uncertainty in their operation, and depending for their success in every step upon the happy event of so many new, dangerous, and visionary projects. It is not amiss, that he has thought proper to give the public some little notice of what they may expect from his friends, when our affairs shall be committed to their management. Let us see how the accounts of disease and remedy are balanced in his [...] "State of the Nation." [...] In the first place, on the side of evils, he states, [...] "an impoverished and heavily-burdened public. A <b>declining</b> <b>trade</b> and decreasing specie. The power of the crown never so much extended over the great; but the great without influence over the lower sort. Parliament losing its reverence with the people. The voice of the multitude set up against the sense of the legislature; a people luxurious and licentious, impatient of rule, and despising all authority. Government relaxed in every sinew, and a corrupt selfish spirit pervading the whole. An opinion of many, that the form of government is not worth contending for. No attachment in the bulk of the people towards the constitution. No reverence for the customs of our ancestors. No attachment but to private interest, nor any zeal but for selfish gratifications. Trade and manufactures going to ruin. Great Britain in danger of becoming tributary to France, and the descent of the crown dependent on her pleasure. Ireland, in case of a war, to become a prey to France; and Great Britain, unable to recover Ireland, cede it by treaty," [...] (the author never can think of a treaty without making cessions,) [...] "in order to purchase peace for herself. The colonies left exposed to the ravages of a domestic, or the conquest of a foreign enemy."--Gloomy enough, God knows. The author well observes,[67] that a mind not totally devoid of feeling cannot look upon such a prospect without horror; and an heart capable of humanity must be unable to hear its description. He ought to have added, that no man of common discretion ought to have exhibited it to the public, if it were true; or of common honesty, if it were false.|$|E

50|$|The {{economic}} decline caused appalling phenomena, like the accelerating deindustrialization after the early 1720s.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an investigation into}} the differences in the postdisplacement labor market experiences of workers separated from <b>declining</b> <b>traded,</b> expanding traded and nontraded industries. The results presented provide the beginnings of a bridge across the gap between what is known and what is perceived regarding the allocative efficiency effects of trade-related labor displacements. The strategy of the paper is to relate the postdisplacement experience of individuals to changes in the competitive position of the industry from which the individual was displaced. The investigative lens is primarily focused on the impact of changing industry competitiveness on the duration of unemployment spells and the change in wages accompanying displacement. The findings are that workers from traded industries in general suffer greater hardhip after displacement than do nontraded workers. They incur both a longer spell of unemployment and a greater loss of earnings. Within traded industries, workers separated from <b>declining</b> <b>traded</b> industries fare much worse than those from expanding traded industries. This evidnece regarding the duration of the unemployment spell is then combined with previous results regarding trade related displacements to provide an accounting of the change in the aggregatenumber of weeks of unemployment resulting from changing trade patterns. The finding is that although expansion of traded industries was sufficient to offset the displacement effects of contracting traded industries, the longer spell of unemployment by those from contracting industries results in a significant increase unemployed resources...|$|R
