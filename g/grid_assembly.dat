50|$|The {{aerodynamics}} are novel, combining vestigial cruciform wings with grid fins used as {{tail control}} surfaces (similar devices are {{used on the}} OTR-23 Oka, and USAF uses them on MOAB). Each surface consists of a metal frame containing a blade-like <b>grid</b> <b>assembly</b> which combines a greater control area, and thus lifting force, with reduced weight and size. The development for this control concept took three years of theoretical work and testing. These surfaces require less powerful actuators than conventional fins. The flow separation which occurs at high angles of attack enhances its turning ability, giving the missile a maximum turn rate of up to 150° per second. However, updated variants of the R-77, such as the izdeliye 180 that is destined for the Sukhoi Su-57, will use conventional fins instead.|$|E

This paper {{gives an}} {{analysis}} of the behavior of polarizing grids and reflecting polarizers by solving Maxwell’s equations, for arbitrary angles of incidence and grid rotation, for cases where the excitation is provided by an incident plane wave or a beam of radiation.

First, {{instead of using}} the two-step searching (i. e. cut and paste), a single-step searching method based on the grid cell size is proposed to modify holes and optimize the grid overlapping automatically. Second, discrepancies between the wall surface representations, where the grids overlap, are handled by introducing the wall's normal directions to the hole-map and projecting the interpolated points on the recipient mesh into the donor mesh. Finally, the dynamic overset method is modified to address the complex moving body problem. At every time step, the initial hole surface of the previous time step is dynamically adjusted to accomplish hole cutting and avoid the time consuming hole-map procedure.

JPL is currently preparing to incorporate a miniature hollow cathode for the MiXI discharge. Computational analyses anticipate that an axially upstream hollow cathode location provides the most favorable performance and beam profile; however, the hot surfaces of the hollow cathode must be sufficiently downstream to avoid demagnetization of the cathode magnet {{at the back of}} the chamber, which can significantly reduce discharge performance. MiXI’s ion extraction grids are designed to provide > 3 mN of thrust; however, previous to this effort, the low-thrust characteristics had not been investigated.

While wind tunnel or flight test remain important, time accurate {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) offers the option of calculating these procedures from first principles. However, such computations are complicated and time consuming. Parallel computing offers a very effective way to improve our productivity in doing CFD analysis. In this article, we review recent progress made in parallel computing in this area. The store separation problem {{will be used to}} offer a physical focus and to help motivate the research effort.

40|$|In {{terms of}} mesh {{resolution}} requirements, higher-order finite element discretization methods {{offer a more}} economic means of obtaining accurate simulations and/or to resolve physics at scales not possible with lower-order schemes. For simulations that may have large relative motion between multiple bodies, overset grid methods have demonstrated distinct advantages over mesh movement strategies. Combining these approaches offers the ability to accurately resolve the flow phenomena and interaction that may occur during unsteady moving boundary simulations. Additionally, overset grid techniques when utilized within a finite element setting mitigate many of the difficulties encountered in finite volume implementations. This research presents {{the development of an}} overset grid methodology for use within a streamline/upwind Petrov-Galerkin formulation for unsteady, viscous, moving boundary simulations.

A compact moiré interferometer is combined with an environmental chamber to allow real-time observation of non-linear and time-dependent solder and solder assemblies. The first apparatus is based on convection heating and cooling to simulate an accelerated thermal cycling (ATC) condition. Vibrations caused by an environmental chamber are circumvented by unique rigid links that connect the specimen to the moiré interferometer. Displacement fields are documented while the chamber is being operated. The system is utilized to analyze thermo-mechanical behavior of a ceramic ball <b>grid</b> array package <b>assembly</b> and a plastic ball <b>grid</b> array package <b>assembly.</b> The effect of thermal cycling on the accumulated permanent deformation is documented, which reveals the temperature-dependent non-linearity of solder joints.

40|$|International audienceOverset {{strategy}} can be {{an efficient}} way to keep high-accuracy discretization by decomposing a complex geometry in topologically simple subdomains. Apart from the <b>grid</b> <b>assembly</b> algorithm, the key point of overset technique lies in the interpolation processes which ensure the communications between the overlapping grids. The family of explicit Lagrange and optimized interpolation schemes is studied. The a priori interpolation error is analyzed in the Fourier space, and combined with the error of the chosen discretization to highlight the modification of the numerical error. When high-accuracy algorithms are used an optimization of the interpolation coefficients can enhance the resolvality, which can be useful when high-frequency waves or small turbulent scales need to be supported by a grid. For general curvilinear grids in more than one space dimension, a mapping in a computational space followed by a tensorization of 1 -D interpolations is preferred to a direct evaluation of the coefficient in the physical domain. A high-order extension of the isoparametric mapping is accurate and robust since it avoids the inversion of a matrix which may be ill-conditioned. A posteriori error analyses indicate that the interpolation stencil size must be tailored to the accuracy of the discretization scheme. For well discretized wavelengthes, the results show that the choice of a stencil smaller than the stencil of the corresponding finite-difference scheme can be acceptable. Besides the gain of optimization to capture high-frequency phenomena is also underlined. Adding order constraints to the optimization allows an interesting trade-off when a large range of scales is considered. Finally, the ability of the present overset strategy to preserve accuracy is illustrated by the diffraction of an acoustic source by two cylinders, and the generation of acoustic tones in a rotor-stator interaction.

40|$|Unstructured grid {{technologies}} for hydrodynamic applications with bodies in relative motion and mesh deformation are presented. A parallel universal mesh deformation scheme is developed to manage deforming surface and volume grids for both aerodynamic and hydrodynamic applications. The approach is universal and independent of grid type. Also, it requires minimal inter-processor communication {{and is thus}} perfectly suitable to a parallel platform. The original scheme of Allen (2006) has difficulty deforming volume grids in regions near concave geometry features and for abrupt grid resolution changes. Several modifications are proposed to overcome these problems. Grid quality can be improved significantly by adding a smoothing algorithm and additional surface mesh connectivity. The mesh deformation scheme is demonstrated and validated by solutions of several synthetic jet test cases from a NASA Langley Workshop. Application to the free surface flow over the S 175 container ship undergoing two-node harmonic bending is also demonstrated. The resulting viscous mesh shows good quality throughout the harmonic deformation with large scale vortex shedding occurring at the bow and stern. Overset grids technologies are adopted to simulate the flow past multiple bodies in relative motion. A generalized library DiRTlib and a <b>grid</b> <b>assembly</b> code SUGGAR both developed by Noack (2005) are used to facilitate integration of overset grids method into Tenasi flow solver. Both static and dynamic cases are tested. First, for verification, simulation of an oscillating cylinder using overset grids is compared with a baseline configuration using a single grid in rigid motion (i. e., no relative motion between the cylinder and the farfield), and the solutions agree with each other very well. Then interaction between two oscillating cylinders with same amplitude and frequency but 180 -degree phase difference is studied. It is found that significant low pressure is generated between these two cylinders when passing each other at close separation distance.

This paper aims to measure this proportion by using a homemade system consisting of a quartz crystal microbalance and a <b>grid</b> energy analyzer <b>assembly.</b> Such a system yields relevant results on {{the composition of the}} post-discharge depending {{on the nature of the}} gas (Ar, Kr, Xe) and the target materials (Pt, Pd, Au, Pt 50 Au 50 and Pt 5 Pd 95). In our conditions, the highest proportions of metal ions in the post-discharge are obtained by using Ar gas and reaches 10 %, 12 %, 50 %, 19 % and 88 % for respective Pt, Au, Pd, Pt 50 Au 50 and Pt 5 Pd 95 target, respectively...|$|R
