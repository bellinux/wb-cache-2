5|$|Hamilton {{crossed the}} line to win his second race of the season, with Rosberg {{following}} him home in 2nd and Vettel completing the podium with 3rd. Pastor Maldonado had an eventful race. On lap 33, while running in seventh position ahead of teammate Romain Grosjean, he missed the pit entry and lost time, dropping several positions. He then proceeded to spin <b>his</b> <b>car</b> on lap 39 as he attempted {{to make up for}} lost time, and on lap 48 he had a collision with Jenson Button following a long battle for position, damaging <b>his</b> <b>car</b> and retiring with rear brake failure a few laps later.

5|$|In {{that race}} at Brands Hatch, Pryce took an unfancied Royale RP11 to {{first place in}} the Formula Three support race for the 1972 Formula One Race of Champions against many {{established}} Formula Three drivers such as Roger Williamson, Jochen Mass and James Hunt. So large was Pryce's advantage {{at the end of the}} race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce's car had run the race underweight; it turned out that the circuit's weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone's cars had been underweight. Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at Oulton Park and Zandvoort, and then during practice for the support race of the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix <b>his</b> <b>car</b> came to a stop at Casino Square after a wire had come loose. He had exited <b>his</b> <b>car</b> to correct the problem when Peter Lamplough lost control of <b>his</b> <b>car</b> and struck the Royale RP11.

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Vergne was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 2.350 seconds, ahead of Prost in second and Bird third. Rosenqvist was fourth-fastest; Félix da Costa was fifth and Heidfeld sixth. Buemi was seventh-fastest, Ma eighth, Sarrazin ninth and Loïc Duval rounded the top ten ahead of qualifying. Duval lost control of <b>his</b> <b>car</b> and crashed into the turn ten outside barrier's exit, removing both his right-hand side tyres, and caused the session to be stopped for ten minutes to allow <b>his</b> <b>car</b> {{to be removed from}} the centre of the track. Engel spun and damaged his right-rear suspension, but was able to drive slowly back to the pit lane. Di Grassi ran wide and went deep into the turn two run-off area. He spun <b>his</b> <b>car</b> to leave the corner but made contact with the wall, removing his rear wing. López lost his vehicle's nose cone in a collision with the wall at the same corner, and his rear wing was removed from <b>his</b> <b>car</b> when he impacted the turn eight barrier. The driver's rear wing was off the racing line, avoiding the need for yellow flags, and Piquet caused the session to conclude under red flag conditions when he heavily collided with the chicane exit barrier.|$|E

All teams, including Mercedes used the softer tyre compound during the first session (Q1). Jenson Button, who had problems with <b>his</b> <b>car</b> all during practice, was unable to set a time when <b>his</b> <b>car</b> broke down on his out lap. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, with Valtteri Bottas in second. Along with Button, both Manor Marussia cars were eliminated in Q1, as well as Daniil Kvyat– who made a mistake during his final lap– and Pastor Maldonado.

5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of <b>his</b> <b>car,</b> he did not feel confident that he could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to making a mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant <b>his</b> <b>car</b> alternated between understeer and oversteer en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with <b>his</b> <b>car</b> and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.|$|E
5|$|The fourth caution {{was given}} on lap 174 when Montoya {{collided}} with the wall, damaging <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> Edwards, who was hit by Montoya, had sustained a similar amount of damage to <b>his</b> <b>car.</b> Keselowski {{was caught up in}} the crash, and Jeff Gordon was forced to spin sideways. None of the leaders made pit stops during the caution. Officials cleared the surface at turn one and checked turn two for a brake motor. The race restarted on lap 181 with Kyle Busch leading, ahead of Kurt Busch, and Reutimann. Five laps later, Kyle Busch had built up a 1.4 second lead. On lap 206, Reed Sorenson damaged <b>his</b> <b>car,</b> after colliding with the wall, which caused the fifth and final caution. Most of the leaders made pit stops for fuel and car adjustments during the caution. Kyle Busch led on the restart on lap 212, followed by Kurt Busch and Reutimann. Seven laps later, Kahne moved into ninth position. On lap 221, Earnhardt. dropped two positions to seventh. Eight laps later, Martin moved into the fifth position.
