The names of the characters were inspired by Bernadin de Saint-Pierre's pastoral novel Paul and Virginia. The use of talking animals followed {{in the tradition of}} fables by La Fontaine and that of J.J. Grandville's illustrations, as well as the contemporary American films of Walt Disney. Hergé would describe the story as an opportunity [...] "to get away from realism for a bit", adding that it allowed him [...] "A little unreality to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> from the rules of 'credibility' to which I'm subjected with Tintin." [...] It was not, however, received with much enthusiasm from the paper's readership, with many readers writing in to ask when The Adventures of Tintin would resume.|$|E

The summer of 2001 was a little dull, so reporters focused on sharks.|$|E

6000|$|Dreary pleasure, you say, breakfasting {{alone in}} a half-furnished house, with the snow lying some feet deep outside and still monotonously falling. Do I forget {{the sound of my}} own voice between Monday and Saturday? I should think not. Nor do I forget Janet's voice. I have read somewhere that the Scotch are a very taciturn race, but Janet is far more Scotch than the haggis that is passed around at some London dinners, and Janet is not a silent woman. The {{difficulty}} with some servants is to get them to answer your summons, but my difficulty with Janet is to get her back to the kitchen. Her favorite position is at the door, which she keeps half open. One of her feet she twists round it, and there she stands, half {{out of the room and}} half in it. She has a good deal of gossip to tell me about those five houses that lie low, two hundred yards from the manse, and it must be admitted that I listen. Why not? If one is interested in people he must gossip about them. You, in London, may not care in the least who your next door neighbor is, but you gossip about your brothers and sisters and aunts. Well, my people are as familiar to me as your brothers are to you, and, therefore, I say, [...] "Ah, indeed," [...] when told that the smith is busy with the wheel of a certain farmer's cart, and [...] "Dear me, is that so?" [...] when Janet explains that William, the ploughman, has got Meggy, his wife, to cut his hair. Meggy has cut my own hair. She puts a bowl on my head and clips away everything that it does not cover. So I would miss Janet if she were gone, and her tongue is as enlivening as a strong ticking clock. No doubt there are times when, if I were not a minister, I might fling something soft at her. She shows to least advantage when I have visitors, and even in winter I have a man to dinner now and again. Then I realize that Janet does not know her place. While we are dining she hovers in the vicinity. If she is not pretending to put the room to rights, she is in her fortified position at the door; and if she is not at the door she is immediately behind it. Her passion is to help in the conversation. As she brings in the potatoes she answers the last remark my guest addressed to me, and if I am too quick for her she explains away my answer, or modifies it, or signifies her approval of it. Then I try to be dignified and to show Janet her place. If I catch her eye I frown, but such opportunities are rare, for it is the guest on whom she concentrates herself. She even tells him, in my presence, little things about myself which I would prefer to keep to myself. The impression conveyed by her is that I confide everything to her. When my guest remarks that I am becoming a hardened bachelor, and I hint that it is because the ladies do not <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> chance, Janet <b>breaks</b> in with-- ...|$|R
