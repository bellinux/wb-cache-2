2500|$|In {{order to}} start selling a drug {{promptly}} after the patent on innovator drug expires, a <b>generic</b> <b>company</b> has to file its ANDA {{well before the}} patent expires. [...] This puts the <b>generic</b> <b>company</b> {{at risk of being}} sued for patent infringement, since the act of filing the ANDA is considered [...] "constructive infringement" [...] of the patent.

2500|$|To {{defend its}} revenue from {{fluoxetine}}, Lilly also fought a five-year, multimillion-dollar battle in court with the <b>generic</b> <b>company</b> Barr Pharmaceuticals {{to protect its}} patents on fluoxetine, and lost the cases for its line-extension patents other than those for Sarafem, opening fluoxetine to generic manufacturers starting in 2001. [...] When Lilly's patent expired in August 2001, generic drug competition decreased Lily's sales of fluoxetine by 70% within two months.|$|E
2500|$|When {{faced with}} patent {{litigation}} {{from the drug}} innovator, generic companies will often counter-sue, challenging {{the validity of the}} patent. [...] Like any litigation between private parties, the innovator and generic companies may choose to settle the litigation. [...] Some of these settlement agreements have been struck down by courts when they took the form of reverse payment patent settlement agreements, in which the <b>generic</b> <b>company</b> basically accepts a payment to drop the litigation, delaying the introduction of the generic product and frustrating the purpose of the Hatch-Waxman Act.|$|E

The data {{used in this study}} was panel dataset, gathered from six large pharmaceutical <b>generic</b> <b>companies</b> in Indonesia, during the period 2006 to 2010. The regression analysis method uses fixed effect models, with generalized least squares (GLS) method.

50|$|Although the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act made it {{possible}} for <b>generic</b> <b>companies</b> to get regulatory approval for drugs by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), in the early 1980s it became clear that very few generics were coming to market. Congress studied the issue and realized that under patent and regulatory law, it was easy for innovator companies to make it difficult for <b>generic</b> <b>companies</b> to successfully file ANDAs and that the regulatory pathway to get ANDAs approved was irregular and uncertain. In response, the Hatch-Waxman Act was negotiated and enacted.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{following}} the Pliva decision, the FDA proposed a rule change {{that would allow}} generics manufacturers to update the label if the originating drug had been withdrawn from the market {{for reasons other than}} safety. As of May 2016 the rule, {{which turned out to be}} controversial since it would open <b>generic</b> <b>companies</b> to product liability suits, was still not finalized, and the FDA had stated the final rule would be issued in April 2017. The FDA issued a draft guidance for <b>generic</b> <b>companies</b> to update labels in July 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Reverse payment patent {{settlements}} {{result from}} a peculiarity in US regulatory law arising from the Hatch-Waxman Act passed in 1984. The law encourages patent infringement litigation with incentives outside the patent system. [...] Under the Act, the first <b>generic</b> <b>company</b> to successfully challenge the patents of the innovative company, and that has its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) accepted by the FDA, is awarded with six months of exclusivity. During that time that FDA {{is not allowed to}} approve any other company's ANDA, and only the originator company and the winning generics company can market the drug. Because of the lack of competition, the price that the <b>generic</b> <b>company</b> can charge during this period is much higher than it eventually will be when other generic companies are allowed to sell the drug as well. [...] In settling the litigation, the generics company can calculate the income it would get due to that 6 month administrative exclusivity, and the innovator can calculate the amount of money it would lose from sales to the <b>generic</b> <b>company.</b> The parties might agree that a cash payment from the innovator to the <b>generic</b> <b>company</b> is an arrangement in which both parties benefit more than they would if the litigation were to continue.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{explore and}} compare the impact of generic {{substitution}} (GS) on the turnover and gross margin per cent of pharmaceutical companies representing mainly original or generic products in Finland. Methods A mail survey to pharmaceutical companies with an office in Finland and substitutable medicines in the Finnish pharmaceutical market 1 year (2004) and nearly 5 years (2008) after GS. The questionnaire were answered by 16 original and 7 <b>generic</b> product <b>companies</b> in 2004 (response rate 56 %, nÂ =Â  41) and by 16 original and 6 <b>generic</b> product <b>companies</b> in 2008 (response rate 56 %, nÂ =Â  39). Results Turnover had decreased in the original product companies and increased in the <b>generic</b> product <b>companies.</b> The gross margin per cent had decreased in the original and <b>generic</b> product <b>companies,</b> and the companies had also compensated for it in many ways. Conclusions The study suggests that GS has promoted the sales of <b>generic</b> product <b>companies</b> in Finland. However, price competition caused by GS has generally decreased the proportion of profit from turnover in the original and <b>generic</b> product <b>companies.</b> The companies have also compensated for their decreased gross margin, {{which suggests that the}} profit in euros has not been sufficient to cover fixed costs in the <b>companies.</b> <b>Generic</b> substitution Pharmaceutical <b>company</b> Turnover Gross margin per cent...|$|R

50|$|Turkey {{has both}} <b>generic</b> <b>company</b> laws and media-specific {{regulations}} on transparency of the print, broadcasting and online media outlets.

50|$|Pharmaceutical {{companies}} have also employed the “pay-to-delay” strategy {{in which they}} enter into reverse payment agreement with <b>generic</b> <b>company</b> to delay the generic drug's manufacture. This {{was the case in}} 2008, when an agreement between AstraZeneca and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.

5000|$|The FDA {{has been}} slow to adopt {{regulations}} for the introduction of generic versions of biopharmaceutical drugs (known as [...] "biosimilars") because the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals is so much more complicated than small molecule drugs.

This part of the Act is one of few pieces of legislation that restricts the powers and reach of a federal agency.

However, Allergan’s method claim (US Patent No. 7,030,149), which states “reducing the number of daily topical ophthalmic doses of brimonidine administered topically to an eye of a person in need thereof for the treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension from 3 to 2 times a day without loss of efficacy”, was held to be non-obvious.
