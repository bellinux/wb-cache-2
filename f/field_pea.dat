50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>pea</b> is a cool-season legume crop that {{is grown}} on over 25 million acres worldwide. <b>Field</b> <b>pea</b> or “dry pea” is marketed as a dry, shelled product for either human or {{livestock}} food. <b>Field</b> <b>pea</b> differs from fresh or succulent pea, which is marketed as a fresh or canned vegetable. The major producing countries of <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> are Russia and China, followed by Canada, Europe, Australia and the United States. Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States raise over 4.5 million acres and are major exporters of peas.

40|$|The {{growth and}} carcase {{characteristics}} of South Suffolk x Merino ewe lambs, grazed on mature crops of either faba beans, <b>field</b> <b>peas,</b> or lupins were evaluated. Lambs grazing faba beans grew significantly (P< 0. 05) faster (220 g/head/day) than lambs grazing <b>field</b> <b>peas</b> (186 g/day), {{which in turn}} grew faster than lambs grazing lupins (166 g/day).

The gross margin from grazing lambs on lupins was greater than grazing lambs on either <b>field</b> <b>peas</b> or faba beans.

5000|$|Crop Rotation: In {{order to}} reduce the risk of {{infection}} of pea crops from infected residue and soil-borne survival structures in a <b>field,</b> <b>pea</b> crops should be grown only every three to four years in the same field.

50|$|The {{development}} {{of genetically modified}} products found to cause allergic reactions has been halted by the companies developing them before they were brought to market. In the early 1990s, Pioneer Hi-Bred attempted to improve the nutrition content of soybeans intended for animal feed by adding a gene from the Brazil nut. Because they knew that people have allergies to nuts, Pioneer ran in vitro and skin prick allergy tests. The tests showed that the transgenic soy was allergenic. Pioneer Hi-Bred therefore discontinued further development. In 2005, a pest-resistant <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> developed by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation {{for use as a}} pasture crop was shown to cause an allergic reaction in mice. Work on this variety was immediately halted. These cases have been used as evidence that genetic modification can produce unexpected and dangerous changes in foods, and as evidence that safety tests effectively protect the food supply.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of heating <b>field</b> <b>peas</b> (Pisum sativum) on the N balance and urine, serum and plasma composition of growing pigs. In the first experiment, four diets containing raw <b>field</b> <b>peas</b> (cv. Wirrega) or <b>field</b> <b>peas</b> heated to 150 ° (cv. Wirrega), 165 ° (cv. Wirrega) or 150 ° (cv. Dundale) for 15 min respectively were formulated to contain 1. 15 g ileal digestible N/MJ digestible energy (DE) and 0. 36 g lieal digestible lysine/MJ DE in a sugar-based diet. Digestibility estimates were based on those for the Dundale cultivar of <b>field</b> <b>peas</b> used in previous experiments. Total urine and faeces collection from eight pigs was conducted over two 7 d collection periods with a 7 d diet change-over period. Serial blood sampling from the external jugular vein was conducted {{on the final day of}} each collection period. There was no significant difference (P < 0. 05) in the N balance or apparent biological value of the field-pea treatments. Pigs fed on diets containing peas heated to 150 ° (cv. Wirrega) or 165 ° (cv. Wirrega) had a significantly lower (P < 0. 01) daily output of urea and uric acid in the urine, and depressed serum protein and serum urea concentrations. Plasma lysine concentration and daily urine lysine output were not significantly different (P < 0. 05) in pigs fed on heated peas. Protein excretion in the urine of pigs fed on diets containing peas heated to 165 ° increased 3 – 7 times (depending on estimation technique) the level observed in pigs fed on diets containing raw peas. A second experiment was conducted to determine the apparent ileal digestibility of N and amino acids in cv. Wirrega <b>field</b> <b>peas.</b> This study revealed that N digestibility (0. 44) and lysine digestibility (0. 35) in peas heated to 165 ° were significantly lower than the cv. Dundale estimates (0. 57 and 062 respectively) used in diet formulations. The depressed serum and urine variables in pigs fed on heated peas were attributed to overestimation of digestibility. The results exemplify the fact that it is not possible to draw general conclusions as to the effects of heat on any particular protein concentrate. Variability in N balance experiments and problems associated with urine analysis are suggested as likely reasons for the current study not reflecting poor utilization of ileal digestible lysine from heat-treated <b>field</b> <b>peas.</b> Despite considerable variation in the results, it is possible that a large proportion of non-utilizable amino acids in heated <b>field</b> <b>peas</b> may be excreted from the pig via the urine in the form of a protein...|$|R
