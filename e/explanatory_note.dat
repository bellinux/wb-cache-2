5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was {{in black and white}} as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} the inclusion of a short <b>explanatory</b> <b>note</b> {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent mess in the eyes of many critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E

500|$|Accum became {{involved}} with the production of gas for lighting purposes {{through the efforts of}} Friedrich Albert Winsor (1763–1830), another German émigré, who had been waging a longstanding publicity campaign. In 1809, Accum was asked to appear before a Parliamentary committee that was considering granting a charter for a gaslight company Winsor had been promoting. While unsuccessful in its first attempt, the bill passed in 1810 and the company was incorporated under the name [...] "Gas Light and Coke Company". The newly incorporated company met the conditions laid out in the bill and began operating in 1812 with Accum as a member of its board of directors. Accum oversaw the construction of a gas plant on Curtain Road, which was the first such plant in the history of gaslight. After that time, gaslight was no longer limited to industrial mills and was introduced into urban life. Westminster Bridge was lighted with gas lamps in 1813, and a year later, the streets in Westminster followed. In 1815, Accum published [...] "Description of the Process of Manufacturing Coal-Gas". In the introduction, Accum compared the newly formed gas utility with the water companies that had been operating in London since the early 18th century: [...] "Through gas, {{it will be possible to}} have light in all rooms, as is presently the case with water." [...] When this book was translated into German in Berlin in 1815, an <b>explanatory</b> <b>note</b> had to be added, as no such water utilities existed there: [...] "There are many private homes in England that are provided with pipes in the walls so that in almost all rooms, all one needs to do to get water is open a faucet." ...|$|E

The Pope concluded the session on 21 November 1964, with the formal pronouncement of Mary as Mother of the Church.|$|E

2500|$|On {{specific}} issues, {{they failed}} to defeat the constitution on the liturgy, which introduced the vernacular and gave greater authority to episcopal conferences, or the decree on ecumenism, which some say undermined the traditional belief that the Catholic Church was the unique path to salvation. Their petition insisting on a condemnation of communism in the constitution on the Church in the Modern World was only slightly more successful; {{it led to the}} insertion of a footnote which referred to an earlier papal condemnation of communism, without mentioning the word. [...] Perhaps their greatest success involved a last minute papal intervention, where Pope Paul VI insisted on the insertion of an <b>explanatory</b> <b>note</b> into the document on the Church, which significantly weakened the force of its claims for collegiality.|$|E
2500|$|In many jurisdictions, {{all forms}} of zoophilic acts are prohibited; others outlaw only the mistreatment of animals, without {{specific}} mention of sexual activity. In the UK, Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (also known as the Extreme Pornography Act) outlaws images of a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive). Despite the Ministry of Justice's <b>explanatory</b> <b>note</b> on extreme images saying [...] "It {{is not a question}} of the intentions of those who produced the image. Nor is it a question of the sexual arousal of the defendant", [...] "it could be argued that a person might possess such an image for the purposes of satire, political commentary or simple grossness," [...] according to The Independent. Countries such as Belgium and Sweden are somewhere in between: they permit sexual activity with animals, but prohibit the promotion of animal-oriented pornography.|$|E

6000|$|Lord Byron has, it seems, very {{accurate}} notions of gratitude, {{and the word}} [...] "grateful" [...] in these lines, and in his dedication of 'The Bride of Abydos', has a delightful similarity of meaning.

[...] Lord Byron well knows that bepraise and bespatter are almost synonimous.

The fault of the poem is that too much matter is packed into too small a compass, and that, in parts, every line implies a minute acquaintance with contemporary events, and requires an <b>explanatory</b> <b>note.</b> But, even so, in The Age of Bronze Byron has wedded [...] "a striking passage of history" [...] to striking and imperishable verse.|$|E
