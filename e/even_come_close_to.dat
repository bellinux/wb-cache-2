5|$|Rudd was {{offering}} generous terms that few competitors {{could hope to}} <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to.</b> If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini–Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he {{had at the time}} between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.|$|E

25|$|The Lightning {{picked up}} goalscorer Dino Ciccarelli from the Detroit Red Wings during the 1996 off-season, {{and he did}} not disappoint, scoring 35 goals in the 1996–97 season, with Chris Gratton {{notching}} another 30 goals. The team moved into a glittering new arena, the Ice Palace (now the Amalie Arena), and appeared destined for another playoff spot. However, the Lightning suffered a devastating rash of injuries. Puppa developed back trouble that kept him out of all but four games during the season; he would only play a total of 50 games from 1996 until his retirement in 2000. Bradley also lost time to a series of injuries that would limit him to a total of 49 games from 1996 until his retirement in December 1999. Center John Cullen developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and missed the last 12 games of the 1996–97 season; he would eventually be forced to retire in 1999. Decimated by these ailments, the Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs. It would be seven years before the Lightning would <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the playoffs again.|$|E

After Andy tries unsuccessfully to mine {{ideas from the}} office employees, he consults a book on management techniques and decides to try an incentives program. He presents a number of items catered to individual employees, which they can purchase with [...] "points" [...] earned by exceptional workplace performance. This idea garners mixed reactions from the employees, but when Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) jokingly asks Andy what prizes he will offer for inordinately large numbers of points, he offers to tattoo whatever his co-workers would like on his butt in exchange for 5,000 points, not anticipating that anyone {{will be able to}} <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> this number.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers lauded M's {{appraisal}} of Bond as a [...] "sexist, misogynist dinosaur", with Todd McCarthy in Variety saying GoldenEye [...] "breathes fresh creative and commercial life" [...] into the series. John Puccio of DVD Town said that GoldenEye was [...] "an eye and ear-pleasing, action-packed {{entry in the}} Bond series" [...] and that the film gave Bond [...] "a bit of humanity, too". Ian Nathan of Empire said that GoldenEye [...] "revamps that indomitable British spirit" [...] and that the Die Hard movies [...] "don't <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 007". Tom Sonne of the Sunday Times considered GoldenEye the best Bond film since The Spy Who Loved Me. Jose Arroyo of Sight & Sound considered the greatest success of the film was in modernising the series.|$|E

500|$|Twelve {{years after}} its release, Dylan said: [...] "The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on {{individual}} bands in the Blonde on Blonde album. It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up." [...] For critics, the double album {{was seen as the}} last installment in Dylan's trilogy of mid-1960s rock albums. As Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "The three albums of this period—Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited both released in 1965, and Blonde on Blonde from 1966—used their electric instrumentation and rock arrangements to achieve a crashing exuberance Dylan hadn't approached before." [...] Mike Marqusee has described Dylan's output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, when he recorded these three albums, as [...] "a body of work that remains unique in popular music." [...] For Patrick Humphries, [...] "Dylan's body of work during the 14-months period... stands unequalled in rock's 30-year history. In substance, style, ambition and achievement, no one has <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> matching Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{many years}} {{it was assumed that}} Monteverdi had written much of the music for Licori before its sudden cancellation; Redlich says the music was {{finished}} by 10 September 1627. The work's rejection and subsequent disappearance have been blamed on Striggio's disregard for Monteverdi's efforts. However, Tomlinson's reading of the correspondence suggests a different conclusion: Monteverdi, in his view, [...] "did not <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> completing the score" [...] and may have written very little of the music. It is likely that he stopped composing at the end of July, having become suspicious of Striggio's true commitment to the work. Tomlinson suggests that, mindful of Mantua's earlier cancellation of Le nozze di Tetide, Monteverdi avoided extending himself on the new project, while maintaining a diplomatic impression of activity. Tomlinson writes: [...] "t would hardly be surprising if Monteverdi were preternaturally sensitive to signs of Mantuan vacillation [...] if, at the first such signs in 1627, he decided to move cautiously in the composition of Licori." [...] Strozzi's libretto has vanished along with whatever music Monteverdi managed to write, but Strozzi wrote a second libretto under the same name, which was set by Francesco Sacrati and produced in Venice in 1641.|$|E
500|$|Some {{families}} of servicemen and servicewomen {{who were killed}} in Iraq reacted angrily to the book, in which Blair does not apologise for the invasion. [...] "I can't regret the decision to go to war. I can say never did I guess the bloody, destructive and chaotic nightmare that unfolded—and that too is part of the responsibility," [...] he says in the book. Reg Keys, whose son Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was [...] "just crocodile tears from Blair." [...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I and my wife have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E

500|$|Electra Heart {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 57, based on 16 reviews. Writing for AllMusic, James Christopher Monger compared the record to {{the works of}} American singers Kesha and Lady Gaga, and favourably summarised it as [...] "a brooding, sexy, desperate, overwrought, and infectious record that's both aware and unashamed of its contrivance." [...] Michael Cragg reviewed the album on behalf of BBC Music; {{he felt that the}} recurring concept of failed romance established [...] "a strange dichotomy" [...] that created a sense of cohesiveness, and elaborated that it [...] " [...] you sharply into her world." [...] He considered {{the second half of the}} disc to be mildly disappointing, although concluded that this was excusable because the overall record [...] " [...] the ironic and the heartfelt, the quirky and the mainstream, the real and the fake with remarkable aplomb." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly complimented Diamandis for her ability to [...] "rival Katy Perry for catchy hooks, command with the swagger of Gwen Stefani, and <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the ethereal vocal exhilaration of Florence Welch." [...] Stack opined that Electra Heart was a healthy combination of up-tempo recordings and genuinely-delivered ballads, and placed additional praise on the female archetypes explored throughout the album.|$|E

2500|$|Operation Silver Fox had not {{achieved}} its sophisticated goals.

[...] The German forces, especially the SS-troops, were unsuited, ill-trained, and unprepared for Arctic warfare and therefore made little progress while suffering heavy casualties.

2500|$|While some rankings {{attempt to}} measure {{teaching}} using metrics such as staff to student ratio, the Higher Education Policy Institute {{has pointed out}} that the metrics used are more closely related to research than teaching quality, e.g. [...] "Staff to student ratios are an almost direct measure of research activity", and [...] "The proportion of PhD students is also to a large extent an indication of research activity". Inside Higher Ed similarly states [...] "these criteria do not actually measure teaching, and none <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> assessing quality of impact". Many rankings are also considered to contain biases towards the natural sciences and, due to the bibilometric sources used, towards publication in English-language journals. Some rankings, including ARWU, also fail to make any correction for the sizes of institutions, so a large institution is ranked considerably higher than a small institution with the same quality of research. Other compilers, such as Scimago and U.S. News and World Report, use a mix of size-dependent and size-independent metrics.|$|E

60|$|But {{in reading}} {{between the lines}} of Dr. Horton's invective one {{continually}} feels {{that he is not}} only angry with the popular Press for being unscrupulous: he is partly angry with the popular Press for being popular. He is not only irritated with Limericks for causing a mean money-scramble; he is also partly irritated with Limericks for being Limericks. The enormous size of the levity gets on his nerves, like the glare and blare of Bank Holiday. Now this is a motive which, however human and natural, must be strictly kept out of the way. It takes all sorts to make a world; and it is not in the least necessary that everybody should have that love of subtle and unobtrusive perfections in the matter of manners or literature which does often go with the type of the ethical idealist. It is not in the least desirable that everybody should be earnest. It is highly desirable that everybody should be honest, but that is a thing that can go quite easily with a coarse and cheerful character. But the ineffectualness of most protests against the abuse of the Press has been very largely due to the instinct of democracy (and the instinct of democracy is like the instinct of one woman, wild but quite right) that the people who were trying to purify the Press were also trying to refine it; and to this the democracy very naturally and very justly objected. We are justified in enforcing good morals, for they belong to all mankind; but we are not justified in enforcing good manners, for good manners always mean our own manners. We have no right to purge the popular Press of all that we think vulgar or trivial. Dr. Horton may possibly loathe and detest Limericks just as I loathe and detest riddles; but I have no right to call them flippant and unprofitable; there are wild {{people in the world who}} like riddles. I am so afraid of this movement passing off into mere formless rhetoric and platform passion that I will <b>even</b> <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the earth and lay down specifically some of the things that, in my opinion, could be, and ought to be, done to reform the Press.|$|E
