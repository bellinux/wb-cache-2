5000|$|The {{film version}} of Frida Kahlo's life was {{initially}} championed by Nancy Hardin, a former book editor and Hollywood-based literary agent, turned early [...] "female studio executive", who, in the mid-1980s wished to [...] "make the transition to independent producing." [...] Learning of Hayden Herrara's biography of Kahlo, Hardin saw Kahlo's life as very contemporary, her [...] "story... an emblematic tale for women torn between marriage and career." [...] Optioning the book in 1988, Hardin [...] "tried to sell it as an epic love story {{in the tradition of}} Out of Africa, attracting tentative interest from actresses such as Meryl Streep and Jessica Lange, but receiving rejection from the film studios. As Kahlo's art gained prominence, however [...] "in May, 1990 one of Kahlo's self-portraits sold at Sotheby's for $1.5 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a Latin American painting." [...] Madonna [...] "announced her plans to star in a film based on Frida's life", and Robert De Niro's Tribeca Productions reportedly [...] "envisioned a joint biography of Rivera and Kahlo." [...] In the spring of 1991, director Luis Valdez began production on a New Line feature about Frida Kahlo starring Laura San Giacomo in the lead. San Giacomo's casting received objections due to her non-Hispanic ethnicity, and New Line complied with the protesters' demands, and left the then-titled Frida and Diego in August, 1992 citing finances. Hardin's project found itself swamped by similar ones:When I first tried to sell the project ... there was no interest because nobody had heard of Frida. A few years later, I heard the exact oppositethat there were too many Frida projects in development, and nobody wanted mine. Valdez was contacted early on by thethen unknown in the U.S.Salma Hayek, who sent [...] "her promo reel to the director and phoned his office", but was ultimately told she was then too young for the role. By 1993, Valdez had retitled the film The Two Fridas with San Giacomo and Ofelia Medina both playing the portraitist. Raúl Juliá was cast as Diego Rivera, but his death further delayed the movie. At the same time, Hardin approached HBO, and with [...] "rising young development executive and producer" [...] Lizz Speed (a former assistant to Sherry Lansing) intended to make a television movie, hopeful that Brian Gibson (director of [...] "What's Love Got to Do With It, the story of Tina Turner" [...] and The Josephine Baker Story) would <b>direct.</b> <b>Casting</b> difficulties proved insurmountable, but Speed joined Hardin in advocating the project, and after four years in development, the two took the project from HBO to Trimark and producer Jay Polstein (with assistant Darlene Caamaño). At Trimark, Salma Hayek became interested in the role, having [...] "been fascinated by Kahlo's work {{from the time she was}} 13 or 14"although not immediately a fan: Hayek was so determined to play the role that she sought out Dolores Olmedo Patino, longtime-lover of Diego Rivera, and (after his death) administrator to the rights of Frida and Rivera's art, which Rivera had [...] "willed ... to the Mexican people", bequeathing the trust to Olmedo. Salma Hayek personally secured access to Kahlo's paintings from her, and began to assemble a supporting cast, approaching Alfred Molina for the role of Rivera in 1998. According to Molina, [...] "She turned up backstage the Broadway rather sheepishly, and asked if I would like to play Diego". Molina went on to gain 35 pounds to play Rivera. When producer Polstein left Trimark, however, the production faltered again, and Hayek approached Harvey Weinstein and Miramax, and the company purchased the film from Trimark; Julie Taymor came onto the project as Director. Meanwhile, in August 2000 it was announced that Jennifer Lopez would star in Valdezs take on the story, The Two Fridas, by then being produced by American Zoetrope. Nonetheless, it was Hayek and Miramax who began production in Spring, 2001 on what was to become simply titled Frida.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{preformed}} on a Gleeble 3500 Thermomechanical Simulator {{to study}} the hot ductility behaviour of C-Mn-A 1 steel {{and the influence of}} Nb, Ti and Nb-Ti additions. The simple hot tensile test has been shown to correlate well to the problem of transverse cracking. Therefore, the principle aim of this research is to gain a greater understanding of transverse cracking during the straightening of continuously cast slabs. In particular, attention was paid to thin slab casting conditions. Hot tensile test specimens were either solution treated in melted in-situ (<b>direct</b> <b>cast)</b> and cooled to the deformation temperature. Solution treatment tests simulated conventional casting, where slabs are cooled to room temperature than heated prior to rolling. <b>Direct</b> <b>cast</b> tests simulated hot direct rolling conditions, where slabs are rolled directly after casting without being cooled below the austenite to ferrite transformation. Specimens were cooled to the deformation temperature at two cooling rates, 100 K/min and 200 K/min. The cooling rate of 100 K/min corresponds to the average cooling rate experienced for a conventionally cast slab, 250 mm in thickness. The cooling rate of 200 K/min corresponds to the average cooling rate for thin-cast slabs, 50 mm in thickness. The development of the combination of thin slab <b>casting</b> of hot <b>direct</b> rolling requires hot ductility work to be performed under <b>direct</b> <b>cast</b> conditions and at higher cooling rates. Surface quality is of the utmost importance in thin slab casting so the elimination of transverse cracking is of prime economic importance. There are significant differences between as-cast (<b>direct</b> <b>cast)</b> and reheated (solution treatment) microstructures. In particular, changes in precipitate behaviour, austenite grain size, and the relationship between segregation and the position of austenite gran boundaries was investigated. An attempt has been made to determine what influences these differences in microstructure have on hot ductility. Niobium bearing steels were selected for the reason that there are still problems with Nb steels regarding transverse cracking. Furthermore, there have been contradictory reports on the effects of Ti additions on the transverse cracking behaviour of NB steels. There is evidence from commercial practice that indicates that small additions of Ti improve the transverse cracking susceptibility of Nb steels. However, laboratory results generally show Ti additions have little influence or even a detrimental effect on hot ductility. Disparities in the thermal history simulated in laboratory tests to actual conditions near the surface of a continuously cast slab is the most likely reason for this discrepancy. Therefore, the influence of more closely simulating the thermal history conditions near the surface of a continuously cast slab was evaluated for the Nb-Ti steel. Experimental work involved metallographic and scanning electron microscopy examination of the fracture surface. Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine precipitation characteristics. Tensile tests were conducted to determine mechanical properties, where reduction in area (RA) was used as a measure of ductility. The dendritic structure for <b>direct</b> <b>cast</b> and solution treatment specimens was revealed using a heat treatment procedure (normalising). Particle size was correlated to reduction of area for precipitates in the single-phase austenite temperature region. It was shown that particles below 15 nm were detrimental to hot ductility. The relationship between interparticle spacing and reduction of area was also determined. Microalloying additions to C-Mn-A 1 steels significantly widen the ductility trough but the depth remains similar. Low ductility was found at higher temperatures in the microalloyed steels due the intergrandular failure as a result of grain boundary sliding in the austenite. Grain boundary sliding was favoured by the slow strain rate and was enhanced by fine microalloyed nitrates and/or carbides. Fine particles can pin austenite grain boundaries, allowing sufficient time for cracks to link together, ultimately causing intergranular fracture. Increasing the cooling rate generally lowered ductility further by promoting finer precipitation. The trough depth is similar in all steels as the formation of thin ferrite films controls ductility at the minimum trough position. The formation of thin films of ferrite allowed strain to concentrate in the softer ferrite phase and intergrandular failure occurred due to microvoid coalescence. <b>Direct</b> <b>cast</b> conditions always led to lower ductility compared to solution treatment conditions. This is explained in terms of differences in the microstructure, namely, grain size, segregation and precipitation. It is recommended that <b>direct</b> <b>cast</b> conditions should be used to determine hot ductility behaviour as it more accurately simulates continuous casting conditions. It was found that simulating the thermal history near the surface of a continuously coast slab, as opposed to cooling directly to the deformation temperature, improved ductility of the Nb-Ti steel. This improvement in ductility was attributed to the thermal history providing favourable conditions for coarsening of NbTi (C,N) ...|$|R
