5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was <b>flashed</b> <b>in</b> the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E

At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light <b>flashed</b> <b>in</b> the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.|$|E

25|$|Dennett's {{thesis is}} that our modern {{understanding}} of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of René Descartes. To show why, he starts {{with a description of}} the phi illusion. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are <b>flashed</b> <b>in</b> succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour before the second light is observed.|$|E

In the same illustration drawned a [...] "stiletto-like dart" [...] directed to the lower left corner: it is a thought [...] "of steady anger, intense and desiring vengeance, {{of the quality of}} murder, sustained through years, and directed against a person who had inflicted a deep injury on the one who sent it forth." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1957, a 31-year-old Lee {{delivered}} the manuscript for Go Set a Watchman to her agent to send out to publishers, including the now-defunct J. B.

[...] "he spark of the true writer <b>flashed</b> <b>in</b> every line", she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott.

During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled To Kill a Mockingbird.|$|E

The survivors were rescued by Michel. They were transferred to , and later [...] which took them to Singapore, where they were handed over to the Japanese as prisoners of war. The continued shelling after the ship had surrendered was considered to be a war crime. Michels captain Helmuth von Ruckteschell was found not guilty on this charge at his trial held at the Curio Haus in Hamburg, Allied-occupied Germany, from 5–21 May 1947. It was shown that the surrender was <b>flashed</b> <b>in</b> Morse Code by electric torch, the light from which was demonstrated in Court to be too weak to be seen in daylight and amongst the flashes of explosions. Von Ruckteschell was convicted on three other charges and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, subsequently reduced to seven years. Von Ruckteschell died in prison on 24 June 1948. Those lost on Empire Dawn are commemorated on the Tower Hill Memorial in London.|$|E
