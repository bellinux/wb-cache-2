40|$|We are {{familiar}} of question. We produce question everyday. Commonly, question {{is used to}} ask information. However, <b>in</b> the <b>written</b> forms, question functions variously. This research tries to examine the functions of question <b>in</b> <b>written</b> advertisements. By using a descriptive quantitative research technique, the writer tried to analize the readers interpretations on the functions of question <b>in</b> <b>written</b> advertisements. This analysis is based on The Language Functions proposed by Roman Jakobson and Dell Hymes, which reveals some functions of sentences. The sample of question was taken from four <b>written</b> advertisements <b>in</b> two magazines published in America. The writer also {{tried to find out}} the relationship between the respondents’ backgrounds in education and occupation and their interpretations on the functions of question <b>in</b> <b>written</b> advertisements. This research found out that there are many functions of question <b>in</b> <b>written</b> advertisements, such as emotive, referential, and contextual functions. Whatever function selected by the respondents enable them to derive the advertisers’ messages. The similarity and difference in interpreting question <b>in</b> <b>written</b> advertisements might not merely be determined by the educational and occupational backgrounds of the respondents yet these might be influenced by the factors of the individual respondents’ perception and opinions...|$|R

50|$|Contractions are {{a common}} feature of English, used {{frequently}} in ordinary speech. <b>In</b> <b>written</b> English, contractions are used <b>in</b> some semiformal <b>writing</b> and mostly <b>in</b> informal <b>writing.</b> They usually involve the elision of a vowel - an apostrophe being inserted in its place <b>in</b> <b>written</b> English - possibly accompanied by other changes. Many of these contractions involve auxiliary verbs and their negations, although {{not all of these}} have common contractions, and there are also certain other contractions not involving these verbs.|$|R

5|$|The lack of {{surviving}} theoretical writing on art and recorded opinion {{from any of}} the pre-16th-century major artists presents still more difficulties in attribution. Dürer, in 1512, was the first artist of the era to properly set down <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> his theories of art, followed by Lucas de Heere in 1565 and Karel van Mander in 1604. Nash believes a more probable explanation for the absence of theoretical writing on art outside Italy is that the northern artists did not yet have the language to describe their aesthetic values, or saw no point in explaining <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> what they had achieved in painting. Surviving 15th-century appreciations of contemporary Netherlandish art are exclusively written by Italians, the best known of which include Cyriacus Ancona in 1449, Bartolomeo Facio in 1456, and Giovanni Santi in 1482.|$|E
