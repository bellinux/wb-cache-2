5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become <b>easier</b> <b>when</b> he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario 3D Land {{utilizes}} the Nintendo 3DS's autostereoscopic technology, allowing {{players to}} perceive depth when viewing the game screen. While {{the game is}} designed to not require the 3D effect, some obstacles or points of interest are deliberately more noticeable or <b>easier</b> <b>when</b> the 3D is switched on. Super Mario 3D Land also utilizes optional use of the 3DS gyroscope, {{which can be used}} to control cannons and binoculars. The game also features StreetPass functionality, allowing players to exchange Mystery Boxes containing bonus items. StreetPass also gives players another Toad house so they can get items.|$|E

She said another factor that made acting on Atlantis easier was the welcoming cast and crew of the series. Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed them in front of the puddle jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, the Padarn Railway {{became the}} first quarry railway to use steam locomotives, and the {{transport}} of slate by train rather than by ship was made <b>easier</b> <b>when</b> the London and North Western Railway built branches to connect Port Penrhyn and Port Dinorwic to the main line in 1852. The Corris Railway opened as the horse-worked Corris, Machynlleth & River Dovey Tramroad in 1859, connecting the slate quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni with wharves on the estuary of the River Dyfi. The Ffestiniog Railway converted to steam in 1863, and the Talyllyn Railway was opened in 1866 to serve the Bryn Eglwys quarry above the village of Abergynolwyn. Bryn Eglwys grew {{to be one of}} the largest quarries in mid Wales, employing 300 men and producing 30% of the total output of the Corris district. The Cardigan Railway was opened in 1873, partly to carry slate traffic, and enabled the Glogue quarry in Pembrokeshire to grow to employ 80 men.|$|E

25|$|Prevention {{of severe}} disease {{involves}} screening {{the population at}} risk with blood tests for TbG.

Treatment of the second stage involves eflornithine {{or a combination of}} nifurtimox and eflornithine for TbG. While melarsoprol works for both stages, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment it typically results in death.|$|E

25|$|Within lexical semantics, {{especially}} {{as applied to}} computers, modeling word meaning is <b>easier</b> <b>when</b> a given word is {{understood in terms of}} related words; semantic networks are therefore important in computational linguistics.

Indeed, the usefulness of this area of mathematics to linguistics has borne organizations such as , as well as various 'Net' projects, such as WordNet, VerbNet, and others.|$|E

25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted parking brakes. Power assisted parking brakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional parking brakes, but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the parking brake <b>easier.</b> <b>When</b> releasing the parking brake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|E
25|$|Post-test probability, as {{estimated}} {{from the}} pre-test probability with likelihood ratio, should be handled with caution in individuals with other determinants (such as risk factors) {{than the general}} population, {{as well as in}} individuals that have undergone previous tests, because such determinants or tests may also influence the test itself in unpredictive ways, still causing inaccurate results. An example with the risk factor of obesity is that additional abdominal fat can make it difficult to palpate abdominal organs and decrease the resolution of abdominal ultrasonography, and similarly, remnant barium contrast from a previous radiography can interfere with subsequent abdominal examinations, in effect decreasing the sensitivities and specificities of such subsequent tests. On the other hand, the effect of interference can potentially improve the efficacy of subsequent tests as compared to usage in the reference group, such as some abdominal examinations being <b>easier</b> <b>when</b> performed on underweight people.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that the Lode was navigable beyond Soham. Lighters brought cargoes of corn to a water mill at Soham, and later brought coal when steam engines replaced the water wheel. Barley and timber were other important cargoes. Railways did not reach Soham until 1879, and resulted in the rapid demise of water-borne transport. Commercial traffic ceased about 1900, and the lode was described as un-navigable in a report by H. Dunn in 1906. There was a sluice at the entrance to the lode, with two sets of mitre gates, pointing in opposite directions, one to prevent flood waters from the Great Ouse entering the lode, and the other to raise the water level in the lode to make navigation <b>easier.</b> <b>When</b> the Anglian Water Authority was created by Act of Parliament in 1977, the lode was not listed as a navigation, and their successors, the Environment Agency, have taken this to mean that there is no right of navigation.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{duties of}} the midwife in antiquity {{consisted}} mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the midwife would call for {{the assistance of a}} physician when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the midwife brought along two or three assistants. In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made <b>easier</b> <b>when</b> a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her. The midwife sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards {{on the top of the}} mother's abdomen.|$|E
25|$|News Corporation, {{through its}} Fox Television Stations subsidiary, agreed to {{purchase}} Chris-Craft Industries and its stations, including KMSP-TV, for $5.35 billion in August 2000 (this brought KMSP, along with San Antonio's KMOL-TV and Salt Lake City's KTVX, back under common ownership with 20th Century Fox); the deal followed {{a bidding war}} with Viacom. The sale was completed on July 31, 2001. While Fox pledged to retain the Chris-Craft stations' UPN affiliations through at least the 2000–01 season, and Chris-Craft agreed to an 18-month renewal for its UPN affiliates in January 2001, an affiliation swap was expected once KMSP's affiliation agreement with UPN ran out in 2002, given Fox's presumed preference to have its programming on a station that it already owned. Additionally, KMSP's signal was much stronger than that of WFTC, it was a VHF station {{that had been on}} the air much longer than UHF outlet WFTC. Most importantly, Fox had been aggressively expanding local news programming on its stations, and KMSP had an established news department whereas WFTC's news department did not begin operations until April 2001. The move was made <b>easier</b> <b>when,</b> in July 2001, Fox agreed to trade KTVX and KMOL (now WOAI-TV) to Clear Channel Communications in exchange for WFTC, a transaction completed that October.|$|E
