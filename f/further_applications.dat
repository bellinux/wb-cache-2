5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} a clay {{model of a}} companion to the École des Beaux-Arts {{in an attempt to}} win entrance; he did not succeed, and two <b>further</b> <b>applications</b> were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the Petite École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.|$|E

However, after Shastri's death, by 1981, India had taken only 300,000 Tamils as repatriates, while Sri Lanka had granted citizenship to only 185,000 citizens (plus another 62,000 born after 1964). Later, India declined to consider any <b>further</b> <b>applications</b> for citizenship, stating that the 1964 agreement had lapsed.|$|E

When the material is bent by a vibration in one direction, the vibration-reduction system responds to the bend and sends electric power to the piezo element to bend in the other direction. Future applications of this technology are expected in cars and houses to reduce noise. <b>Further</b> <b>applications</b> to flexible structures, such as shells and plates, have also been studied for nearly three decades.|$|E

25|$|This {{does not}} mean that an MP retains his or her Parliamentary seat despite being under some {{disqualification}} until Parliament has made a formal decision on the matter. On 10 November 1986, the MP for Anson, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore, lost an appeal against a conviction for making a false statement in a declaration and was sentenced to one month's imprisonment and a fine of $5,000. <b>Further</b> <b>applications</b> and appeals in the criminal proceedings to the High Court, Court of Appeal and the Privy Council (then Singapore's highest court) were dismissed. On 9 December, the Speaker of Parliament made a statement in the House that Jeyaretnam had ceased to be an MP with effect from 10 November by virtue of having been convicted of an offence and sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000. Jeyaretnam did not object to the statement at the time. Under Article 45(2) of the Constitution, he was disqualified to be an MP until five years had elapsed from the date the fine was imposed. Jeyaretnam subsequently applied to court for a declaration that, among other things, he had not ceased to be an MP in 1986 and that the Speaker's statement had been ineffective because Parliament itself had not determined that he had vacated his seat. On 9 July 1990, the High Court ruled that Jeyaretnam had ceased to be an MP by operation of law and that no separate determination by Parliament had been necessary.|$|E

2500|$|In mathematics, Newton's identities, {{also known}} as the Newton–Girard formulae, give {{relations}} between two types of symmetric polynomials, namely between power sums and elementary symmetric polynomials. Evaluated at the roots of a monic polynomial P in one variable, they allow expressing the sums of the k-th powers of all roots of P (counted with their multiplicity) in terms of the coefficients of P, without actually finding those roots. These identities were found by Isaac Newton around 1666, apparently in ignorance of earlier work (1629) by Albert Girard. [...] They have applications in many areas of mathematics, including Galois theory, invariant theory, group theory, combinatorics, as well as <b>further</b> <b>applications</b> outside mathematics, including general relativity.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{problem for}} the {{authorities}} was Despard's wife, who caused considerable dismay. [...] A woman of African descent, she had accompanied her husband from Central America to London in 1790. Active in prisoners' rights, she formed a link between her husband and the other revolutionaries with their colleagues and families outside the prison. [...] She had worked for improvement of prison conditions, including the necessities of life: warmth, fresh air, food, space, writing materials, and access to friends and families. [...] She was, essentially, a courier between the condemned and the outside world, and furthermore an intrepid correspondent. [...] The prison wardens feared she was smuggling goods {{in and out of}} the prison, but feared to search her. [...] It was she who had approached Lord Nelson to speak at the trial, and he made <b>further</b> <b>applications</b> to the government on behalf of Despard and his compatriots.|$|E
2500|$|The National Science Foundation funded {{researcher}} David Berube {{to study}} the field of nanotechnology. His findings are published in the monograph Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz. [...] This study concludes {{that much of what}} is sold as “nanotechnology” is in fact a recasting of straightforward materials science, which is leading to a “nanotech industry built solely on selling nanotubes, nanowires, and the like” which will “end up with a few suppliers selling low margin products in huge volumes." [...] <b>Further</b> <b>applications</b> which require actual manipulation or arrangement of nanoscale components await further research. Though technologies branded with the term 'nano' are sometimes little related to and fall far short of the most ambitious and transformative technological goals of the sort in molecular manufacturing proposals, the term still connotes such ideas. According to Berube, there may be a danger that a [...] "nano bubble" [...] will form, or is forming already, from {{the use of the term}} by scientists and entrepreneurs to garner funding, regardless of interest in the transformative possibilities of more ambitious and far-sighted work.|$|E

This he effected in the following manner: There {{was a man in}} his court who was afflicted with some malady of the eyes. Histiæus told him that if he would put himself under his charge he could effect a cure. It would be necessary, he said, that the man should have his head shaved and scarified; that is, punctured with a sharp instrument, previously dipped in some medicinal compound. Then, after some <b>further</b> <b>applications</b> should have been made, it would be necessary for the patient to go to Ionia, in Asia Minor, where there was a physician who would complete the cure.|$|E

In future {{chapters}} we shall have to deal mainly with {{the application of the}} theory to explain the varied and complex phenomena presented by the organic world; and, also, to discuss some of the theories put forth by modern writers, either as being more fundamental than that of Darwin or as supplementary to it. Before doing this, however, it will be well briefly to summarise the facts and arguments already set forth, because it is only by a clear comprehension of these that the full importance of the theory can be appreciated and its <b>further</b> <b>applications</b> understood.|$|E
6000|$|... 5. One of the {{conclusions}} to which such an inquiry leads, is, that in each branch of instruction we should proceed from the empirical to the rational. During human progress, every science is evolved {{out of its}} corresponding art. It results from the necessity we are under, both individually and as a race, of reaching the abstract {{by way of the}} concrete, that there must be practice and an accruing experience with its empirical generalisation, before there can be science. Science is organised knowledge; and before knowledge can be organised, some of it must be possessed. Every study, therefore, should have a purely experimental introduction; and only after an ample fund of observations has been accumulated, should reasoning begin. As illustrative applications of this rule, we may instance the modern course of placing grammar, not before language, but after it; or the ordinary custom of prefacing perspective by practical drawing. By and by <b>further</b> <b>applications</b> of it will be indicated.|$|E
