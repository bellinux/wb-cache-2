500|$|Radiohead {{have been}} {{critical}} of Hail to the Thief. In a 2006 interview with Spin, Yorke said: [...] "I'd maybe change the playlist. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a meltdown when we put it together ... We wanted to do things quickly, and I think the songs suffered." [...] In 2008, O'Brien told Mojo he felt Radiohead should have cut the album to ten tracks and that its length had alienated some listeners. In the same interview, Colin Greenwood said he felt several songs were unfinished and that the album was [...] "more of a holding process". In 2013, Godrich told the NME: [...] "I think there's some great moments on there - but too many songs... As a whole I think it's charming {{because of the lack of}} editing. But personally it's probably my least favourite of all the albums ... It didn't really have its own direction. It was almost like a homogeny of previous work. Maybe that's its strength." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Kidney Now!" [...] {{was first}} read by its cast on March 5, 2009; it was filmed on March 16–17, 2009. [...] "He Needs a Kidney", the charity song {{featured}} in this episode, was written by show composer and co-executive producer Jeff Richmond. Richmond is married to series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. In discussion {{of the development of}} [...] "Kidney Now!", Richmond said that Carlock and Fey [...] "were trying {{to figure out a way}} to highlight Jack's dad in getting a kidney and how they're going to deal with that", and that the two came to the decision to [...] "take advantage of the singing", as they have done so in the past with different 30 Rock episodes, in which the show's characters have sung songs. Carlock and Fey agreed to the idea that a song be included in the season finale, but that it be an anthem like the 1985 charity song, [...] "We Are the World", [...] as the cause is that the Milton Greene character is in need of a kidney donor. [...] "Basically, the parameters were if 'We Are the World' but they want to get a kidney. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> angles that everyone has two kidneys and you'll only need one kidney, and we thought 'Alright, we'll get some distance on that'", said Richmond. While working on the track, Fey suggested to Richmond that he incorporate Milton Greene's name in one part of the song, which he did, as this was sung by singers Cyndi Lauper and Robert Randolph.|$|E
2500|$|At first , we {{were called}} Force. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> gotten that name from a UFO album, {{but there was}} also a band called Rising Force with Yngwie Malmsteen. And then I thought, 'We should move up. We should do {{something}} else.' That night, I was so nervous telling them I thought it should be Europe. They got so quiet after I told them. But as the night progressed, they started liking it more and more." ...|$|E

2500|$|But {{many things}} {{did not involve}} smooth sailing: for example, as he put it, [...] "I had terrible trouble over the Animal Health Laboratory when he [...] wanted to close it all down, just when it was nearly {{finished}} being built." [...] Further, CSIRO {{for the first time}} had to react to public criticism about its policies. Wild said [...] "Before that time … I suppose CSIRO was a sacred cow, beyond criticism; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to get used to criticism and get used to defending." ...|$|E
2500|$|Big Black's first {{release for}} Touch and Go was the Headache EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited {{original}} {{edition of the}} EP {{was a pair of}} forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic [...] "body bag" [...] to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers. A sticker on the EP's cover read [...] "Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese!" [...] According to Durango, [...] "We didn't want to sit there and screw people. If we felt it wasn't as good, then we should just be honest about it." [...] Indeed, Headache recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on Atomizer, showing signs that the band was lagging creatively. Durango later remarked that [...] "I was feeling tapped out ideawise. At that point <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> tried everything that we wanted to try, musically and in the studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1996, Quo Vadis {{headed back}} into the studio and {{recorded}} their debut album with Pierre Rémillard, who had previously worked with Cryptopsy, as producer. On April 10, 1996, Forever... was released and was received favorably by both fans and critics, leading Earth AD Records in Germany and Immortal Records in Poland to sign licensing deals with Quo Vadis. Bart said of the album, [...] "We recorded a demo which was released as an EP on cassette last year. The reaction was very positive. We were still searching for direction at that time, experimenting with keyboards and femme vox. The music is much more focused now as we have found our sound. Forever... is much more aggressive then the EP was, it's much more melodic and intricate. That {{may sound like a}} contradiction but that is the case. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> more to say as musicians this time in the studio as well. Our objective was to keep the aggression and not to loose our edge. I think we captured that quite well, at the same time setting free our artistic side. It's pretty weird. You have to listen to both to really understand." ...|$|E

2500|$|After touring {{with the}} Dead, Billboard {{reported}} publicly {{that a small}} Midwest sound system purveyor had snagged the position. Shortly after the article Heil {{received a call from}} the management of The Who. They had been experiencing a bumpy start to their US tour, and Heil brought a more refined and powerful version of his sound system to their shows. He's stated [...] "We did the Who's Next tour {{for a year and a}} half, across the US, to Europe and back here again." [...] The tour created a bond between Heil and Who guitarist Pete Townshend, who commissioned Heil to create the quadraphonic sound system he had envisioned for the live tour after the release of their Quadrophenia LP. According to Heil, [...] "We set up two 15-channel Midas consoles together, put speakers in four corners and we were able to fly Roger's [...] voice around the room. When we did Madison Square Garden with Quadrophenia, the PA was enormous. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> on each side six to eight 15-inch speaker bins, six to eight radial horns, and about a dozen tweeters. We could get about 110dB to 115dB on that stage before feedback. And the Who loved it, man, because it was loud, and they loved loud." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mega Man V was {{developed}} by the same third-party company that worked on three of the four previous Game Boy Mega Man games. According to Mega Man series artist Keiji Inafune, the fifth installment took the longest time to develop of all five of these titles. Inafune was responsible for the game's character designs after their initial concepts were devised. [...] "When you have a theme to follow, it can make things easier and harder at the same time," [...] Inafune recounted. [...] "Especially with a theme as vague as space." [...] He additionally recalled having [...] "a lot of reservations" [...] when designing the Stardroids. Tango was included as a support character not featured in the home console games; his name, like other characters in the series, is part of musical motif. Inafune, who always enjoyed working on animal support characters, was especially pleased to design Tango due to the artist's personal fondness for cats. Mega Man V is the final installment in the Game Boy line of games based on the original Mega Man series. Inafune stated, [...] "In the end, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a lot of fun working on this series". Mega Man V {{was developed}} with Super Game Boy support, which allows the game to be played with a custom color scheme and border on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It {{was one of the first}} games available with added support from the peripheral. It was also the last time the classic 8-bit Mega Man sprite was used for a game released on an 8-bit console, and last until Mega Man 9 in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} two months of writing and recording, Moraz was let go from the band, which he did not expect. Anderson thought he [...] "just wasn't playing like he was involved", and that his sound was not [...] "too good, and that {{affected}} his vibe ... it was obvious that he just wasn't getting off on what we were doing." [...] Several months after his exit, Moraz said he had to leave because of [...] "the enormous psychological pressures at the time within the group ... I felt there were a few things going on that I didn't know ... Unfortunately some people did not play the game fair, although the final decision was taken by all members." [...] The decision was made after Rick Wakeman, who left Yes in 1974 over differences surrounding their ambitious double album Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973) and whom Moraz replaced, was invited to play on Going for the One as a session musician by Brian Lane, manager of Yes and Wakeman, and his business partner Alex Scott. Wakeman had pursued a successful solo career but by mid-1976, he faced money issues after his tour earlier in the year had met its minimal targets. He became interested to play with Yes again after he had heard a tape of early versions of two of their new songs, [...] "Going for the One" [...] and [...] "Wonderous Stories". Upon his arrival at Switzerland, Wakeman was surprised by how much the band had changed. [...] "We began relating to each other for the first time. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> all grown up and became much more mature. Maybe I had to grow up more than them." [...] At a party held by Claude Nobs soon after Wakeman's arrival, Lane and Squire convinced Wakeman to rejoin as a full-time member as the group would have difficulty in finding a suitable replacement to play Wakeman's parts on their upcoming tour, but did not tell him that the press had already been informed of his return. Several hours after his decision, Wakeman found Melody Maker had printed [...] "Wakeman rejoins Yes" [...] on the front cover of its 4 December 1976 edition.|$|E
