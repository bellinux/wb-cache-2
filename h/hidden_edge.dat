40|$|Reliable and {{quantitative}} non-destructive evaluation for small fatigue cracks, in particular those in hard-to-inspect locations, is a challenging problem. Guided waves are advantageous for structural health monitoring {{due to their}} slow geometrical decay of amplitude with propagating distance, which is ideal for rapid wide-area inspection. This paper presents a 3 D laser vibrometry experimental and finite element analysis {{of the interaction between}} an edge-guided wave and a small through-thickness <b>hidden</b> <b>edge</b> crack on a racecourse shaped hole that occurs, in practice, as a fuel vent hole. A piezoelectric transducer is bonded on the straight edge of the hole to generate the incident wave. The excitation signal consists of a 5. 5 cycle Hann-windowed tone burst of centre frequency 220 kHz, which is below the cut-off frequency for the first order Lamb wave modes (SH 1). Two-dimensional fast Fourier transformation (2 D FFT) is applied to the incident and scattered wave field along radial lines emanating from the crack mouth, so as to identify the wave modes and determine their angular variation and amplitude. It is shown experimentally and computationally that mid-plane symmetric edge waves can travel around the hole’s edge to detect a hidden crack. Furthermore, the scattered wave field due to a small crack length, a, (compared to the wavelength λ of the incident wave) is shown to be equivalent to a point source consisting of a particular combination of body-force doublets. It is found that the amplitude of the scattered field increases quadratically as a function of a/λ, whereas the scattered wave pattern is independent of crack length for small cracks a << λ. This study of the forward scattering problem from a known crack size provides a useful guide for the inverse problem of hidden crack detection and sizing...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} and specific features of seismogynamics of the Baikal zones are reviewed {{in the context}} of interactions between deep deformation waves and the regional structure of the lithospheric mantle. The study is based on a model of the mantle structure with reference to chemical compositions of mantle peridotites from ophiolotic series located in the south-western framing of the Siberian craton (Fig. 1). The chemical zonation of the lithospheric mantle at the regional scale is determined from results of analyses of the heterogeneity of compositions of peridotites (Fig. 2, Table 1) and variations of contents of whole rock major components, such as iron, magnesium and silica (Fig. 3). According to spatial variations of the compositions of peridotites, the mantle has the concentric zonal structure, and the content of SiO 2 is regularly decreasing, while concentrations of FeO∑ and MgO are increasing towards the centre of such structure (Fig. 4). This structure belongs to the mantle of the Siberian craton, which deep edge extends beyond the surface contour of the craton and underlies the north-western segment of the Central Asian orogenic belt. Results of the studies of peridotites of the Baikal region are consistent with modern concepts [Snyder, 2002; O’Reilly, Griffin, 2006; Chen et al., 2009] that suggest that large mantle lenses underlie the Archaean cratons (Fig. 5). The lenses are distinguished by high-density ultrabasic rocks and compose high-velocity roots of cratons which have remained isolated from technic processes. Edges of the mantle lenses may extend a few hundred kilometers beyond the limits of the cratons and underlie orogenic belts that frame the cratons, and this takes place in the south-western segment of the Siberian craton. The revealed structure of the lithospheric mantle is consistent with independent results of seismic and magmatectonical studies of the region. The Angara geoblock is located above {{the central part of the}} mantle lense (Fig 6, A); it is one of four main tectonical units that compose the basement of the Siberian craton [Mironyuk, Zagruzina, 1983]. As evidenced by the zonal composition of the mantle lense, the centre of the lense is highly dense, and this explains the location of a seismic anomaly there (Fig. 6, B) which is determined to a depth of about 50 – 60 km [Pavlenkova G. A., Pavlenkova N. I., 2006]. The high-velocity root located in this segment of the craton is traced by seismic tomography [Koulakov, Bushenkova, 2010] to a depth of about 600 km (Fig. 7). The southward-stretching edge of the sub-cratonic mantle has played a major role in the evolution of the Central Asian orogenic belt. In the Paleozoic, the position and the configuration of the accretional margin of the Siberian paleocontinent were determined by the hidden boundary of the craton (Fig. 8, A). Along the craton’s boundary, rifting zones of various ages are located, and intrusions are concentrated, which genesis was related to extension settings (Fig. 8, B). The Cenozoic sedimentary basins are located above the <b>hidden</b> <b>edge</b> of the Siberian craton, which gives evidence of involvement of the deep lithospheric structure in the formation of the recent destruction zone. The basin of Lake Baikal is located along the mantle edge of the Siberian craton, and the basin’s crescent shape accentuates the strike of the mantle edge. In the region under study, the wave nature of seismicity is most evidently manifested by the cyclicity of the strongest earthquakes in the Baikal zone (Table 2). Three seismic cycles are distinguished as follows: (1) at the turn of the 20 th century (earthquakes in the period from 1885 to 1931, M= 6. 6 – 8. 2), (2) the middle of the 20 th century (earthquakes from 1950 to 1967, M= 6. 8 – 8. 1), and (3) at the turn of the 21 st century (earthquakes from 1991 to 2012, M= 6. 3 – 7. 3). While moving in the mantle, the deformation front collapses with the craton’s basement, partially releases its energy to the lithosphere and involves the fragmented edge of the crust overlying the craton’s edge into deformation (Fig. 9, A). This interaction resulted in the formation of the Mongolia-Baikal and the Altai-Baikal seismic sutures whereat all the strong earthquake took place in seismic cycles (1) and (3), respectively (Fig. 9, B). The third, West Amur seismic suture framing the boundary of the Amur plate comprises locations of strong earthquakes that occurred in cycle (2) (Fig. 10). An important specific feature of the Baikal seismic zone is orthogonal migration of earthquakes within seismic sutures. In each of the sutures, epicenters of strong earthquakes (M> 6. 0) migrated in the transverse direction, which established the orientation of maximum compression during interaction of deformation waves with the mantle structures (Fig. 9, and 10). The less strong seismic events (М< 6. 0) (Fig. 11) migrated along the seismic sutures. At the western flank of the zone, in the Altai-Baikal and Mongolia-Baikal sutures, latitudinal migration took place in the direction from west to east with account of the trajectory of the deformation wave. In the northern part of the West Amur suture, latitudinal migration was directed from east to west, and its direction was gradually changed to meridional in the southern part, which reflected the anticlockwise rotation of the Amur plate. This conclusion can explain a paradox of counter migration of seismicity in the Baikal zone, which is revealed by S. I. Sherman [Sherman, Zlogodukhova, 2011]. In each of the three seismic/deformation sutures, stresses are released via orthogonal multi-directional migration of earthquakes (Fig. 12), and the sutures are regularly combined to compose a complex structure of the stress field in the Baikal seismic zone. Their positions predetermine locations of the major riftogenic structures, primarily sedimentary basins from Tunka to Ubsunur (Fig. 9, B). The three seismic sutures join and overlap each other in the area of Lake Baikal and thus set up the maximum intensity of deformation in this area. Apparently, each of the deformation sutures corresponds to one of the three basins of Lake Baikal (Fig. 13, A). Their depths are correlated with widths of the sutures, which is explained by ‘weakening’ of the deformation wave in the successive cycles of its interaction with the deep structure of the lithosphere. Seismicity of the Baikal zone and its Cenozoic rifting reflect the character of the stress field generated by interaction between the deep deformation wave and the organization of the lithospheric mantle.    </p...|$|E

The presence of <b>hidden</b> incoming <b>edges</b> but observable outgoing edges poses a challenge to char-acterize large directed graphs through crawling. Unless we can crawl the entire graph or the directed graph edges are highly symmetrical, <b>hidden</b> incoming <b>edges</b> induce unknown biases in the sampled nodes. In this work we propose a random walk sampling algorithm that is less prone these biases. The driving principle behind our random walk is to construct, in real-time, an undirected graph from the directed graph in a way that is consistent with the sample path followed by the algorithm walking on either graph. We also study outdegree and indegree distribution estimation. Out-degrees are visible to the walker while indegrees are hidden (latent). This makes for strikingly different estimation accuracies of in- and outdegree distributions. Our algorithm accurately estimates outdegree distributions of a variety of real world graphs while we show that, in the same sce-narios, no algorithm can accurately estimate unbiased indegree distributions unless the directed graph is highly symmetrical.

We propose a variational problem for detecting sparsely hidden relationships with a multivariate Hawkes process that takes into account the gaps from each entity. We bypass the problem of dealing with a large amount of missing events by introducing a small number of unknown boundary conditions. In the case where our observations are sparse (e. g. from 10 % to 30 %), we show through numerical simulations that robust recovery with MHPG is still possible even if the lengths of the observed intervals are small but they are chosen accordingly. The numerical results also show that the knowledge of gaps and imposing the right boundary conditions are very crucial in discovering the underlying patterns and hidden relationships...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Fascioperichondrial flap with a proximal base prepared from the dorsal side was transposed to the anterior helix and conchal excision side and secured with stitches to <b>hide</b> visible <b>edges</b> and reinforce Furnas sutures. Nine patients operated for prominent ear deformity using this modification {{were included in the}} study and follow-up period was at least 6 months. Conchal mastoid distances were calculated from the superior and middle third of the ears before and after the operation, also in follow-up controls to determine the efficiency of the method. Results: There were no suture extrusions, skin necrosis or infection. The mean difference for both the upper and middle third of the ears were considerably lower (p≤ 0. 05) at the end of six month after the operation. There were no visible skin edges and discomfort described by the patients. Conclusion: Fascioperichondrial flap with a proximal base repositioning to conchal side is an easy procedure that can be applied simply as an adjunct to traditional techniques. Addition of this flap provides an additional tissue to reinforce suture repair and, the results seem to be more durable and strong.

This method solves a 3 D reconstruction problem in stepwise fashion via face propagation, and allows a detailed relative importance study of key regularities and their usages for reconstruction rules establishment, which {{is the focus of}} this paper. Based on the proposed reconstruction method, two new trustfulness measures in terms of form and size distortions have been devised to evaluate regularities and their limitations. As a result of adapting the existing concepts of the MSDA [5] and the MSDSM [9] into a stepwise system, two new localized regularities have been developed in terms of the localized minimizing standard deviation of angles (L-MSDA) and the localized minimizing standard deviation of segment magnitudes (L-MSDSM). The proposed method and the identified key regularity have been tested with many cases. A range of weightings for the combination of L-MSAD and L-MSDSM regularities have been identified for practical use. The test results show that (1) the level-by-level reconstruction method is useful to 3 D reconstruction, (2) the combined usage of localized key regularities L-MSDA and L-MSDSM, can produce satisfactory results with the proposed method, and (3) the demonstrated success of the combined usage of L-MSDA and L-MSDSM suggests that the concept of combining MSDA and MSDSM should be utilized in any optimization-based reconstruction approaches to improve their accuracy...|$|R
