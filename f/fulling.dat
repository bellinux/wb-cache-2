5|$|<b>Fulling</b> mills {{were later}} {{established}} elsewhere in Wales, particularly the north {{east and the}} Ceiriog valley.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{technological}} revolution took much longer in Wales {{than it had}} in England, with slow adoption of machinery. Until {{the latter part of}} the 18th century carding and spinning was done at home, and weaving in the village ty-gwydd (loom house), although <b>fulling</b> was done by machine in <b>fulling</b> mills.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor a <b>full</b> semi-AFL K, B(K) {{is defined}} as the family of {{languages}} generated by all K-extended basic macro grammars, while H(K) ⊆ B(K) is the smallest <b>full</b> hyper-AFL containing K; a <b>full</b> basic-AFL is a <b>full</b> AFL K such that B(K) = K (hence every <b>full</b> basic-AFL is a <b>full</b> hyper-AFL). For any <b>full</b> semi-AFL K, K is a <b>full</b> basic-AFL if and only if B(K) is substitution closed if and only if H(K) is a <b>full</b> basic-AFL. If K is not a <b>full</b> basic-AFL, then the smallest <b>full</b> basic-AFL containing K is the union of an infinite hierarchy of <b>full</b> hyper-AFLs. If K is a <b>full</b> principal basic-AFL (such as INDEX, the family of indexed languages), then the largest <b>full</b> AFL properly contained in K is a <b>full</b> basic-AFL. There is a <b>full</b> basic-AFL lying properly in between the smallest <b>full</b> basic-AFL and the largest <b>full</b> basic-AFL in INDEX...|$|R

5|$|There was a <b>fulling</b> mill in {{the town}} by 1394 for the textile industry. After 1820 this {{expanded}} with the town becoming a centre for lace manufacture led by manufacturers who fled from the Luddite resistance they had faced in the English Midlands. Bowden's Old Lace Factory and the Gifford Fox factory are examples of the sites constructed. The Guildhall was built as a Corn Exchange and Guildhall in 1834 {{and is now the}} Town Hall.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Domesday Book in 1086 there were two mills in Dunster. One which was called the Lower Mill was {{on the site of the}} present mill. In the 17th century there were both malt and oats mills but by 1721 one of these had been {{converted}} to a <b>fulling</b> mill. The present mill, which was built around 1780 and replaced the two former mills. In 1940 a bakery was added. The mill ground corn until World War II and then animal feed until it closed in 1962.|$|E
5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down. It was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years.

The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a <b>fulling</b> mill.|$|E

5|$|Local weavers {{specialised}} in {{the production}} of kersey, a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen fabric that was often used for military uniforms; by the 16thcentury Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England. In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth was hung outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a <b>fulling</b> mill. Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed account of what he had been told of the gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the castle}} was its residential tower. This tower may have been built around 1341 {{on the site of}} an older, unfortified house owned by the family on the same site, incorporating {{part of the}} structure into the new, crenellated tower. Alternatively, the central tower may have been built at some point between the late 13th and early 14th centuries, complete with crenellations, in which case the licence from Edward III served only to allow Manners to extend the perimeter fortifications. By the 1350s, the castle was surrounded by a manor which included mills for corn and <b>fulling,</b> lime kilns and coal mines.|$|E
