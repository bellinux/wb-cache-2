500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rap-Up, Mars explained that the song [...] "Somewhere in Brooklyn" [...] is dedicated to his father who is from Brooklyn, adding that: [...] "everyone can agree that New York is a special place". Lyrically, a girl {{is the subject of}} Mars' attention. After they met briefly, he tries to find her again somewhere in Brooklyn. Ari Levine talked in {{an interview}} with Sound on Sound about producing some of Mars' songs. [...] "The Other Side", whose production was re-arranged, was intended <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else,</b> and several people wrote parts of the track. Concerning the lyrics' concept Mars said that they describe: [...] "the lifestyle you end up living as an artist".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the cuts, McCall made a number of changes to his squad during the summer of 2009. His team started the 2009–10 season by going four games without scoring, until they {{recorded}} a 5–4 victory against Cheltenham Town. After the game, McCall said: [...] "That was the youngest, and certainly cheapest, team Bradford have put out {{for a long time and}} I’m really proud of them." [...] City continued by going ten games unbeaten and reached the area semi-finals of the Football League Trophy where they lost to Carlisle United, managed by McCall's friend Greg Abbott, but at the start of 2010 found themselves 16th in League Two and eight points off the play-offs after a run of five defeats in seven games. McCall laid down a challenge to his team to win three of their next four games, saying: [...] "The bottom line is that the players and me personally will get judged on results. And the results aren't good enough." [...] Despite the club's slide down the table, he denied he would resign, but it was reported that two late goals from summer signing Gareth Evans to give City a late 2–1 away at Torquay United saved McCall from being sacked. However, defeat to Bury in the club's following fixture was McCall's last game as manager, with McCall saying after the game: [...] "It's time <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> to come in and take up the reins and hopefully do well." [...] He won a little more than one-third of his 133games in charge of City. McCall left by mutual consent.|$|E

40|$|We explore {{situations}} in which a decision-maker bears responsibility <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> outcomes {{as well as for}} her own. For gains we confirm the intuition that being responsible <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> payoffs increases risk aversion, while in the loss domain we find increased risk seeking. In a second experiment we replicate the finding of increased risk aversion for large probabilities of a gain, while for small probability gains we find an increase of risk seeking under conditions of responsibility. This discredits hypotheses of a cautious shift under responsibility, and indicates an accentuation of the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes usually found for individual choices.

[...] She then said that, while she sympathized with the family, she knew from her own experience {{as a victim of}} crime that such people look <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> to blame.|$|E

Worcestershire appointed Solanki as captain of the county for 2005, succeeding the retiring Steve Rhodes. In September 2006 he agreed an extension to his contract which saw him remain at the county until 2009.

2500|$|There {{has been}} much debate over Karzai's alleged {{consultant}} work with Unocal (Union Oil Company of California since acquired by Chevron in 2005). In 2002, when Karzai {{became the subject of}} heavy media coverage as one of the front runners to lead Afghanistan, it was reported that he was a former consultant for them. [...] Spokesmen for both Unocal and Karzai have denied any such relationship, although Unocal could not speak for all companies involved in the consortium. [...] The original claim that Karzai worked for Unocal originates from a 6 December 2001 issue of the French newspaper Le Monde, [...] Barry Lane UNOCAL's manager for public relations states in an interview on the website Emperor's Clothes that, [...] "He was never a consultant, never an employee.

60|$|A simple person, of {{inexpensive}} habits, she began forthwith to save, and, perhaps, to {{be a little}} parsimonious, in favour of her boy. There were no entertainments, of course, at Fairoaks, during the year of her weeds. Nor, indeed, did the Doctor's silver dish-covers, of which he was so proud, and which were flourished all over with the arms of the Pendennises, and surmounted with their crest, come out of the plate-chests again for long, long years. The household was diminished, and its expenses curtailed. There was a very blank anchorite repast when Pen dined from home: and he himself headed the remonstrance from the kitchen regarding the deteriorated quality of the Fairoaks beer. She was becoming miserly for Pen. Indeed, who ever accused women of being just? They are always sacrificing themselves or <b>somebody</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> sake.|$|R
