40|$|The beam {{switching}} cylindrical array, {{which is a}} unique system, has been designed and developed to cover 3600 in azimuth plane by generating 16 beams with specified elevation coverage. In this design, the concept of fast aperture selection (4 x 4) in microseconds from the total cylindrical array has been realised successfully to meet the requirement of point-to-multipoint communication. The components of the array, viz., radiating elements, powder dividers, switches, etc., are designed in printed circuit type, and hence, objectives of lightweight and ease of reproducibility are achieved. The lightweight of the array makes it accessible for easy mounting at a specified height for achieving longer communication range. Finally, a low-Ioss radome is incorporated to protect the array from environmental conditions. The various paramete"rs, viz., return loss, gain, and switched-beam radiation patterns were measured over a bandwidth of 300 MHz in L- band and typical measured results are presented in this paper. (ii) beam scanning is nearly continuous by using the phase shifters, which makes the antenna system complex arid costlier 3. As the requirement of scanning is to generate a fixed beam in azimuth and also narrow beam in elevation planes, the cylin'drical array with 64 elements arranged in 4 rows and 16 columns (4 x 16) is considered, which provides moderate gain. A software for uniform distribution was developed to stud) ṫhe <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>interelement</b> spacing <b>of</b> cylindrical array, which reveals similar results 4. Finally, the cylindrical array covering 20 per cent bandwidth in L-band has been designed and developed. The mutual coupfing effects were also studied experimentally 5. The concept of fast selecting aperture in co-phasal condition for appropriate beam is implemented successfully. The antenna is housed in a low-Ioss, lightweight sandwich radome and is evaluated in azimuth and elevation planes in small steps of 1...|$|R

40|$|Two {{competing}} models <b>of</b> the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> pattern element proximity, masking, and perceptual integration on the discriminability of spatiotemporal vibrotactile {{patterns are}} compared. Kirman's 'integration hypothesis' predicts that pattern perception is facilitated {{by a process}} of perceptual integration which requires that pattern elements be presented in close spatial and temporal proximity. Conversely, the 'isolation hypothesis' predicts that the strong masking effects which occur when pattern elements are presented in close proximity impede the perception of patterns. Traditional masking studies do not provide a fair test of these two hypothesis because they rely on methods that measure the subject's ability to identify the target when the target is presented {{in conjunction with the}} mask, rather than the discriminability of the complex percept resulting from the integration of the target and mask. To account for this, a new procedure was devised where the amount <b>of</b> <b>interelement</b> masking and the discriminability of the pattern as a whole were measured independently as the spatial and temporal separation of the pattern elements were varied. As expected under both hypotheses, masking between pattern elements increased as either the spatial or the temporal separation between them was decreased. The pattern discrimination data also support the isolation hypothesis in that the patterns were discriminated less well with increasing temporal element separation with a similar but nonsignificant trend in the case of spatial separation. It is concluded that this new methodology should be applied to a wider range of tactile pattern processing situations in order to assess the generality of the results obtained...|$|R

Over the past decade, there has been active development of the theory of the so-called complex networks whose structure is irregular and the elements demonstrate chaotic behavior [1, 2]. Interest in a study of such networks is related to both the necessity of analyzing various natural, social, and engineering objects and the importance of revealing fundamental aspects of chaotic synchronization in a system of many coupled partial subsystems [3 – 6].

40|$|The {{present study}} {{involves}} {{the analysis and}} interpretation of geochemical data from a suite of sediment samples recovered at ODP Hole 752 A. The samples encompass the time period that includes the lithospheric extension and uplift of Broken Ridge, and they record deposition below and above the mid-Eocene angular unconformity that denotes this uplift. A Q-mode {{factor analysis of the}} geochemical data indicates that the sediments in this section are composed of a mixture of three geochemical end members that collectively account for 94. 2 % of the total variance in the data. An examination <b>of</b> <b>interelement</b> ratios for each of these end members suggests that they represent the following sedimentary components: (1) a biogenic component, (2) a volcanogenic component, and (3) a hydrothermal component. The flux of the biogenic component decreases almost thirtyfold across the Eocene unconformity. This drastic reduction in the deposition of biogenic materials corresponds to the almost complete disappearance of chert layers, diatoms, and siliceous microfossils and is coincident with the uplift of Broken Ridge. The volcanogenic component is similar in composition to Santonian ash recovered at Hole 755 A on Broken Ridge and is the apparent source of the Fe-stained sediment that immediately overlies the angular unconformity. This finding suggests that significant amounts of Santonian ash were subaerially exposed, weathered, and redeposited and is consistent with data that suggest that the vertical uplift of Broken Ridge was both rapid and extensive. The greatest flux of hydrothermal materials is recorded in the sediments immediately below the angular unconformity. This implies that the uplift of Broken Ridge was preceded by a significant amount of rifting, during which faulting and fracturing of the lithosphere led to enhanced hydrothermal circulation. This time sequence of events is consistent with (but not necessarily diagnostic of) the passive model of lithospheric extension and uplift...|$|R
