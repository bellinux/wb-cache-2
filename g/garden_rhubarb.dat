50|$|The species R. tanguticum and R. officinale, {{also under}} the {{categorical}} {{term of the}} Chinese drug da-huang, {{are closely related to}} R. palmatum. Today, these three species are regarded as superior in performance to other species-existing rhubarbs. Though R palmatum is commonly misinterpreted to be one in the same with the familiar R. rhabarbarum <b>garden</b> <b>rhubarb</b> we eat, there are several facets falsifying this assumption. Size is the most evident of the facets used to differentiate these two closely related species. While most garden species only grow to a mere few feet in height, Chinese rhubarb can produce as high as a “six to ten foot jointed stalk,” with loosely branched clusters of flowers along the tips that mature red in color from their often yellow or white blooms.Its leaves are rather “large, jagged and hand - shaped,” growing in width of at least two to three feet.It {{is important to recognize that}} only those species of Rheum with lobed leaves are accredited for their medicinal use. Subsequently, <b>garden</b> <b>rhubarb,</b> R. rhubarbarum, as well as any other variety of species with either “wavy” or “undulating leaves” are not founded for any medicinal purpose. Additionally, one can decipher Chinese rhubarb by its rather thick, deep roots whereas the perennial garden plant is composed predominantly of “fleshy rhizomes and buds (http://www.rhubarbinfo.com/growing).|$|E

40|$|Polyphenolic components, such as anthraquinones and stilbenes, from {{species of}} the genus Rheum {{have been shown to}} have a range of bioactivities {{relevant}} to human health. This paper outlines the polyphenolic composition of edible petioles of <b>garden</b> <b>rhubarb</b> (Rheum rhapontigen) and describes the effects of common cooking methods on total polyphenolic content, anthocyanin content and total antioxidant capacity. Most cooking regimes (fast stewing, slow stewing and baking) except blanching increased total polyphenol content and overall antioxidant capacity, compared to the raw material. The patterns of anthocyanin content and total polyphenol content between the different cooking regimes suggested a balance between two processes; cooking facilitated the release of polyphenol compounds from the rhubarb but also caused breakdown of the released compounds. Baking and slow stewing offered the best maintenance of colour through preservation of anthocyanin and the highest antioxidant capacity. Baking for 20 min provided well-cooked rhubarb with the highest antioxidant capacity and the highest anthocyanin content, which is important for the aesthetic quality of the dish. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometric (LC–MS) analysis putatively identified over 40 polyphenol components in raw rhubarb, including anthraquinone, stilbene, anthocyanin and flavonol derivatives. Baking caused selective effects on the stability of the different polyphenol components. Initially, the yield of all components increased but there was a drastic decline in the relative stability of anthraquinone aglycones with increasing cooking time and initial evidence for the turnover of other anthraquinone derivatives was obtained...|$|E

40|$|Sarah Mitchell, {{daughter}} of John Mitchell of Lisdillon, between Little Swanport and Mayfield on the East Coast of Tasmania, {{was born in}} 1853, and kept a diary {{from the age of}} 13 until she died at ninety three in 1946. In her later years, too, she kept scrapbooks in which she stuck, indiscriminately, early letters and memoranda of her family, photographs, newspaper clippings etc., which form an additional record, not only of her own life but of her parents and brothers and sisters. Her father, John Mitchell, was the son of James Mitchell of St. German's, Cornwall, England, and came to Tasmania as a surveyor in 1837. He took a government post, and later became superintendent of boys at. Port Puer, where he wrote a report on the health of the boy convicts in 1846. His Cornish fiancée, Catherine Augusta Keast, followed out in 1839, remembering her voyage Tasmania as particularly unpleasant, through storms, a drunken captain and shortage of food. The couple were married at Old Trinity Church, Hobart, before settling at Port Puer', where several children were born. Mitchell bought a farm at South Arm, but in 1852 he left his government post and moved to Lisdillon with hi s wife and five surviving children. There they remained, acquiring an extensive property for raising sheep, cattle, some arable crops and hops. Mitchell also served on Swansea Council and held a government post in the Post Office. He had charge of the Swansea mails, which gave him the privilege of franking his own mail. the two eldest sons, Frederick Keast and Frank,William Drew, were sent to "England to complete their education in 1858. Both boys kept, brief diaries of their voyage on the “Derwentwater” via Cape Horn, and their first days in England, where they were met by their Keast relatives. At first they boarded at Sydenham School, near London, but later they moved to a grammar school near their relatives in Cornwall. Here Fred's delicate health became worse through the bullying (a letter from a schoolmate is reminiscent of Tom Brown’s School Days (B. S. 32 / 85 p. 37) and he died in, 1861 at the age of 18. Frank, however, went to Mannamead School in Plymouth, Devon, and did well in the British Civil 5 ervice examinations, being appointed to a post in Dublin, Ireland. In 1922 he built a house in Sussex, England, naming it Lisdillon after his childhood home. The other two sons, Edwin and Mark, attended Horton College, Tasmania. Mark remained at home and worked Lisdillon, which he inherited. after his marriage to Mabel Giblin he lived at the Wattles, a cottage on the property, as his mother remained at Lisdillon during her lifetime. Mark died in 1897, before his mother, leaving Lisdillon to his children It was advertised for sale, under the terms of his will, when the children were grown up, in 1913. His widow purchased it and remained there for a while, but the property was eventually split up. Edwin, after a spell in a job in New South Wales, settled at Mayfield, formerly part of his father's property. The eldest daughter, Catherine Penwarne (Kate) married the Reverend John Aubrey Ball of Bright, Victoria, at St. John's Chuch, Buckland, in 1877 but died the following year and is buried at Buckland. Of the two daughters born after the family moved to Lisdillon, the youngest, Amy Mary Jane, took a trip to England about 1872 and after her return married Herbert Giblin in 1877. Sarah Elizabeth Emma remained at home, apart from brief holiday visits to Hobart. Her father died in 1880 and Sarah looked after her mother at Lisdillon until Mrs Mitchell’s death in 1899. Sarah then took a holiday to stay with her brother, Frank, in Ireland and to see something of England and Europe, before she settled at Tirrzah, near Lisdillon, left to her by her father. In her later years she moved to Schouten House in Swansea with her neice, Grace Catherine, who took care of her. In 1937 she moved into the Westminster Rest Home, North Hobart, where she stayed until she died in 1946. Sarah started keeping a diary at the age of thirteen and continued until she was ninety-two, although {{for the last few years}} she had to dictate them to her niece, Grace. In her diaries she noted, daily the state of the weather and a record of the day’s activities, such as helping with routine tasks about the house and property, planting or picking vegetables and fruit from the <b>gardens</b> (peas, lettuces, <b>rhubarb,</b> gooseberries, etc.) or visits to or from neighbours.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in Nano-biotechnology, offer potential longer duration storage options for silver nanoparticles (SNPs) with preferable capping agents where a plentiful {{efforts have been}} given to minimize the toxicity effects SNPs. To overcome the toxicity scenario of SNPs, a novel green methodology was put forward in the present investigation. Biogenic SNPs were synthesized using water extract of <b>Garden</b> <b>Rhubarb</b> (GR) stems under ambient conditions. The method demonstrates an eco-friendly, instant and easy route for stable SNPs synthesis. The formation of instant SNPs was analyzed by visual observation and monitored by UV-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer. The characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 445 nm, revealed the formation of SNPs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of green SNPs showed their crystalline structure. SEM and TEM studies revealed that the shape of SNPs was spherical and has approximate diameter within 100 nm range. The zeta potential measurements on 180 th day after SNPs synthesis, revealed the stability and size distribution of SNPs. The values are 29. 6 mV, 28. 1 mV and 24. 1 mV for three varied compositions of AgNO 3 (1 mM) and GR extract. The high dielectric constant (ϵ′) has been observed for GR mediated SNPs, the ϵ′ values were found to reach the minimum value of 40000 at frequency 1 MHz. Suitable tuning of the dielectric performances can conclusively prove their applications in multifunctional sensors, optical, and charge storage devices.
