30|$|It {{may be of}} {{interest}} to determine whether the effects of thinning and fertilisation are additive or if there is an interaction between the two treatments (Miller et al. 1979; Zhang et al. 2005). This can be investigated with the models. The models for both Douglas-fir and western hemlock have significant interaction terms (parameters b 04 and b 24 for Douglas-fir, parameter b 04 only for western hemlock, Table  3). In a much smaller experiment, McWilliams and Thérien (1996) did not find any interaction between thinning and fertilisation in Douglas-fir. Simulation was used to investigate how this interaction term affects volume. Three site index levels were assumed with corresponding volumes at age 20 (Table  2) for each species. Thinning and fertilisation treatments (35 % removal with 450  kg/ha urea fertiliser) were applied at age 30. The same scenario was applied with the interaction term removed from the model. The difference in volume is then due to the thinning/fertilisation interaction. The volume-age trajectories are plotted in Figure  4, parts a (Douglas-fir) and b (western hemlock). The effect of the interaction between fertilisation and thinning is slight for Douglas-fir (approximately 20 – 25  m 3 /ha at age 100 for low and medium sites, practically no difference for high sites) and virtually non-existent for western hemlock. Interestingly, though, the very slight effect of the thinning[*]×[*]fertilisation interaction for western hemlock is negative which is due to the negative estimated value of parameter b 04 in Equation  4. The lack of a significant interaction response for western hemlock (even though the parameter for this term is statistically significant) {{can be attributed to the}} small estimated value for parameter b 04 in Equation  4. When this parameter is multiplied by the thinning and <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effects</b> (T and F, respectively, in Equation  4), the term does not have a large effect on the asymptote, particularly as the thinning and <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effects</b> diminish over time.|$|R

40|$|Plant {{photosynthesis}} {{tends to}} increase with irradiance. However, recent theoretical and observational {{studies have demonstrated}} that photosynthesis is also more efficient under diffuse light conditions 1 – 5. Changes in cloud cover or atmospheric aerosol loadings, arising from either volcanic or anthropogenic emissions, alter both the total photosynthetically active radiation reaching the surface and the fraction of this radiation which is diffuse, with uncertain overall effects on global plant productivity and the land carbon sink. Here we estimate the impact of variations in diffuse fraction on the land carbon sink using a global model modified to account for the effects of variations in both direct and diffuse radiation on canopy photosynthesis. We estimate that variations in diffuse fraction, associated largely with the ‘global dimming’ period 6 – 8, enhanced the land carbon sink by approximately one-quarter between 1960 and 1999.

40|$|Summary Ironically, {{the aspect}} {{of global climate change}} that we are most certain about, that there will be {{increasing}} concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 is also the factor about which we know the least in terms of its impact on weed competition. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 ([CO 2]) is thought to lead to the carbon <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effect</b> (CFE) and increasing water use efficiency (WUE). However, the extent to which desirable plants and weeds will benefit, and how these effects are distributed throughout the plant kingdom are uncertain. CLIMEX was used to explore the effect of increasing ecosystem water use efficiency (eWUE) on the potential distribution of three tropical weed species. In the tropics, increases in eWUE may have very little effect on weed distribution compared with the projected changes in temperature and rainfall if plants use the ‘extra ’ soil moisture to fuel additional growth. The effects of increasing CO 2 on tropical shrubs requires urgent research attention in realistic, competitive field situations to assess the vulnerability of primary production and biodiversity conservation sectors...|$|E
30|$|Nitrogen (N) is {{the most}} {{limiting}} nutrient in Douglas-fir and western hemlock sites (Bennett et al. 2003; Chappell et al. 1991). Consequently, fertilisation with N is more common than fertilising with other nutrients. The period of time for which tree growth is elevated after fertilisation is variable but relatively short, e.g. 5 – 10  years (Bennett et al. 2003; Binkley and Reid 1985), although exceptions can be found (Binkley and Reid 1985). When fertiliser is applied {{at the time of}} thinning the maximum response is observed about 5  years after treatment (Snowdon 2002). It has been hypothesized that the length of time that a <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effect</b> is observed depends on the amount of fertilisation applied in relation to the amount of the nutrient on site before fertilisation (Miller 1981). These hypotheses can be evaluated with the models. For each species, sites at three levels of site index were fertilised with 450  kg/ha of N fertiliser at age 50. This level of fertiliser is generally the maximum that is economically feasible (Barclay and Brix 1985). The percent change in growth as compared to an unfertilised site with the same site index was plotted (part a of Figure  3 is for Douglas-fir; part b is for western hemlock).|$|E

Over {{the course of an}} entire growing season, our objectives were to: (1) characterise soil moisture profiles in relation to site preparation techniques (ripping and created ashbeds) and (2) determine whether early seedling establishment can be increased through site preparation techniques (ripping and ashbeds), plant treatments (various fertilisers and biochar) and early planting during the wet season. Ripping significantly reduced soil compaction and was associated with a significant soil moisture stratification; moisture penetrated to greater depths in soils that were ripped or treated with ashbeds. Particular site preparation techniques (ripping) and early planting significantly increased early establishment, health and growth of tree seedlings. <b>Fertilisation</b> <b>effects</b> varied by species with generally neutral effects on seedlings. Finally, seedlings planted in ripped soils had significantly longer, deeper root systems accessing portions of the soil profile with higher summer moisture. Techniques such as ripping, even in deep sandy soils, reduce soil compaction and alter moisture availability within the soil profile, promoting deeper root growth and thus increasing revegetation success in these degraded Mediterranean ecosystems.

As nutrient contents in organic material often are unbalanced {{in comparison to the}} plants’ needs, the aim of this paper was to study the <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effect</b> of waste-based NPK compound fertiliser products and their potential to substitute conventional fertilisers in agricultural plant production. A pot experiment with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum var. italicum) as experimental crop was conducted where the four N-rich waste resources meat and bone meal (MBM), composted fish sludge (CFS) and two types of industrial compost (Dynea 2009 and Dynea 2004) were tested alone and in combination with K-rich bottom wood ash (BWA). Fertilisation levels (150 kg N ha- 1 + 120 kg K ha- 1; 300 kg N ha- 1 + 240 kg K ha- 1) were based on total N and K content in Nrich waste and BWA, respectively. Treatments with BWA, artificial compound fertiliser (minNPK) and calcium nitrate (minN) only, as well as an unfertilised control were used as references. Availability of mineral N was the key limiting factor to plant growth. Mineral fertiliser treatments resulted in the highest total yields being significantly different from all waste combinations Plants that received MBM or CFS fertilisation had good and even biomass production throughout the season, but fertilisation effects were limited by mineralised N. Mineral fertiliser equivalents of MBM and CFS treatments were between 48 - 73 %. MBM treatments increased the amount of soluble P in plant-soil systems to amounts that were higher than total P applied with the fertiliser product. MBM might therefore be a more valuable alternative P-fertiliser than one assumed so far. CFS seems to be more appropriate as an ingredient in alternative NPK fertiliser products than MBM because of reduced effects on residual P in the soil, good availability of P in the material, as well as a wider N:P ratio and relatively high initial amounts of mineral N. Dynea composts had poor fertilisation effects and can therefore rather be classified as soil conditioners than as fertilisers. K <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effect</b> of BWA was hidden by sufficient K supply from the soil but K-AL values of soils that were fertilised with BWA were significantly higher than soils of unfertilised control treatments. MinN + BWA treatments had poor establishment due to local pH increase and initial P deficiency, but leaching or denitrification of NO 3 -N was avoided so that the treatments still resulted in vigorous plant growth {{towards the end of the}} season.

Thus {{it appears that the}} biogeographical limits for sustained cold-water coral growth along the NE Atlantic margin are strongly related to climate change. By focussing on the last glacial interglacial cycle, this study shows that palaeo-productivity was increased during the last glacial.

After the Younger Dryas cold event, the input of aeolian dust and productivity significantly decreased concurrent with an increase in water temperatures in the GoC.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need to understand what makes vegetation at some locations more sensitive to climate change than others. For savanna rangelands, this requires building knowledge of how forage production in different land types will respond to climate change, and identifying how location-specific land type characteristics, climate and land management control the magnitude and direction of its responses to change. Here, a simulation analysis is used to explore how forage production in 14 land types of the north-eastern Australian rangelands responds to three climate change scenarios of + 3 A degrees C, + 17 % rainfall; + 2 A degrees C, - 7 % rainfall; and + 3 A degrees C, - 46 % rainfall. Our results demonstrate that the controls on forage production responses are complex, with functional characteristics of land types interacting to determine the magnitude and direction of change. Forage production may increase by up to 60 % or decrease by up to 90 % {{in response to the}} extreme scenarios of change. The magnitude of these responses is dependent on whether forage production is water or nitrogen (N) limited, and how climate changes influence these limiting conditions. Forage production responds most to changes in temperature and moisture availability in land types that are water-limited, and shows the least amount of change when growth is restricted by N availability. The <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effects</b> of doubled atmospheric CO 2 were found to offset declines in forage production under 2 A degrees C warming and a 7 % reduction in rainfall.

30|$|Wheat {{growth in}} the {{moderately}} acidic soil responded more than the calcareous soil when amended with P fertilisers. Fertilising with SS increased shoot and root growth compared to the control (C-a), resulting in similar values to those observed for TSP-a, suggesting that SS was as effective at releasing plant-available P as TSP. Several authors have reported increases in biomass and growth after SS application, suggesting that sewage sludge has a P fertilisation potential equivalent to inorganic fertilisers [4, 5]. Antolín et al. [33] found an increase in barley crop yield associated with an improvement in the early seedling establishment after application of sewage sludge. Azam and Lhodi [34] found positive effects of sewage sludge on the aboveground biomass of wheat plants, which increased by 41  % compared to the control plants. However, different <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effects</b> were observed between soils {{with the addition of}} P amendments. Sewage sludge-amended plants grown in moderately acidic soil (SS-a) had a shoot biomass 2.5 times and significantly higher than the control plants (C-a), while plants from SS-c showed a shoot biomass 1.2 times higher than C-c. The greater effect of SS in the moderately acidic soil compared to the calcareous soil is most probably caused by the difference in the initial content of plant-available P. Thus, the initial concentration of water-extractable P was more than twofold higher in the calcareous soil compared to the moderately acidic soil. In a similar vein, Frossard et al. [5] found a reduction in the effect of sludge because of a high soil-available P content of 6  mg water-extractable P kg− 1 soil. Therefore, despite the moderate P content in calcareous soil, in the present experiment this was not substantially limiting plant growth. Thus, we could confirm our second hypothesis that fertilisation with SS results in a higher immediate P fertilisation response, i.e. higher root and shoot growth in moderately acidic low P soil compared to calcareous soil.|$|R

A land-use and land-cover change module, driven by gross land-use transitions and wood harvest area was implemented, tailored {{to the needs of the}} Coupled Model Intercomparison Project- 6 (CMIP 6). Novel aspects include the treatment of secondary woody vegetation, which benefits from a tight coupling between the land-use module and the Population Orders Physiology (POP) module for woody demography and disturbance-mediated landscape heterogeneity. Land-use transitions and harvest associated with secondary forest tiles modify the annually-resolved patch age distribution within secondary-vegetated tiles, in turn affecting biomass accumulation and turnover rates and hence the magnitude of the secondary forest sink. Additionally, we implemented a novel approach to constrain modelled GPP consistent with the Co-ordination Hypothesis, predicted by evolutionary theory, which suggests that electron transport and Rubisco-limited rates adjust seasonally and across biomes to be co-limiting. We show that the default prior assumption - common to CABLE and other LSMs - of a fixed ratio of electron transport to carboxylation capacity is at odds with this hypothesis, and implement an alternative algorithm for dynamic optimisation of this ratio, such that co-ordination is achieved as an outcome of fitness maximisation.

This thesis evaluated different approaches to reduce the mineral fertiliser requirement in reed canary grass (RCG) production for bioenergy purposes in a spring harvesting system. <b>Fertilisation</b> <b>effects</b> and the risk of heavy metal enrichment were studied in a field experiment involving annual applications of ash for seven years. Three different treatments were applied: ash from co-combustion of RCG and municipal waste (mixed ash), pure RCG ash and, as a control, PK fertilisers. There {{were no significant differences between}} treatments in terms of RCG dry matter yield or biomass concentrations of heavy metals. Samples from the uppermost soil layer (0 - 5 cm) differed between treatments in terms of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead and zinc concentration, with higher concentrations in the mixed ash treatment compared with the control. The effects of intercropping RCG with different nitrogen (N) -fixing perennial legumes were examined in three field experiments, in combination with various fertilisation treatments. Two levels of N fertilisation combined with RCG ash or sewage sludge were applied in a delayed harvest system, which involved cutting the biomass in late autumn, leaving it on the field during winter and harvesting in spring. The estimated N fixation rate in red clover and alsike clover was high enough to compensate for lower N fertilisation. However, in most cases growth of the RCG in monoculture was not N-limited at half the recommended N fertilisation rate and intercropping with legumes was not beneficial. In order to determine the P and K requirements of RCG in a delayed harvest system, different levels of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), supplied by mineral fertilisers or RCG ash are being compared in an ongoing study.

However, understanding of climate change impacts on global crop yield, and of farmers’ adaptive capacity, remains incomplete as previous global assessments: (1) inadequately evaluated the role of extreme weather events; (2) focused on a small subset of {{the full range of}} climate change predictions; (3) overlooked uncertainties related to the choice of crop modelling approach and; (4) simplified the representation of farming adaptation strategies. This research aimed to assess climate change impacts on global crop yield that accounts for the knowledge gaps listed above, based on the further development and application of the global crop model PEGASUS. Four main research topics are presented. First, I investigated the roles of extreme heat stress at anthesis on crop yield and uncertainties related to the use of seventy-two climate change scenarios. I showed large disparities in impacts across regions as extreme temperatures adversely affects major areas of crop production and lower income countries, the latter appear likely to face larger reduction in crop yields. Second, I coordinated the first global gridded crop model intercomparison study, comparing simulations of crop yield and water use under climate change. I found modelled global average crop water productivity increases by up to 17 ± 20. 3 % when including carbon <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effects,</b> but decreases to – 28 ± 13. 9 % when excluding them; and identified fundamental uncertainties and gaps in our understanding of crop response to elevated carbon dioxide. Third, to link climate impacts with adaptation, I introduced the recently developed concept of representative agricultural pathways and examined their potential use in models to explore farming adaptation options within biophysical and socio-economic constraints. Finally, I explored tradeoffs between increasing nitrogen fertiliser use to close the global maize yield gap and the resulting nitrous oxide emissions. I found global maize production increases by 62 % based on current harvested area using intensive rates of nitrogen fertiliser. This raises the share of nitrous oxide emissions associated with maize production from 20 to 32 % of global cereal related emissions. Finally, these results demonstrated that in some regions increasing nitrogen fertiliser application, without addressing other limiting factors such as soil nutrient imbalance and water scarcity, could raise nitrous oxide emissions without enhancing crop yield...|$|R
40|$|The outputs of Global Climate Models (GCMs) were nested {{with the}} DSSAT 3. 5 CERES-Wheat model {{to explore the}} {{potential}} {{effects of climate change}} on South Australia's wheat production for the 2080 s with CO 2 <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effect</b> taken into account. A stochastic weather generator: LARS-WG was employed to generate daily climate change scenarios. The simulated results were fed into Arc/View to produce regional impact maps for visual assessment and spatial analysis under different climate change scenarios and CO 2 levels through an interface of AEGIS/WIN. Two sowing dates were employed to look at the potential impact of future climate change and atmospheric CO 2 increase on wheat production. Simulated results show that (1) Wheat yields increase under all CO 2 levels. Yields increase under different climate change scenarios in most cases. However, the increase is less than that under corresponding CO 2 levels due to the adverse effects of climate change. Wetter sites benefited less compared with drier sites under climate change scenarios. (2) Grain nitrogen content decreases under all CO 2 levels and under most of climate change scenarios, but the decrease under climate change scenarios is less than that under corresponding CO 2 level due to increased temperature which enhanced soil nitrogen mineralisation. Grain protein content decreased more at drier sites. The combined effects of climate change and increase of atmospheric CO 2 concentration will downgrade wheat quality at least one class at drier sites. (3) Grain yield at planting date of 30 June was significantly enhanced compared with that of planting date of 30 May under the same environmental change condition (same climate change scenarios plus their corresponding CO 2 levels).

40|$|Significant climatic {{changes are}} {{currently}} observed and, according to projections, will be strengthened over the 21 (st) century {{throughout the world}} with the continuing increase of the atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Climate will be generally warmer with notably changes in the seasonality and in the precipitation regime. These changes will have major impacts on the biodiversity and the functioning of natural ecosystems. The CARAIB dynamic vegetation model driven by the ARPEGE/Climate model under forcing from the A 2 IPCC emission scenario is used to illustrate and analyse the potential impacts of climate change on forest productivity and distribution as well as fire intensity over Europe. The potential CO 2 fertilizing effect is studied throughout transient runs of the vegetation model over the 1961 - 2100 period assuming constant and increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Without <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effect,</b> the net primary productivity (NPP) might increase in high latitudes and altitudes (by up to 40 % or even 60 - 100 %) while it might decrease in temperate (by up to 50 %) and in warmer regions, e. g., Mediterranean area (by up to 80 %). This strong decrease in NPP is associated with recurrent drought events occurring mostly in summer time. Under rising CO 2 concentration, NPP increases all over Europe by as much as 25 - 75 %, {{but it is not clear}} whether or not soils might sustain such an increase. The model indicates also that interannual NPP variability might strongly increase in the areas which will undergo recurrent water stress in the future. During the years exhibiting summer drought, the NPP might decrease to values much lower than present-day average NPP even when CO 2 fertilization is included. Moreover, years with such events will happen much more frequently than today. Regions with more severe droughts might also be affected by an increase of wildfire frequency and intensity, which may have large impacts on vegetation density and distribution. For instance, in the Mediterranean basin, the area burned by wildfire can be expected to increase by a factor of 3 - 5 at the end of the 21 (st) century compared to present. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{radiocarbon}} and tephra-dated sediment core from Lifebuoy Lake, {{located on}} the north-east coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, was analysed for pollen, spores, diatoms, chironomids and tephra in order to uncover regional environmental history. The 6500 -year environmental history of Lifebuoy Lake correlates with the broad regional patterns of vegetation development and climate dynamics with both diatoms and chironomids showing near-synchronous changes. Between ca. 6300 and 3900 calyrBP, the lake ecosystem was naturally enriched, with several Stephanodiscus species dominating the diatom plankton. This natural eutrophication state {{is likely to be}} due to a combination of the base-rich catchment geology, the <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effect</b> of several fires in the catchment, silica input from tephra layers and, possibly, nitrogen input from seabirds. The substantial tephra deposit at about 3850 calyrBP might have stopped sedimentary phosphorus from entering the lake water thus decreasing the trophic state of the lake and facilitating the shift in diatom composition to a benthic Fragiliariaceae complex. Both diatoms and chironomids showed simultaneous compositional changes, which are also reflected by statistically significant changes in their rates of change 300 – 400 years after the arrival of Pinus pumila in the lake catchment. The rapid increase in both total diatom concentration and the percentage abundance of the large heavy species, Aulacoseira subarctica might be a response to the change in timing and intensity of lake spring turn-over due to the changes in the patterns of North Pacific atmospheric circulation, most notably westward shift of the Aleutian Low. The two highest peaks in A. subarctica abundance at Lifebouy Lake occurred during opposite summer temperature inferences: the earlier peak (3500 – 2900 calyrBP) coincided with warm summers and the latter peak (300 calyrBP–present) occurred during the cold summer period. These imply that A. subarctica shows no direct response to the changes of summer air temperature. Instead, it appears to thrive during the periods of increased winter precipitation, thicker ice and late spring turn-over periods, i. e., shows indirect response to climate. The clearest effect of tephra deposition on the lake ecosystem is above 908 cm (ca. 3800 calyrBP) where the tephra deposit might have caused the shift from Stephanodiscus-dominated planktonic assemblages to the Fragilariaceae complex of benthic species. Tephra deposits might have also contributed towards the development of eutrophic plankton from about 6300 calyrBP. It is not certain if several tephra deposits influenced diatom and chironomid changes during the last 300 years...|$|E
40|$|Human {{induced changes}} in global {{environmental}} conditions {{are expected to}} influence or, as it is hypothesised in this study, have already influenced the biomass and growth of forest ecosystems. In this study, we reconstruct the history of tree growth and quantify the standing biomass along a chronosequence of six Norway spruce stands (Picea abies [L. ] Karst; 16 - 142 years old) on acid soils in a mountainous region with high nitrogen deposition. The inventories of the study sites, {{as well as the}} historical stem growth of the sample trees were compared with common yield tables, representing growing conditions before 1960, to find out if and when significant changes in growth of trees had occurred. The growth at tree level (0. 003 - 0. 030 m(3) yr(- 1)) was about 150 - 350 % higher than predicted by the yield tables, independent of tree age. Because of low stand densities due to early thinning, the increase of stem growth at stand level (90 % higher than yield table predictions) and the stand volume (35 % higher than yield table predictions) were not as high as the increase of growth at tree level. Total biomass at stand level (including stems, branches, twigs, needles and roots) ranged between 35 and 180 t C ha(- 1). Net primary productivity varied between 6 and 13 t C ha(- 1) yr(- 1). Intensive tree thinning activities probably stimulated growth of remaining trees, but the observed growth rates were beyond what would be expected from these activities exclusively. Thus it is assumed that the <b>fertilisation</b> <b>effects</b> of increased nitrogen deposition and CO 2 concentration, and improved climatic conditions due to ongoing climate change, have contributed to the observed changes in stem growth and that the thinning activities were synergetic with changing environmental conditions. The implications for carbon sinks as accountable under the Kyoto Protocol are probably small, because changes in environmental conditions are not accountable under the Kyoto Protocol and most of the observed changes in growth took place before 1990, the baseline for the Kyoto Protocol. Additionally, it is assumed that impacts on the carbon balance of forest stands due to changes in the thinning regime after 1990, which would be accountable according to article 3. 4 of the Kyoto Protocol, are very small without any synergetic changes in environmental conditions.

40|$|Near the {{completion}} of growth, mammalian oocytes acquire the competence to resume and complete meiosis. In vivo the preovulatory LH surge triggers the resumption of meiosis in the oocyte contained in preovulatory follicles. When immature oocytes and the surrounding cumulus cells are released from their follicular environment, resumption of meiosis is induced spontaneously. Culture of bovine cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) obtained from antral follicles results in blastocyst formation following in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilisation and in vitro embryo culture. Addition of growth hormone (GH) to the maturation medium accelerates nuclear maturation of cumulus enclosed bovine oocytes, induces cumulus expansion and promotes early embryonic development following in vitro <b>fertilisation.</b> The <b>effect</b> of GH is exerted through the cumulus cells and not mediated by IGF-I. Cumulus cells and the oocyte express mRNA for GH receptor. Using specific inhibitors {{it has been shown}} that the effect of GH on oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion is mediated by the cyclic AMP signal transduction pathway. Within COCs both cumulus cells and oocyte show GH immunoreactivity while expression of GH mRNA is only found in the oocyte. These observations point to a paracrine and/or autocrine action of GH in oocyte maturation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
