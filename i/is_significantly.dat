5|$|Bromine <b>is</b> <b>significantly</b> less {{abundant}} in the crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5parts per million of the Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts.

Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the Dead Sea contains 0.4% bromide ions.

40|$|Aims To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} unilateral PIC and specific dentofacial parameters. Materials and methods A sample of 216 subjects, with 108 subjects in the retrospective and prospective samples respectively. Dental parameters: The following dental parameters were assessed: Inter-canine and intermolar width; palatal depth and palatal area; anterior Bolton tooth-size discrepancy (TSD); maxillary arch shape and ratio and maxillary central and lateral incisor shape and ratio. Facial parameters: Three-dimensional (3 D) images were taken for subjects in the prospective sample only, and {{were used to assess}} the following facial parameters: Face shape; face ratio and 3 D distances and angles. Results Dental parameters: Inter-canine width <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> smaller in the test group compared to the control group in the retrospective (p= 0. 0002) and prospective (p= 0. 0018) samples respectively. Anterior Bolton TSD <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> higher in the prospective test group compared to controls (p= 0. 0070). Arch ratio <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> smaller in the test group than the control group for the retrospective sample (p= 0. 0029), whereas no significant difference was recorded in the prospective sample (p= 0. 1017). Arch shape distribution <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> different in the retrospective sample (p= 0. 009).
