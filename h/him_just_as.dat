Grannis and Baker are two elderly {{boarders}} who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met.

Kratos ignores her {{and tries to}} kill Zeus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the blade, granting Zeus escape. Before she dies, Athena reveals that Kratos is actually Zeus' son. Zeus was afraid Kratos would usurp <b>him,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Zeus had usurped his own father, Cronos.

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Silent Hill, James decides to search a local park, where he meets Maria, who claims {{that she has}} never met or seen Mary. As she is scared, he allows her to follow him. While looking for Laura inside a hospital, James and Maria are ambushed by the monster Pyramid Head, and Maria is killed by <b>him</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> James escapes. He resumes his task of finding Mary, and chooses to search a local hotel where he and Mary spent their vacation. On the way, James finds Maria alive and unharmed in a locked room. She claims ignorance of their previous encounter and discusses elements of James' and Mary's past that only Mary would know. James then sets off {{to find a way}} to release Maria from the room and eventually returns to find her dead again. Later on, he rescues Angela from a monster; she confesses that her father used to sexually abuse her, and a newspaper clipping James can find implies she killed him in self-defense before coming to Silent Hill. He also confronts Eddie, who admits to maiming a bully, and killing a dog, before fleeing to Silent Hill. Attacked by Eddie, James kills him in self-defense. At this point, it is revealed that Eddie saw a different version of Silent Hill - while James sees monsters that reflect his relationship with his wife, Eddie sees people laughing and taunting him to violence.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{tells her}} {{version of the story}} via a {{flashback}} to the previous day. She arrives at work and Mulder tells her about a murder in Texas, which he believes to be the work of vampires.

The agents travel to the small town of Chaney, Texas where they meet Sheriff Hartwell (Luke Wilson), whom Scully finds highly charming. Mulder and Hartwell leave to investigate further while Scully autopsies the body. She discovers that the victim, whose last meal had been pizza, was incapacitated with chloral hydrate. She returns to the motel room and orders a pizza, but Mulder soon appears and sends her back to autopsy another body. She leaves <b>him</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> her food is delivered.

When she catches up to him, Mulder has gotten there first and hammered a stake into Ronnie's heart.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} {{temple of}} the Angkorian region, Angkor Wat, was built between 1113 and 1150 by King Suryavarman II. Suryavarman ascended to the throne after prevailing in a battle with a rival prince.

25|$|Welcomed at the castle, {{especially}} by fellow poet Peavey, he is nevertheless suspected by the ever-vigilant Baxter, the real McTodd having telegrammed to cancel his visit. Eve arrives and Psmith begins his wooing with some success, despite her {{belief that he}} is McTodd and has jilted her friend.

25|$|It was {{the search}} for beauty that had {{attracted}} Metzinger to the abstract. Beauty depends not only on geometrical forms or simplified colors, but plainly beauty as it exists in itself. It wasn't just the simple result of a reductive approach to the elements of all the parts. It wasn't either just a dialectic view of everything that led <b>him</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> simply to treat each object {{as opposed to the}} other, and therefore thoroughly distinct. The blurring of differences was against the entire tenor of the whole.|$|E
25|$|Zach and Kendall's {{romance is}} shot to crumbs when Kendall learns that Zach caused the {{blackout}} which spun {{her in the}} position of having to carry her own child with Ryan instead of Greenlee's. Zach voices to Kendall that he arranged the blackout to sabotage her chances of surrogacy because he wanted to protect her from a dangerous Ryan. Kendall does not care for Zach's reasons and breaks off her romantic ties to <b>him,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> she is not feeling the maternal instinct. Zach also loses his son, Ethan, to death around this same time, and loses Kendall as well.|$|E
25|$|Harvey and Bryant's {{father were}} now dead, {{and he became}} {{increasingly}} lonely. From 1993 to late 1995, he visited various overseas countries fourteen times and a summary of his domestic airline travel filled three pages. He hated the destinations he travelled to, as he found that people there avoided <b>him</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> they did in Tasmania. However, he enjoyed the flights, as he could speak to the people sitting adjacent to him who {{had no choice but}} to be polite. Bryant later took great joy in describing some of the more successful conversations he had with fellow passengers.|$|E

25|$|Hume's wife Mary died on 30 March 1890 {{and news}} {{of her death}} reached <b>him</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> he reached London on 1 April 1890. Their only {{daughter}} Maria Jane Burnley ("Minnie") (1854 - 1927) had married Ross Scott at Shimla on 28 December 1881. Maria {{became a member of}} the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, another occult movement, after moving to England.

Hume's grandson Allan Hume Scott served with the Royal Engineers in India.|$|E
25|$|Saturn Devouring His Son, a {{disturbing}} {{portrait of the}} titan Saturn consuming one of his children, was one of six works with which Goya decorated the dining room. According to Roman myth (inspired by the original Greek myth), it had been foretold {{that one of the}} sons of Saturn would overthrow <b>him,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> he had overthrown his father, Caelus. To prevent this, Saturn ate his children moments after each was born. His wife Ops eventually hid his third son, Jupiter, on the island of Crete, deceiving Saturn by offering a stone wrapped in swaddling in his place. Jupiter eventually supplanted his father just as the prophecy had predicted.|$|E
25|$|In , Booster {{is part of}} the manhunt {{to bring}} the resurrected Maxwell Lord to justice. He finds Max but is beaten badly. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom find <b>him</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Lord uses his psychic powers to the utmost to erase all memory of himself from the minds of the entire world. For some reason, Booster, Fire, Ice, and Atom {{are the only ones who}} {{remember}} Lord and see him in recorded images. Trying to convince Batman (Dick Grayson), Booster is horrified to learn that, thanks to Max, the world believes Ted Kord committed suicide. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom are soon set up by Max to cut them off from allies, but, ironically, Booster is left alone because his reputation is already poor.|$|E

25|$|On the Ides of March (15 March; see Roman calendar) of 44 BC, Caesar was due {{to appear}} at a session of the Senate. Several Senators had conspired to assassinate Caesar. Mark Antony, having vaguely learned of the plot the night before from a terrified liberator named Servilius Casca, and fearing the worst, went to head Caesar off. The plotters, however, had {{anticipated}} this and, fearing that Antony would come to Caesar's aid, had arranged for Trebonius to intercept <b>him</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> he approached the portico of the Theatre of Pompey, where the session was to be held, and detain him outside. (Plutarch, however, assigns this action to delay Antony to Brutus Albinus.) When he heard the commotion from the Senate chamber, Antony fled.|$|E
25|$|Rebellion and {{rejection}} are also expressed themes in this story. Bartleby refuses {{to conform to}} the normal ways of the people around him and instead, simply just doesn't complete his tasks requested by his boss. He does not make any request for changes in the workplace, but just continues to be passive to the work happening around <b>him.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> public rejects changes from a normal routine, this rebellious style by Bartleby causes his co-workers to reject him as he is not behaving the same {{as the rest of the}} work place environment. The narrator tries multiple tactics to get Bartleby {{to conform to the}} standards of the workplace, and ultimately realizes that Bartleby's mental state is not that of normal society. Although the narrator sees Bartleby as a harmless person, the narrator refuses to engage in the same peculiar rhythm that Bartleby is stuck in.|$|E
25|$|Since Macpherson {{had long}} {{served as the}} coach for the Bryan brothers, it was {{inevitable}} that the twins would want to follow <b>him</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> they did when he was hired as the Aviators' head coach in 2014. Consequently, prior to the WTT draft on March 16, 2015, the Aviators traded Bob and Mike Bryan to the Dream for financial consideration. The Aviators did not protect 2014 WTT Female Most Valuable Player Daniela Hantuchov√° in the marquee portion of the draft. Madison Keys was assigned to the Aviators as a league-designated player, and they selected her as their only marquee draft pick. In the roster portion of the draft, the Aviators protected Raven Klaasen and Kvƒõta Peschke. They did not protect 2014 WTT Male Rookie of the Year Somdev Devvarman. The Aviators selected amateur Taylor Fritz and Chanelle Scheepers in the roster portion of the draft. Fritz was the only amateur player selected in the 2015 WTT Draft.|$|E
