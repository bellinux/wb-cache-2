50|$|There {{are four}} types of <b>divorce</b> in Japan: <b>Divorce</b> by {{agreement}} in which the <b>divorce</b> is mutual, <b>divorce</b> by mediation which happens in family court, <b>divorce</b> by decision of family court that takes place when a couple cannot complete a <b>divorce</b> through mediation, and <b>divorce</b> by judgment of district court.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, {{the theory}} of overall {{heterogeneity}} can adequately explain how <b>divorce</b> risk changes over time. As Vaupel and Yashin pointed out, what is so special about the phenomenon of <b>divorce</b> is that not every married couple will eventually <b>divorce,</b> and {{the large majority of}} couples who will never <b>divorce</b> seriously affect the shape of the overall <b>divorce</b> risk function. Split-population models show that the <b>divorce</b> risk function for couples who will eventually <b>divorce</b> is a linear monotonically increasing line, which is in essence different from the overall <b>divorce</b> risk function. The inverted U-shape overall <b>divorce</b> risk function accurately reflects neither the <b>divorce</b> pattern of couples who will eventually <b>divorce</b> nor the <b>divorce</b> risk of couples who will never <b>divorce.</b> Therefore, the “seven-year itch” reflects the mixed result of <b>divorce</b> risk dynamics for various marriage cohorts undergoing dramatic social, economic, and institutional changes; it is mainly the result of population heterogeneity, i.e., given that {{only a small number of}} couples end their marriage in <b>divorce.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Divorce</b> rate in Czech Republic: {{cross-sectional}} and cohort view Abstract The bachelor thesis {{deals with}} trends of <b>divorce</b> {{rate in the}} Czech Republic after the World War II up to the present. In the theoretical part it focuses on the legislative changes affecting <b>divorce</b> rate during the period under study and on the population structure according to marital status. Furthermore, it describes <b>divorce</b> rate development on {{the territory of the}} Czech Republic using demographic indicators measuring <b>divorce</b> quantum and timing. This part mainly shows the development of total and crude <b>divorce</b> rate and the impact of average marriage length on <b>divorce</b> frequency. The study of major causes of <b>divorce</b> and role of a minor child, or the number of minor children in the family on the <b>divorce</b> rate is included. Next chapter focuses on the study of <b>divorce</b> rate of selected marriage cohorts. The last chapter is dedicated to the international comparison of <b>divorce</b> rate.

The reforms range from countries that legalized <b>divorce</b> to the introduction of no-fault grounds and unilateral <b>divorce.</b> We estimate that the introduction of no-fault, unilateral <b>divorce</b> increased the <b>divorce</b> rate by about 0. 6, a sizeable effect given the average rate of 2 <b>divorces</b> per 1000 people in 2002. <b>Divorce</b> rates Legislation Unilateral <b>divorce</b> No-fault <b>divorce...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper revisits the {{evidence}} {{on the impact of}} unilateral <b>divorce</b> laws on <b>divorce</b> rates in the United States. Most states switched from requiring mutual consent to allowing unilateral or no-fault <b>divorce</b> between 1970 and 1985, while the national <b>divorce</b> rate more than doubled after 1965. According to the Coase theorem, however, the legal shift should have had no effect on <b>divorce</b> rates. Recent papers using cross-sectional micro data have disputed the empirical importance of unilateral <b>divorce,</b> disagreeing in particular about controls for state-level heterogeneity in <b>divorce</b> propensities. This paper uses a panel of state-level <b>divorce</b> rates which includes virtually every <b>divorce</b> in the U. S. over the entire period of the law changes. Adding comprehensive controls - year and state fixed effects and state fixed trends - for changing unobservable <b>divorce</b> propensities reveals that the <b>divorce</b> rate would have been about 6 % lower if states had not switched to unilateral <b>divorce,</b> accounting for 17 % of the increase in the <b>divorce</b> rate between 1968 and 1988. Additional results in this paper demonstrate that the type of unilateral <b>divorce</b> law that states adopted matters. Weaker versions of unilateral <b>divorce,</b> which retain elements of mutual <b>divorce,</b> raised the <b>divorce</b> rate significantly, but by less than the strongest versions of unilateral <b>divorce</b> did. ...|$|R

5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of <b>divorced</b> women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that <b>divorced</b> lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit <b>divorced</b> lesbian mothers more often than <b>divorced</b> nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E
5000|$|Many states {{allow for}} couples {{to file for}} a summary <b>divorce</b> based upon a jointly filed <b>divorce</b> petition. A summary <b>divorce</b> means the spouses have {{discussed}} the terms required by state law to issue a <b>divorce</b> and they have reached an mutual agreement.

50|$|Military <b>divorce</b> is a {{specific}} type of <b>divorce</b> that arises when one or both partners are members of the military. Although typically an uncontested <b>divorce,</b> military <b>divorces</b> are different because they require additional requirements to be fulfilled. <b>Divorces</b> occur less frequently than within the civilian population. They present a special set of challenges that make military <b>divorces</b> more complicated than a typical <b>divorce.</b> For example, The Federal Service Members Civil Relief Act of 2003 requires any person seeking a <b>divorce</b> to state that their spouse is or is not currently a member of the United States armed forces. This is meant to prevent spouses from seeking <b>divorces</b> from service members who would be unable to attend <b>divorce</b> proceedings.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{response}} of the <b>divorce</b> rate to law reform introducing unilateral <b>divorce</b> after controlling for law reforms concerning the aftermath of <b>divorce,</b> which are omitted from most previous works. We introduce two main policy changes that have swept the U. S. since the late 1970 s; the approval of the joint custody regime and the Child Support Enforcement program. Because those reforms affect <b>divorce</b> decisions by counteracting the reallocation of property rights generated by the unilateral <b>divorce</b> procedure and by increasing the expected financial costs of <b>divorce,</b> it is arguable that their omission might obscure the impact of unilateral <b>divorce</b> reforms on <b>divorce</b> rates. Our results suggest that what has driven the decline in the <b>divorce</b> rate since the 1980 s are law reforms concerning the aftermath of <b>divorce</b> rather than a reverse response of <b>divorce</b> rates to the adoption of unilateral <b>divorce</b> laws. Supplemental analysis, developed to examine the frequency of permanent shocks in U. S. <b>divorce</b> rates, indicates that the positive permanent changes in <b>divorce</b> rates can be associated with the implementation of unilateral <b>divorce,</b> and that the negative permanent changes can be related to the law reforms concerning living arrangement in aftermath of <b>divorce.</b> This seems to confirm the important role of those policies in the evolution of <b>divorce</b> rates. ...|$|R

5000|$|Fault <b>divorces</b> are {{becoming}} less common today because almost every state now recognizes no-fault <b>divorces.</b> [...] No-fault <b>divorces</b> {{are more common}} since no proof of fault is required.

Another benefit of a fault <b>divorce</b> is the monetary gain. Proof of the accused party’s wrongdoing may result in the court granting the filing spouse a larger portion of the marital property or increased support and alimony.

40|$|There is {{extensive}} literature examining {{changes in}} <b>divorce</b> rates {{focusing on the}} effects of changes in <b>divorce</b> laws. Previous analysis omits reforms that introduced changes in <b>divorce</b> settlements. This might in somehow obscure the impact of unilateral reforms on <b>divorce</b> rates. In this paper, we extend on the previous analyses offering insights on the impact of unilateral <b>divorce</b> on <b>divorce</b> rates after controlling for several reforms of aspects of law relevant to <b>divorce.</b> We introduce both joint custody law reforms and Child Support Enforcement efforts. Our results suggest that those reforms {{play an important role in}} explaining the behaviour of <b>divorce</b> rate in the 1980 s and 1990 s. Supplemental analysis, developed by exploiting time-series analysis, also suggests that what is driving the evolution of the <b>divorce</b> rate in the 1980 s and 1990 s is a shock that had a negative effect on <b>divorce.</b> This seems to confirm that unilateral <b>divorce</b> reforms do not have a negative effect on <b>divorce</b> rate in the long run.
