5|$|<b>His</b> <b>loss</b> {{of faith}} in human {{relationships}} is mirrored in <b>his</b> <b>loss</b> {{of faith in}} God. During the first night, {{as he and his}} father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence.|$|E

5|$|Gebhard's {{conversion}} and marriage {{was the first}} major test of the principle of ecclesiastical reservation established in the Peace of Augsburg, 1555. <b>His</b> <b>loss</b> of the Electorate strengthened the Catholic counter reformation in the northern German states, gave the Jesuits a stronghold in Cologne, and expanded the Wittelsbach family influence in imperial politics.|$|E

5|$|When facing {{world-class}} opponents, Gossip {{more often}} {{fell victim to}} their combinations. A famous example is <b>his</b> <b>loss,</b> also at New York 1889, to Mikhail Chigorin (White), who lost world championship matches to Steinitz in 1889 and 1892.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here <b>his</b> <b>loss</b> of power.|$|E

5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} {{in the years following}} the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to <b>his</b> <b>loss</b> of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E
5|$|British {{military}} leadership, {{which had}} been decisive up to Brock's death, suffered a blow with <b>his</b> <b>loss.</b> His direct successor, Major-General Sheaffe, although successful in his approach at Queenston Heights, {{was never able to}} live up to Brock's reputation. He was criticised by many, including John Strachan, for his retreat at the Battle of York, and was shortly after recalled to England, where he continued a successful, if not brilliant, military career.|$|E
5|$|Crush's {{rivalry with}} Vega ended {{when he joined}} the Nation in early 1997. Crush aided Faarooq in his feud with Ahmed Johnson. After <b>his</b> <b>loss</b> to Goldust at King of the Ring, Crush argued with Savio Vega, during Faarooq's WWF Championship title shot, which distracted Faarooq, causing him to lose the match. The {{following}} night on Raw is War, Crush and Vega, {{along with the rest of}} Nation were fired by Faarooq.

The third session saw no comeback from Murphy and O'Sullivan progressed to the quarter-finals 13−7. The quarter-finals would be the furthest O'Sullivan would progress, as he fell behind Ding Junhui 6–10 after the opening two sessions. Despite scoring the tournament's highest break with a 146 in the final session, he would eventually lose 10–13. Following <b>his</b> <b>loss,</b> O'Sullivan stated {{that he had no}} intention of retiring.|$|E

During the 1856 presidential election, Letcher spoke on behalf of Millard Fillmore in Pennsylvania, New York, and Kentucky. In 1857 and 1858, he urged John J. Crittenden to oppose the Lecompton Constitution for Kansas.|$|E
