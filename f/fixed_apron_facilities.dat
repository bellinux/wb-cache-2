50|$|The runways, taxiways and aprons {{are able}} to {{accommodate}} large aircraft, {{up to and including}} the Airbus A380. Currently there is no scheduled A380 routes, however Hamburg Airport is a diversion airport for Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport, the location of the Airbus plant in Hamburg, where all A380s are painted and interior fitted prior to delivery. Therefore, the <b>apron</b> <b>facilities</b> had already been upgraded for the use by A380s before the terminal stands.|$|R
25|$|To {{maintain}} the current two-runway system, {{there will be}} enhancements to the terminal and <b>apron</b> <b>facilities</b> to increase the airport's capacity. This option will enable the airport to handle a maximum of 420,000 flight movements per year, with annual passenger and cargo throughput increased to 74 million and six million tonnes respectively. The approximate cost of this plan is $23.4 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2010 prices, or HK$42.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices. However, the Airport Authority estimates that the airport will reach its maximum runway capacity sometime around 2020 if no extra runway is added.|$|R

50|$|Royal Air Force Gibraltar or {{more simply}} RAF Gibraltar, also {{formerly}} known as North Front, is a Royal Air Force station on Gibraltar. No military aircraft are currently stationed there, but RAF, Commonwealth and aircraft of other NATO nations will periodically arrive for transient stopovers, exercises, or other temporary duty. Administered by British Forces Gibraltar, the station is a joint civil-military facility that also functions as the Rock's civilian airport - Gibraltar Airport, with the civilian airport's passenger terminal building and <b>apron</b> <b>facilities</b> located {{on the north side}} of the runway while the apron and hangar of RAF Gibraltar are located on the south side of the runway.|$|R
50|$|The airport has {{two primary}} runways: one sealed and one brown gravel (with large grass area {{either side of}} gravel). The airport also has one {{secondary}} runway used for glider traffic. The sealed runway, taxiway and <b>apron</b> have lighting <b>facilities</b> which are pilot-activated.|$|R
50|$|The airport {{facilities}} {{were designed to}} address the movement of aircraft {{and the growth of}} passenger and cargo traffic projected until 1990 and thereafter. A taxiway parallel to the runway was built later, along with the <b>facilities,</b> <b>apron,</b> and hangars to serve general aviation.|$|R
50|$|After some {{construction}} of additional runways, taxiways, <b>aprons</b> and support <b>facilities,</b> the 78th Fighter-Interceptor Group with its 432d and 433d Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons arrived on November 1, 1952, replacing the 78th ABS {{as the host}} operating unit at Truax. The 78th was reassigned from Hamilton AFB, California and flew the F-86 Sabre and F-89 Scorpion aircraft in a fighter-interceptor role.|$|R
50|$|During 1941, as the Army Air Corps transitioned to the U.S. Army Air Forces, a {{major project}} {{took place at}} Lawson with the {{construction}} of barracks, runways, parking <b>aprons</b> and other <b>facilities.</b> Several additional observation, reconnaissance, and light bomber squadrons passed through Lawson during 1941 and the first of 1942. The 74th Observation Group (February 27, 1942 - April 10, 1942) Trained personnel in aerial reconnaissance, medium bombardment, and fighter techniques.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the {{original}} terminal building, the eastern runway (17L/35R), control tower, east <b>apron</b> and cargo <b>facilities</b> commenced in 1961. On February 2, 1967, the airport was commissioned Aeropuerto Internacional de Pudahuel, due to its location in the municipality of Pudahuel. On March 19, 1980, the airport was rechristened Air Commodore Arturo Merino Ben√≠tez International Airport in honour of {{the founder of the}} Chilean Air Force and Chilean carrier LATAM Chile.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the former}} Air Force {{facilities}} remain. Sections of the World War II airfield remain {{as well as the}} wartime aircraft parking <b>apron.</b> Those <b>facilities</b> were used by Air Defense Command interceptors, with the ADC alert sheds remaining and a section of the Wartime NW/SE runway being converted into a taxiway for the interceptors to use for alert launches. ADC control and maintenance buildings remain intact, albeit unused. The Wurtsmith Air Museum is housed in the old ADC alert facility. The SAC B-52 alert facility and alert pads remain and are unused. The large parking ramp built by SAC for B-52s and KC-135s now is utilized by the Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport as aircraft parking space, and some of the old SAC hangars also appear to be in use.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the Cold War {{military}} buildup, Grandview Airport was leased by the United States Air Force on 1 January 1952. After some construction and upgrading of facilities, Grandview Air Force Base was opened on 1 October 1952, with the 4610th Air Base Squadron being the base operating unit (operating from Fairfax Field in Kansas City, Kansas). No military personnel were assigned prior to 1954 while major construction took place of runways, taxiways, <b>aprons</b> and support <b>facilities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} parking <b>aprons</b> at the <b>facility</b> {{are approximately}} 87,000 ft2 and encompass approximately 170,000 ft2 of area. [...] The principal apron is located northwest of Runway 19 {{and has the}} capacity to hold 42 aircraft. The secondary apron is located in front of the terminal building and has the capacity for 10 aircraft. A small fueling apron is located between the two parking aprons. Aircraft tie-down spaces are leased by the facility's FBO from the State of Vermont.|$|R
50|$|The stadium {{track is}} a nine lane European oval, with straightaways of 82 meters and curves of 118 meters in length, which creates a longer, {{smoother}} curve {{than the typical}} 100 m-by-100 m configuration. This smoother curve has given the track {{a reputation as one}} of the fastest tracks in the United States, if not the world. The field events area consists of several throwing circles, dual jump lanes, and two high jump <b>aprons.</b> The <b>facility</b> also houses a 21200 sq ft field house consisting of a press box, locker rooms for the UT track and soccer teams, visitors' and officials locker rooms, a specialized training room, and a lounge for track and soccer athletes and coaches. There is a scoreboard at each end of the stadium, and full lighting allows events to be conducted at night. On the west side of the stadium stands a 1,200-space parking garage.|$|R
50|$|A new {{terminal}} was recently completed and other general aviation upgrades are underway. A total upgrade of the runway, taxiway, <b>apron,</b> and related <b>facilities</b> {{is expected to}} commence in 2008. It will improve taxiway-runway spacing, allow larger aircraft to land, and incorporate design features {{that have been developed}} since the 1920s and 1950s expansions. These original plans have served the airport remarkably well, functioning during every aviation era from open biplanes to corporate jets. The realignment of the runway will mark the first such alteration in over 80 years.|$|R
50|$|The Ukrainian government's {{air fleet}} (Ukraine Air Enterprise) {{is based at}} Boryspil. This fleet compromises one Airbus A319 {{for the use of}} the President of Ukraine, two {{long-haul}} Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft and a number of smaller aircraft and helicopters for general government use. Currently these aircraft are based near the covered hangars to the north of Terminal F. However, with the completion of Boryspil 2, it is expected that the government's dedicated aircraft will move to that <b>facility's</b> <b>apron,</b> thus allowing officials to board/disembark their aircraft with minimum adverse effects on other civil operations.|$|R
50|$|As of December 2015, a major {{redesign}} of Terminal 1 including a capacity increase and {{an extension of}} the central terminal building to the west for centralised security and shopping facilities was under preparation. In November 2016, a major ‚Ç¨400m extension and refurbishment for Terminal 1 has been announced. Terminal areas A and B will be entirely redesigned {{with the addition of a}} 320m long pier stretching out on the <b>apron.</b> The new <b>facilities</b> will provide capacity for 6 million additional passengers, will be able to handle 12 aircraft including two Airbus A380s at once, and are due to open by 2022.|$|R
5000|$|Kisumu International Airport is {{an airport}} in Kisumu, Kenya [...] It is the third-busiest airport in Kenya and the country's fourth {{international}} airport.
