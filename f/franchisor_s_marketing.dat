First, except China we find high cross-sectional correlation of the daily stock returns across the East Asian and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>markets.</b> A comparison of the results between the two sub-periods demonstrates a recent strengthening of the linkages. In particular, China records profound increases in its correlations with the other East Asian and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>markets.</b> Second, we find that {{with the exception of}} China the stock returns on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> exert {{a significant impact on the}} night-time market returns of Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan (in order).

When cross-listed firms are {{divided into two groups}} {{on the basis of their}} share turnover in the home market relative to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market,</b> only the firms that develop active trading in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> experience an increase in valuation. Foreign firms that remain predominantly traded in the home market following cross-listing are valued similarly to non-cross-listed firms. To gain the full benefits of cross-listing, a foreign firm must convince investors that their shareholder rights will be protected.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which financial returns on market indices exhibit mean and volatility asymmetries, as a response to past information from both the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> and the local market itself. In particular, we wish to assess the asymmetric effect of a combination of local and U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> news on volatility. To the best of the authors knowledge, this joint effect has not been considered previously. We propose a double threshold non-linear heteroscedastic model, combined with a GJR-GARCH effect in the conditional volatility equation, to capture jointly both mean and volatility asymmetric behaviours and the interactive effect of U. <b>S.</b> and local <b>market</b> news. In an application to five major international market indices, clear evidence of threshold non-linearity is discovered, supporting the hypothesis of an uneven mean-reverting pattern and volatility asymmetry, both in reaction to U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> news and news from the local market itself. Significant, but somewhat different, interactive effects between local and U. S. news are observed in all markets. An asymmetric pattern in the exogenous relationship between the local market and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> is also found. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

While these findings suggest weaker linkages, the reaction to bad market news has strengthened after the crisis. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> is the main source to the mean spillover effects.

We test the heterogeneous-agent, rational expectations model of Llorente, Michaely, Saar, and Wang (2002) {{for a comprehensive}} sample of 556 foreign stocks cross-listed on U. <b>S.</b> <b>markets</b> from 36 different markets. Their model argues that investors trade to speculate on their private information or to rebalance their portfolios and predicts that returns associated with portfolio rebalancing tend to reverse themselves while returns generated by speculative trades tend to continue themselves. We test this prediction by analyzing the relationship between trading volume and return comovements between the home and U. <b>S.</b> <b>markets</b> for the cross-listed shares. We hypothesize that returns in the home (U. <b>S.)</b> <b>market</b> on high-volume days {{are more likely to}} continue to spill over into the U. <b>S.</b> (home) <b>market</b> for those stocks subject to the risk of greater informed trading.
