5|$|To {{better control}} the {{population}} of termites, various methods {{have been developed to}} track termite movements. One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white, cow milk, or soy milk proteins, which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test.|$|E

40|$|The <b>immunoglobulins</b> <b>G,</b> A and M run chiefly in {{the beta}} and gamma regions on {{cellulose}} acetate electrophoresis. Observations {{suggest that in}} most instances the <b>immunoglobulins</b> <b>G</b> and A can be predicted on a semiquantitative basis from the electrophoretic densitometer pattern by inspection using simple parameters and that elevated values in many patients can be excluded with a considerable degree of confidence. It {{is not possible to}} predict effectively the value of immunoglobulin M. Data for analysis have been derived from thirty-five healthy subjects and two hundred patients. Protein fractionation was performed by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate membranes using the Beckman Microzone system and an Analytrol densitometer-integrator. The <b>immunoglobulins</b> <b>G,</b> A and M were determined using an agar gel immunodiffusion technique with commercially prepared plates and standards (Hyland).

25|$|Culture or PCR are {{the current}} means for {{detecting}} {{the presence of}} the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia. OspA antigens, shedded by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. High titers of either <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years.|$|E
25|$|Immunoaffinity {{chromatography}} {{uses the}} specific binding of an antibody-antigen to selectively purify the target protein. The procedure involves immobilizing a protein to a solid substrate (e.g. a porous bead or a membrane), which then selectively binds the target, while everything else flows through. The target protein can be eluted {{by changing the}} pH or the salinity. The immobilized ligand can be an antibody (such as <b>Immunoglobulin</b> <b>G)</b> {{or it can be}} a protein (such as Protein A). Because this method does not involve engineering in a tag, it can be used for proteins from natural sources.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> (IgG) {{antibodies}} {{are large}} heterodimeric molecules, approximately 150 kDa and {{are composed of}} two kinds of polypeptide chain, called the heavy (~50kDa) and the light chain (~25kDa). The two types of light chains are kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). By cleavage with enzyme papain, the Fab (fragment-antigen binding) part can {{be separated from the}} Fc (fragment constant) part of the molecule. The Fab fragments contain the variable domains, which consist of three antibody hypervariable amino acid domains responsible for the antibody specificity embedded into constant regions. The four known IgG subclasses are involved in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.|$|E

25|$|There are {{hypersensitivity}} responses, both a type I response (atopic, with {{formation of}} immunoglobulin E, or IgE) and a type III hypersensitivity response (with formation of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G,</b> or IgG). The reaction of IgE with Aspergillus antigens results in mast cell degranulation with bronchoconstriction and increased capillary permeability. Immune complexes (a type III reaction) and inflammatory cells are deposited within the mucous membranes of the airways, leading to necrosis (tissue death) and eosinophilic infiltration. Type 2 T helper cells appear {{to play an}} important role in ABPA due to an increased sensitivity to interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-5. These cytokines up-regulate mast cell degranulation, exacerbating respiratory decline.|$|E
25|$|VAR2CSA {{is unique}} {{in that it is}} mostly {{produced}} by the placenta during pregnancy (the condition called pregnancy-associated malaria, PAM, or placental malaria). The majority of PAM is therefore due to VAR2SCA. Unlike other PfEMP1, VAR2CSA binds to chondroitin sulphate A present on the vascular endothelium of placenta. Although its individual domains can bind to CSA, its entire structure is used for complete binding. The major complication in PAM is low-birth-weight babies. However, women who survived the first infection generally develop an effective immune response. In P. falciparum-prevalent regions in Africa, pregnant women are found to contain high levels of antibody (<b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G,</b> or IgG) against VAR2CSA, which protect them the placenta-attacking malarial parasite. They are noted for giving birth to heavier babies.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to VZV in {{a healthy}} child initiates the {{production}} of host <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies; IgG antibodies persist for life and confer immunity. Cell-mediated immune responses are also important in limiting the scope and the duration of primary varicella infection. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. VZV then remains latent in the dorsal ganglion cells of the sensory nerves. Reactivation of VZV results in the clinically distinct syndrome of herpes zoster (i.e., shingles), postherpetic neuralgia, and sometimes Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II. Varicella zoster can affect the arteries in the neck and head, producing stroke, either during childhood, or after a latency period of many years.|$|E
50|$|Hyper IgM syndromes is a {{group of}} primary immune {{deficiency}} disorders characterized by defective CD40 signaling; via B cells affecting class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation. Immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination deficiencies are characterized by elevated serum Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels and a considerable deficiency in <b>Immunoglobulins</b> <b>G</b> (IgG), A (IgA) and E (IgE). As a consequence, people with HIGM have decreased concentrations of serum IgG and IgA and normal or elevated IgM, leading to increased susceptibility to infections.|$|R

IgM was found in only five patients, but its presence, together with an increase in IgG and IgA concentrations, appears to indicate activity of the pathological process and a poor prognosis for the course of the disease...|$|R
25|$|Individual {{immunity}} {{can also}} be gained passively, in which antibodies to a pathogen are transferred from one individual to another. This can occur naturally, whereby maternal antibodies, primarily <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> antibodies, are transferred across the placenta and in colostrum to fetuses and newborns, or artificially, by which antibodies from the serum or plasma of an immune individual are injected into a susceptible person. Protection generated from passive immunity is immediate but wanes {{over the course of}} weeks to months, so any contribution to herd immunity is temporary. For diseases that are especially severe among fetuses and newborns, such as influenza and tetanus, pregnant women may be immunized in order to transfer antibodies to the child. In the same way, high-risk groups that are either more likely to experience infection or are more likely to develop complications from infection may receive antibody preparations to prevent these infections or to reduce the severity of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Maternal passive {{immunity}} {{is a type}} of naturally acquired {{passive immunity}}, and refers to antibody-mediated immunity conveyed to a fetus or infant by its mother. Naturally acquired passive immunity can be provided during pregnancy, and through breastfeeding. In humans, maternal antibodies (MatAb) are passed through the placenta to the fetus by an FcRn receptor on placental cells. This occurs predominately during the third trimester of pregnancy, and thus is often reduced in babies born prematurely. <b>Immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> (IgG) is the only antibody isotype that can pass through the human placenta, and is the most common antibody of the five types of antibodies found in the body. IgG antibodies protects against bacterial and viral infections in fetuses. Immunization is often required shortly following birth to prevent diseases in newborns such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B, polio, and pertussis, however, maternal IgG can inhibit the induction of protective vaccine responses throughout the first year of life. This effect is usually overcome by secondary responses to booster immunization.|$|E

500|$|A {{phagocyte}} {{has many}} types of receptors on its surface {{that are used to}} bind material. They include [...] opsonin receptors, scavenger receptors, and Toll-like receptors.

[...] "Complement" [...] is the name given to a complex series of protein molecules found in the blood that destroy cells or mark them for destruction. Scavenger receptors bind to a large range of molecules on the surface of bacterial cells, and Toll-like receptors—so called because of their similarity to well-studied receptors in fruit flies that are encoded by the Toll gene—bind to more specific molecules. Binding to Toll-like receptors increases phagocytosis and causes the phagocyte to release a group of hormones that cause inflammation.|$|E
