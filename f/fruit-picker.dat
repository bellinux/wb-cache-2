40|$|Published online: 01 July 2008 We interviewed {{half of the}} mango-growers in {{northern}} Benin, including 15 farmers involved in a regional fruit fly project, and held focus group discussions with women <b>fruit-pickers.</b> They were asked about pest management and their knowledge of a weaver ant, Oecophylla longinoda. All considered low yields due to fruit flies to be the principal constraint upon mango production, estimating economic losses to be between 20 and 45 %. None could recognize damage during the first 2 days after fruit fly egg deposition. On-farm research persuaded farmers to stop using insecticides and it also changed negative perceptions of Oecophylla. Over 80 % of the farmers involved in on-farm research, compared to 25 % of those not involved, reported Oecophylla to be beneficial. All <b>fruit-pickers</b> knew that ants protected mango from fruit flies, with 60 % attributing better mango quality in terms of appearance, shelf-life and sweetness {{to the presence of}} Oecophylla. Nevertheless, 40 % of the pickers still considered weaver ants a nuisance pest during harvest.

40|$|The weaver ants Oecophylla smaragdina and O. longinoda are {{abundant}} in tropical Asia, Australia and Africa. Although local {{people and a}} handful of scientists appreciate the benefits these tree-dwelling ants bring in terms of medicinal and food source, protection of tree crops, and enhancement of fruit and nut quality, Oecophylla has one major drawback: it also bites people. Perception of this nuisance, and the response to it, is influenced by the frequency of encounters and the perceived benefits gained from Oecophylla. We used a range of methods in more than ten countries to document how people reduce weaver ant nuisance, including interactive rural radio programs. Apart from growers, also ant brood collectors, <b>fruit-pickers</b> and intermediaries in the value chain hold in-depth ecological knowledge on weaver ants.

40|$|Viliami Tanginoa {{died three}} {{years ago at the}} Maribyrnong {{detention}} centre. Now that the coroner has reported, Peter Mares looks at why The video shows a man sitting quite still, his face impassive. The only visible movement is an occasional puffing of the cheeks as he blows bursts of air through half-closed lips. It is a gesture that suggests forbearance, as if he is breathing through gritted teeth. Perhaps he is endeavouring to see off the pain in legs cramped after almost eight hours of crouching. Perhaps he is trying to ignore the growing pressure on his bladder. Perhaps the puffing helps to chase certain thoughts from his mind or disperses the water that is trickling down his face. It is raining hard. A summer thunderstorm has dumped sheets of water on Melbourne’s western suburbs. The man’s back is hunched to the deluge but nothing can prevent him from being drenched. He is perched on top of the steel frame that supports a basketball hoop. Heavy drips fall steadily from the cuff of his sleeve to the backboard and then slide off to join the shallow lake that has formed in the courtyard three metres below. The basketball net hangs forlorn, half torn from its ring and flapping miserably in the wind. Whoever is behind the camera informs us that it is now 15. 46. The downpour has lasted the best part of an hour. The camera pans to show a second man, another Pacific Islander, who enters the courtyard from a doorway to the left, dressed in blue shorts and a white T-shirt. He walks {{around the perimeter of the}} courtyard towards the basketball ring and stops next to a small, raised garden bed constructed from concrete blocks. The blocks have been painted a lurid green and the garden bed itself contains a conifer which has been inexpertly draped with a long strand of silver Christmas tinsel. The two men converse, gesticulating but inaudible. After a couple of minutes the conversation ends and the man in the white T-shirt retreats inside, stepping gingerly around puddles. The camera’s attention returns to the man sitting in the rain. The video is on a long zoom and the picture is a bit grainy but it is evident that he is no longer young. His hair shows patches of grey and his features are emphasised by the deep furrows in his face. He is big but not fat. He looks strong. One person who saw him scale the pole just after eight o’clock that morning described it as ‘an athletic feat for such a large man’. The minutes tick by and he continues to sit, continues puffing his cheeks. Once or twice he flicks the rain out of his eyes with a finger. Every now and again there is an exchange with someone who is out of view of the camera. Otherwise the man is still. Later one observer would say that he was ‘not looking at anyone or anything but staring at a place’. He was ‘very focused and concentrated in thought’ as if he was ‘thinking about his whole life’. At 15 : 51 the man clearly motions for a cigarette. A moment later he waves, as if to acknowledge that his friend cannot help, that he understands his request has been overruled by higher powers. Then, inexplicably, the video cuts out. The next piece of footage shows a body lying motionless on the concrete. The body is half hidden by the garden bed that contains the Christmas tree but two bare feet protrude beyond the low green wall. The feet look small, too small for such a big man. It is still raining. VILIAMI TANGINOA died {{three years ago}}, shortly after four o’clock on the afternoon of Friday, December 22, 2000, at the Maribyrnong detention centre. He was 53 years old and he had been living in Australia for 17 years, since arriving from Tonga in April 1983 and overstaying a six-month visitor’s visa. In August 2000, after a tip-off to the immigration department, Victorian police arrested Tanginoa near Swan Hill, where he had been working as a <b>fruit-picker.</b> His son Antonio was also detained. Antonio had followed his father to Australia, stowing away on a Sydney-bound vessel at the age of 15 and then sneaking onto the docks to evade the immigration authorities. Viliami Tanginoa, often called William or Bill, had three half-brothers in Sydney, all Australian citizens. He was known to the Tongan Catholic Church in Auburn, in Sydney’s west, where the local priest described him as ‘a good family man’. The general impression of those who knew Tanginoa, both in and out of detention, was of ‘a gentle giant’; taciturn, softly spoken and peaceful. The detention centre’s manager would describe him as ‘polite and courteous, compliant’. Tanginoa would end discussions with his immigration department case officer with a blessing, saying things like ‘God bless you’ to the woman who was organising his deportation. Paul Lasalo, liaison officer for the Tongan Catholic Chaplaincy in Australia, says Tanginoa lived for many years in Marrickville where he was employed as a process worker. More recently he had moved to join Antonio in Victoria. According to Lasalo, the two men were arrested shortly after a hospital visit to Antonio’s wife, who had just given birth to the couple’s first child. Antonio’s relationship with an Australian citizen meant that he had a chance of eventually re-entering Australia on a spousal visa, so he agreed to return to Tonga promptly, departing Australia just six weeks after being detained. Viliami Tanginoa was reluctant to join Antonio on a one-way trip to Tonga despite the opportunity of being reunited with his wife and six other children. Rocky, a Fijian also detained at Maribyrnong, said that his friend ‘William’ had been ‘crushed’ by the decision to deport him. He knew that unemployment awaited him in Tonga and he believed that he was in a better position to provide for his family and himself by staying in Australia, albeit as an illegal immigrant. After 17 years the bonds with his homeland had also weakened and he had formed a relationship with an Australian woman, with whom he was living at the time he was picked up. Back in Tonga, four of his seven children hardly knew him; even the eldest son, Viliami jnr, was only eightyears old when his father left. It is not an uncommon story in Tonga. The total number of Tongans living outside their homeland mostly in Australia, New Zealand and the US is roughly equal to the 100, 000 who remain in the country. Remittances from Tongans living abroad make up the country’s single biggest source of income. Last year remittances were equivalent to 50 per cent of the country’s GDP and worth more than five times the income from exports and tourism combined. Like many Pacific Island nations, Tonga has limited natural resources and is experiencing population pressures; every year about 2000 young people leave school to look for work but only about a quarter of them find jobs. On reaching the age of 16, every Tongan male is theoretically entitled to an allotment of up to 3. 4 hectares of land for growing food. However, Tonga’s Minister for Lands recently told Pacific Magazine that he has ‘no more land to give’. The magazine Matangi Tonga reports there are now more than 10, 000 landless citizens in the country. All this helps to explain why Tongans are among the nationalities most likely to overstay their visas on a visit to Australia and why Viliami Tanginoa was reluctant to return to the land of his birth. After being taken to the Maribyrnong detention centre, Tanginoa sought the help of Lasalo, who co-ordinates the work of the Australia Pacific Amnesty Council on behalf of the Tongan Catholic Chaplaincy. The council mediates between the immigration department and Pacific Islanders who have been detained as illegal immigrants. Lasalo can often negotiate for detainees to be released on a bond so that they can finalise their affairs in Australia before departure. In most cases he says, the department demands a definite departure date, evidence of a one-way ticket home and a ‘reasonable’ bond of between $ 1000 and $ 1500. Lasalo was shocked when the bond suggested for Tanginoa was $ 8000, an amount that was well beyond reach, even with the help of friends and relatives. He believes that if a reasonable bond had been set, then Tanginoa would have accepted the conditions and departed of his own accord. Evidence given to the Migration Review Tribunal presents a slightly different story; it says that the department set a compliance bond of $ 2000 with seven conditions attached, but that the deal was never finalised because the department ‘was not satisfied that the funds were available or could be accessed for the purpose’. Regardless of the exact amount involved, the department clearly saw Tanginoa as a flight risk. In the 17 years that he had lived in Australia he had come to official attention only once before, in October 1994, when he lodged an application for refugee status. The application was rejected five months later and he disappeared back into the community. While the department believed that Tanginoa was determined to remain in Australia, it did little to prepare for the potential problems involved in sending him back to Tonga. Even though appeals to the Migration Review Tribunal and the Federal Court had failed, Tanginoa still seemed unable or unwilling to accept that his days in Australia were numbered. According to his immigration department case officer, when confronted with the reality Tanginoa ‘would just tend to go quiet’ or would talk about being transferred to Villawood in Sydney, or about other options that had already been ruled out. Three days before his scheduled departure, Tanginoa refused to sign a document acknowledging the travel arrangements that had been made on his behalf. He told other detainees that he ‘was not going to sign any deportation paper’ and one detainee noted that his sleep patterns had changed and that he was staying up late. Yet there was no follow-up, no consultation about Tanginoa’s case between the department and Australasian Correctional Management, the private company which ran the Maribyrnong detention centre and which had the responsibility for transporting Tanginoa to the airport and putting him on a flight back to Tonga. On the morning that he was due to depart Australia, Tanginoa woke his Fijian roommate Rocky (the man wearing the white T-shirt in the video) at 7 am and asked him to join him in prayer. He declined to accompany Rocky to breakfast, saying he was not hungry. At about 7. 30 am the detention centre property officer Cyn Jones says he told Tanginoa to pack his things and prepare to leave for the airport. Some minutes later he repeated the request but, he says, Tanginoa ‘just wandered off’. Jones said a ‘funny feeling’ came over him that Tanginoa ‘wasn’t really interested’ in leaving. A few moments later he saw Tanginoa scale the basketball stanchion. Rocky recalls a rather different scene. He says four officers were circling his friend in an effort to apprehend him, but that Tanginoa ‘managed to wrestle his way through the back door of the pool room, and pounce onto the pole and slither up to the top’. Either way, it was a particularly inconvenient time for such a protest action. On the morning in question, ACM was hosting a visit from Philip Flood, former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who was conducting an inquiry into immigration detention procedures at the request of the then immigration minister, Philip Ruddock. At one point, Flood walked through the courtyard and passed by Tanginoa sitting on the pole. Flood was accompanied by senior immigration department officials who must have been alerted to the protest, yet it appears that departmental managers did not take an active interest in events at the detention centre or closely monitor the situation after Flood had left. If they had, perhaps they might have urged ACM to activate Operation Clam, a protocol between ACM and the Victorian police to engage professional negotiators ‘in a hostage or similar situation’. Shortly before noon, after his VIP guest had departed, ACM detention centre manager Tony Tipper turned his attention to the situation in the courtyard. By this stage the scheduled flight to Tonga was long gone and there was no chance of Tanginoa being deported until after Christmas. A parade of ACM staff and immigration department officials had trooped out to the basketball stanchion to point this out to Tanginoa, confident that it would convince him to end his protest. The centre manager endorsed the approach and made his own attempt to talk the big Tongan down: ‘Bill, come on down. Let’s go and have a cup of tea. You’ve achieved what you wanted to do. Let’s get back to normal operations. ’ When this approach failed, Tipper ordered that all other detainees be excluded from the courtyard. Up to this point, they too had been speaking with their colleague, occasionally throwing him up cigarettes or food. At about 1. 30 pm Tipper directed staff to place some mattresses around the base of the basketball pole, especially to cover the heavy bench seats. Half an hour later, staff approached again and this time Tanginoa became agitated. The video shows him standing up, balancing himself against the backboard with one hand, and waving at staff to move away with the other. The entire structure wobbles visibly under his weight. When the ACM officers retreat, he sits down again. A few minutes later the centre’s operations manager, David Randich, approaches once more. Tipper says he had instructed Randich to bring out a ladder, although no ladder is visible in the video. This time Tanginoa’s reaction is even more dramatic: he points at his own head, then stands again, waving Randich away and pointing at the ground. He is threatening to jump. This may not have been the first time that day that Tanginoa threatened self-harm. Fellow detainee Yusuf Omar testified that when he spoke to the Tongan at around 10. 30 am, Tanginoa had said ‘that he wanted to make a sacrifice for all refugees as Jesus had sacrificed for all men’. Omar thought he was joking. In the early afternoon, however, ACM officers were left in no doubt that Tanginoa was serious. Centre officer Alan Bessina recalled that Tanginoa shouted, ‘Fuck off or I’ll jump. ’ By this time, at the very latest, ACM should have reconsidered its approach to the situation. ACM managers investigating the death retrospectively described the tactics used on the day as a ‘wait and see’ approach and ‘passive negotiation’. After viewing the evidence as an expert witness, psychiatrist Paul Mullen said that ‘common sense’ would indicate that Tanginoa was ‘in a state of considerable distress and emotional turmoil’ whatever his outward signs. ‘And it would seem that clambering up the pole and putting himself on the basketball hoop at the very least put him in immediate risk of harm. ’ Mullen’s overall assessment of ACM’s approach was nothing short of damning. Referring to the video, he said: ‘There are brief moments when something is done. There are enormous lengths of time when nothing, effectively, is being done. If you’re asking me whether the approaches to him showed any evidence of an informed, structured approach or really thinking through what they were doing, I find it difficult to discern it. I think there was a culture which borders on contempt for this man and I thinkthat that was what we saw. ’ THE coronial inquest into Viliami Tanginoa’s death opened on January 20, 2003, a day when Melbourne was sweltering in 37 -degree heat and blanketed by a grey-brown haze and the smell of burning forest. More than two years had passed since Tanginoa’s fall and many of the detainees who had witnessed the event had long been removed from Australia; in fact, a community lawyer reported after visiting Maribyrnong that four key witnesses had been removed or transferred interstate before police had begun taking formal statements. Detective senior constable Paul Allen told the inquest that the five-week delay in taking formal statements was caused by ‘the logistics of obtaining enough members to take statements and organising and pre-booking interpreters to have them all available at one time’. It also took two weeks for police to secure videotapes of the incident from ACM staff. The police officer expressed little concern at this, saying the tapes had been ‘sealed in a clear vinyl bag and locked in a safe’; with hindsight, he admitted, it might have been a better idea to secure the tapes when he visited the detention centre on the day of Tanginoa’s fall. The first order of business at the inquest was an application by Brimbank Community Legal Centre to be represented. Brimbank argued that it brought particular expertise in relation to deaths in custody and that its participation in the inquest would be in the public interest. Coroner Phillip Byrne gave short shrift to the application, expressing concern that the hearing should not ‘become a forum for a ‘free-ranging’ debate on the question of the detention of unlawful non-citizens or the broad issue of privately operated detention centres’. He expressed confidence in the capacity of the counsel assisting the coroner to bring all relevant issues to his attention. Without the legal centre, the bar table was dominated by three separate legal teams representing ACM, the immigration department and an individual departmental officer. One wry observer in the gallery estimated the collective cost at $ 15, 000 per day. Proceedings over the next four days were largely a tussle between the teams from immigration and ACM, as each endeavoured to ensure that responsibility for the death was seen to reside solely with the other. This unseemly contest between the government and its private-sector enforcer may have offered some grim satisfaction to critics of Australia’s immigration detention system but it was doing little to shed light on the circumstances of Tanginoa’s fatal fall. Immediately after the death, media reports had quoted detainee witnesses who accused detention centre guards of taunting Tanginoa while he sat on the pole. In unsworn statements collected by visitors to the detention centre in January 2001, Tanginoa’s friend Rocky accuses ACM staff of ‘shooting the ball into the basketball post where Tanginoa was sitting’. At least three other detainees made the same accusation in unsworn statements and the accusation was included in the brief of evidence presented to the court. The inquest heard no other testimony to support the allegation but at one point the video shows operations manager Randich walking through the frame bouncing a basketball. Quizzed about his behaviour, Randich told the inquest: ‘I was trying to show him that I wasn’t there to antagonise him. I was there just purely to observe, and I wouldn’t interfere with him. ’ The explanation failed to impress the coroner, who said Randich’s actions were ‘at best unhelpful and amateurish’ and epitomised ‘the ineptitude of the approach adopted by ACM’ towards Tanginoa’s protest. Detainees accused another officer, Helen Floros, of taunting Tanginoa when he asked for a cigarette by promising to give him her whole packet if he came down. The detainees claimed that he became angry when she laughed and joked that he was making her stand out in the rain. The incident is captured on video but it is impossible to decipher the words that pass between them. In her witness statement Floros said she had ‘pleaded’ with Tanginoa to come down and told him that it ‘hurt’ her to see him up the pole. She also said she was not concerned for Tanginoa’s safety because she thought he was being ‘a stubborn old man’. The coroner accepted that the cigarette incident was not a taunt but ‘a genuine offer to endeavour to persuade Mr Tanginoa down’. However well intentioned the actions of Floros, they reinforced the coroner’s overall impression of ineptitude. As German detainee Jorg Diebel put it, detention centre staff did not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situation and were tending to treat it ‘like children playing a game’. Mitrevski Blagoj, a detainee from Macedonia, says he urged the detention officers to take the event seriously because ‘if he jump from the post, he will hurt himself very badly or maybe even kill himself’. He says the officers dismissed his concerns, telling him that Tanginoa would come down when he became hungry and thirsty. After the first four days of the inquest it seemed unlikely that the concerns of Tanginoa’s fellow detainees would receive much attention, despite the efforts of counsel assisting the coroner. However when the inquest reconvened later in the year, proceedings took on a different hue. At this point I must declare my own small intervention. In my efforts to piece together the story of Tanginoa I had asked a friend and colleague, Nic Maclellan, to see if he could track down the Tanginoa family while on a private visit to Tonga. I had assumed that the family had decided, for whatever reason, not to be represented at the inquest but I thought that they might wish nonetheless to be kept abreast of proceedings by someone who was fol...|$|E
