40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to give an insight in how home care <b>givers</b> with {{different}} ethnic background, other than European, experience their work as home care <b>givers.</b> It is a qualitative study based on interviews and observations of four different home care <b>givers.</b> Among the questions studied include; if ethnicity is a resource or not, how does it affect home care <b>givers</b> in doing their work? What importance does it have on the organisation as a home care entrepreneur? Has the home care entrepreneur a perspective of diversity? The results of the study have been analyzed with the help of symbolic interaction. The results have led us to conclude that the home care <b>givers</b> have a professional identity, which does not include an ethnic identity. Further more results indicate that ethnicity has a limited impact on the home care <b>givers</b> of non European origin that have not experienced discrimination.

5|$|After {{traveling}} through Delphi, the warrior obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus. Eventually, both Circe and the warrior encountered the general, who was {{revealed to be}} the warrior's uncle. The general revealed that he killed the warrior's father because he refused to join the general. Circe was then revealed to be the general's lover who had only aided the warrior so he would reach the general, who planned to offer the warrior a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests. The warrior refused, and Circe offered him with a choice; to serve the general and his men would be spared from Circe's wrath, or to kill the general and his men shall die. The <b>Giver,</b> who followed the two, reminded the warrior {{that if he were}} to kill the general, {{who was a member of}} his family, the oath he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his men would perish and the oath he made to protect his men would be broken. The warrior declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. He tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated. Because the warrior killed his own uncle, the oath he made to his father was broken. The <b>Giver</b> revealed himself to be Orkos, the oath keeper of the Furies and the warrior was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.|$|E

Participants completed a 55 -statement Q sort about 1) perceptions of nonprofit organizations, 2) various fundraising methods, and 3) types of organizations donors prefer funding. The researcher then entered the data into the PQMethod software and determined three factors of donors: Skeptical <b>Givers,</b> Generous <b>Givers,</b> and Untapped <b>Givers.</b> The Skeptical <b>Givers</b> {{did not trust}} nonprofit organizations and only donated a limited portion of their money to charities. Skeptical <b>Givers</b> also felt {{it was more important}} for them to save their money and support their family than it was for them to donate money to people in need. The Generous <b>Givers</b> held church as one of their top priorities. They were also taught that it was their social responsibility to help those in need. Therefore, the Generous <b>Givers</b> donated their time and over 11 percent of their annual income to nonprofit organizations. The Untapped <b>Givers</b> were business-minded individuals who were also committed to their communities and nonprofit organizations. They trusted nonprofits and considered helping the less fortunate to be a high priority. Although the Untapped <b>Givers</b> gave money to nonprofit organizations, they preferred to donate their time through volunteering and serving on boards of directors. The Untapped <b>Givers</b> were committed to giving financially to charities; however, they only gave a limited portion of their savings to charities. These three factors illustrated that nonprofit development officers should recognize that different strategies might be employed to entice separate segments of donors to give money.

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} essay is to study the public support <b>givers</b> view of the concept {{innovation}} and to study how the public support <b>givers</b> discuss and act around the division of public support to entrepreneurs innovations. The purpose is further to describe if the division of public support favour or not favour environmental innovations and to examine if the public support <b>givers</b> consider the industry for environmental innovations is profitable for the society’s economy. We have done several case studies where we have interviewed eight public support. Support <b>givers</b> in this essay are defined as public authorities and other organisations on local, national and/or international level that gives public support to innovations. The public support <b>givers</b> that take part of the essay is VINNOVA, ALMI Stockholm, Innovationsbron, Energimyndigheten, SU Holding AB, KTH Holding, Västra Götalandsregionen and MISTRA. Our theoretical starting point is Silverman and Baums theory ”Picking Winners or Building Them”. They discuss if external support <b>givers</b> act like scouts, who are experts on finding winning companies, or if the external support <b>givers</b> act like coaches and have a more advisory roll and help the companies to become winners. Our conclusions are that an innovation is an idea that is possible to comers and that it also has taken the step towards commercial. When {{you look at the}} support <b>givers</b> support processes they take in consideration different characteristics that the entrepreneur should possess, like the team behind the innovation and the innovation itself, when they decide who to give support to. At the same time they help entrepreneurs with guidance and coaching. Therefore they act both as scouts and coaches. The majority of the support <b>givers</b> don’t focus on a specific industry. Three support <b>givers</b> focus though more or less on environmental innovations. Public support is very important for the Swedish industry. It is important for the possibility for innovations to succeed since other external support <b>givers</b> like venture capitalists and banks don’t give support in the early innovation face. An important factor with public support <b>givers</b> is that they don’t focus on getting refund on invested capital. They public support <b>givers</b> want their actions to favour the society. Finally our essay shows that the public support <b>givers</b> neither favour nor not favour environmental innovations. They consider environmental innovations to be an industry that is profitable from an economic point of view but it should not be the only industry Sweden ought to invest in...|$|R

Her worship is also prescribed for those who wish to defeat their foes. Dhumavati's worship is considered ideal for unpaired members of society, such as bachelors, widows, and world renouncers as well as Tantrikas. In her Varanasi temple, however, she transcends her inauspiciousness and acquires the status of a local protective deity. There, even married couples worship her. Although she has very few dedicated temples, her worship by Tantric ritual continues in private in secluded places like cremation grounds and forests.|$|E

Dhumavati's worship is prescribed to ward off all the negativity that she stands for and to transcend the smoke screen to acquire true knowledge.

5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the <b>giver</b> {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the <b>giver</b> himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} of interpersonal gift giving have uncovered feelings of anx-iety among gift <b>givers.</b> The anxious moments that <b>givers</b> often experience stand {{in stark contrast}} to the festive atmospheres and joyous celebrations that surround many gift occasions. Why is gift-giving such a torturous endeavor for so many people? What conditions coincide with the anxious moments that <b>givers</b> often experience? What factors drive this anxiety? These questions are explored in this article, which develops a model based on a self-presentational theory and two sets of qualitative data.

Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family. The warrior swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The <b>Giver,</b> who guided him and followed him throughout his journey. Soon after, the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village. The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command. One soldier told the warrior that swords alone could not defeat the general. The warrior and his men traveled to the land of Aeaea and recruited the witch Circe, who seemingly also sought revenge against the general. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested that they see the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses.

In Rise of the Warrior, it is shown that he was a native of Kirra whose father was killed by a general. Before dying, the warrior swore to his father that he would bring no harm to his family. The warrior then gathered soldiers of the village and sought after the general, also recruiting the witch Circe. Finding the general, he discovered that the general was actually his uncle and Circe's lover. After negotiations, the warrior tricked his uncle into drinking poisonous Cerberus blood, killing his uncle. Circe was aghast and fled. Because he killed his uncle, it broke his oath to his father. The <b>Giver</b> appeared, revealing himself to be Orkos, and imprisoned the warrior in the Prison of the Damned. In Ascension during Kratos' pursuit of Megaera, Kratos encountered the warrior, who was rejoiced to see an opportunity for freedom from his prison. Before being attacked by an arm of the Hecatonchires, the warrior vanished in a beam of light upon praying to the gods. This transported him to the Rotunda of Olympus. There, he started his trials for redemption to become a champion of the gods and was given a choice to either swear an allegiance to Ares, Hades, Poseidon, or Zeus.
