5|$|The first Academy plans {{outlined}} a £24 million grant for rebuilding Aveland and refurbishing Lafford. Despite {{a delay in}} 2008, the scheme was revived the following year: the three remaining schools would merge and up to £40 million of funds were being considered {{to pay for the}} redevelopment of each site. The chairman of the governors, Graham Arnold, pledged to raise £2 million towards the scheme. A feasibility report indicated that Aveland was not sustainable due to falling enrolment and would have to close; instead the remaining two sites would be redeveloped with £20 million of Government funding. The scheme was approved and, on 4 January 2010, St George's combined with Coteland's and Aveland to become St George's Academy. As planned, September 2012 saw the Billingborough site close and the remaining pupils transfer to the other sites. The oldest part of the Sleaford site was demolished and main building and sixth form centre constructed in its place, while new science and IT buildings were added and a new <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> rolled out; the original post-war buildings at the Ruskington site were pulled down and a new school built.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{reforms to}} the NHS have {{included}} {{changes to the}} GP contract. General practitioners are now not required to work unsociable hours, and get paid to some extent according to their performance, e.g. numbers of patients treated, what treatments were administered, {{and the health of}} their catchment area, through the Quality and Outcomes Framework. The <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> used for assessing their income based on these criteria is called QMAS. The amount that a GP can expect to earn does vary according to the location of their work and the health needs of the population that they serve. Within a couple of years of the new contract being introduced it became apparent that there were a few examples where the arrangements were out step with what had been expected. A full-time self-employed GP, such as a GMS or PMS practice partner, might currently expect to earn a profit share of around £95,900 before tax while a GP employed by a CCG could expect to earn a salary in the range of £54,863 to £82,789. This can equate to an hourly rate of around £40 an hour for a GP partner.|$|E
30|$|The five reasons {{included}} in the ‘IT in use’ category are equally important for routine and nonroutine processes. The reason that required data is scattered over multiple sources {{is very important for}} routine and nonroutine processes. The same holds for the reason that relevant <b>IT</b> <b>systems</b> have unnecessarily complex user interfaces. This finding is in line with knowledge on technology acceptance, because user interfaces impact the perceived ease of use, which in turn influences the process participants’ behavioral intention to use <b>IT</b> <b>systems</b> and the actual use (Davis 1986). The reason that relevant <b>IT</b> <b>systems</b> do not provide the required functionality is extremely important for routine and nonroutine processes. In our opinion, this is plausible as insufficient functionality of <b>IT</b> <b>systems</b> is a key reason for shadow IT and workarounds (Alter 2014; Buchwald et al. 2015). The reasons that process participants {{do not have access to}} relevant <b>IT</b> <b>systems</b> or data as well as that the process requires many and/or non-integrated <b>IT</b> <b>systems</b> to be used are very important for routine or nonroutine processes. In our opinion, this last finding is surprising as task-technology fit theory suggests that task characteristics and IT capabilities must be aligned to enable high performance (Goodhue and Thompson 1995). As routine processes strive for pace and precision, one might have expected a higher importance of non-integrated <b>IT</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

25|$|Data {{access to}} the station is {{provided}} by access via NASA's TDRS-4, 5, and 6 satellites, the DOD DSCS-3 satellite, and the commercial Iridium satellite constellation. For the 2007–2008 season, the TDRS relay (named South Pole TDRSS Relay or SPTR) was upgraded to support a data return rate of 50 Mbit/s, which comprises over 90% of the data return capability. The TDRS-1 satellite formerly provided services to the station, but it failed in October 2009 and was subsequently decommissioned. Marisat and LES9 were also formerly used. In July 2016, the GOES-3 satellite was decommissioned due to it {{nearing the end of}} its supply of propellant and was replaced by the use of the DSCS-3 satellite, a military communications satellite. DSCS-3 can provide a 30 MB/s data rate compared to GOES-3's 1.5 MB/s. DSCS-3 and TDRS-4, 5, and 6 are used together to provide the main communications capability for the station. These satellites provide the data uplink for the station's scientific data as well as provide broadband internet and telecommunications access. Only during the main satellite events is the station's telephone system able to dial out. The commercial Iridium satellite is used when the TDRS and DSCS satellites are all out of range to give the station limited communications capability during those times. During those times, telephone calls may only be made on several Iridium satellite telephone sets owned by the station. The station's <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> also has a limited data uplink over the Iridium network, which allows emails less than 100KB to be sent and received at all times and small critical data files to be transmitted. This uplink works by bonding the data stream over 12 voice channels.|$|E

New competitors like the Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company created increased competition for McKinsey by marketing specific branded products, {{such as the}} Growth-Share Matrix, and by selling their industry expertise. In 1971, McKinsey created the Commission on Firm Aims and Goals, which found that McKinsey had become too focused on geographic expansion and lacked adequate industry knowledge. The commission advised that McKinsey slow its growth and develop industry specialties. In 1976, Ron Daniel was elected managing director, serving until 1988. Daniel and Fred Gluck helped shift the firm away from its generalist approach by developing 15 specialized working groups within McKinsey called Centers of Competence and by developing practice areas called Strategy, Operations and Organization. Daniel also began McKinsey's knowledge management efforts in 1987. This {{led to the creation}} of an <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> that tracked McKinsey engagements, a process to centralize knowledge from each practice area and a resource directory of internal experts."
