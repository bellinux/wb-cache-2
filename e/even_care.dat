5|$|Dowding saw 12 Group as the {{protector}} of the Midlands and a reserve for 11 Group. Mallory and Bader wanted to ignore both the defence of the Midlands and keeping a reserve in order to commit 12 Group to battle. In essence, they proposed the opposite of Dowding and resolved to commit the reserves before the front-line units. While this method might have spared 11 Group, it had its problems. Although Mallory and Bader wanted to stop the enemy before it hit RAF airfields, {{the amount of time}} it took to position large formations for interception meant that the Big Wing often failed to achieve this. Instead, they engaged the enemy as he withdrew. Prompted by a supporting comment from Leigh-Mallory, to the effect that it did not matter when an interception was made, as long as it accounted for a large number of enemy aircraft, Bader announced that he would rather destroy 50 German bombers after hitting their targets than 10 before. The argument was strong; crippling losses would act as a deterrent, so that damage sustained on an occasion when the Germans did get through would have to be offset against later occasions when they did not <b>even</b> <b>care</b> to try.|$|E

500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd <b>even</b> <b>care</b> to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E

500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't <b>even</b> <b>care</b> what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Artest and Yao later {{exchanged}} extensive phone calls.

2500|$|The {{elements}} of the ceremony have changed little over the Mafia's history. These elements {{have been the subject}} of much curiosity and speculation. [...] Sociologist Diego Gambetta points out that the Mafia, being a secretive criminal organization, cannot risk having its recruits sign application forms and written contracts which might be seized by the police. [...] Thus they rely on the old-fashioned ritual ceremony. [...] The {{elements of}} the ceremony are made deliberately specific, bizarre, and painful so that the event is both memorable and unambiguous, and the ceremony is witnessed by a number of senior mafiosi. The participants may not <b>even</b> <b>care</b> about what the symbols mean, and they may indeed have no intrinsic meaning. [...] The real point of the ritual is to leave no doubt about the mafioso's new status so that it cannot be denied or revoked on a whim.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, a faux hair metal band, Limozeen, was {{introduced}} as {{a parody of}} 1980s hair metal bands like Skid Row, White Lion and Poison; with songs including [...] "Because, It's Midnite" [...] and [...] "Nite Mamas". On March 17, 2008, [...] "Limozeen" [...] (actually the Atlanta indie band Y-O-U along with Matt Chapman on vocals) performed a live show in Atlanta, Georgia, and again on November 8, 2008, opening for indie pop band Of Montreal. A college rock band called Sloshy(with the logo stylized in lower case and rotated 180 degrees, with the [...] "o" [...] being a different color, as [...] "ʎɥsoןs") {{was introduced}} in 2007. Sloshy features songs in the musical vein of Pavement such as [...] "We Don't Really <b>Even</b> <b>Care</b> About You" [...] and [...] "The B-est of B-Sides". Other fictitious artists include Scandinavian death metal parody Taranchula, rapper Peacey P, with a singing style resembling that of Snoop Dogg, and the self-absorbed R artist Tenerence Love.|$|E
2500|$|GameZone's Louis Bedigian {{scored the}} game 8.4 out of 10, feeling [...] "Dark Cloud 2 {{includes}} many annoyances {{that were not}} present in the first game, such as a longer, cheesier storyline; dorkier characters; and voice-overs that are so traumatizing you'll think you were watching an episode of Blue's Clues." [...] He concluded that [...] "For all its annoyances, Dark Cloud 2 is still a really, really good game. [...] I love the battles, I love the Georama system, and I love being able to build my own weapons. But I am also very disappointed in the direction that was taken with the story. Most PlayStation 2 owners are adults [...] The gameplay is so challenging that it's unlikely that a six-year-old will <b>even</b> <b>care</b> about it. But the childish voices are so annoying that this game will almost certainly turn off {{a large number of}} hardcore gamers who would have otherwise loved it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{had told}} Billboard {{that he had}} been {{lobbying}} for the Miracles since his own induction, [...] "making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it." [...] Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, [...] "I don't really <b>even</b> <b>care</b> about that. I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. We were one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy." [...] Claudette Robinson stated, [...] "When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? I was surprised by that. I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's {{a lot of people that}} were really pulling for us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that." [...] However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.|$|E
