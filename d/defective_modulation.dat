40|$|Calmodulin (CaM) {{association}} with the cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR 2) regulates excitation–contraction coupling. Defective CaM–RyR 2 interaction is associated with heart failure. A novel CaM mutation (CaMF 90 L) was recently identified in a family with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) and early onset sudden cardiac death. We report the first biochemical characterization of CaMF 90 L. F 90 L confers a deleterious effect on protein stability. Ca 2 +-binding studies reveal reduced Ca 2 +-binding affinity {{and a loss of}} co-operativity. Moreover, CaMF 90 L displays reduced RyR 2 interaction and <b>defective</b> <b>modulation</b> of [3 H]ryanodine binding. Hence, dysregulation of RyR 2 -mediated Ca 2 + release via aberrant CaMF 90 L–RyR 2 interaction is a potential mechanism that underlies familial IVF...|$|E
40|$|Limbic {{encephalitis}} (LE) is an autoimmune-mediated {{disorder that}} affects {{structures of the}} limbic system, in particular the amygdala. The amygdala constitutes a brain area substantial for processing of emotional, especially fear-related signals. The amygdala is also involved in neuroendocrine and autonomic functions, including skin conductance responses (SCRs) to emotionally arousing stimuli. This study investigates behavioral and autonomic responses to discrete emotion-evoking and neutral film clips in a patient suffering from LE associated with contactin-associated protein- 2 (CASPR 2) -antibodies as compared to a healthy control group. Results show a lack of SCRs in the patient while watching the film clips, with significant differences compared to healthy controls {{in the case of}} fear-inducing videos. There was no comparable impairment in behavioral data (emotion report, valence and arousal ratings). The results point to a <b>defective</b> <b>modulation</b> of sympathetic responses during emotional stimulation in patients with LE, probably due to impaired functioning of the amygdala...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to immunologic derangement, hematological abnormalities {{have been reported}} in the majority of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In this study 15 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) were evaluated for the in vitro growth of hemopoietic progenitor cells. In all patients a significant reduction of growth (mean +/- SEM) of colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, macrophage, (megakaryocyte) (CFU-GEM) (1. 2 +/- 0. 3), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) (17 +/- 10), CFU-megakaryocyte (CFU-Mk) (1. 7 +/- 0. 6), and CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) (35 +/- 10) was observed in comparison with normal controls. Depletion of T cells from the bone marrow before culture led to a significant increase in colony growth, which indicated an imbalance of the normally modulating T cell subsets. This increase was reversed by readdition of autologous T cells causing a decrease in colony growth to a degree, dependent on the T 4 to T 8 ratio. A decreased number of hemopoietic progenitor cells and/or a <b>defective</b> <b>modulation</b> of progenitor cell growth, normally carried out by T lymphocyte subsets, might be the cause of the hematological abnormalities in AIDS patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective Pain {{medicine}} still lacks mechanism-specific biomarkers {{to guide}} diagnosis and treatment, and <b>defective</b> top-down <b>modulation</b> {{is an important}} factor in the pathophysiology of chronic pain conditions. Using modern analytical tools and advanced multivariate statistical analysis, the aim of this study was to revisit two classical potential biomarkers of pro- and anti-nociception in humans (substance P and beta-endorphin), focusing particularly on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Design Cross-sectional, comparative, observational study. Subjects Patients with chronic, post-traumatic and/or post-surgical, neuropathic pain refractory to conventional treatment (N[*]=[*] 15) and healthy controls (N[*]=[*] 19) were included. Methods Samples were taken from CSF and blood, and levels of substance P and beta-endorphin were investigated using a Luminex technology kit. Results We found low levels of beta-endorphin in the CSF of neuropathic pain patients (66 [*]±[*] 11 [*]pcg/mL) compared with healthy controls (115 [*]±[*] 14 [*]pcg/mL) (P[*]=[*] 0. 017). Substance P levels in the CSF did not differ (20 [*]±[*] 2 [*]pcg/mL, 26 [*]±[*] 2, P[*]=[*] 0. 08). However, our multivariate data analysis showed that belonging to the patient group was associated with low levels of both substances in the CSF. A higher correlation between the levels of beta-endorphin and substance P in CSF was found in healthy controls than in patients (rs[*]=[*] 0. 725, P[*]<[*] 0. 001 vs rs[*]=[*] 0. 574, P[*]=[*] 0. 032). Conclusions Patients with chronic neuropathic pain due to trauma or surgery had low levels of beta-endorphin in the CSF. We speculate that this could indicate a <b>defective</b> top-down <b>modulation</b> of pain in chronic neuropathic pain. Our results also illustrate the importance of taking a system-wide, multivariate approach when searching for biomarkers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIRSp 53 (also {{known as}} BAIAP 2) is a {{multi-domain}} scaffolding and adaptor protein {{that has been}} implicated in the regulation of membrane and actin dynamics at subcellular structures, including filopodia and lamellipodia. Accumulating evidence indicates that IRSp 53 is an abundant component of the postsynaptic density at excitatory synapses and an important regulator of actin-rich dendritic spines. In addition, IRSp 53 has been implicated in diverse psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Mice lacking IRSp 53 display enhanced NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor function accompanied by social and cognitive deficits, which are reversed by pharmacological suppression of NMDA receptor function. These results suggest the hypothesis that <b>defective</b> actin/membrane <b>modulation</b> in IRSp 53 -deficient dendritic spines may lead to social and cognitive deficits through NMDA receptor dysfunction.

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD), a progressive condition that is untreatable {{in up to}} 90 % of patients, is {{a leading cause of}} blindness in the elderly worldwide. The two forms of AMD, wet and dry, are classified based on {{the presence or absence of}} blood vessels that have disruptively invaded the retina, respectively. A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying wet AMD has led to several robust FDA-approved therapies. In contrast, there are no approved treatments for dry AMD. In this review, we provide insight into the critical effector pathways mediating each form of the disease. A recurring theme that spans most aspects of AMD pathogenesis is <b>defective</b> immune <b>modulation</b> in the classically immune-privileged ocular haven. Interestingly, the latest advances in AMD research also highlight common molecular disease pathways with other neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, the therapeutic potential of intervening at known mechanistic steps of AMD pathogenesis is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} the hematopoietic failure in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) -infected patients are still unknown. Several findings indicate that the in vitro proliferative potential of precursor cells from AIDS patients is reduced. The changes seen in bone marrow (BM) morphology and the defective BM functions associated with cytopenias have both been proposed as potential explanations. In patients treated with {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) an immune reconstitution associated with increased whole blood cell counts has been described. We have investigated the effects of HAART on the number of colony-forming cells (CFCs) and long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs), using long-term BM cell cultures (LTBMC) in a group of subjects with HIV- 1 infection enrolled in an open study to evaluate the mechanisms of immune reconstitution during HAART. In each patient, the increase in colony growth was homogeneous, regardless of the type of hematopoietic progenitor cells assayed; in four subjects an increase in the most primitive progenitor cells (LTC-ICs) was observed. These findings were associated with the in vivo data showing increased numbers of BM mononuclear cells (BMMCs) after HAART and with a rise in peripheral CD 4 (+) T cell counts and decreased levels of plasma HIV- 1 RNA. A decreased number of hematopoietic progenitor cells and/or a <b>defective</b> <b>modulation</b> of progenitor cell growth might be the cause of the hematological abnormalities in AIDS patients. Controlling HIV- 1 replication by HAART could determine a restoration of stem cell activity, probably because of the suppression of factors that inhibit normal hematopoiesis...|$|E
40|$|Pre-messenger RNA {{splicing}} {{is carried}} out by a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome. Despite the striking evolutionary conservation of the spliceosomal components and their functions, controversy persists about {{the relative importance of}} splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—particularly given the paucity of intron-containing genes in yeast. Here we show that splicing of one pre-messenger RNA, SUS 1, a component of the histone H 2 B ubiquitin protease machinery, is essential for establishing the proper modification state of chromatin. One protein complex that is intimately involved in pre-mRNA splicing, the yeast cap-binding complex, appears to be particularly important, as evidenced by its extensive and unique genetic interactions with enzymes that catalyze histone H 2 B ubiquitination. Microarray studies show that cap binding complex (CBC) deletion has a global effect on gene expression, and for ∼ 20 % of these genes, this effect is suppressed when ubiquitination of histone H 2 B is eliminated. Consistent with this finding of histone H 2 B dependent effects on gene expression, deletion of the yeast cap binding complex leads to overubiquitination of histone H 2 B. A key component of the ubiquitin-protease module of the SAGA complex, Sus 1, is encoded by a gene that contains two introns and is misspliced when the CBC is deleted, leading to destabilization of the ubiquitin protease complex and <b>defective</b> <b>modulation</b> of cellular H 2 B levels. These data demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing plays a critical role in histone H 2 B ubiquitination and that the CBC in particular helps to establish the proper state of chromatin and proper expression of genes that are regulated at the level of histone H 2 B ubiquitination...|$|E
40|$|The Tec {{family member}} Bruton’s {{tyrosine}} kinase (Btk) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that transduces {{signals from the}} pre-B and B cell receptor (BCR). Btk is involved in pre-B cell maturation by regulating IL- 7 responsiveness, cell surface phenotype changes, and the activation of L chain gene rearrangements. In mature B cells, Btk is essential for BCR-mediated proliferation and survival. Upon BCR stimulation, Btk is transphosphorylated at position Y 551, which promotes its catalytic activity and subsequently results in autophosphorylation at position Y 223 in the Src homology 3 domain. To address the significance of Y 223 autophosphorylation and the requirement of enzymatic activity for Btk function in vivo, we generated transgenic mice that express the autophosphorylation site mutant Y 223 F and the kinase-inactive mutant K 430 R, respectively. We found that Y 223 autophos-phorylation was not required for the regulation of IL- 7 responsiveness and cell surface phenotype changes in differentiating pre-B cells, or for peripheral B cell differentiation. However, expression of the Y 223 F-Btk transgene could not fully rescue the reduction of L chain usage in Btk-deficient mice. In contrast, transgenic expression of kinase-inactive K 430 R-Btk completely reconstituted usage in Btk-deficient mice, but the <b>defective</b> <b>modulation</b> of pre-B cell surface markers, peripheral B cell survival, and BCR-mediated NF-B induction were partially corrected. From these findings, we conclude that: 1) autophosphorylation at position Y 223 is not essential for Btk function in vivo, except for regulation of L chain usage, and 2) during B cell development, Btk partially acts as an adapter molecule, independent of its catalytic activity.

40|$|Abstract Background Development {{of the eye}} {{depends partly}} on the periocular mesenchyme derived from the neural crest (NC), but the fate of NC cells in {{mammalian}} eye development and the signals coordinating the formation of ocular structures are poorly understood. Results Here we reveal distinct NC contributions to both anterior and posterior mesenchymal eye structures and show that TGFβ signaling in these cells is crucial for normal eye development. In the anterior eye, TGFβ 2 released from the lens {{is required for the}} expression of transcription factors Pitx 2 and Foxc 1 in the NC-derived cornea and in the chamber-angle structures of the eye that control intraocular pressure. TGFβ enhances Foxc 1 and induces Pitx 2 expression in cell cultures. As in patients carrying mutations in PITX 2 and FOXC 1, TGFβ signal inactivation in NC cells leads to ocular defects characteristic of the human disorder Axenfeld-Rieger's anomaly. In the posterior eye, NC cell-specific inactivation of TGFβ signaling results in a condition reminiscent of the human disorder persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. As a secondary effect, retinal patterning is also disturbed in mutant mice.

40|$|Leprosy is a {{spectral}} {{disease in}} which clinical presentation {{is thought to}} be related to the host immune response. Previous investigations have suggested that selective unresponsiveness to Mycobacterium leprae in patients with lepromatous leprosy is due to the presence of M. leprae-specific T-suppressor cells. However, it has recently been suggested that CD 2 modulation was the mechanism for the observed impaired immune response in lepromatous patients. Therefore, we studied the expression of CD 2 and CD 3 on lymphocytes in lepromatous skin lesions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Using immunohistochemical techniques, we found that virtually all of the CD 3 + cells in leprosy skin lesions expressed CD 2. In addition, indirect immunofluorescence flow cytometry demonstrated that most CD 3 + cells in the peripheral blood possessed the CD 2 marker, suggesting that CD 2 expression of T-lymphocytes is normal. T-cell activation using paired anti-T 11 (2) and anti-T 11 (3) or anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibodies demonstrated similar 3 H-thymidine incorporation and gamma interferon production in the PBMC of lepromatous patients in comparison with the PBMC of their contacts and tuberculoid patients. However, lepromatous PBMC did not proliferate or produce gamma interferon in response to M. leprae. Our data suggest not only that CD 2 expression is normal on T lymphocytes in lepromatous leprosy skin lesions but also that CD 2 expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes is functional in T-cell activation. <b>Defective</b> CD 2 <b>modulation</b> does not appear to be the mechanism for specific unresponsiveness in lepromatous leprosy...|$|R

40|$|The {{basis for}} {{development}} of hepatosplenic disease and attendant morbidity in Schistosoma mansoni-infected individuals is uncertain but may relate to <b>defective</b> <b>modulation</b> of immunopathology. Individuals 14 to 30 years of age from a village in the Nile Delta in Egypt were selected for study: 32 were infected with S. mansoni but lacked hepatosplenomegaly (mean fecal egg excretion +/- standard error of the mean, 1, 142 +/- 79 eggs per g), 9 had S. mansoni infection and hepatosplenomegaly (1, 267 +/- 197 eggs per g), and 12 were uninfected. The ratio of OKT 4 helper/OKT 8 suppressor cells in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was reduced in infected subjects without hepatosplenomegaly to 1. 4 +/- 0. 1 compared with a ratio of 1. 7 +/- 0. 1 (P less than 0. 05) in uninfected subjects. In contrast, this ratio was increased in the group with hepatosplenomegaly to 2. 7 +/- 0. 3 (P less than 0. 01). Schistosome antigen-induced [3 H]thymidine incorporation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was comparable in infected subjects without (5, 837 +/- 1, 009 cpm) and with (3, 329 +/- 738 cpm; P greater than 0. 1) hepatosplenomegaly. Depletion of adherent suppressor cells significantly increased the responses in the group lacking organomegaly (14, 028 +/- 1, 683 cpm; P less than 0. 001) but not in the hepatosplenomegaly group (5, 046 +/- 1, 830 cpm; P greater than 0. 5); this difference in response of nonadherent cells to soluble worm antigenic preparation was statistically significant (P less than 0. 02) and not explained by quantitative shifts in OKT 8 suppressor cells. Thus, in S. mansoni infection, subjects with hepatosplenomegaly are distinctive in their lack of an immunosuppressive balance of T-lymphocyte subpopulations {{and in the absence of}} functional adherent suppressor cells. Defective immunoregulatory mechanisms could be important in the genesis of hepatosplenic disease and its morbid sequelae...|$|E
40|$|The α 2 a/d-adrenoceptor subtype in the rat kidney modulates solute {{excretion}} (osmolar clearance). Since {{the kidney}} {{plays a role}} in chronic regulation of blood pressure, altered renal function may be implicated in the development of hypertension. A second alteration - that of the α 2 a/d-adrenoceptor subtype gene - has also been correlated with hypertension in rats and man. We hypothesized that {{as a consequence of the}} altered α 2 a/d-adrenoceptor subtype gene previously shown in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats, the increase in osmolar clearance following stimulation of the renal α 2 a/d-subtype would be attenuated in SH rats as compared to normotensive Wistar rats. In contrast, based on the theory that such functional unresponsiveness of the α 2 a/d-subtype would be genetically determined, we further hypothesized that in one kidney-one clip (1 K- 1 C) rats, the response to stimulation of the renal α 2 a/d-subtype would be intact as compared to the normotensive Wistar 1 K-sham rats. Male rats were unilaterally nephrectomized under ether anaesthesia. In the 1 K- 1 C rats, a silver clip (diameter 0. 254 [*]mm) was also placed around the left renal artery. On the experimental day, rats were administered pentobarbitone (50. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.). The carotid artery and jugular vein were cannulated for blood pressure monitoring and saline infusion. The ureter was catheterized for urine collection. A 31 gauge needle was advanced into the renal artery for infusion of the α 2 a/d-selective agonist, guanfacine (vehicle, 1. 0, 3. 0 and 10. 0 [*]nmol[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1 in Wistar and SH rats; vehicle and 10. 0 [*]nmol[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1 in Wistar 1 K-sham and 1 K- 1 C rats). In Wistar rats, guanfacine dose-dependently increased urine flow and sodium excretion. An increase in osmolar clearance but not free water clearance was also observed. However, in SH rats guanfacine failed to alter urine flow, sodium excretion, osmolar and free water clearance. In contrast, in both Wistar 1 K-sham and 1 K- 1 C rats, guanfacine increased urine flow rate. Again, this response was due solely to an increase in osmolar clearance. At these doses, guanfacine did not alter blood pressure or creatinine clearance during the experiment. In summary, the ability of the α 2 a/d-adrenoceptor subtype to mediate an increase in osmolar clearance was absent in a genetic model of hypertension, the SH rats. This effect was intact in an acquired model of hypertension (1 K- 1 C rats). This suggested a <b>defective</b> <b>modulation</b> of solute excretion in SH rats which was probably due to alteration of the α 2 a/d-subtype gene and not secondary to the elevated blood pressure. The altered α 2 a/d-subtype gene and function may therefore play a causal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Preeclampsia {{is a major}} {{challenge}} to obstetricians, due to its impact on maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality {{and the lack of}} preventive and treatment strategies. The overall aim of this thesis is to increase the knowledge of the pathogenesis of preeclampsia including the role of inflammation, angiogenesis and coagulation, both locally at the fetomaternal interface and in the maternal circulation. Uncompensated maternal endothelial inflammatory responses to factors from stressed trophoblasts seem to be a major contributor to the syndrome, together with an imbalance in angiogenesis and an activated coagulation system. An increasing amount of data indicates an involvement of the immune system with defect tolerance to the conceptus {{as an integral part of}} the pathogenesis, at least in early-onset preeclampsia (EOP). We showed that a single administration of human preeclampsia serum in pregnant IL- 10 −/− mice induced the full spectrum of preeclampsia-like symptoms including hypoxic injury in uteroplacental tissues and endotheliosis in maternal kidneys. Importantly, preeclampsia serum, as early as 12 to 14 weeks of gestation, disrupted cross talk between trophoblasts and endothelial cells in an in vitro model of endovascular activity (Tube formation test). These results indicate that preeclamptic sera can be used to better understand the pathophysiology and to predict the disorder. Preeclampsia has been associated with increased inflammation, aberrant angiogenesis and activated coagulation, but their correlation and relative contribution are unknown. We found that markers for all these mechanisms were independently associated with preeclampsia. Cytokines, chemokines, and complement factors seem all to be part of a Th 1 -associated inflammatory reaction in preeclampsia, more pronounced in EOP than in late-onset preeclampsia (LOP), in line with a more homogeneous pathogenesis in EOP as based on placental pathology. In women with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), with an anticipated pathologic placentation, only differences in levels for sFlt- 1 and PlGF were found in comparison with mothers without IUGR. Thus, sFlt- 1 and PlGF seem to be indicators of placental pathology, while other biomarkers might also reflect maternal endothelial pathology. Chemokines, in contrast to cytokines, may prove to be useful markers in preeclampsia. A deficiency in regulatory T (Treg) cells causing reduced immune regulatory capacity has been proposed in preeclampsia. Utilizing recent advances in flow cytometry phenotyping, we found no major alterations in circulating Treg numbers in preeclamptic women compared with normal pregnant and non-pregnant women. However, preeclampsia was associated with increased fractions of CTLA- 4 + and CCR 4 + cells within Treg subpopulations, which is in line with a migratory defect of Treg cells, and potentially associated with a reduced number of suppressive Treg cells at the fetomaternal interface. As we found that corticosteroid treatment affected the results, it should be accounted for in studies of EOP. Chemokines are supposed to be part of the immune adaptation in pregnancy. We found a decreased expression of CCL 18   (Th 2 /Tregassociated), in trophoblasts from preeclamptic compared to normal pregnant women, indicating a local regulatory defect in preeclampsia, in line with our finding of a possible migratory defect of circulating Treg cells. Due to increased expression of CCL 20 (Th 17) and CCL 22 (Th 2) in first trimester placenta and increased circulating levels of CXCL 10 (Th 1) and CCL 20 (Th 17) in third trimester preeclamptic women, we suggest that CCL 20 and CCL 22 may be important for implantation and early placentation while in third trimester of a preeclamptic pregnancy CXCL 10 and CCL 20 mainly mirror maternal increased endothelial inflammation and aberrant angiogenesis. In summary, we found that preeclampsia is associated with increased inflammation, aberrant angiogenesis and activated coagulation, caused by placental factors in maternal peripheral circulation, more pronounced in the early-onset form of preeclampsia. It also appears that there is a <b>defective</b> <b>modulation</b> of the immune system in preeclamptic pregnancies. The results provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and have given suggestions to predictive markers for preeclampsia in the future...|$|E
