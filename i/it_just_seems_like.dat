In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't {{sure what to}} think about [...] "The Bishop Revival", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy working for the US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode [...] "surprisingly meh"; while appreciating [...] "all the weird family revelations about the Bishops", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be [...] "too much" [...] because [...] "we didn't need that extra backstory". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining [...] "Plotwise, there wasn't much going on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it." [...] Murray did however praise the killer's methods and [...] "Aryan aloofness" [...] as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "delightfully old-school". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained [...] "stupid revelations"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father [...] "just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's work for the government. Obviously, this info about Peter's grandfather {{was supposed to be}} 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a very artificial, unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} the album on Punknews.org was far more {{critical}} of the album, stating [...] "there is [...] "substance" [...] here—there are guitar solos, tempo changes, gang vocals—but there isn't substance. There's no authenticity; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the songs were built from a collection of [...] "brutal" [...] ideas written on pieces of paper, put together in a hat, and splashed out on the floor." [...] The album received a 1.5 out of 5 rating. A review on AbsolutePunk was also critical of the album, stating that while some songs were [...] "heavy, but catchy" [...] and [...] "sounds like {{it would have a}} room full of people moshing until they drop", at some points it feels like the band is [...] "half-arseing it", going on to say [...] "Sometimes you wish they would throw in some thrash beats, and fast riffing. This can disappoint and I feel like a few solo's wouldn't go amiss." [...] However, the reviewer concludes by saying [...] "All in all, Suicide Season has impressed me. The boys from BMTH have come back and shown they aren't just a generic haircuts band." ...|$|E

5000|$|Martin Ayres, one {{of several}} who wrote their first {{articles}} for Sporting Cyclist {{and went on to}} edit cycling magazines of their own, said that Wadley's discursive, first-person style looked simple but [...] "I tried to copy Jock's style once or twice when I was editor of Cycling, but when I did <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> name-dropping.' ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{collaborating with}} American female rapper Nicki Minaj on the song [...] "I'm Legit" [...] for Minaj's album , Minaj agreed {{to appear on}} Ciara's album in return. Originally, the duo had worked on just one {{collaboration}} for Ciara called [...] "I'm Out". Speaking about Minaj's version on the song, Ciara said [...] "The energy of the record is so dope, and it's really for the ladies, and Nicki she just killed the verse. She literally murdered it, like she got that throw-back, that thing that she does that's so special. She went in." [...] Having enjoyed the process Minaj said [...] "I was supposed to only do one song for her album and I think I'm {{going to end up}} doing two. I just love what she's doing and I'm so proud and I'm really excited for people to hear it." [...] In April, Ciara confirmed that Minaj was finished with a second record for the album; in an interview with MTV News, Ciara said, [...] "She's actually finishing up one now that's really it's a monster too. The moments that we have had so far have just been crazy. It's just been magical, it's been something special and I feel like the fans have always wanted to see she and I rock together." [...] In the end, Minaj also recorded vocals for the aforementioned [...] "Livin' It Up". On June 23, 2013, rapper, Future confirmed that the track, [...] "Where You Go", was originally recorded for his second studio album, Future Hendrix (2013); however, he gave it to Ciara, stating, [...] "She's like, 'I need this song. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> it was just speaking to me. Give it to me, give it to me.' I was like, 'Man cool, you can have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} laughed over it so happily if I had my baby," [...] she sobbed to Marilla. [...] "But when I haven't <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> wanton cruelty--though I know Phil wouldn't hurt me for the world. Oh, Marilla, I don't see how I can EVER be happy again--EVERYTHING will hurt me {{all the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pitchfork was critical, writing, [...] "Beyond the melodies that dont {{stick in}} my head and the beats that dont make me want to dance, the only real problem with Souljacker ... is that <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> an underachievement." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hamlin {{said after}} the race {{that he was doing}} all he [...] "could to pace (Larson). I knew he had a very fast car. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> {{we were able to get}} off the corner pretty good and I just ran kind of a pace there which I felt {{comfortable}} with. And just in case we had a restart, they wanted to burn the tires up." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Cowboys {{is where}} {{everybody}} came into their own, {{along with the}} full-blown Pantera sound", [...] "That was actually the first song we wrote for the record. Basically it was about us coming out of Texas and being out of place. People don't think of Texas as being a hot spot for heavy metal, they think of New York or L.A. or something <b>like</b> that, so <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> an obvious concept for us." [...] Vinnie Paul ...|$|R
5000|$|Norman {{says the}} feeling of being {{different}} goes back as far as she can remember. In a cover story for New York Magazine she said [...] " [...] <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> I was living in the wrong body. I always felt female." [...] For Norman her life at home as well as school was not easy. She had a father who was battling cancer and a family who she was afraid to come out to.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> {{the most}} fun thing in the world. I've never met people who have kids who haven't {{looked me in the}} eye and been like, [...] "It's the {{greatest}} thing that's ever happened." ... I think it's biological. I'm 30. I'm not that young, right? I'm not, like, 24 or 22. I'm no longer in the phase of my life where I talk about everything as in the future. Like, I'm in the future.|$|E
5000|$|On August 15, 2017, Parton {{formally}} {{announced the}} album's upcoming release {{at a press}} conference at her management's Nashville office in front of reporters and their children, saying [...] "I love kids and I am so excited. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the right time release a children's album since I'm getting so old, I'm getting back into my second childhood." [...] She also revealed the album's cover and revealed the track listing, as well as singing three songs from the album and reading a story to the children.|$|E
50|$|Remembering his {{childhood}} Dave said: “It was tougher back then; I’ve {{had a rough}} life. But I can remember everything. From horse and cart days right up until today; jet planes and computers. When I was a boy there weren’t even any fences. No electricity lines or phone lines. No roads, nothing. You could just head out across country and you wouldn’t have to open any gates or anything like that. All just open prairie. The world has changed so quickly in just one lifetime. It’s so short a time. I’ve had a long life but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> yesterday”.|$|E
50|$|Lane {{identifies}} as bisexual. She stated I think the hardest time {{was coming to}} terms with my bisexuality. That was probably the hardest thing. I was brought up that I was going to burn for it. Once I got over that and realized I didn't have to live under my family's thumb any more and that I was an adult and made my own decisions, I sought out the adult industry, being a natural exhibitionist. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the right thing.|$|R
5000|$|I got to {{the point}} where I didn’t really know what else we could do, but I don't think that was as much a factor as I just didn’t feel very {{comfortable}} in it any more. I was 33 at the time, and playing songs that were written 10 years before, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> this wasn't what I wanted to do; I didn't really know what I wanted to do, but I was just becoming more and more aware that I didn't want to do that.|$|R
5000|$|On February 14, 2014 {{the band}} re-released the album with Tory Edwards on violin and mandolin, stating {{that they had}} {{received}} many requests to remix the record. The band had experienced difficulties in obtaining the master tapes of the 1988 album and as such, decided to re-record the album. Of the decision, the band commented that [...] "The aim was not really to change but to enhance it with the opportunity {{with the use of}} new tools. We have the time available as well, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a no-brainer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode {{three and a}} half stars out of five, saying [...] "I was {{wondering}} if there was anything in particular that would cause this episode to be delayed a week after the Sandy Hook tragedy, and perhaps {{it was the fact that}} King Herod’s forces were trying to kill a baby that did it, though little else seemed particularly offensive. However, there were a lot of pauses and general delay tactics that might have served as ways to edit out other potentially-insensitive content. But otherwise, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> it was just pushed back because Fox didn’t want to air something crass right after such a tragedy. Probably a good idea." ...|$|E
5000|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with praise and criticism focused on Franco's methods of presenting Faulkner's complex narrative. Kyle Smith of The New York Post was very harsh, declaring, [...] "Franco dilutes the drama with first-year-film-student gimmicks, like split screens and slow motion, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a dull collection of pointless monologues from actors who can’t even {{be bothered to}} match up their accents." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "But in rushing in where wise men might fear to tread, Mr. Franco has accomplished something serious and worthwhile. His “As I Lay Dying” is certainly ambitious, {{but it is also}} admirably modest. The script, written by Mr. Franco with Matt Rager, tries to pare Faulkner’s multivoiced narrative to a manageable essence." ...|$|E
5000|$|Once the {{qualifying}} session completed, Stewart commented, [...] "I {{was watching}} guys' lap times, {{and looking at}} the sheet to seeing what they practiced, and it wasn't as much an increase as what we've seen. I think, obviously, we've had a lot of cloud cover today and cool temperatures here the last couple of days, so I don't think the track changed as much and got as hot during the day as what we typically see here. I think that's the reason that we didn't have the big pick-ups. But you still anticipate that, at night, the guys are going to pick up speed. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the air's a little muggier right now. I don't know whether that hurt horsepower or even created more drag and kind of evened everything out." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dave Williams {{explained}} how album {{got its name}} in MTV interview: [...] "I got that tattoo tattooed before we named the record. We {{were working on the}} song [...] "Sinner," [...] and our A&R guy said, [...] "That would be a good name for the record." [...] We all just {{looked at each other and}} said, [...] "Wow, OK." [...] <b>It</b> was <b>just</b> a natural progression that became the whole theme of the record. There are a lot of religious issues on the record and a lot of relationship issues. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> would fit." ...|$|R
5000|$|Long {{reportedly}} {{decided that}} he didn't {{want to go to}} Iraq after talking to people who had been there: [...] "These people came back and were telling these horrific stories and our superiors were egging people on, some people were actually volunteering to go over there and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> justified homicide", he said in the interview. [...] "It didn't sit right in my stomach. I morally couldn't do it." [...] Long was ordered in March 2005 to report to Iraq for service. [...] In 2005, he left his military base in Colorado Springs, and went to Toronto.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the Houston Chronicle, Walker stated about the album, [...] "There's no safety net in this music, I’m dangerous right now because I feel I've got nothing to lose. I'm coming out swinging." [...] In {{an interview}} with The Arizona Daily Star Walker said, [...] "I feel like it {{is by far the most}} important album of my career, this is without a question the best record I've ever made. Everything just clicked for me in the studio, everywhere. It clicked in looking for the songs. The photo shoot went great. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> everything fell in place. It seemed natural." ...|$|R
5000|$|Forty-four {{cars are}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three could {{qualify for the}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. McMurray clinched his first pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 19.621 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Newman. Kasey Kahne qualified third, Logano took fourth, and Hamlin started fifth. Allmendinger, Labonte, Reutimann, Harvick and Regan Smith rounded out the top ten. However, in the qualifying session, only 43 cars attempted to qualify (Setzer withdrew). Following the session, McMurray commented, [...] "We've had really good cars. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> we've had really bad luck, so I'm hoping. ... I've always been a little superstitious of green, and I showed up, and I saw my car, and I was like, 'Wow, that's not really what I was expecting to see.' But I hope this turns it around for us." ...|$|E
5000|$|Entertainment Weekly's Hilary Busis {{liked the}} episode, but somehow {{questioned}} the show creators' sudden inclusion of characters that {{were written in}} the 1800s into the storylines: [...] "Maybe it's best not to anger the all-powerful sorcerers. Instead, let's talk about their televised creation: 'The Doctor,' which revealed that Dr. Whale was once known as Dr. Horrible—I mean, Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Though I know {{that not all of}} Once's 'fairy land' characters actually hail from folklore—like Frankenstein, Pinocchio and the Mad Hatter are both inventions of 19th century novelists—I've still got mixed feelings about bringing Mary Shelley's classic into OUAT's potent public domain stew. If any and all stories are fair game, where will the show's writers draw the line? Will future episodes feature Emma befriending Elizabeth Bennet and Jo March, then trying to reunite Romeo and Juliet? <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> expanding the show's world beyond fairy tales and Disney properties—like Captain Hook—has the potential to turn Once into a giant, fanfiction-y mess." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{a congressional}} hearing on May 23, 2013, on an {{abortion}} bill that would ban the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, Gohmert {{told the story of}} another couple he knew that decided to go through with their pregnancy despite learning of fetal anomalies. He told Zink, a woman witness, that she should have gone through with her pregnancy despite some doctor's opinion that the brain function was impaired, and then have a better assessment of the baby's health once it was born. Gohmert explained: [...] "Ms. Zink, having my great sympathy and empathy both, I still come back wondering, shouldn't we wait, like that couple did, and see if the child can survive before we decide to rip him apart? ... So these are ethical issues, they're moral issues, they’re difficult issues, and the parents should certainly be consulted. But <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like,</b> it’s a more educated decision if the child is in front of you to make those decisions", Gohmert said.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was used}} by George W. Bush for his 2004 {{re-election}} campaign without the band's knowledge. [...] "That was weird," [...] Grohl remarked. [...] "And to me <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a pretty {{good example of how}} completely out of touch he was. You read those lyrics: they're about hope and love and compassion. And look at his administration: war and fear and death. It was laughable. You couldn't have picked a worse song. That's why I jumped on the John Kerry campaign. I thought, 'I guess {{the right thing to do}} is to go play the song where it's needed - where it makes sense.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It sounds kind of dumb, but I just didn’t {{think of}} doing it until recently. I used to publish these stories in 32-page comics, and I would either do short stories or break the long ones up into chunks {{so there would be}} some variety inside the Weathercraft comic. But since then, people have been doing more and more long, {{standalone}} works, and the term [...] "graphic novel" [...] has sort of become the codified term now. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the time was right to do it. I always felt that I could do those Frank stories by the inch, yard, or mile. The length of the stories never really mattered that much to me." [...] Jim Woodring ...|$|R
5000|$|Livingston {{stated that}} the comic {{was a good way}} of {{pointing}} out several shortcomings of video games and first-person shooters in particular. He emphasized the presence of various objects throughout the levels of games which were intended to aid the player, but would have little chance of being found in the real world in a similar manner. [...] Theres a lot of elements about video games to poke fun of, especially in first-person shooters, which all have {{a lot of things in}} common, such as health kits, ammo, and barrels filled with explosive material strewn about levels for no practical, real-world reason. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a good setting to make jokes. Christopher C. Livingston ...|$|R
5000|$|Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.9 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "Will God appear on Supernatural? It's a {{question}} I'm sure many viewers {{have continued to}} ask, especially with what seems like the numerous mentions of the character on Supernatural Season 11. And with the way Supernatural Season 11 Episode 18 ended, it certainly feels more likely... right? On one hand, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the right time with God's sister showing up and causing problems that God would finally reveal himself and get involved. Granted, we've seen lots of bad things happen on Earth over the seasons from the apocalypse to the Leviathan arriving, etc., and we haven't heard a peep from him. So, would Amara using Lucifer to draw out God really work? That's what's {{going to get him}} to reveal himself? The idea sounds exciting, but I also worry that the execution of him arriving might be more of a letdown." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{review of}} the album on Punknews.org was far more {{critical}} of the album, stating [...] "there is [...] "substance" [...] here—there are guitar solos, tempo changes, gang vocals—but there isn't substance.

5000|$|According to band leader Bill Leeb {{there was}} no theme from which the album took form. [...] "Everyone just started doing stuff", {{he said in an}} {{interview}} with Auxiliary Magazine, emphasizing how the band was influenced by their surroundings, [...] "I don’t know if it’s just the times we live in or the stuff going on around us. Whether you read the internet or watch the news or whether you just talk to people. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> it ended up being a theme of predominance, world issues." [...] Leeb cited travelling with the band as important inspiration, mentioning trips to Russia as example: [...] "Front Line has always liked iconic symbolism and going to countries like that really inspired me lyrically." [...] "It seemed like wherever we looked there was something for us to get into. We didn’t have to make up any stories or create anything that wasn’t already in front of us.", he concluded. Similarly, the album title arose from the band's perception of the outside world. Guitarist Jared Slingerland said in a conversation with The Rumpus, [...] "I mean, I.E.D., it's obvious what it is, but because it's still kind of a sensitive issue, Bill came up with the idea of 'electronic device.' There's obviously some overlap there." ...|$|E

According to Sublette, [...] "Willie took it from there" [...] though Nelson recently found that demo in a drawer among a stack of his own while recording unreleased songs for iTunes at his Spicewood, Texas home studio. Nelson says, [...] "I thought it was the funniest goddamn song I'd ever heard. I had it on the bus for 20 years, and people would come in and I'd play it.
