To resolve this dilemma, hot <b>solder</b> <b>dip</b> is being implemented to convert components to alternative finishes.

25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then {{passed through the}} holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and <b>dip</b> <b>soldered.</b> The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dip</b> <b>soldering</b> is {{accomplished}} by submerging parts to be joined into a molten solder bath. Thus, all components surfaces are coated with filler metal. Solders have low surface tension and high wetting capability. There are many types of solders, each used for different applications. Such as Lead-Silver for strength at higher than room temperature. Tin-Lead is used for General Purpose; Tin-Zinc is used for Aluminum; Cadmium-Silver is used for strength at high temperatures; Zinc-Aluminum is used for Aluminum and corrosion resistance; Tin-Silver and Tin-Bismuth is used for Electronics. Because of the toxicity of lead, lead-free solders are being developed and more widely used. The molten bath can be any suitable filler metal, but the selection is usually confined to the lower melting point elements. The most common <b>dip</b> <b>soldering</b> operations use zinc-aluminum and tin-lead solders.Solder pot metal - Cast iron or steel,electrically heated.Bath temperature - 220 deg.

40|$|Abstract. A novel way {{of three}} {{dimensional}} (3 D) chip stacking {{has been designed}} in a view to improve heat dissipation across the layers. Chip stacking using vertical interconnections forms microscale channels for coolant to circulate through the gaps. Solder-based self assembled (SBSA) 3 D structures have been designed as posts on simulated through silicon vias (TSVs) to prove the processing concept. The processing of SBSA structures using a low temperature solder alloy and <b>dip</b> <b>soldering</b> method is described. Additional processing steps to fabricate interconnected 3 D structures were demonstrated. Mechanical grinding of the 3 D structures shows that soldered SBSA structures were void free and robust enough {{to be used as}} a connection post for chip stacking. SBSA structures provide a solder bump that serves as a connection path in the integration of dissimilar electronic technologies. Conventional copper posts, developed in a previous project, can be an effective approach to integrated circuit (IC) stacking. However, the SBSA post provides more variety in size and shape with a potential to serve as a reservoir for solder to aid in chip bonding. The solder bumps are heat resistant and uniform thicknesses were obtained across a large array of SBSA structures. The electrical durability of SBSA posts were determined by completing I-V measurements after thermal treatments. Fabricated SBSA posts were subjected to thermal cycling with temperatures ranging from room temperature to 300 °C. The interconnected SBSA posts are shown to be stable until 165 °C with little variation in measured resistance...|$|E

Tin-silver-copper is an option of lead-free terminal finish. <b>Solder</b> <b>dip</b> is the way to obtain tin-silver-copper finish. However, the reliability of solder joints formed with these refinished terminals may be affected by the refinishing process. The solder joint reliability of refinished components under temperature cycling conditions need to be determined to study the effects of refinishing on the solder joint reliability. Tin-bismuth terminal finish is another tin-whisker mitigation strategy. The reliability of solder joints under temperature cycling conditions formed with tin-bismuth finished terminals also needs to be determined before the implementation. The microstructure and strength of solder joints formed with refinished terminals were evaluated by comparing with those of solder joints formed with original pure tin finished terminals. The reliability of solder joints formed with original pure tin finished terminals, refinished terminals and original tin-bismuth finished terminals were tested under temperature cycling. Under temperature cycling test, solder joints formed with Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu <b>solder</b> <b>dipped</b> terminals have shorter characteristic life for thin-small-outline-packages but longer characteristic life for 2512 resistors than those formed with the original pure tin finished terminals in both eutectic SnPb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder assembly.

In the present research, whisker growth is investigated via immersion Sn finishes on Cu substrate. The effects of Sn layer thickness, addition of Ni under-layer and <b>solder</b> <b>dipping</b> on whisker growth are investigated by storing the samples under ambient temperature for up to 24 weeks.

Manufacturers of high reliability and safety critical equipment in sectors such as defence and aerospace rely increasingly {{on the use of}} commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components for their products and systems. The use of COTS components with lead-free solder plated terminations comes with the risks for their long term reliability associated with tin whisker growth related failures. In the case of leaded type electronic components such as Quad Flat Package (QFP) and Small Outline Package (SOP), one of the promising solutions to this problem is to “re-finish” the package terminations by replacing the lead-free solder coatings on the leads with conventional tin–lead solder. This involves subjecting the electronic components to a post-manufacturing process known as Hot <b>Solder</b> <b>Dip</b> (HSD).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Within {{the context of the}} imminent implementation of the Pb-free soldering in Europe in 2006, this thesis addresses the gap in understanding that has emerged in the fundamental materials issues between well-understood and mature lead-containing solders and a plethora of new, Pb-free solders for which there are neither long term reliability data nor understanding of the materials behaviour and how these might be influenced by manufacture and in-service conditions. In addition, this thesis also addresses the question as to whether the solder joint size and geometry could become a reliability issue and therefore affect the implementation of the Pb-free solders in ultrafine micro joints. Thermodynamic calculations using MTDATA (developed by the National Physical Laboratory, NPL, UK) together with a thermodynamic database for solders under either equilibrium or Scheil conditions, have shown their usefulness in Pb-free solder design and processing, generating a wealth of information in respect of the temperature dependence of phase formation and composition. The predictions from MTDATA on a number of selected systems is generally in good agreement with the results from experimental work, and has assisted in the understanding of the microstructure and mechanical properties of the Pb-free solders and the implications of their interactions with a tin-lead solder. However, further critical assessment and the addition of new elements into the solder database, such as Ni and P, are required to make MTDA TA a more effective computational tool to assist the optimization of processing parameters and cost-effective production in using Pb-free solders. Molten solder can interact with the under bump metallizations (UBM) and/or board level metallizations {{on either side of the}} solder bump to form intermetallic compounds (IMCs) during solder reflow. In the modelling of the kinetics of the dissolution process of UBM into the liquid solder, the commonly used NernstBrunner (N-B) equation is found to have poor validity for these calculations for micro joints at 100 µm in diameter or less. Three bumping techniques, i. e. <b>solder</b> <b>dipping</b> (SD), <b>solder</b> paste stencil printing followed by reflow (SPR) and electroplating of solders and subsequent reflow (EPR), are used to investigate the interfacial interactions of molten Sn/Sn-rich solders, i. e. pure Sn, Sn- 3. 5 Ag, and Sn- 3. 8 AgO. 7 Cu, on electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) and copper pads at 240 °C. The resultant bulk and interfacial microstructures from a variety of pad sizes, ranging from 1 mm down to 25 µm, suggest that in general the small bumps contain smaller β-Sn dendrites and Ag₃Sn IMC particles, nevertheless the interfacial IMC is thicker in the smalI bumps than in the large bumps. In addition, one and two-dimensional combined thermodynamic and kinetic models have been developed to assist the understanding of the kinetics of interdiffusion and the formation of interfacial intermetallic compounds during reflow. Both the experimental results and theoretical predictions suggest that the solder bump size and geometry can influence the as-soldered microstructure, and therefore this factor should be taken into consideration for the design of future reliable ultrafine Ph-free solder joints...|$|R

In some applications, it is also used to ensure reliable solder joints by replacing contaminated finishes and lead-free alloys with tin–lead to result in a homogeneous solder joint with tin–lead paste. In this paper, the impact of a HSD refinishing process on leaded components was statistically studied by comparing the electrical test data of refinished samples with those not-refinished. The likely damage from the component refinishing was thought to be the degradation of package integrity through thermo-mechanical stressing. This might be detectable as a microscopic leakage current if moisture could be encouraged into any open areas. Ten types of leaded components were selected and samples for each type of the component were allocated into 2 lots, one for refinishing and one used as a control. 150 cycles − 65 / 150 °C thermal cycling followed by 500 h 85 %RH/ 85 °C humidity test was applied to all the samples (both refinished and not-refinished) to amplify any incipient failure points and accelerate moisture ingress into the package. Electrical test was then carried out to measure any small changes in current under zero and reverse bias conditions. In the end, a data reduction process in conjunction with a statistical hypothesis test was used to analyze the electrical test data. The results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between the measured currents of refinished and not-refinished post-aged samples. Therefore it was concluded that the refinishing process did not have a significant impact on the tested components. This conclusion was further strengthened by other experimental test results such as CSAM images...|$|R
