5|$|Zinc oxide {{itself is}} non-toxic; {{however it is}} {{hazardous}} to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass {{is close to the}} boiling point of zinc. Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding <b>galvanized</b> (zinc plated) steel, can result in a nervous malady called metal fume fever. For this reason, typically <b>galvanized</b> steel is not welded, or the zinc is removed first.|$|E

40|$|The {{finding of}} studies into {{the factors that}} affects optimal {{performance}} of <b>galvanizing</b> kettle is presented in this paper. The production schedule and history of a failed <b>galvanizing</b> kettle for 3 -consecutively years in a hot-dip <b>galvanizing</b> industry was collated and analyzed. The analysis of the collated data revealed that average <b>galvanizing</b> temperatures for the 3 -year under review were 483. 9 °C (2003), 482. 25 °C (2004) and 482 °C (2005) respectively. The amount of flux, and dross produced in the corresponding years were 169. 15 kg and 31. 6 tons, 56. 31 kg and 10. 5 tons and 101. 14 and 18. 91 tonnes for 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. During these years, zinc consumed averaged 647, 334 and 446 tonnes respectively. Stochiometry evaluation of flux, and dross in a hot-dip <b>galvanizing</b> process determined flux required as 60 kg/year and dross produced as 90 slabs / month. The study revealed that the lifespan of <b>galvanizing</b> kettle is greatly reduced by temperature fluctuation, dross formation, excess flux additions and combinations of these factors. It is recommended that improved service integrity of <b>galvanizing</b> kettle is assured at <b>galvanizing</b> temperature of 460 °C, flux consumption of 0. 15 – 0. 20 kg daily and constant removal of dross at 3 - 5 slabs per day. This reduces the formation of skim lines, which leads to pits {{on the walls of}} the kettle...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} the method {{to assess the}} diffusion coefficient D in the sub-layer of intermetallic phases formed during hot-dip <b>galvanizing</b> “Armco” iron and ductile cast iron EN-GJS- 500 - 7. Hot-dip <b>galvanizing</b> {{is one of the}} most popular forms of long-term protection of Fe-C alloys against corrosion. The process for producing a protective layer of sufficient quality is closely related to diffusion of atoms of zinc and iron. The simulation consist in performed a hot-dip <b>galvanizing</b> in laboratory condition above Fe-C alloys, in the Department of Engineering of Cast Alloys and Composites. <b>Galvanizing</b> time ranged from 15 to 300 seconds. Then metallographic specimens were prepared, intermetallic layers were measured and diffusion coefficient (D) were calculated. It was found that the diffusion coefficient obtained during hot-dip <b>galvanizing</b> “Armco” iron and zinc is about two orders of magnitude less than the coefficient obtained on ductile cast iron EN-GJS- 500 - 7...|$|R

5|$|Pennies {{and other}} small coins are {{sometimes}} ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in <b>galvanized</b> cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The hybrid {{effect of}} Al and Cr in zinc bath on <b>galvanizing</b> {{coatings}} were studied {{by means of}} scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS), coupled with hot-dip <b>galvanizing</b> experiments. A new phase T 1 {{was found in the}} coating, and the ζ phase was absent when hot-dip <b>galvanizing</b> at 480 °C. When Cr added zinc bath were alloyed with 0. 1 wt. % Al, coating was composed of δ, ζ, η and T 1 phases; when Cr added zinc bath were alloyed with 0. 2 wt. % Al, δ phase layer became thinner, ζ changed from even layer to blocky crystals, and diffuse-∆ coexisted with the ζ phase. The morphology evolution of <b>galvanizing</b> coating was analyzed and the hybrid effect of Al and Cr were discussed with diffusion path theory...|$|R

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are more}} susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be <b>galvanized</b> or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It {{is not difficult to}} monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E
