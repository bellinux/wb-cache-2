5|$|Finally, {{yet another}} brother, {{possibly}} younger than Nyuserre {{has also been}} proposed: Iryenre, a prince Iry-pat whose relationship <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> {{by the fact that}} his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.|$|E
5|$|For a {{suspected}} first leg DVT in a moderate-probability scenario, a high-sensitivity D-dimer <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> as a recommended option over ultrasound imaging, with both whole-leg and compression ultrasound possible. The NICE guideline uses a two-point Wells score {{and does not}} refer to a moderate probability group.|$|E
50|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that there}} <b>was</b> an {{evolution}} of the hieroglyphs into the linear scripts. Also, some relations to Anatolian hieroglyphs have <b>been</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Coniine from hemlock {{consumed}} by quail has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as the cause, though quail resist eating hemlock. Hellebore has also <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{as the source}} of the toxin. [...] It has also been asserted that this evidence points to the seeds of the annual woundwort (Stachys annua) being the causal agent. It has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that Galeopsis ladanum seeds are not responsible.|$|R
25|$|Hydrocarbon {{fracturing}} of oil-bearing formations is {{a potentially}} interesting and large-scale application. Nanocellulose has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{for use in}} oil recovery applications as a fracturing fluid. Drilling muds based on nanocellulose have also <b>been</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|R
5|$|It is {{not known}} why Michelangelo {{selected}} the five particular Sibyls that were depicted, given that, as with the Minor Prophets, there were ten or twelve possibilities. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> by John O'Malley that the choice was made for a wide geographic coverage, with the Sibyls coming from Africa, Asia, Greece and Ionia.|$|E
5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. In vitro studies {{on some of}} these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that they function as inhibitors in vivo. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|Purity {{of heart}} <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> as the {{necessary}} quality needed {{to accomplish this}} task; common Catholic prayers and hymns include a request for this virtue.|$|E
50|$|Several {{theories}} <b>were</b> <b>suggested</b> surrounding their disappearance. At the time, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} Lonergans might have staged their disappearance. However, the Lonergans' bank accounts were never touched and their insurance policies were not claimed.|$|R
50|$|Based on morphology, Meyna has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{as likely}} {{candidate}} {{for inclusion in}} Canthium subgenus Canthium. In 2004, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that Meyna tetraphylla is related to Canthium and the transfer to Canthium <b>was</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|R
30|$|Subjects and {{the scope}} of the {{research}} <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> for future study. Student samples from both technical colleges and academic universities can be included as subjects to make the research more thorough. In addition, different disciplines <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> to explore whether different subject areas can be one of factor to affect online learning satisfaction and efficiency. A longitudinal study with experimental period and learners background <b>is</b> <b>suggest</b> increasing research reliability and validity.|$|R
5|$|Rudy Giecek {{claims that}} the Dumas is haunted by the ghost of Elinore Knott. Author Karen Stevens also {{recalled}} paranormal experiences related to the brothel. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that Knott's ghost {{is one of several}} at the Dumas.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} ceratopsians, {{especially}} Centrosaurus and its relatives, {{appear to have}} been gregarious, living in herds. This <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> by bonebed finds with the remains of many individuals of different ages. Like modern migratory herds, they would have had a significant effect on their environment, as well as serving as a major food source for predators.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such {{as white}} peacocks, swans and geese, are not {{believed}} to be true albinos, as {{they do not have}} red eyes, rather, their colouration <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> to be the expression of a white fur or feather gene, not a lack of melanin.|$|E
5000|$|... (Q)SAR {{models have}} been used for risk management. QSARS <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> by {{regulatory}} authorities; in the European Union, QSARs <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> by the REACH regulation, where [...] "REACH" [...] abbreviates [...] "Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals".|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} intermediate community between society {{and individuals who}} experienced hikikomori. I conducted group interview with {{members of a group}} issues the information magazines of school refusal and hikikomori. As a result, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that sense of security obtained through sharing of experiences of school refusal or hikikomori is factor and motivation in their relationship. Also, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that their sensitivities to hurting others and other’s pain mediate their relationship. As regards the function of this community, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that members of the community can share their experiential knowledge through the information magazines. Also, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that the activities of editing and selling the magazines moderates their internal confl icts...|$|R
5|$|This form of {{inheritance}} for Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome is}} not yet absolute, though, as a girl has been reported with the disorder. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that further analysis is needed for the inheritance to be formally established.|$|E
5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|After the closure, the {{non-profit}} organization Friends of the Numedal Line was established and offered occasional heritage rides along the line. It maintains the tracks between Rollag and Rødberg and offers draisine rental between Veggli and Rødberg. Irregular transport from the gravel pit at Svene and the sawmill Numedal Bruk at Flesberg. The latter is operated by Tågåkeriet i Bergslagen and hauls lumber from Uddevalla, Sweden. The stretch from Flesberg to Rødberg <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{significance}} of their joint work, it has <b>been</b> <b>suggested,</b> <b>is</b> {{that they believed}} and worked towards [...] "revolution not reformation," [...] and that that accounted for their many switches between organizations. It has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that what brought the two women together was [...] "the waged and political work" [...] that they shared.|$|R
30|$|Hence, lasso and {{stepwise}} {{variable selection}} methods <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> for continuous response variable, and association and correlation methods <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> for categorical response variable; or alternatively, variable selection method by combing both association, correlation, and regression method {{can bring a}} better result.|$|R
5|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that Pallas has a moon. A moon about 1 {{kilometer}} {{in diameter}} <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> based on occultation data from an occultation on 29 May 1978, {{and another one}} separated from Pallas by 750 kilometers and 175 kilometers in diameter itself <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> in 1980, but later shown incorrect in 1983 occultation observations. Considering {{the level at which}} Pallas has been studied and observed since it was discovered, it is unlikely that there are any large moons orbiting Pallas.|$|R
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|He {{could not}} breathe {{for the first}} twenty minutes of his life. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that this {{deprivation}} may have caused him to develop Asperger's syndrome—some of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, maintain that this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors in later life. He was of English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and it <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that they may be}} storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that by the}} Early Cambrian, organisms {{higher in}} the food chain caused the {{microbial}} mats to largely disappear. If these grazers first appeared as the Ediacaran biota started to decline, then it may suggest that they destabilised the microbial substrate, leading to displacement or detachment of the biota; or that {{the destruction of the}} mat destabilised the ecosystem, causing extinctions.|$|E
5|$|Parentage : The Apollodorus {{responsible}} for the Library lists Troilus last of Priam and Hecuba's sons – a detail adopted in the later tradition – but then adds that {{it is said that}} the boy was fathered by Apollo. On the other hand, Hyginus includes Troilus {{in the middle of a}} list of Priam's sons without further comment. In the early Christian writings the Clementine Homilies, it <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that Apollo was Troilus' lover rather than his father.|$|E
5|$|The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor {{results show}} that gamma rays and {{antimatter}} particles (positrons) can be generated in powerful thunderstorms. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGF). TGFs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning. The streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays. About 500 TGFs may occur every day worldwide, but mostly go undetected.|$|E
50|$|A {{recent example}} is the Korean spicy chicken dish dakdoritang, the naming origin of which has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as a Japanese-Korean hybrid (dak(닭) means chicken in Korean, whereas dori(とり) means bird in Japanese). The refined word dakbokkeumtang (닭볶음탕) has <b>been</b> <b>suggested,</b> with some controversy.|$|R
