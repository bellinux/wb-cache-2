Although the electromagnetic vibration of IMs has been studied for several years, the relationships between the radial distribution of the electromagnetic vibration and noise and the electromagnetic forces responsible for them have not yet been analyzed in sufficient detail. In the present study, we investigated this relationship experimentally for a small IM under different load conditions. Our results clearly show that the radial distributions of the dominant electromagnetic vibration and noise components match the mode shape of the dominant electromagnetic force producing these components...|$|R
