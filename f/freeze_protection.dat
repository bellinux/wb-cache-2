40|$|Globally, C 4 plants {{dominate}} hot, open environments, {{but this}} general pattern is underpinned by important {{differences in the}} biogeography of C 4 lineages. In particular, the species richness of C 4 Poaceae (grasses) increases strongly with increasing temperature, whereas that of the major C 4 eudicot group Chenopodiaceae correlates positively with aridity. Freezing tolerance is a crucial determinant of biogeographical relationships with temperature and is mediated by photodamage and cellular disruption by desiccation, but {{little is known about}} differences between C 4 families. This study hypothesized that there is a greater risk of freezing damage via these mechanisms in C 4 Poaceae than Chenopodiaceae, that <b>freezing</b> <b>protection</b> differs between the taxonomic groups, and that freezing tolerance of species is linked to arid habitat preference. Chlorophyll fluorescence, water relations, and freezing injury were compared in four C 3 and six C 4 species of Poaceae and Chenopodiaceae from the same Mongolian flora. Contrary to expectations, freezing-induced leaf mortality and photodamage were lower in Poaceae than Chenopodiaceae species, and unrelated to photosynthetic pathway. The freezing resistance of Poaceae species resulted from constitutive protection and cold acclimation and an ability to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from photodamage. <b>Freezing</b> <b>protection</b> was associated with low osmotic potential and low tissue elasticity, and freezing damage was accompanied by electrolyte leakage, consistent with cell-membrane disruption by ice. Both Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae had the potential to develop cold acclimation and withstand freezing during the growing season, which conflicted with the hypothesis. Instead, freezing tolerance was more closely associated with life history and ecological preference in these Mongolian species...|$|R

2500|$|Pure {{ethylene}} glycol has a {{specific heat capacity}} about one half that of water.

[...] A 1:1 mix by mass has a specific heat capacity of about 3140 J/(kg·°C) (0.75 BTU/(lb·°F)), three quarters that of pure water, thus requiring increased flow rates in same system comparisons with water. The formation of large bubbles in cooling passages of internal combustion engines will seriously inhibit heat flow (flux) from that area, thus allowing nucleation (tiny bubbles) heat transfer to occur is not advisable. Large bubbles in cooling passages will be self-sustaining or grow larger, with virtually {{the complete loss of}} cooling in that spot. With pure MEG that hot spot has to get to 200 °C. Cooling due to other effects such as air draft from fan etc. (not considered in pure nucleation analysis) will assist in preventing large-bubble formation.|$|E

40|$|During {{exposure}} to 2 °C, pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings cold acclimated to a killing temperature of − 6 °C. Associated with {{this increase in}} freezing resistance {{was an increase in}} the weight of cell walls and changes in wall composition. Arabinosyl content increased by 100 %, while other cell wall glycosyl residues and cellulose increased by about 20 %. The cell wall hydroxyproline content increased by 80 %. Arabinose and hydroxyproline are both major components of the structural cell wall glycoprotein, extensin. The increase in these components indicates that the level of extensin in the cell wall increases during cold acclimation. Northern blot analysis, using the pDC 5 A 1 genomic clone as a probe, revealed a more than three-fold increase in total extensin mRNA during {{exposure to}} cold temperature. Specific extensin transcripts of 6. 0, 4. 5, 3. 5, 2. 6, 2. 3, 1. 8, and 1. 5 kilobases were identified. Those at 6. 0, 2. 6, and 1. 5 kilobases were especially promoted by low temperature treatment. The rise in extensin during cold acclimation may be regulated, at least in part, at the gene level.

40|$|AbstractLate {{embryogenesis}} abundant (LEA) proteins are {{a highly}} {{diverse group of}} polypeptides expected to play important roles in desiccation tolerance of plant seeds. They are also found in other plant tissues and in some anhydrobotic invertebrates, fungi, protists and prokaryotes. The LEA protein LEAM accumulates in the matrix space of pea (Pisum sativum) mitochondria during late seed maturation. LEAM is an intrinsically disordered protein folding into amphipathic α-helix upon desiccation. This suggests that it could interact with the inner mitochondrial membrane, providing structural protection in dry seeds. Here, we have used Fourier-transform infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy to gain insight into the molecular details of interactions of LEAM with phospholipid bilayers in the dry state and their effects on liposome stability. LEAM interacted specifically with negatively charged phosphate groups in dry phospholipids, increasing fatty acyl chain mobility. This led to an enhanced stability of liposomes during drying and rehydration, but also upon <b>freezing.</b> <b>Protection</b> depended on phospholipid composition and was strongly enhanced in membranes containing the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin. Collectively, the results provide strong evidence for a function of LEAM as a mitochondrial membrane protectant during desiccation and highlight the role of lipid composition in the interactions between LEA proteins and membranes...|$|R
2500|$|Salts {{freezing}} - Fluoride salt mixtures have melting points {{ranging from}} 300 to 600°C (...) [...] The salts, {{especially those with}} beryllium fluoride, are very viscous near their freezing point. This requires careful design and <b>freeze</b> <b>protection</b> in the containment and heat exchangers. Freezing must be prevented in normal operation, during transients, and during extended downtime. The primary loop salt contains the decay heat-generating fission products, which help to maintain the required temperature. For the MSBR, ORNL planned on keeping the entire reactor room (the hot cell) at high temperature. This avoided the need for individual electric heater lines on all piping and provided more even heating of the primary loop components. One [...] "liquid oven" [...] concept developed for molten salt-cooled, solid-fueled reactors employs a separate buffer salt pool containing the entire primary loop. Because of the high heat capacity and considerable density of the buffer salt, the buffer salt prevents fuel salt freezing and participates in the passive decay heat cooling system, provides radiation shielding and reduces deadweight stresses on primary loop components. This design could also be adopted for LFTRs.|$|E

The proposed methodology in this report is based on already existing test methods. The methods are without any exceptions taken from fire tests on products and constructions used on the market for European building products. The methodology proposed follows a step like testing sequence. The first step is to evaluate if the product is non-combustible or not. If not the fire properties are evaluated and described in terms of heat release rate and smoke production rate. If the fire properties are not good enough the product can be covered with a protection and the whole construction is evaluated regarding fire resistance...|$|R

Magneto-mechanical transmission devices have several advantages over conventional mechanisms: no friction between rotatory elements (no power losses or heat generation by friction so increase of efficiency), no lubrication is needed (oil-free mechanisms and no lubrication auxiliary systems), reduced maintenance (no lubricant so no need of oil replacements), wider operational temperature ranges (no lubricant evaporation or <b>freezing),</b> overload <b>protection</b> (if overload occurs magnet simply slides but no teeth brake), through-wall connection (decoupling of thermal and electrical paths and environmental isolation), larger operative speeds (more efficient operative conditions), ultralow noise and vibrations (no contact no noise generation).

40|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} pavements have given excellent service history for Iowa. Many of these pavements placed during the 1920 ’s and 1930 ’s {{are still in}} service today. Many factors go in to achieve a long term durable concrete pavement. Probably {{the most important is}} the durability of the aggregate. Until the 1930 ’s, pit run gravel was the most predominant aggregate used. Many of these gravels provided long term performance and their durability is dependent upon the carbonate fraction of the gravel. Later, limestone (calcium carbonate) and dolomite (calcium, magnesium carbonate) sources were mined across Iowa. The durability of these carbonate aggregates is largely dependent upon the pore system which can cause freeze thaw problems known as D-cracking, which was a problem with some sources during the 1960 ’s. Also, some of these carbonate aggregates are also susceptible to deterioration from deicing salts. Geologists have identified the major components that affect the durability of these carbonate aggregates and sources are tested to ensure long term performance in Portland {{cement concrete}}.

40|$|The loss of big {{sagebrush}} (Artemisia tridentata) {{throughout the}} Great Basin Desert has motivated efforts to restore {{it because of}} fire and other disturbance effects on sagebrush-dependent wildlife and ecosystem function. Initial establishment is the first challenge to restoration, and appropriateness of seeds, climate, and weather variability are factors that may explain success or difficulties in big sagebrush restoration efforts. This project provided several ways of assessing climate responses of big sagebrush seedlings during the critical establishment phase post-fire. We evaluated eleven different seed sources of big sagebrush from all three subspecies, dissimilar climates-of-origin, and different ploidy levels to assess how subspecies, cytotype, and climate-of-origin affect initial establishment of sagebrush in a common garden study. We assessed ecophysiological-climate adaptation {{as it relates to}} seedling performance using a suite of dependent variables, including: survival, growth, water balance, photosynthesis, and threshold freezing responses. Results indicate the importance of minimum temperatures to seedling establishment, and reveal a gradient of physiological responses to freezing that inform big sagebrush adaptation and functional diversity. We then used in-situ experimental warming to isolate minimum temperatures, and test the effects of warming on seedling physiological performance for the three dominant subspecies of big sagebrush: A. t. tridentata, A. t. vaseyana, and A. t. wyomingensis. Experimental warming further supported our minimum temperature hypothesis, indicating that warming may alter seedling freezing response thereby affect growth and survival. In a third experiment, we evaluated how initial establishment of big sagebrush is influenced by management treatments on the herb layer, as post-fire rehabilitation frequently involves alterations of the plant community and soil. Results suggest that drill seeding combined with land management treatments that cause disturbance of the herb layer and soil surface may negatively affect sagebrush during the establishment phase. Also, seedlings from local seed or faster-growing populations had greater survival than seedlings from climates that differed from the experimental site. In summary, we provide experimental evidence for the importance of minimum temperatures and seed sources to big sagebrush ecology and management of sagebrush systems. As the climate warms, selection for population-specific freezing resistance mechanisms may alter subspecies distributions. Our data indicated that warming could increase relative abundance of A. t. tridentata compared to A. t. wyomingensis at our Birds of Prey National Conservation Areas study site on the lower Snake River plain. The underlying mechanism for this is greater stress overcome by changes in resource allocation from <b>freezing</b> <b>protection</b> to growth, as well as an extraction of deeper soil water resources in A. t. tridentata. Mortality of A. t. vaseyana appeared to relate to drought stress and greater vulnerability to minimum temperature exposure. Understanding differences in big sagebrush populations’ ability to compete with different types and abundances of herbs as well as variation in freezing resistance mechanisms will contribute to appropriate seed selection for particular restoration sites. The implication is that selection of seed is critical for big sagebrush restoration success...|$|R
