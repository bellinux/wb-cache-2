30|$|The MDP-E {{consists}} of two mission data processor boards (MDP 1 and MDP 2), mission data recorder boards (MDR 1 and MDR 2), and power distribution units (PDUs). The dimensions of the MDP-E are 165  mm[*]×[*] 265  mm[*]×[*] 167  mm, its mass is 4.25  kg, and its power consumption is 29.8  W. The MDP-E has two SpaceWire ports connected to the router in the bus network. The MDP is the only component connecting the bus and the mission network, and two MDPs have been provided for redundancy {{in case of a}} breakdown. This allows for single-system failure faults caused by the small satellite project; however, it constitutes a redundant system for parts that are entirely damaged by the mission and for parts necessary for gathering information on failure causes. Therefore, the <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> <b>line</b> with SpaceWire, the power supply line, and the spin index pulse line all have redundant systems to avoid whole mission failure when there is a fault at an interface point between the bus and the mission.|$|E
40|$|Bachelor's {{thesis is}} focused on the issue of data {{communications}} over power lines. This technology is known as PLC (Power <b>Line</b> <b>Communication).</b> Wider deployment of this technology into practice at present prevents a number of shortcomings. Main problems are disturbance useful signal on power lines, radiation interference, small reach of useful signal and elements of energy network, which affect the transmission. In the analysis of sub-problems, it appears that it is appropriate to have a computer power line model, allowing a computer simulation of <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> over power <b>line.</b> It is necessary to combine two different, conflicting requirements. Power lines are not primarily intended for <b>data</b> <b>communication,</b> and <b>data</b> <b>lines</b> are not designed for the transmission of electricity. Both types of line are described the same primary parameters, but they operate in completely different modes. This thesis examines these modes and possible models of power and data lines in terms of <b>data</b> <b>communication.</b> The main part is devoted to the draft power <b>line</b> model for <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> and computer verification of the functionality of the new proposed model...|$|R

40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} demand for <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> methods, power <b>line</b> <b>communication</b> {{has become an}} interesting alternative method for <b>data</b> <b>communication.</b> Power <b>line</b> <b>communication</b> falls into two categories: one for data transmission between sites in the power grid {{and the other for}} home or office networking. When considering home or office networking, existing methods are either too slow for tasks other than simple automation, or are very fast with a higher cost than necessary for the desired function. The objective in this work is to develop a lower cost communication system with an intermediate data transmission rate. At first glance, power <b>line</b> <b>communication</b> looks like a good option because of the availability of power outlets in every room of a building. However, the power conductors were installed solely for the purpose of distributing 60 Hz mains power and, for data signals, they exhibit very high attenuation, variable impedance and there is radio frequency shielding. Furthermore, many of the 60 Hz loads produce radio frequency interference that impedes <b>data</b> <b>communication.</b> Previous research has shown that much of the noise is time synchronous with the 60 Hz mains frequency and that the majority of data errors occur during these periods of high noise. This work develops a power <b>line</b> <b>communication</b> protocol that coordinates transmissions and uses only the predictable times of lower noise. Using a central control strategy, the power line 60 Hz mains signal is divided into 16 timeslots and each timeslot is monitored for errors. The central controller periodically polls all stations to learn which timeslots have low noise and it then controls all transmissions to make the best use of these good timeslots. The periodic polling allows the system to adapt to changes in electrical loading and noise. This control strategy has been achieved with modest complexity and laboratory measurements have shown throughput approaching 70 % of the modem bit rate...|$|R

They are, in particular, interference with useful signal on lines, interference radiation, limited range of useful signal, and power grid elements that affect the transfer. It results from an analysis of partial problems that it is of advantage to have available a computer model of power line, which would enable simulating appropriately the data transfer over power lines. Two different, in a way conflicting, requirements need to be reconciled. Primarily, power lines are not designed for data transfer while data lines, in turn, are not adapted for power transmission. Although the two types of line are represented by the same parameters, their operation is completely different.

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>communication</b> {{over power}} <b>lines</b> {{requires}} advanced signal-processing techniques {{to cope with}} time-varying intersymbol interference and severe impulsive noise. A further challenge comes from strict regulatory constraints that stipulate low transmission power. In this paper, we propose an adaptive robust turbo equalizer for single-carrier coded systems. The turbo equalizer has a component equalizer {{to deal with the}} deep frequency notches present in power-line channels. The component equalizer' exchanges extrinsic information with a component decoder to perform iterative detection. To facilitate adaptive equalization in time-varying power-line channels, a simple system identification-based channel estimator is incorporated. Most important, a nonlinear-matched myriad filter (MMyF) is used for efficient baseband filtering in impulsive channels. The results show that the MMyF is indispensable for the turbo equalizer to achieve reliable channel estimation and data detection in impulsive power lines. Substantial performance improvements over the conventional scheme designed for Gaussian channels are observed...|$|R
