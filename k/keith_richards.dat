5|$|The services' {{association}} with 1960s musicians is remembered {{in a set}} of photographs published in 2008 of the Stones stopping at Watford Gap on the way to ATV Studios, Birmingham in 1963. In 2009, Roadchef paid a former employee £1,000 for autographs he had collected while working there, including those of Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, <b>Keith</b> <b>Richards,</b> Brian Jones, Dusty Springfield and Cliff Richard. In July 2011, music journalist Peter Paphides presented Late Nights at the Blue Boar, a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the connection between the services and Britain's 1960s rock bands.|$|E
5|$|Berry {{continued}} to play 70 to 100 one-nighters {{per year in the}} 1980s, still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop. In 1986, Taylor Hackford made a documentary film, Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll, of a celebration concert for Berry's sixtieth birthday, organized by <b>Keith</b> <b>Richards.</b> Eric Clapton, Etta James, Julian Lennon, Robert Cray and Linda Ronstadt, among others, appeared with Berry on stage and in the film. During the concert, Berry played a Gibson ES-355, the luxury version of the ES-335 that he favored on his 1970s tours. Richards played a black Fender Telecaster Custom, Cray a Fender Stratocaster and Clapton a , the same model that Berry used on his early recordings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Keith</b> <b>Richards</b> as Edward Teague: Keeper of the Pirata Codex for the Brethren Court and Jack Sparrow's father. The other pirate lords are visibly {{terrified of}} him. Richards, who {{partially}} inspired Depp's portrayal of Sparrow, {{was meant to}} appear in Dead Man's Chest, {{but there was no}} room for him in the story, as well as his being tied up with a Rolling Stones tour. He almost missed filming a scene in At World's End, following injuries sustained by falling out of a tree. In June 2006, Verbinski finally managed to make room in Richards' schedule to shoot that September.|$|E

5|$|Life is {{a memoir}} by the Rolling Stones guitarist <b>Keith</b> <b>Richards,</b> written with the {{assistance}} of journalist James Fox. Published in October 2010, in hardback, audio and e-book formats, the book chronicles Richards' love of music, charting influences from his mother and maternal grandfather, through his discovery of blues music, the founding of the Rolling Stones, his often turbulent relationship with Mick Jagger, his involvement with drugs, and his relationships with women including Anita Pallenberg and his wife Patti Hansen. Richards also released Vintage Vinos, a compilation of his work with the X-Pensive Winos, at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{magistrates court}} {{continued}} to cover significant trials that were widely {{reported by the}} media. In 1963, Christine Keeler was tried here for attempting to obstruct the course of justice. In the late 1960s, a number of rock stars, including The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, <b>Keith</b> <b>Richards</b> and Brian Jones, stood trial on drugs offences at the magistrates court. Richards was tried here again in 1973 for possession of heroin and owning unlicensed firearms, but was only fined £205 (now £). John Lennon and Yoko Ono were tried for obscenity here in 1970. The building became Grade II listed in 1970. The courts closed in 1998, and are now the Courthouse Hotel.|$|E
5|$|After {{performances}} in Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand in March/April 2006, the Rolling Stones tour took a scheduled break before proceeding to Europe; during this break <b>Keith</b> <b>Richards</b> was hospitalised in New Zealand for cranial surgery after a fall {{from a tree}} on Fiji, {{where he had been}} on holiday. The incident led to a six-week delay in launching the European leg of the tour. In June 2006 it was reported that Ronnie Wood was continuing his programme of rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, but this did not affect the rearranged European tour schedule. Two out of the 21 shows scheduled for July–September 2006 were later cancelled due to Mick Jagger's throat problems. The Rolling Stones returned to North America for concerts in September 2006, and returned to Europe on 5 June 2007. By November 2006, the Bigger Bang tour had been declared the highest grossing tour of all time.|$|E

5|$|<b>Keith</b> <b>Richards</b> and Mick Jagger became {{childhood}} {{friends and}} classmates in 1950 in Dartford, Kent, before the Jagger {{family moved to}} Wilmington, five miles (8.05km) away, in 1954. In the mid-1950s, Jagger formed a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor; the group mainly played material by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin' Wolf and Bo Diddley. Jagger met Richards again in 1960 on Dartford railway station, and the Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records that Jagger was carrying revealed a common interest. A musical partnership began shortly afterwards. Richards joined Jagger and Taylor at frequent meetings at Jagger's house. The meetings switched to Taylor's house in late 1961, where the three were joined by Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{hosted the}} orchestral session as a 1960s-style happening, with guests {{including}} Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, <b>Keith</b> <b>Richards,</b> Brian Jones, Donovan, Pattie Boyd, Michael Nesmith, {{and members of}} the psychedelic design collective The Fool. Overseen by Tony Bramwell of NEMS Enterprises, the event was filmed for use in a projected television special that never materialised. Reflecting the Beatles' taste for experimentation and the avant garde, the orchestra players were asked to wear formal dress and then given a costume piece as a contrast with this attire. This resulted in different players wearing anything from fake noses to fake stick-on nipples. Martin recalled that the lead violinist performed wearing a gorilla paw, while a bassoon player placed a balloon on the end of his instrument.|$|E
