Go home, get your England stuff ready, and I'll call first thing tomorrow...' Even though I was approximately the seventeenth choice, this was still fantastic news... After three disappointing Test appearances, this was my second chance, {{and the opportunity to}} set the record straight... the telephone finally rang. 'Got some bad news, I'm afraid,' David began. 'I couldn't persuade Ted Dexter or Mickey Stewart, so you're not in any more. They've gone for Alan Igglesden. Know anything about him?' With that, David must have known his influence as England captain was over â€“ and indeed Graham Gooch succeeded him after that Test. I felt utterly devastated, and knew I would never play for England again, which had been my main motivating force. So when the Today newspaper offered me the post of cricket correspondent the following summer, it was an easy decision to make. I might have been only thirty, which was no age to retire from professional cricket, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> have played for another five years. But it was definitely time to move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Karnofskys {{took him}} in and treated him like family; knowing he lived without a father, they fed and nurtured him. He later wrote a memoir of his {{relationship}} with the Karnofskys, Louis Armstrong + the Jewish Family in New Orleans, La., the Year of 1907. In it he described his discovery that this family was also subject to discrimination by [...] "other white folks" [...] who felt that they were better than Jews: [...] "I was only seven years old but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> see the ungodly treatment that the White Folks were handing the poor Jewish family whom I worked for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing in the Sunday Express on 30 December 2007, Marshall Julius {{described}} the 2007 Christmas special as [...] "so cosy and old-fashioned that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> have dismissed {{it with a}} cynical wave". However, he says he found himself enjoying it [...] "about halfway through" [...] and said [...] "it was a real pleasure to see Peter Bowles and Penelope Keith, for both of whom I feel great affection, once again sparring on the small screen". Julius finished his review by commenting [...] "Not that I'm saying I'd like {{a whole series of}} it but as a one-off event it was surprisingly welcome".|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's Patrick Joynt's main {{criticism}} {{concerned the}} lack of character development: [...] "Rogue Galaxy looks great and is technically stunning. It's packed utterly full of the standbys of the genre - combat, exploration, personalization, and sub-games that are too huge to be called [...] "mini-games" [...] - which are all executed well, but [...] the characters themselves seem entirely secondary to the matter at hand [...] they're as engaging as cardboard cutouts, largely because they're so predictable." [...] However, he praised the range of mini-games and side-quests, and the overall size of the game. He concluded, [...] "Rogue Galaxys greatest triumph, the brightest gleam in its eye, is that at sixty hours of play I've got another sixty <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> pour in." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It wasn't {{the trouble}} of writing that {{prevented}} me; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> as <b>easily</b> have written you four pages as one. But my silence was an intention," [...] Isabel said. [...] "I thought it the best thing." ...|$|R
60|$|What the {{destitute}} {{subject of}} such an offer tried to say, I need not repeat. What she did say, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> more <b>easily</b> tell, if it were worth the telling. What she felt, and will feel to her dying hour, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never relate.|$|R

60|$|The Rev. Mr. Worden gave a loud hem--placed {{his arms}} akimbo--and seemed {{determined}} to brazen it out; though, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> perceive, {{that he felt}} excessively awkward.|$|E

6000|$|As I {{passed up}} one street and down another, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not help but}} look about me with great curiosity. If Chicago was not New York, it was [...] "next door" [...] to it, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>easily</b> spent the entire day in sightseeing.|$|R
6000|$|Emily {{looked at}} him in alarm. He went on without {{appearing}} to notice that he had startled her. [...] "I wish to God <b>I</b> <b>could</b> as <b>easily</b> put a stop to the mad project which you are contemplating." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah! {{the other}} man--?" [...] asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but {{impressed}} none the less, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> see, by {{the precision of}} the other's manner.|$|E
60|$|That {{explanation}} was clear enough, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> understand why John Stumpy {{had come to}} Darbyville, {{and how it was}} the merchant had treated him with so much consideration.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, that's it, is it?" [...] he cried. [...] "Why didn't {{you say so}} before? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>easily</b> explained. We are {{not coming}} by the same route; but we'll pick up their trail {{sometime}} today, even if we don't overtake them." ...|$|R

6000|$|She was all logic now, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> see, {{between my}} light and my darkness, {{how she would}} remain so. Yet I was scarce satisfied. [...] "And it's only on 'that effect'----?" ...|$|E
60|$|Anneke now smiled, and {{glancing at}} {{me at the}} same instant, a bright blush suffused her face, though the meaning of my eye, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> see, {{strongly}} tempted her to laugh.|$|E
