Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had <b>in</b> <b>transforming</b> the boost mechanic and shifting the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented the system by presenting more opportunities to perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it to be far ahead of anything that had been done before.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{years as}} a political hostage in Thebes, PhilipII sought to imitate the Greek example of martial exercises and the issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, and succeeded <b>in</b> <b>transforming</b> the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained, professional army. PhilipII adopted some of the military tactics of his enemies, such as the embolon (flying wedge) cavalry formation of the Scythians. His infantry wielded peltai shields that replaced the earlier hoplon-style shield, were equipped with protective helmets, greaves, and either cuirass breastplates or kotthybos stomach bands, and armed with sarissa pikes and a dagger as a secondary weapon. The elite hypaspistai infantry, composed of handpicked men {{from the ranks of}} the pezhetairoi, were formed during the reign of PhilipII and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great. PhilipII was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (somatophylakes).|$|E

Furthermore, Sanctus has used Agnus' research to summon an army of demons to attack Fortuna, while simultaneously awakening a long dormant weapon called The Savior (a giant colossus made in Sparda's image) to destroy the threat; posing as the second coming of Sparda in order to eliminate non-believers, and strengthen his congregation’s worship.|$|E

40|$|The chicken anemia virus protein Apoptin {{selectively}} induces apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> cells {{while leaving}} normal cells intact. This selectivity {{is thought to}} be largely due to cell type-specific localization: Apoptin is cytoplasmic in primary cells and nuclear <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> cells. The basis of Apoptin cell type-specific localization and activity remains to be determined. Here we show that Apoptin is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein whose localization is mediated by an N-terminal nuclear export signal (NES) and a C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS). Both signals are required for cell type-specific localization, since Apoptin fragments containing either the NES or the NLS fail to differentially localize <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> and primary cells. Significantly, cell type-specific localization can be conferred in trans by coexpression of the two separate fragments, which interact through an Apoptin multimerization domain. We have previously shown that Apoptin interacts with the APC 1 subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), resulting in G 2 /M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> cells. We found that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity is critical for efficient APC 1 association and induction of apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> cells. Interestingly, both Apoptin multimerization and APC 1 interaction are mediated by domains that overlap with the NES and NLS sequences, respectively. Apoptin expression <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> cells induces the formation of PML nuclear bodies and recruits APC/C to these subnuclear structures.

5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey <b>in</b> <b>transforming</b> Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating {{creature}} {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E
5|$|Under Antemoro Zafikasimambo leadership, the commoners' {{freedom was}} {{significantly}} reduced and religion became a central feature {{of social and}} political life. The conflict between the Antemoro and Zafiraminia nobles and the resulting Zafikasimambo rule also established a tradition of emigration from this part of the island. Unlike the majority of Malagasy who generally seek to return to their ancestral land, the Antemoro initially felt no such call to remain linked to a geographic area. As a result, the ombiasy of the Antemoro traveled widely, some moving from place to place and others settling permanently at royal courts and elsewhere. Their arcane knowledge of writing, medicine, technology and other areas both established their reputation as indispensable advisers to nobles and commoners alike, and instilled the island-wide feature of the community astrologer who shapes daily life. The ombiasy of Matitana were According to historian Bethwell Ogot, the network of stationary and itinerant Antemoro ombiasy were key <b>in</b> <b>transforming</b> the societies of Madagascar from an amalgam of insular clans to outward looking communities with greater awareness of others, leading to territorial expansion and larger, more complex kingdoms.

40|$|We report {{here that}} the higher levels of calmodulin <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> chicken embryo {{fibroblasts}} are due {{to an increase in}} the rate of synthesis of calmodulin that results from an increased amount of calmodulin-specific mRNA <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> cells. Transformation of several types of eucaryotic cells by oncogenic viruses results in a two- to threefold increase in the intracellular levels of calmodulin. We used the normal chicken embryo fibroblast and its Rous sarcoma virus-transformed counterpart to examine the biosynthesis of calmodulin. We show that the higher levels of calmodulin found <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> fibroblasts appear to be the consequence of a selective increase in the rate of synthesis of calmodulin above that of total soluble or total cellular protein. A significant difference in the rate of degradation of calmodulin or total protein between transformed and normal cells was not detected. We also examined the mechanism of the increased synthesis rate of calmodulin and show that the levels of calmodulin mRNA are increased <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> fibroblasts as measured by both translational activity and hybridization to a calmodulin cDNA probe. It is suggested by these data that the higher levels of calmodulin <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> cells may result from a specific increase in the rate of either calmodulin gene transcription or mRNA processing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nitric oxide (NO) has {{recently}} been shown to mediate apoptosis induction selectively <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> fibroblasts, <b>in</b> contrast to their nontransformed parental cells. Here we show that NO-mediated apoptosis induction <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> fibroblasts {{can be divided into}} two major phases. During phase 1, peroxynitrite is generated by the interaction of extracellular superoxide anions with NO and the intracellular glutathione level is subsequently lowered. This defines the beginning of phase 2, in which NO-mediated signaling depends on intracellular superoxide anions exclusively. The resultant peroxynitrite seems to activate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and thus triggers execution of apoptosis. Experimental depletion of intracellular glutathione causes a drastic decrease in the length of phase 1 <b>in</b> <b>transformed</b> cells and renders nontransformed cells sensitive to NO-mediated apoptosis induction. These findings allow the prediction that eithe...|$|R
