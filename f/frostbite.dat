5|$|However, {{faced with}} overly ambitious {{objectives}} and atrocious weather, the combined operation failed {{to destroy the}} Partisan forces and was called off on 23 January 1942, with the Germans having suffered casualties of 25 dead, 131 wounded, and one missing, as well as around 300 cases of <b>frostbite.</b> The NDH forces lost 50 soldiers killed or seriously wounded. The Germans captured 855 rifles, 22 machine guns and four artillery pieces, along with livestock and draft animals. The Partisans had lost 531 killed and between 1,331 and 1,400 captured, {{in addition to the}} <b>frostbite</b> casualties suffered by the 1st Proletarian Brigade while crossing Mt. Igman. A total of 168 NDH and 104 Italian troops that had been captured by the Partisans were freed during the operation. The Supreme Headquarters entered Foča on 25 January and stayed there for three-and-a-half months.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarians {{reached the}} Kolubara on 16 November and {{launched}} an assault against Serbian defensive positions there the following day. The Serbs managed {{to force the}} Austro-Hungarians back and {{over the course of}} the next five days, the two armies fought a series of battles under heavy rain and snowfall. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, with a large number of soldiers succumbing to <b>frostbite</b> and hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|The Hessian forces lost 22 {{killed in}} action, 83 wounded, and 896 capturedincluding the wounded. The Americans {{suffered}} only two deaths from bare feet causing <b>frostbite</b> and five wounded from battle, including a near-fatal wound to future president James Monroe. Other losses incurred by the Patriots due to exhaustion, exposure, and illness {{in the following}} days may have raised their losses above those of the Hessians.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cytokines provide {{important}} connecting links between immunity, blood clotting, and nonspecific resistance that become altered in local <b>frostbites.</b> The aim of {{study was to}} determine the contents of cytokines in blood of patients with local <b>frostbites</b> at various terms following the lesion. Fifty patients, 17 to 50 years old, with <b>frostbites</b> of extremities (grade II to IV) were under observation. Arterial and venous blood, as well as venous blood from damaged and intact extremities were examined. Cytokine concentrations were determined using ELISA technique. It was shown that blood concentrations of TNFα, IL- 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 8 and IL- 18 reached their maximum at early reactive period of the trauma (a 2. 3 - to 19 -fold increase). IL- 1 β concentration exceeded appropriate control values during all the periods of local <b>frostbites.</b> IL 18 levels were increased at early reactive period of the trauma. IL- 1 β and IL- 8 concentration at pre-reactive period proved to be higher in arterial blood of damaged extremities, than in effluent venous blood. Both during early and late reactive periods, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in effluent blood from damaged extremities were 1. 2 - to 8 -fold higher than in venous blood from intact extremities, whereas IL- 4 levels were 2 - to 5 -fold lower. </p...|$|R

5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused <b>frostbite</b> in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E
5|$|During {{a raid on}} the {{northern}} Italian city of Verona on 12 October 1944, Raw's aircraft was hit by two anti-aircraft shells that destroyed its hydraulics system and an engine, wounded the radio operator and opened 166 holes in the fuselage. Despite this damage, Raw was able to return the B-24 safely to its base. He suffered <b>frostbite</b> to his feet, as damage to the plane's nose caused icy winds to enter the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|On January 18, 1988, Vicki Myron, a {{librarian}} at the Spencer Public Library, discovered an eight-week-old male kitten {{that had been}} left in the library's drop box the previous night. Myron nursed the cat, who was suffering from <b>frostbite,</b> back to health and named him Dewey, after Melvil Dewey, inventor of the Dewey Decimal library classification system. The library decided to keep him as a library cat and his story first received publicity in the Spencer Daily Reporter a week after his discovery.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weeks}} {{extended}} well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities {{to relieve the}} tedium. A permanent lookout was kept {{for the arrival of}} the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from <b>frostbite,</b> and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55minutes, and was a complete success.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) {{also tried to}} break the Chinese {{blockade}} at Hill 1419 on 1 December. Despite being badly reduced by combat, hunger and <b>frostbite,</b> the PVA 59th Division sent in its last five platoons and refused to yield. As night approached, 1/7 finally captured the peak and started to march through the hills {{on the east side}} of the road. Relying on the element of surprise, they managed to destroy several Chinese positions along the road. On the morning of 2 December, a joint attack by Fox Company and 1/7 secured the Toktong Pass, thus opening the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen poses {{a number}} of hazards to human safety, from {{potential}} detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as <b>frostbite)</b> associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its release, Q*bert inspired many other games with similar concepts. The magazines Video Games and Computer Games both commented on the trend with features about Q*bert-like games in 1984. They listed Mr. Cool by Sierra On-Line, <b>Frostbite</b> by Activision, Q-Bopper by Accelerated Software, Juice by Tronix, Quick Step by Imagic, Flip & Flop and Boing by First Star Software, Pharaoh's Pyramid by Master Control Software, Pogo Joe by Screenplay, Rabbit Transit by Starpath, as games which had been inspired by Q*bert. Further titles that {{have been identified as}} Q*bert-like games include J-bird by Orion Software, Cubit by Micromax, and in the UK Pogo by Ocean, Spellbound by Beyond, Hubert by Blaby Computer Games and Vector Hopper by Kristof Tuts.|$|E
5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to <b>frostbite</b> as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E

From December 1915 to August 1919, a total of 41,153 Serbian soldiers were treated. In Tunisian hospitals, 833 soldiers died (typhus, malaria, wounds, hunger and <b>frostbites).</b> In Sidi Abdala, local population helped the Serbs providing food, medicines and nurture. A total of 1,722 people died there.|$|R
5000|$|A very {{negative}} example of Flurbereinigung {{occurred in the}} first half of the 70th at Kaiserstuhl (Baden-Württemberg), when great terraces where created with an inclination in direction to the hillside. The idea was to store water in the area, but heavy rains in the Pentecost week in 1983 leeded to great damage. Moreover due to the inclination of the terraces in springtime (blooming time of the wine) cold air was stored leeding to massive <b>frostbites.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Conditions within blizzards {{often include}} large {{quantities}} of blowing snow and strong winds which may significantly reduce visibility. Reduced viability of personnel on foot may result in extended exposure to the blizzard and increase the chance of becoming lost. The strong winds associated with blizzards create wind chill that can result in <b>frostbites</b> and hypothermia. The strong winds present in blizzards are capable of damaging plants and may cause power outrages, frozen pipes, and cut off fuel lines ...|$|R
5|$|Oil {{from the}} flowers was used against catarrhs, colics and, in Germany, earaches, <b>frostbite,</b> eczema and other {{external}} conditions. Topical application of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, and chilblains, amongst others. Recent studies have found that great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's leaves, in addition to the seeds, have been reported to contain rotenone, although quantities are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment. Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe <b>frostbite,</b> had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could get no nearer than , and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars could see no indications of life.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the work is}} to test and implement modern interactive methods in the field of medical education, namely the method of cooperative groups into the educational process of the Department of General Surgery of SI "DMA MH" and to determine its efficacy by the example of class on the topic "Burns, <b>frostbites,</b> electrical trauma. Diagnosis, first aid, medical treatment”. The method is used to find similarities in different patterns of giving medical care to patients with burns, <b>frostbites</b> and electric trauma. Learning activity is divided into three stages. Stage 1 : the teacher divides the students into four groups and gives a task to each group. Stage 2 : each group announces the results and presents them in the standardized format. After the discussion the proper decision on the common features of the first aid, treatment, and the algorithm of action is made. Stage 3 : the groups share results of the previous clinical experience, sum up, solve situational tasks and tests of level III. The method of co-operative groups allows to increase the motivation of students in the learning process, causes more efficient and thorough acquiring of the material, promotes development of clinical thinking, develops the urge towards collaboration and collective responsibility, favors the development of positive personal qualities of a future professional doctor...|$|R
50|$|At 4:00 PM, {{the unit}} reached {{the summit of}} Umatateba (732m / 2,402 ft), which was only four {{kilometers}} from the first day's objective, Tashiro Hot Spring, but the weather changed suddenly, and they were struck by a severe blizzard. In {{the midst of the}} deep snow and blizzard, the soldiers wandered the northeast slope of the Hakkōda Mountains for several days, with 193 of the 210 men freezing to death en route, and a further six died within two months after rescue. Eight out of 11 survivors had to have limbs amputated due to serious <b>frostbites.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{cold wave}} can cause death and injury to {{livestock}} and wildlife. Exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals, including humans, {{and if a}} cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow, grazing animals {{may be unable to}} reach necessary food and water, and die of hypothermia or starvation. Cold waves often necessitate the purchase of fodder for livestock at considerable cost to farmers. Human populations can be inflicted with <b>frostbites</b> when exposed for extended periods of time to cold and may result in the loss of limbs or damage to internal organs.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} part of October, the British troops with their {{supplies}} and artillery made their way with difficulty up the road to prepare for the siege. When they were all in place the First Bombardment took place, starting on October 17. It had been expected that the bombardment would be effective and that the siege would be short-lived; certainly over before the winter. However, the Russians blew up one of the French magazines and the damage done by British gunfire was soon repaired. The British were running out of ammunition and supplies, winter was approaching and with the onset of bad weather the road became virtually impassable. Supplies were arriving at the crowded port of Balaclava but it was impossible to convey them to the besieging troops who were increasingly suffering from disease, <b>frostbite</b> and malnutrition. Conditions in Balaclava itself were also deteriorating.|$|E

Due to the extreme cold, Beadles was suffering from <b>frostbite</b> and was found floating unconscious in the water {{at the time of}} the evacuation and was subsequently sent to a military hospital in Malta. After recovering he was sent to re-join his regiment, who were now stationed in Palestine. He took part in all three attempts to capture Gaza and the eventual push to take Jerusalem under the command of Edmund Allenby. During the second battle of Gaza, Beadles witnessed the death of his uncle Richard Pearce who was shot in the head while standing next to him. Beadles' brother Ewart was awarded the Military Medal and promoted to the rank of Sergeant for his actions during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company.

When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives.

Many were suffering terribly from <b>frostbites,</b> the cavalry were altogether unable to act, so worn out and enfeebled were the horses. Great numbers of the men could scarce drag themselves along owing to the state of their feet; their shoes and sandals, well enough adapted for sandy plains, were wholly unfitted for traversing rocky precipices, and the greater part of the army was almost barefoot.|$|R
