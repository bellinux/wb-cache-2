5|$|Foraging {{takes place}} {{mostly on the}} ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about. Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by {{dropping}} vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil. Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.|$|E
5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While {{on the small screen}} the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks and tears did not show up on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1955, Steiger {{played an}} obnoxious film tycoon, {{loosely based on}} Columbia boss Harry Cohn, {{opposite}} Jack Palance and Ida Lupino in Robert Aldrich's film noir The Big Knife. Steiger bleached his <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> the part, sought inspiration for the role from Russian actor Vladimir Sokoloff, read {{a book about the}} Treblinka extermination camp to understand his character thoroughly, and visited the perfume department of a store in Beverly Hills, California, to try to understand his character's contempt for women. Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production, and in one scene Palance threw several record albums at Steiger in frustration, feeling {{that he was trying to}} steal the scene. Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in Otto Preminger's The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, alongside Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, at TGS, {{it is time}} {{to renew}} Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) contract, and Jack decides to {{approach}} the matter carefully as Tracy does not need the money he makes on the show. While negotiating Tracy's new contract, Jack mentions this fact, which comes as a shock to Tracy, who had never realized that he could survive financially without the income. After realizing that Tracy has quit the show, Jack {{must find a way to}} bring him back, after Tracy's son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), complains to Jack about how unbearable his father is to have around the house. Meanwhile, in order to get attention for herself, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) decides to cut her <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> charity as a publicity stunt. Jenna makes an appearance on NBC's Today Show, where her haircut will be broadcast. Meredith Vieira asks Jenna's opinion on the news that Tracy has left TGS. At learning this, Jenna bails out on her haircut.|$|E
5|$|Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre had, since 1849, {{designed}} coins {{with various}} visages {{of the goddess}} Liberty, based on a bust, Venus Accroupie, {{he had seen in}} a Philadelphia museum on loan from the Vatican. Although the Liberty as used on the three-cent nickel piece is closest to Longacre's experimental cents of 1857 and quarter eagles of 1860, she resembles most of the Chief Engraver's other depictions of Liberty. On the three-cent piece, she wears a coronet with her name on it, and a ribbon binds her <b>hair.</b> <b>For</b> the reverse, Longacre combined the Roman numeral III as rendered on the silver three-cent piece with the laurel wreath used on the 1859 Indian Head cent reverse. Breen suggested that the similarity of design to other Longacre coins has contributed to the low level of collector interest in the three-cent nickel.|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed long <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that materialistic {{women are more likely}} to want to alter their bodies (Henderson-King 2 ̆ 6 Brooks, 2009). This study focuses specifically on the relationship between materialism and body hair removal. We collected information about the frequency of body <b>hair</b> removal, reasons <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> removal, and materialism (Richins 2 ̆ 6 Dawson, 1992). Findings indicate that males and females do not significantly differ on materialist values. Correlational analyses reveal that for women, materialism is related to frequency of <b>hair</b> removal <b>for</b> several body sites; for men, however, materialism was related to body <b>hair</b> removal <b>for</b> only a single site. Qualitative analyses reveal that men who are more materialistic also report fewer health-related (intrinsic) reasons <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> removal. <b>For</b> women who are more materialistic, analyses reveal that they provide more normative (extrinsic) reasons <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> removal...|$|R

5|$|With Luminous Studio, {{real-time}} {{scenes in}} XV have five million polygons per frame, with character models {{made up of}} about 100,000 polygons each. Character models for XV were constructed with 600 bones, estimated as roughly 10-12 times more than seventh generation hardware. About 150 bones are used for the face, 300 for the hair and clothes, and 150 for the body. For the characters' hair, the team used the same technique as with the characters in Agni's Philosophy. The inner <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> each character uses about 20,000 polygons, five times more than seventh generation hardware. The data capacity for textures is also much greater than before. Each character uses 30 MB of texture data, and ten levels of detail. While seventh-generation games used 50 to 100 MB of texture data for a scene, Final Fantasy XV can use about sixteen times this amount on the PlayStation 4 console. 2048×2048 and 4096×4096 texels are used for the HD textures. For the Microsoft Windows port, Luminous Studio was upgraded using technology from Nvidia.|$|E
25|$|From the mid 80s {{until the}} early 90s, mullets were popular in {{suburban}} and rural areas among working-class men. This contrasted with a conservative look preferred by business professionals, with neatly groomed short <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> men and sleek, straight <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> women. Some men also wore bangs in styles such as regular frontal or side swept bangs {{but they were not}} as big as women or girls bangs. Hairsprays such as AquaNet were also used in excess by fans of glam metal bands such as Poison.|$|E

50|$|In 1944 Brown was {{the first}} woman to have her <b>hair</b> used <b>for</b> {{military}} aircraft bombsights. She saw an advertisement in a Pueblo newspaper in 1943 that said the government was looking <b>for</b> <b>hair</b> from women <b>for</b> the war effort, although no details were given as to how it would be used. The ad said only that they wanted blonde hair that was at least 22 in, and which had not been treated with chemicals or hot irons. The women's <b>hair</b> collection <b>for</b> use as bombsight crosshairs was a clandestine operation even though they found the hair through a newspaper advertisement.|$|R

25|$|Salvation {{is deemed}} to require {{self-sacrifice}} in following the example and commandments of Jesus and suffering is revered. Members {{are encouraged to}} attend meetings and to speak at them. Although the church has roots in the Holiness movement and has inherited some of its features, charismatic elements are suppressed. Other standards include modest dress, not wearing jewelry, long <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> women and short <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> men, not getting piercings, not dying hair, not getting a tattoo, and avoiding activities deemed to be worldly or frivolous (such as smoking, drinking alcohol, watching television, and viewing motion pictures). Standards and practices vary geographically: for example, in some areas fermented wine is used in Sunday meetings, in other areas grape juice is used; in some areas people who have divorced and remarried {{are not allowed to}} participate in meetings, in others they may. The use of television and other mass media is discouraged in some areas, based on the stance of the local workers and overseers. Some requirements have been loosened in recent years in response to criticisms aired on the Internet.|$|E
25|$|A special fine-toothed comb {{that can}} pick out lice is used. For a {{treatment}} with louse comb alone, {{it is recommended}} to comb the <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> an hour to {{an hour and a}} half (depending the length and type of the hair) daily or every second day for 14 days. Wetting the hair especially with water and shampoo or conditioner will facilitate the combing and the removal of lice, eggs and nits.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the scandal}} flappers generated, their look became fashionable in a toned-down form among respectable older women.

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for professional footballers (soccer) and road cyclists to remove leg <b>hair</b> <b>for</b> a number of reasons. In {{the case of a}} crash or tackle, the absence of the leg hair means the injuries (usually road rash or scarring) can be cleaned up more efficiently, and treatment is not impeded. Professional cyclists as well as professional footballers also receive regular leg massages, and the absence of hair reduces the friction and increases their comfort and effectiveness.|$|E
