40|$|Against two extreme {{forms of}} thinking, which have {{influenced}} planning theory, this article argues, {{in the context}} of a looming amount of literature generated in a movement for <b>private</b> <b>planning,</b> that the distinction between <b>private</b> <b>planning</b> and public planning is a valid one, but one in need of tweaking. However, the plan–market dichotomy (i. e. the assumption that state and <b>private</b> <b>planning</b> is mutually exclusive) is fallacious. Informed by the neo-institutional economic assumption of rational decisions and the stance of contractual solutions, it rides on the surge in <b>private</b> <b>planning</b> by proposing a taxonomy of planning that combines two modes of planning with two types of planning agent and discusses their possible interrelationships using some neo-institutional economic reasoning informed by the ideas of Coase. Some pedagogical and theoretical implications are also discussed. postprin...|$|R

40|$|Canada has {{developed}} an extensive private pension system that {{accounts for more than}} half the government assisted resources available for retirement incomes. <b>Private</b> <b>plans</b> in Italy account for {{less than one percent of}} retirement resources, but it has recently provided pension reforms to encourage greater use of these plans. This paper examines these reforms in light of Canada’s experience with its <b>private</b> savings <b>plans.</b> In general terms the Canadian plans available to firms and individuals are more integrated with one another than is allowed in Italy, and, as well, the <b>private</b> <b>plans</b> in Italy have less flexibility to address both pre-retirement cash needs and the ability to shift retirement assets between portfolio managers. There are also fewer post retirement options available in Italy. The greater choice and flexibility of Canadian plans are seen as attractive features to savers and further Italian reforms that provide these characteristics to retirement savings plans should lead to more rapid growth in Italian <b>private</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R

To monitor program performance, we examine MA enrollment trends, plan availability for the coming year, and payments for MA plan enrollees relative to spending for fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries.

In addition this year, we describe {{the changes in the}} MA payment system that are being phased in {{as a result of the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) and suggest a technical adjustment to the benchmark formula. The MA program allows Medicare beneficiaries to receive benefits from <b>private</b> <b>plans</b> rather than from the traditional FFS Medicare program. The Commission supports <b>private</b> <b>plans</b> in the Medicare program; beneficiaries should be able to choose between the traditional FFS Medicare program and the alternative delivery systems that <b>private</b> <b>plans</b> can provide. <b>Private</b> <b>plans</b> have greater potential to innovate and to use care management techniques and, if paid appropriately, would have more incentive to do so.

In 2011, the MA program included more than 3, 400 plan options, enrolled more than 12 million beneficiaries, and paid MA plans about $ 124 billion. To monitor program performance, we examine MA enrollment trends, plan availability for the coming year, and payments for MA plan enrollees relative to spending for fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries.

25|$|Critics of Social Security {{claim that}} it gives a low rate of return, {{compared}} to what is obtained through private retirement accounts.

While some advocates of privatization of Social Security point to the Galveston pension plan as a model for Social Security reform, critics point to a GAO report to the House Ways and Means Committee, which indicates that, for low and middle income employees, particularly those with shorter work histories, the outcome may be less favorable.|$|R
