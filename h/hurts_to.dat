500|$|In 1963, Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, and Cherry Smith {{were called}} the Teenagers. They later {{changed the name}} to the Wailing Rudeboys, then to the Wailing Wailers, at which point they were {{discovered}} by record producer Coxsone Dodd, and finally to the Wailers. Their single [...] "Simmer Down" [...] for the Coxsone label became a Jamaican #1 in February 1964 selling an estimated 70,000 copies. The Wailers, now regularly recording for Studio One, found themselves working with established Jamaican musicians such as Ernest Ranglin (arranger [...] "It <b>Hurts</b> <b>To</b> Be Alone"), the keyboardist Jackie Mittoo and saxophonist Roland Alphonso. By 1966, Braithwaite, Kelso, and Smith had left the Wailers, leaving the core trio of Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, and Peter Tosh.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were less}} complimentary. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris wrote, [...] "there are some {{powerful}} and touching moments in 'Sein und Zeit', but others that miss the mark so widely that it <b>hurts</b> <b>to</b> think what this episode might have been." [...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com, although complimentary towards {{the focus on}} Samantha Mulder, was critical of the slowness of the episode, writing, [...] "While the series' reversion to its central theme is much appreciated, this episode unfolds with an unfortunate slowness that does little to satisfy the seven-year itch many X-Files viewers have come to feel in response to monster-of-the-week episodes and phony-baloney mythology cliffhangers." ...|$|E

500|$|Betty Buckley also sang her own songs, one of which, [...] "Over You", {{written by}} Austin Roberts and Bobby Hart, was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award. Although Buckley performed it in the film, country singer Lane Brody was chosen to record it for radio release, and Mac Davis later sang it at the 1984 Academy Awards ceremony.

500|$|The {{song was}} met with a polarised {{response}} from critics. PopMatters felt that the song [...] "comes close to sounding too safe, almost like the band is on autopilot." [...] Several critics felt that the song resembled Coldplay's earlier single [...] "Clocks". MusicOMH commented that [...] "Speed Of Sound, the lead single, has 'Clocks'-like drumming contrasts with synth sequences that remind more of Enya than rock music" [...] and criticised it for sounding [...] "familiar and far older than it is." [...] Pitchfork Media likewise criticised the song's [...] "uncanny resemblance to 'Clocks'" [...] and continued [...] "Certainly, it rarely <b>hurts</b> <b>to</b> stick with what works, {{but this is not}} just a near-exact replica of its successful predecessor; it's also a less memorable song riding a piano hook that has so deeply infiltrated the pop-culture landscape that I've become numb to it." [...] The reviewer did, however, comment that [...] "the track's vocal melody outperforms the one from 'Clocks' by a hair." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of 2001, Dr.Dre focused on {{producing}} songs and albums for other artists.

He produced the single [...] "Family Affair" [...] by R singer Mary J. Blige for her album No More Drama in 2001.

Dr. Dre was the executive producer of Eminem's 2002 release, The Eminem Show.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Marge's mother Jackie is particularly nightmarish in her first real appearance. The final sequence on the rooftop with Lisa and Bart is lovely, and Homer's comment to Marge is a magical wrap-up to a good episode." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the episode [...] "maintained a nicely irreverent tone most of the time— irreverent {{enough to make it}} amusing, at least," [...] and added: [...] "The interaction of the Simpson and Bouvier families at dinner was terrific, and Bart’s experiences on skid row made their point while they still managed to be pointed and clever. 'Bart vs. Thanksgiving' was another winner." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said [...] "Bart vs. Thanksgiving" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Substitute", another season two episode, were the first episodes that [...] "asked [...] to truly care about the characters, and they work beautifully." [...] Both Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal and Jacobson thought the most memorable line of the episode was Jackie's line to Marge: [...] "I have laryngitis and it <b>hurts</b> <b>to</b> talk, so I'll just say one thing— you never do anything right." [...] A reviewer for DVD.net, on the other hand, thought the best line was Homer's [...] "Oh Lord, be honest– are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?".|$|E

2500|$|To {{make matters}} worse, RCA Victor refused to release his new recording, [...] "It <b>Hurts</b> <b>to</b> Be in Love", {{because he had}} not {{recorded}} at their own studios, as stipulated by his contract. Sedaka attempted another recording of this song in RCA's studios, but the results were unsatisfactory. Howard Greenfield and Helen Miller, the song's co-writers, offered it instead to one of Sedaka's friends, Gene Pitney. Pitney took the existing musical track, replacing Sedaka's lead vocal track with his own. Everything else was Sedaka, including his own arrangement and backing vocals, piano-playing, and usual female backup singers. Pitney {{ended up with a}} No.7 hit for himself and his record label, Musicor, in 1964.|$|E

Their next album was Greatest Hits 2, released in July 1984. [...] Unlike the 1980 Greatest Hits album, this one included two new songs, [...] "Everyday" [...] and [...] "Make My Life With You", both number-one country hits.

2500|$|In early 2007, Sedaka {{signed his}} first {{recording}} contract in {{nearly two decades}} with Razor and Tie Records, a small-but-growing, New York-based independent label with a talent roster that also includes Joan Baez, Vanessa Carlton, Foreigner, Joe Jackson, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The first release was The Definitive Collection, a life-spanning compilation of his hits, along with outtakes and songs previously released but unavailable in CD and/or download format. It debuted in the Top 25 on Billboards Top 200 Albums chart in May 2007, one of the highest-charting albums of his entire career. It also includes It <b>Hurts</b> <b>to</b> Be in Love, Sedaka's version of the Gene Pitney hit which RCA had refused to release in 1964. Best known as a [...] "singles artist," [...] this album chart activity was considered a significant comeback for the veteran entertainer. The last time Sedaka had an album on the Top 200 albums chart was in 1980, with his album In the Pocket – when [...] "Should've Never Let You Go," [...] the 1980 duet with Sedaka and his daughter Dara, was Sedaka's last Top 20 hit on the Hot 100 singles chart.|$|E

[...] In 1972, the Packers had the best pass defense in the NFL. [...] In 1973, the defense lost All-Pro cornerback Willie Buchanon to a broken leg in the sixth game of the season, but still finished as the fifth best pass defense in the NFL. [...] In January 1974, the Packers announced that Doll had resigned [...] "because of personal problems", but it was later revealed that he was fired by Devine due to a personality conflict and disagreements over defensive strategy. [...] On learning of Doll's departure, Willie Buchanon said, [...] "It <b>hurts</b> <b>to</b> get news like this. [...] Not only was he a very good coach, but he was someone who we could relate to and get along with. [...] There aren't many people like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Emperor and Empress both {{decided to}} send Nicholas and George on a nine-month-long trip to Japan in 1890. George would go as a naval cadet and Nicholas to {{complete}} his education by seeing something of the world. Their mother hoped the warm sun and the sea air would improve George's health. They left Gatchina on 4 November 1890. The Empress had never been separated from her sons {{for such a long}} time and she missed them terribly.
