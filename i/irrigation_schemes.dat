25|$|For {{many years}} from the 1950s onwards, vast dams and <b>irrigation</b> <b>schemes</b> were constructed, causing a massive rise in {{water-borne}} infections from schistosomiasis. The detailed specifications laid out in various UN documents since the 1950s could have minimized this problem. <b>Irrigation</b> <b>schemes</b> can be designed to {{make it hard for}} the snails to colonize the water and to reduce the contact with the local population. Even though guidelines on how to design these schemes to minimise the spread of the disease had been published years before, the designers were unaware of them. The dams appear to have reduced the population of the large migratory prawn Macrobrachium. After the construction of fourteen large dams, greater increases in schistosomiasis occurred in the historical habitats of native prawns than in other areas. Further, at the 1986 Diama Dam on the Senegal River, restoring prawns upstream of the dam reduced both snail density and the human schistosomiasis reinfection rate.|$|E

Decentralization, together {{with the development of}} water resources management and irrigation institutions, created a multitude of entities responsible for irrigation investments at the national, regional, and local levels. The National Government has been investing in major irrigation infrastructure, mostly located in the coastal region although it plans to extend its efforts to the highlands as well.

25|$|Due to {{the shift}} of {{agriculture}} from self-supporting production to highly intensified cropland systems {{there has been a}} total investment of the Vietnamese Government of ~125 trillion VND in irrigation infrastructure during the last four decades. The constructions built during that time include approximately 100 large to medium scale hydraulic works. Furthermore, there are more than 8000 other irrigation systems (e.g. reservoirs, weirs, irrigation and drainage gates and pumping stations). The main irrigation form used is paddy field irrigation. Whereas gravity irrigation is widely distributed in the Mekong region, in the Central North and coastal regions (3/5 of total <b>irrigation</b> <b>schemes).</b> Irrigation utilizing pumps (electric or with oil engines) is mainly located in the delta regions (~2/3 of total). The other irrigation forms are informal (non-governmental) systems like small private pumps or small gravity diversions.

The <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheme</b> {{supplies}} the locals with vegetables and other horticultural products. Ngondoma <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Scheme</b> {{was established in}} 1968 by the Government. It is 72 km by road from Kadoma. The initial area of the scheme was 10ha with 12 active farmers, but was extended to 50 ha in the early 1970s. Then in 1979 the area was reduced to 22.5 ha due to water shortages caused by the increasing demand of water at the then Empress Nickel Mine. Nowadays the scheme has over a 100 farmers with quotas ranging between 0.1 and 0.6 ha and the hactarage has since been increased to +44 ha since the closure of Empress Mine. The Scheme is administered by AGRITEX, a Government extension for Agricultural Supervision and technical assistance.An additional 6ha of land has been put under irrigation about 2 km upstream as Ngondoma <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Scheme</b> extension. This came into effect because Empress Nickel Mine closed in 1985 and the water demand reduced reasonably. Water for the scheme comes from Ngondoma Dam on the Ngondoma River. The dam has an estimated capacity of 7.5 million cubic metres of water. The dam is under the Zimbabwe National Water Authority. Water from the dam is conveyed to the <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheme</b> by a free running carnal propelled by gradient because the irrigation is down-stream. The canal is 4.8 km long and delivers to an overnight storage dam inside the <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheme.</b> Unless Empress Nickel Mine reopens, which is very unlikely, the water supply to the <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheme</b> is adequate in all seasons.|$|R
