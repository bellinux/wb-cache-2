25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a <b>double</b> <b>boiler.</b> A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the <b>double</b> <b>boiler</b> of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the Babylonian civilization, around 1200 B.C., two perfumeresses named Tapputi-Belatekallim and -ninu (first half of her name lost) were able to obtain the {{essences}} from plants by using extraction and distillation procedures. If we are to argue chemistry as the use of chemical equipment and processes, then we can identify these two women as the first chemists. Even {{during the time of the}} Egyptian dynasty, women were involved in applied chemistry, such as the making of beer and the preparation of medicinal compounds. A good number of women have been recorded to have made major contributions to alchemy. Many of which lived in Alexandria around the 1st or 2nd centuries AD, where the gnostic tradition led to female contributions being valued. The most famous of the women alchemist, Mary the Jewess, is credited with inventing several chemical instruments, including the <b>double</b> <b>boiler</b> (bain-marie); the improvement or creation of distillation equipment of that time. Such distillation equipment were called kerotakis (simple still) and the tribikos (a complex distillation device).|$|E

2500|$|The {{industrial}} production of soap involves continuous processes, such as continuous addition {{of fat and}} removal of product. Smaller-scale production involves the traditional batch processes. The three variations are the cold process, wherein the reaction takes place substantially at room temperature; the semi-boiled or [...] "hot process," [...] wherein the reaction takes place near the boiling point; and the fully boiled process, wherein the reactants are boiled at least once and the glycerol is recovered. There are several types of semi-boiled hot process methods, the most common being DBHP (<b>Double</b> <b>Boiler</b> Hot Process) and CPHP (Crock Pot Hot Process). Most soapmakers, however, continue to prefer the cold process method. The cold process and hot process (semi-boiled) are the simplest, and are typically used by small artisans and hobbyists producing handmade decorative soaps. The glycerol remains in the soap and the reaction continues for many days after the soap is poured into molds. The glycerol is left during the hot-process method, but at the high temperature employed, the reaction is practically completed in the kettle, before the soap is poured into molds. This simple and quick process is employed in small factories all over the world.|$|E

40|$|Sensory {{evaluation}} of food products {{is a valuable}} means of learning about their characteristics. Consumer taste panels are regularly used to evaluate properties of meat products such as pork loins. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of post-cooking holding time on the taste panel ratings of enhanced pork. The loins used in this project were enhanced with varying percentages (close to 10 %) of solutions containing water, salt, phosphates and natural juices or flavors. The loins came from 10 different suppliers and were served in randomly allotted groups of seven, throughout twenty, one-hour taste panel sessions. The meat was cooked, diced and kept in <b>double</b> <b>boilers</b> in order to maintain a steady temperature of approximately 122 ¬∞ F throughout the duration of the one-hour taste panel. Eight-point hedonic scales were used for juiciness, tenderness, flavor and overall acceptability. The order in which the panelists attended the taste panel throughout the hour was recorded. Significant first-degree interactions between time and tenderness, juiciness, flavor and overall acceptability were found. As expected, the ratings given by the panelists to the meat decreased as post-cooking holding time in the <b>double</b> <b>boilers</b> increased. Empirically, holding time should be minimized and samples should be replaced after no more than 30 minutes. Results showed that current American Meat Science Association (AMSA) guidelines for meat evaluation should be revised whereby samples are cooked while the taste panel is conducted. As such, it is important that proper facilities be used and positive air flow in the panel booths be maintained to minimize any carry-over effects from the aroma of cooking meat...|$|R
