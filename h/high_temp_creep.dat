Haemolymph cation levels increased significantly throughout the feeding period from 1 st to 6 th day in all the three races and showed a significant decrease on 7 th day. Mg 2 + and K+ ions were present at relatively higher levels followed by Ca 2 + and Na+ both in the leaf and larval hemolymph. Among the races, hemolymph cation levels were higher in NB 4 D 2 than CSR 2 and PM. K+ levels of bivoltine races were about 30 % higher than the multivoltine PM. The rates of elimination of cations were least during feeding stage than during non feeding stages resulting in higher cation levels during feeding stage. Despite increased feeding activity during active growth period, the cation levels showed significant drop in silkworm excreta suggesting that the cations are more completely absorbed during growth phase. When larvae were exposed to <b>higher</b> <b>temps.,</b> monovalent cations like Na+ and K+ are hyper-regulated and divalent cations like Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + are hypo-regulated {{in order to prevent}} abnormal rise in the levels of hemolymph osmotic pressure. The lower levels of divalent cations in both hemolymph and excreta in larva hemolymph at <b>higher</b> <b>temps.</b> suggest that the divalent cations are sequestered by intracellular fluids to counteract osmotic desiccation of somatic cells at <b>higher</b> <b>temps.</b> [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R
