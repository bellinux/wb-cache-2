500|$|Only {{members of}} a {{national}} UIAA club are allowed to climb the peak on their own. Other visitors {{have to take a}} certified mountain guide. The two easiest routes, usually up the Velická próba and down the Batizovská próba named after their respective valleys, are protected by chains. Because of an exposed section along the Velická próba and tricky orientation especially on the ridge, both are among the more difficult scrambling routes in the High Tatras, although it's rather climbing, since there are many moments when one must rely on ones hands to hold ones bodyweight. With no snow, guidebooks grade the routes as a II or III climb (UIAA scale) or lower. The total <b>elevation</b> <b>gain</b> is about [...] for those who spend the night at the Sliezsky Dom Hotel or are driven there by a mountain guide, and about [...] for those who hike from Tatranská Polianka.

All of the mountains {{are a part of the}} Rocky Mountains. In the northern and central portions of the forest lie the Absaroka Mountains which were named after the Crow Indian tribe. The majority of the Absaroka Mountains are contained within the forest, with the highest peak being Francs Peak at [...] The peaks of the Absaroka are basaltic in origin, having been the result of volcanic activity estimated to have occurred 50million years ago during the Eocene epoch. The rocks are composed of mostly andesite and breccias deposited for millions of years during volcanic events and are atop more ancient sedimentary rocks that are considered to have economically viable mineral wealth. Gold was mined from the slopes of Francs Peak between the years 1890 and 1915, and the small ghost town of Kirwin remains as a legacy of that period. Major tributaries of the Bighorn River, such as the Shoshone and Greybull Rivers, originate in the Absaroka Mountains. Important passes through the Absarokas include Sylvan Pass, which leads to the eastern entrance of Yellowstone National Park; and Togwotee Pass, which provides access to Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park.|$|E
50|$|The Tajika System also lays {{stress on}} the <b>elevation</b> <b>gained</b> by the aspecting planets. It states that in the circle (of houses) the left aspect {{is said to be}} very strong even as that from the 10th to the 4th, which means a planet in the visible semi-circle is more elevated, and therefore, {{stronger}} than a planet in the invisible semi-circle. Of course, the opposition and square aspects are not always evil.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of thru-hikers (those who hike the entire trail in one trip) hike {{from east to}} west. This choice of direction is preferred partly because snow typically melts {{earlier in the year}} on the eastern portion of the trail than on the higher western portion. In addition, the east-to-west hike allows a thru-hiker to start with more gradual <b>elevation</b> <b>gains</b> and build up to the more rugged terrain of the western portion of the trail in the San Juan Mountains.|$|R
50|$|The total {{distance}} from Josephine Falls is 15 km return and would normally take between 10-12 hours. The vertical <b>elevation</b> <b>gained</b> is around 1500 metres. This area of Queensland records several metres of rain every year, {{so it is}} not unusual for the peak to be covered in cloud. The best time to climb Bartle Frere is during winter when the weather is cooler and likelihood of rain is lower.

50|$|A High mark {{begins when}} a {{snowmobiler}} leaves an established trail and fully accelerates; blazing his/her own trail upward toward {{the summit of}} a snow-covered mountain face, ideally lying at a 30-45% grade. As the terrain gets steeper, the machine's acceleration slows down. At {{the apex of the}} <b>elevation</b> <b>gained,</b> the rider must sharply turn 180 degrees and descend the feature. The height of the arching track left in the snow by a pioneering rider usually sparks competition within members of a rider's party, urging the rest to surpass the height of the original arch, thus initiating a competition. High marks vary in their degrees of difficulty depending on the pitch of a given ascent and conditions of the snow.|$|R
50|$|The <b>elevation</b> <b>gained</b> {{local and}} {{worldwide}} historic significance after Che Guevara {{used it as}} hideout and command center to invade the city in a battle known as Battle of Santa Clara during the Cuban Revolution. With an altitude of 176.6 m, the smallest peak holds the name of Capiro and next to it, with 185.9 and 188.4 meters tall are twin peaks known as Dos Hermanas (Two sisters). A monument commemorating the battle was placed {{at the top of}} the smallest peak. A lookout is located close to it, providing a view of the city, the savanna filled with royal palms and farms.
