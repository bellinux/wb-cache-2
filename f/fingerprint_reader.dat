2500|$|Details about a {{possible}} HTC One successor, codenamed [...] "M8", first leaked in November 2013. Photos posted by a user of the Chinese forum Baidu Tieba revealed a unibody chassis part that also covered {{the edges of the}} device (removing the need for injection molding), and a second hole above the camera on the rear of the device—speculated to be either a <b>fingerprint</b> <b>reader</b> or a second camera. In December 2013, the HTC One Mini was banned from sale in the United Kingdom {{as the result of a}} patent infringement lawsuit by Nokia. While the then-current HTC One was also affected by the ruling, its sales ban was stayed by the court pending an appeal, since the judge indicated that banning HTC One sales would have a negative effect on the company as it prepared a new model, which was assumed to have not infringed the patents, for release in either February or March 2014.|$|E

With the tremendous growth of technology, e-commerce, and business globalization, society implements new methods to try to battle security problems. Technology advances has resulted in a number of inexpensive biometric devices to the marketplace. Two questions surface regarding this devices-are they reliable enough for general usage and will people be willing to use them? This research conducted a repeated design experiment to determine the effectiveness of four inexpensive biometric devices-three <b>fingerprint</b> <b>readers</b> and an iris scanner. Further, a questionnaire was designed to gain insights to the views of subjects using these biometric devices. On average, all the devices performed well for identification purposes-the <b>fingerprint</b> <b>readers</b> performing better than the iris scanner. The questionnaire revealed that most people prefer <b>fingerprint</b> <b>readers</b> over that of iris scanners and that although 60...|$|R
