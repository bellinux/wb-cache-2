40|$|The energy {{intensity}} of modern food systems represents {{a major issue}} in a scenario of decreasing oil resources and increasing population. Beside the use of renewable energy, an increased efficiency in food systems could contribute to reduce fossil fuels dependence. In this sense, food losses and waste (FLW) have crucial consequences on the energy balance. Based on the concept of “embodied energy”, food wastage can be framed as a <b>double</b> <b>waste</b> of energy, both in terms of non-consumed food energy and the inputs used for production. Secondary data regarding direct and indirect energy inputs and FLW have been collected for the Italian food chain to estimate the embodied energy of food waste. Since in 2011 the production and distribution of food implied the use of 822 PJ and 18 Mt of food was discarded, 67 PJ of food energy and 100 PJ of embodied energy were wasted. These figures are equivalent to 12. 2 % of the total nutritional energy output and to 1. 3 % of the final energy use in Italy, respectively. The concept of double energy waste sheds new light on the intertwined relationship between energy and food security, suggesting that appropriate food waste reduction policies could result in a higher food production level and relevant energy savings...|$|E

40|$|The {{nuclear waste}} storage concept {{according}} to the baseline design of the proposed high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain is analyzed. The high-temperature storage concept, in which the emplacement area is heated above the boiling temperature of water, is subject to criticism {{on the basis of}} uncertainties due to nonlinear multiphysics processes in the rock mass and in the storage airspace. The storage environment around the nuclear waste containers is reexamined using a new thermal-hydrologic airflow model. The complex nature of the thermal-hydraulic behavior in a superheated waste repository is described with fewer simplifying assump-tions than those used in the baseline design. The em-placement area in the mountain is described as an open system, in which the air pressure is connected to the barometric pressure through fractures, faults, and par-tially sealed drifts. The cyclic variation of the atmo-spheric pressure that affects the heat and mass transport processes in the near-field rock mass is also modeled. The implications of evaporation into the drift airspace are discussed, and a hypothesis of salt accumulation in the near-field rock mass is established. Model calcula-tion is also presented for a below–boiling temperature storage concept that is easier to predict and has fewer anomalies. The price for a below–boiling temperature storage is the extended preclosure ventilation time pe-riod. However, as demonstrated for a trade-off, it is possible to design a repository with below-boiling tem-peratures and <b>doubled</b> <b>waste</b> inventory at the same time. I...|$|R

Changing these parameters had no impact on the Cu content of the ash, whereas the Pb content depended on the burning temperature and the mixed ratio, and the Zn content was affected by all three parameters.

5000|$|Oakland is {{no longer}} {{measuring}} progress in terms of diversion rates, which allows credits for recycling, population and economic factors, but evaluates waste reduction more ambitiously, in terms of total disposal tonnage. The 90% reduction rate it seeks by 2020 will require Oakland to <b>double</b> the <b>waste</b> reduction it had achieved over the past 15 years. After 2002, when the City adopted the 75% reduction rate goal, Oakland’s Public Works Agency realized that the systems that enabled Oakland to reach a 50% reduction rate would not be sufficient for Oakland to reach a 75% reduction rate. Hence, improving the systems has been a primary focus since 2006, which are outlined in Strategies #2 and #4 of the Strategic Plan. These strategies aim to build an end to incentives to continue disposing in landfills, instead calling for manufacturers {{to take responsibility for}} the products and their materials through the entire duration of product life cycles.|$|R
40|$|Large episodic {{gas release}} events (GREs) in Hanford <b>Double</b> Shell <b>Waste</b> Tanks have been {{considered}} a potentially serious safety hazard since the phenomenon began to be studied in 1990. Prior to 1993, one tank occasionally released a sufficient volume of gas to make the tank headspace flammable. The GREs {{are believed to be}} caused by the mechanism of buoyant displacement. Questions persist as to why some tanks exhibit GREs and others do not. This paper attempts to answer to these questions by considering the physics of buoyant displacements. An overview of the simple yet insightful methods used to predict them are presented. The models give criteria that must be satisfied in order for buoyant displacements to occur. These models are derived from fluid stability theory, mechanics, energy arguments, and bubble transport theory. The models are validated by laboratory scale experiments and by comparison to data from observed gas release events from the waste tanks. Application of the models to some current and planned waste tank activities is presented. These include the current effort to remediate the unexpected level rise in Tank SY- 101 by transfer and back dilutions. Additionally, the initial retrieval activities for Tank AN- 105 will be discussed in light of buoyant displacement GRE potential...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{procedure was}} developed and verified for stabilizing salt produced by an industrial waste incinerator. This procedure is based on salt stabilization {{by means of an}} asphalt binder. Conductivity values and relevant anion contents in leachates of stabilized waste with an asphalt coating were near zero. The pH value of these leachates equaled the pH value of the water used, so that the stabilized waste salt represented inert material, posing no environmental hazard. An unusually significant reduction in the volume of processed salt occurred during stabilization. After compacting under 10. 4 MPa pressure, the volume of test specimens was almost 55 % smaller than the initial salt volume. In practice, this would mean more than a <b>doubling</b> of landfill <b>waste</b> capacity. Volume reduction was successfully explained by means of a mathematical model...|$|R
40|$|Liquid phase {{oxidation}} process using {{chelated iron}} solution {{is among the}} most promising techniques for the hydrogen sulfide removal due to its <b>double</b> advantage of <b>waste</b> minimization and resource recovery. Regeneration of chelated iron is a core reaction in this process. Regeneration of chelated iron in acidic solution is very difficult. In this paper, a novel regeneration of iron citrate in acidic solution by biooxidation of iron-oxidizing bacteria was reported firstly. By using such a process, the influence of iron-oxidizing bacteria on the regeneration rate was investigated. The results demonstrated the regeneration rate with the new technology was increased significantly. The process may contribute to the biooxidation of iron-oxidizing bacteria. Application of this novel process increased the regeneration rate under the optimum conditions, suggesting the iron citrate regeneration process may be a feasible and economical method in application...|$|R
50|$|Cotton was not {{the only}} {{industry}} in the locality, as foundries and engineering factories were required to produce the machinery needed by the mills. The largest of these were those operated by the brothers John Muir Hetherington and Thomas Ridley Hetherington, which were established in 1830.

40|$|The {{ability of}} some plants {{to grow and}} develop in the soils with limited access to oxygen results not so much from the {{biochemical}} differences in their root metabolism, but from the access of oxygen from the aboveground plant parts via internal transport. By the same route, harmful gases (e. g., carbon dioxide and methane) get into the plant from the soil. Their toxic properties are neutralised in the aboveground plant parts or these gases are released into the atmosphere. The {{studies were carried out}} on a peat-muck soil (Eutric Histosol Ã¢Â€Â“ pH in KCl 7. 2, C org. 326 g kgÃ¢Â€Â“ 1). The study plot was divided into three sections (A,B,C), in which three irrigation treatments were applied. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the contribution of a mixture of grasses (with Alopecurus pratensis, Phalaris arundinacea, Festuca pra- tensis as dominant species) to methane transportation via internal routes from the soil irrigated with municipal waste water after the second stage of purification (mechanical and biological treatment) during two flooding cycles.

40|$|A plant, {{designed}} for the thermo-valorisation of tyres, was specifically modified in order to treat Automobile Shredder Residue (ASR). Results from two full-scale combustion experiments, carried out on large ASR feeding lots (thousands of tons) indicate the proposed technology as a potential route to help the fulfilling of impending 95 % reuse and recovery target set by the End of life Vehicle (ELV) Directive (January 2015).

40|$|Issue: There {{are several}} {{areas of the}} country where the market is fairly well {{established}} for wood shavings and/or sawdust as livestock bedding. Sawdust and wood shavings typically compete with straw and newsprint bedding. In some areas, straw is becoming less available as farmers change their planting practices. In some parts of the country, shredded old newspaper bedding is increasingly used in place of straw. Although the supply cost of old newspapers is low at times, it also can be quite high at times, making the viability of this bedding feedstock somewhat conditional. Because most animal bedding sales are made directly between the producer and the user, the costs are considered wholesale rather than retail. The purpose of animal bedding is to supply an absorbent cushion for the animal. The use of wood waste for animal bedding poses the potential concern about contaminants not fully removed from the wood waste. Another concern is that certain wood species may cause severe reactions in some animals. Best Practice: The potential use of wood waste for animal bedding involves the sale of either sawdust or wood shavings as opposed to shredded or ground material originating from operations like hammer-mill grinding. The production of a sawdust or small fines from shredded wood waste can be used in animal bedding. It usually involves <b>double</b> grinding the <b>waste</b> wood in wood hogs with an air-conveying system, which helps drop out the oversized and/or tramp contaminants.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{leachate}} recirculation with cellulase augmentation on {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) biostabilisation and landfill gas production was investigated using batch bioreactors to determine the optimal conditions of moisture content, temperature and nutrients. Experimentation was thereafter scaled-up in 7 L bioreactors. Three conditions were tested including (1) leachate recirculation only, (2) leachate recirculation with enzyme augmentation and (3) no leachate recirculation (control). Cumulative biogas production of the batch tests {{indicated that there was}} little difference between the leachate and control test conditions, producing on average 0. 043 m 3 biogas kg− 1 waste. However the addition of cellulase at 15 × 106 U tonne− 1 <b>waste</b> <b>doubled</b> the biogas production (0. 074 m 3 biogas kg− 1 waste). Similar trend was observed with the bioreactors. Cellulase addition also resulted in the highest COD reduction in both the waste and the leachate samples (47 % and 42 % COD reduction, respectively). In both cases, the quantity of biogas produced was closer to the lower value of theoretical and data-based biogas prediction indicators (0. 05 – 0. 4 m 3 biogas kg− 1 waste). This was likely due to a high concentration of heavy metals present in the leachate, in particular Cr and Mn, which are known to be toxic to methanogens. The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) based on the settings of the study (cellulase concentration of 15 × 106 U tonne− 1 waste) showed that leachate bioaugmentation using cellulase is economically viable, with a net benefit of approximately € 12. 1 million on a 5 Mt mixed waste landfill...|$|R
40|$|Food {{production}} needs to <b>double,</b> with minimum <b>waste,</b> if hunger and poverty {{is to be}} alleviated in South Africa. The condemnation of liver during meat inspection represents a huge waste of a protein food resource. This paper measures the quantity of liver condemned in three abattoirs in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and assesses the causes and the monetary loss associated with these condemnations. A retrospective study (RS) (n = 51 302) involving the use of abattoir slaughter records from 2010 – 2012 and a post-mortem meat inspection (PMMI) (n = 1374) was conducted from July to December 2013. The RS revealed {{the leading cause of}} liver wastage as fasciolosis (5. 95 %, 4. 48 %, and 2. 7 %), fibrosis (2. 74 %, 2. 37 %, and 1. 0 %), and abscessation (1. 11 %, 2. 78 %, and 1. 5 %) for the 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively. During the PMMI, the same factors caused liver condemnation in addition to calcification (8. 3 %, 6. 8 %, and 3. 2 %), Cysticercosis bovis (1. 7 %, 2. 4 %, and 1. 3 %) and improper evisceration (4. 8 %, 12. 4 %, and 27. 1 %) for the abattoirs X, Y, and Z respectively. A total of R 343, 330 (USD 45, 271. 07) was lost due to the condemnation of liver between 2010 and 2012. The further loss of 3290. 4 kg of liver was calculated for the six month in 2013, and its financial value was R 59, 227. 2 (USD 5889. 82).

5000|$|While Russia {{possesses}} vast mineral {{and energy}} wealth, {{this does not}} come without some price both to Russia and to the greater globe. Particularly, oil and gas extraction exacts a heavy cost {{to the health of}} the land and people. Drilling waste water, mud, and sludges are accumulated, annual volumes have been estimated at 1.7 million tons of chemical reagents contaminating 25 million cubic meters of topsoil. Considerable geomechanical disturbances, contamination of soils and water, and multiple increases of contaminated waste water ejected into surface water streams, is a serious problem offsetting Russia's profits from the industry. It has been estimated that between 1991-1999 the volume of contaminated waste waters from the Russian oil industry amounted to 200 million cubic meters. Complete utilization of co-extracted gas in oil extraction does not exceed 80% in Russia, it has been variously estimated that annually 5-17 billion cubic meters of un-utilized gas extracted alongside oil is burnt in [...] "gas torches," [...] with 400,000 tons or more hazardous substances released into the atmosphere from this each year, creating the <b>double</b> impact of <b>wasted</b> resource and negative environmental effect. 560 million tons of methane is estimated to leak annually into the atmosphere from oil and gas extraction, not counting accidental outbursts and pipe breakage. Other valuable industries also have their costs, such as the coal industry's release of vast quantities of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive materials. Also the Russian gold industry, with Russia being the only nation for at least a century with high extraction of gold from placer deposits, and having 4000+ large deposits, inevitably creates problems for the river systems. The associated pollution from using mass explosions in mining also can be a problem.

40|$|Energy {{recovery}} by {{waste incineration}} has a <b>double</b> function as <b>waste</b> treatment method and supplier of electricity and/or heat, thereby linking the systems {{of energy and}} waste management. Both systems are undergoing great changes, mainly due to new regulations. Important regulations within waste management in Sweden are a ban on landfill of combustible waste and organic waste, and a tax on landfill of waste. New waste incineration facilities are being built {{in order to increase}} capacity to meet these demands. The aim of this thesis is to investigate impacts on Swedish district heating systems of increased use of waste as a fuel in economic and environmental terms, the latter mainly by assessing emissions of carbon dioxide. Of importance is the influence of various policy instruments. To highlight the connection between the energy and waste management systems and how these influence each other is another goal, as well as the function of district heating systems as user of various waste heat supplies. An important assumption for this thesis is a deregulated European electricity market, where the marginal power production in the short term is coal condensing power and in the long term natural gas based power, that affects the conditions for combined heat and power in district heating systems. The method used is case studies of three Swedish municipalities that utilise waste in their district heating systems. In two papers, the scope is broadened from the energy utility perspective by comparing the energy efficiency of energy recovery and material recovery of various fractions, and the effect of including external costs for CO 2 as well as SO 2, NOx and particles. The ambition is that the results can be part of the decision making process for energy utilities and for policy makers in the energy sector and waste management. It is economically advantageous to use waste as a fuel in the energy sector and regulations in the waste management sector and high taxes on fossil fuels contribute to profitability. Waste incineration plants are base suppliers of heat because they derive revenue from receiving the waste. Economic conditions for waste incineration are altered with the introduction of a tax on incinerated municipal waste. A conflict may arise between combined heat and power production in district heating systems and waste incineration, since the latter can remove the heat sink for other combined heat and power plants with higher efficiencies. Combined heat and power is the main measure to decrease carbon dioxide emissions in district heating systems on the assumption that locally produced electricity replaces electricity in coal condensing plants. It can be difficult to design policy instruments for waste incineration due to some conflicting goals for waste management and energy systems. Comparing the energy efficiency of material recovery and energy recovery is a way to assess the resource efficiency of waste treatment methods. From that perspective, if there is a district heating system which can utilise the heat, biodegradable waste and cardboard should be energy recovered and plastics and paper material recovered. To put costs on environmental effects, so called external costs, is a way to take these effects into regard in traditional economic calculations, but the method has drawbacks, e. g. the limited range of environmental effects included and uncertainties in the monetary valuation of environmental effects...|$|R
