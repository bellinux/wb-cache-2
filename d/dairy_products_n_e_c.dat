40|$|The {{validity}} of established threshold {{values for the}} analytical authentication (stable isotopes and fatty acids) of organic drinking milk in Germany was determined for more strongly processed organic <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> (<b>n</b> = 56). Milk fat extracted from both soft and semi-hard cheeses, butter, cream, sour cream, buttermilk, yoghurt and low-fat milk always possessed an alpha-linolenic acid (C 18 : 3 w 3) content above the minimum level of 0. 50 % and a stable isotope ratio of carbon (delta 13 C) below the maximum level of - 26. 5 ‰ required for organic milk. Noncompliant results were obtained for whey as well as both Italian ice creams and cheeses. Analyses of German cream cheese and curd lipids revealed that 7 out of 39 samples did not comply with the two thresholds. An additional analysis of delta 13 C in the defatted dry matter showed that these reconstituted products apparently contained a combination of organic skim milk and conventional or imported organic cream. The inherent correlation between delta 13 C in the fat and defatted dry matter indicates their different origins, which may provide evidence of fraud. This study showed that the previous C 18 : 3 w 3 and delta 13 C thresholds are generally applicable to processed <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> from Germany.

40|$|Abstract Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid (CLA), a naturally occurring anticarcinogen found in <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> is an intermediary product of ruminal biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Few data {{exist on the}} CLA content of the human blood plasma. The determination of a "normal" content could help in estimating if a person consumes satisfactory amounts of CLA with the diet and thus takes advantage of its potential beneficial effects on health. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the plasma CLA content of individuals not consuming <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> (group 1, <b>n</b> = 12), individuals consuming normal amounts of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> (group 2, <b>n</b> = 77) and individuals consuming CLA supplement (group 3, n = 12). The only CLA isomer that presented higher percentage than the detection limit (0. 03 % of total fatty acids) was rumenic acid (cis 9, trans 11 -octadecadienoic acid). An interesting finding is that compared to the other two groups, group 3 members show the highest average plasma content in rumenic acid, i. e. 0. 20 % of total fatty acids. The present study could be characterized as the first step in the direction of establishing a normal CLA content of human plasma. Based on these results, it could be suggested that the lower limit of the plasma CLA content is approximately 0. 1 % of total fatty acids. </p...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: Since the available studies were conducted using very high levels of Ca supplementation or on subjects fed Ca lacking diet, we studied the role of Ca from dairy foods on subjects receiving ipo-caloric diet, with Ca content adequate to the requirements. METHODOLOGY: 40 pre-menopausal, women nursed for their obesity and eating or not dairy foods, were recruited for the study. They received ipo-caloric diets, with Ca equal to requirements.

New Zealand and Australia are the most important suppliers to Thailand dairy import market. Both countries together contribute more than 50 percent to Thailand total dairy import market. In 2005, Thailand signed free trade agreements with Australia (Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement: TAFTA) and New Zealand (Thailand-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership: THNZCEP). Both agreements include tariff liberalisation in <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> which directly affect Thai {{dairy industry}}. It is debatable whether both agreements create or divert resource allocation efficiency for Thailand dairy production. This study assessed the welfare impacts of the implementation of THNZCEP and TAFTA. The modified gravity model was employed to assess trade creation and trade diversion effects of both agreements in seven <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> categories: non-concentrated milk and cream, concentrated milk and cream, buttermilk and yogurt, whey, butter, cheese and curd and total <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> The modified gravity model for each <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> was estimated by pooling the data from 1991 :Q 1 - 2009 :Q 4 across Thailand top five trading partners using Time Series and Cross Sections (TSCS) estimation. In addition, the study employed the import price model to examine effects of the Thailand tariff reduction for New Zealand and Australian <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> on the prices of New Zealand and Australian <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> and the relative price of non-FTA member to New Zealand (Australian) <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in Thailand market.

In addition, it is found that the reduction in tariffs for <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> from New Zealand and Australia has negligible effects on the Thailand import prices of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> from both countries while other factors such as exchange rate, competitor price, and drought have significantly larger effects. Furthermore, the reduction in tariffs for <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> from New Zealand and Australia significantly increases the ratio of non-FTA member to New Zealand (Australian) prices in some <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in Thailand market.

The review begins with a brief discussion on the different terms used for specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Followed by the introduction is history of the dairy industry and its growth and change over many, many years. <b>Dairy</b> <b>products</b> have been around longer than they have actually been recorded. As the population increased so did the production of <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> In 1850, the production of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in American was larger than any other country. The first major increase in the distribution and consumption of milk happened from approximately 1870 - 1950. With the development of the centrifugal cream separator by Alfred de Laval, and soon after the factory system of production was established. With the big industrial push came the escalated production of commodity products produced in a large scale by machinery. In the past few decades the United States consumers have been pushing away from the commodity dairy processing industry and are interested in the smaller scale specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Many more <b>dairy</b> producers and processors have been converting over to either shipping their milk to processors to make specialty products or use their own milk to produce artisan and farmstead <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Some of the specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> produced are a variety of different cheeses, yogurt, butter, and bottled milk. Specialty cheese is by far produced on the largest scale compared to any other <b>dairy</b> <b>product.</b> Specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> especially specialty and artisan cheese, have increased production substantially in the last few decades. The production of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> has grown due to various factors. According to the California Milk Advisory Board, specialty cheese consumption has increased five times faster than the total cheese consumption in the past ten years. In 2003, the CMAB recorded that the United States specialty cheese production totaled 815 million pounds with an estimated value of $ 6. 4 billion. Recently, the specialty cheese category in the dairy industry is a major factor driving the sales of United States cheese production. The specialty dairy industry is growing due to many different areas. Some reasons of the growth of the specialty cheese market are: that Americans are wanting more variety and flavor in their food, Americans are traveling abroad and wanting the unique flavor of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> that they have had in other countries, the growth of ethnic groups and their ethnic food, and the greater availability to a variety of different and unique cheeses. Other areas of growth include specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> used in food services, restaurants, farmer’s markets, supermarkets, and ingredients in prepared foods. Although the specialty dairy industry has been increasingly growing over the years a big question is whether it is profitable to an on-farm processor and specialty processor to produce value- added specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> On-farm processing is very difficult to manage because of both the farm and the processing plan, and the expenses that go along with it. Many considerations and evaluations need to be analyzed before making the commitment of producing specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> There is value in the production of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> but many factors and variables need to be considered because, many risk arise in the production of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> also...|$|R
