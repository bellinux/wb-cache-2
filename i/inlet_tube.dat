40|$|Because of the {{precious}} space in modern industry, a prerequisite in optimizing the acoustical performance of mufflers within a compact volume is necessary. To depress the acoustical performance, a multi-chamber muffler hybridized with perfo-rated plug-inlet tubes which may dramatically increase the acoustical performance, is then adopted and optimized under space constraint. In this paper, both the numerical decoupling technique and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm for solving the coupled acoustical problem of perforated plug-inlet tubes and optimizing the muffler shape are used. To appreciate the acoustical {{ability of the}} new mufflers, traditional multi-chamber mufflers with extended <b>inlet</b> <b>tubes</b> have been assessed. Furthermore, noise reductions in broadband and pure tones noise are also introduced. But before the SA operation can be carried out, {{the accuracy of the}} mathematical model has to be checked by experimental data. Results reveal that the maximal STL is precisely located at the desired target tone. In addition, the acoustical performance of mufflers conjugated with perforated plug-inlet tubes is superior to that hybridized with extended <b>inlet</b> <b>tubes.</b> Moreover, the more chambers the mufflers have, the higher acoustical performance they will reach. Consequently, we demonstrate a successful SA application to the muffler design...|$|R
50|$|Solvent-assisted {{ionization}} (SAI) is {{a method}} in which charged droplets are produced by introducing a solution containing analyte into a heated <b>inlet</b> <b>tube</b> of an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer. just as in ESI, desolvation of the charged droplets produces multiply charged analyte ions. Volatile and nonvolatile compounds are analyzed by SAI, and high voltage {{is not required to}} achieve sensitivity comparable to ESI. Application of a voltage to the solution entering the hot inlet through a zero dead volume fitting connected to fused silica tubing produces ESI-like mass spectra, but with higher sensitivity.

In this paper, a swirling gas jet was implemented to assist with laser trepanning for a galvanometer scanned CO 2 laser. The proposed swirling gas jet is based on laser trepanning. This swirling gas jet nozzle was composed of four <b>inlet</b> <b>tubes</b> to produce the flow of the vortex. Then, the plume particles were excluded, and spatter {{on the surface of the}} workpiece decreased. Thus, this approach can mitigate the problem of overcooling. This study manipulated the appropriate parameter settings, which were simulated by computational fluid dynamics software ANSYS CFX. The proposed swirling gas jet can be used with galvanometer-based scanner systems to keep the laser beam from interference by spatter. In addition, a hollow position of the vortex was achieved by using the four <b>inlet</b> <b>tubes,</b> which resulted in pressure asymmetry in the nozzle and velocity distribution on the surface of the workpiece. The experiment verified that the depth of processing could be enhanced by 110 % when trepanning at a scanning speed of 30 mm/s, and that the removal of volume could be enhanced by 71 % in trepanning at a diameter of 1 mm by using a swirl assistant compared with a non-assisted condition. Furthermore, the material removal rate of the swirling jet increases when the machining area of the galvanometer-based scanner is larger...|$|R

The increase of 0.25 points, up from the standard 4.6L compression ratio of 9.35:1 was achieved by a modification to the cylinder heads. The cylinder heads were also modified to improve the airflow {{into and out of the}} combustion chambers. The inlet manifold gasket front valley clamp has been changed to accommodate the heater hose positioning on the bottom front of the Callaway manifold. The ram pipe housing has been modified by shortening the ram pipe tube lengths. The intake runner lengths were tuned to increase both power and torque. The black plastic air <b>inlet</b> <b>tube</b> was replaced with a larger diameter fancy looking carbon fiber <b>inlet</b> <b>tube</b> to match the larger throttle bore in the plenum.

50|$|Ionization at {{atmospheric}} pressure {{often leads to}} a loss of ions during the transfer of the ions from the ambient pressure region to the vacuum of the mass analyzer.

Initial ionization occurs in the sub-{{atmospheric pressure}} region of the heated <b>inlet</b> <b>tube</b> which is directly attached to the vacuum of the mass analyzer and so ion loss is reduced as transfer of the ions does not occur.|$|E

We consider three different groundwater flow velocities of 10 − 6 m s− 1, 10 − 7 m s− 1, and 10 − 8 m s− 1 and vary the flow direction from 0 ° (W direction) to 180 ° (E direction) in steps of 22.5 °.|$|R
2500|$|The {{crankcase}} was an aluminium casting and {{in later}} models contained a fuel mixing chamber. [...] These later versions also used long bolts {{to attach the}} cylinders to the crankcase. [...] The engine used a single, kinked crankweb, coupled to slim but broad connecting rods in order to minimise the axial displacement between the two rows. [...] This was less than in more recent double row radials, the rear face of the front row falling on the centre plane of the back row. The engine was not strictly a radial, as the crankweb geometry slightly offset the centres of the two rows, an arrangement best seen {{from the back of}} the engine, where the superimposed <b>inlet</b> <b>tubes</b> and push-rods of the later engine highlight the cylinder centre lines. Such an offset between cylinder centre line and crankshaft is often termed désaxé.|$|R

50|$|Laserspray inlet {{ionization}} (LSII) is {{a subset}} of MAII and uses a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) method. It was originally called atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization however was renamed as LSII to avoid confusion with MALDI and as it {{was found to be}} a type of inlet ionization. As all inlet ionization techniques, highly multiply charged ions are produced. A nitrogen laser is used to ablate the solid matrix/analyte into the heated <b>inlet</b> <b>tube,</b> the observed ions are generated at the surface of the matrix/analyte and so the laser is not directly involved in the ionization as was originally thought. LSII can determine protein molecular weights and has been found to detect masses of proteins up to 20,000 Da. The sensitivity of LSII, for protein detection, is higher by an order of magnitude compared to ESI.|$|E
50|$|The {{container}} of the Bubblers {{is similar to}} the construction of a gas washing bottle and used for the protected storage of metalorganic compounds to exclude air (oxygen, moisture). The bubbler has a supply pipe and a sampling tube. The <b>inlet</b> <b>tube</b> ends just before the bottom of the tube. In this tube, an inert gas is introduced, which bubbles through the liquid chemical; a solid chemical will sublime. The mixture of the controlled inert gas and the vaporized chemical leaves the cylinder into a downstream reaction vessel. The temperature is controlled by a thermostat, so that a defined, constant steam pressure can be achieved. The supply of the often expensive and sensitive chemical is controlled by the regulated flow of inert gas and the temperature of the bubbler, resulting in a given vapor pressure of the chemical.|$|E
40|$|The {{preferred}} {{cooling process}} for household refrigeration appliances is a vapor compression refrigeration process with a capillary tube as expansion device. The vapor compression refrigeration system requires a phase {{change of the}} refrigerant inside the condenser and evaporator. Through a direct connection of condenser outlet and capillary <b>tube</b> <b>inlet,</b> which is commonly practiced for household refrigeration cycles, the condenser outlet defines directly the refrigerant state at the capillary <b>tube</b> <b>inlet.</b> Due to unsteady operation conditions the refrigerant state can change from subcooled liquid to saturated liquid with partially a vapor phase at the capillary <b>tube</b> <b>inlet.</b> The refrigerant flow inside the capillary tube is either adiabatic or non-adiabatic (by utilizing internal heat exchange). In both cases the refrigerants state changes during the expansion with an increase of vapor quality towards the capillary tube outlet. A variable vapor quality at the capillary <b>tube</b> <b>inlet</b> causes different flow patterns, especially at the capillary tube outlet. These flow patterns change periodically depending on the refrigerant state at the capillary <b>tube</b> <b>inlet.</b> Associated with the periodical changing flow patterns the occurrence of noise effects with the same periodicity and remarkable variations of the sound pressure level can be observed at the capillary tube outlet. Â This paper presents the experimental investigations on the simultaneous occurrence of refrigerant flow patterns and corresponding noise effects at the outlet of a capillary tube installed in a refrigeration test cycle. The discussion of the experimental results leads to an explanation of causal relation between distinguishable flow patterns and corresponding noise effects...|$|R
30|$|Under {{stationary}} conditions, {{the model}} with groundwater flow as advective heat transport is dominant (soil temperature is 10  °C) {{and is on}} average warmer than the one without flow. From the results in Fig.  4, groundwater flow appears to only minutely change the temperature at the inner ring sensors labeled 1 – 8 (see Figs.  1 and 3). However, the inner ring is essential for determining the sensor’s position relative to the BHE tubes. As the double U-tube heat exchanger is asymmetrical, the temperature shift resulting from the BHE layout {{has to be taken}} into account. Depending on the groundwater’s angle of incidence, the distorted temperature distribution differs with the relative position of the <b>inlet</b> <b>tubes</b> and outlet tubes, provided that they have a temperature difference. The influence of groundwater flow on the inner and outer ring temperatures will be discussed in the following section.|$|R

50|$|Matrix-Assisted Ionization MAI {{is similar}} to MALDI in sample preparation, but a laser is not {{required}} to convert analyte molecules included in a matrix compound into gas-phase ions. In MAI, analyte ions have charge states similar to electrospray ionization but obtained from a solid matrix rather than a solvent. No voltage or laser is required, but a laser can be used to obtain spatial resolution for imaging. Matrix-analyte samples are ionized in the vacuum of a mass spectrometer and can be inserted into the vacuum through an atmospheric pressure inlet. Less volatile matrices such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid require a hot <b>inlet</b> <b>tube</b> to produce analyte ions by MAI, but more volatile matrices such as 3-nitrobenzonitrile require no heat, voltage, or laser. Simply introducing the matrix:analyte sample to the inlet aperture of an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer produces abundant ions. Compounds at least as large as bovine serum albumin kDa can be ionized with this method. In this simple, low cost and easy to use ionization method, the inlet to the mass spectrometer can be considered the ion source.|$|E
