5|$|Representative peers were {{introduced}} in 1707, when the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> England and the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Scotland were united into the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain. At the time, there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers. The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently {{the election of a}} small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated.

5|$|The <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> England—which after 1535 {{included}} Wales—ceased being {{a separate}} sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union {{put into effect}} the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Scotland to create the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain. In 1801, Great Britain was united with the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being renamed the United <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain and Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Before 1707, the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Scotland was a {{sovereign}} independent state {{which had its}} own legislature—the Parliament of Scotland—which met, latterly, at Parliament House on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Treaty of Union, signed in 1707, created an incorporating political union between the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Scots and the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> England. The two previous Acts of Union (one for the British Parliament {{and one for the}} Parliament of Scotland) had dissolved the previous parliaments. The Treaty of Union created the Parliament of Great Britain which was housed in the Palace of Westminster in London. As a consequence, Scotland was directly governed from London for the next 292 years without a legislature or a Parliament building of its own.|$|E
5|$|Between the Humber and Forth the English {{had formed}} into two main kingdoms, Deira and Bernicia, often united as the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Northumbria.

A native British kingdom, later called the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Strathclyde, survived {{as an independent}} power into the 10th century in the area which became modern-day Dunbartonshire and Clydesdale. To the north-west of Strathclyde lay the Gaelic <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Dál Riata, and to the north-east {{a small number of}} Pictish kingdoms. Further north still lay the great Pictish <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Fortriu, which after the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 came to be the strongest power in the northern half of Britain. The Irish had always had contacts {{with the rest of the}} British Isles, and during the early 6th century they immigrated from the island of Ireland to form the <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Dál Riata, although exactly how much conquest took place is a matter of dispute with historians.
