5|$|The Spinozistic {{conception}} of a conatus was a historical precursor to modern theories of autopoiesis in biological systems. In systems theory and the sciences in general, {{the concept of a}} conatus {{may be related to the}} phenomenon of emergence, whereby complex systems may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's conatus principle; however, the scope of the idea <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.|$|E
5|$|Aden meets Cassie and flirts with her. He {{ensures that}} her {{previous}} relationship with Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> over, then asks Cassie out. Her acceptance makes Ric jealous, so {{during a game}} of rugby, he tackles Aden so hard that he is knocked unconscious and hospitalised. Aden's brother Sean (Gabriel Egan) attacks Ric in retaliation, and when Aden recovers, he gives Sean a false alibi. Cassie discovers the truth and breaks up with him. Aden next appears as a rival of Geoff's on the school football team. Annoyed that PE teacher Tony Holden (Jon Sivewright) favours Geoff, Aden spikes Geoff's drink and locks him in the boot of Tony's car. Tony throws Aden off the team, so Aden vandalises Geoff's grandfather's farm, and bullies Geoff and his younger sister Annie (Charlotte Best).|$|E

25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|It {{is quickly}} {{revealed}} that Ella <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> {{not what she}} seems. She is 445 years old and the daughter of John Dee. Ella is also a witch and has been hunting Azazeal for centuries. So far, she has been very successful in preventing Azazeal from begetting a son by a mortal witch. This time, however, Ella was too late. Her mission: kill Malachi.|$|E

25|$|The issues {{involved}} in raw feeding may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi. It {{is interesting to note}} that the Hortaya Borzaya, undoubtedly a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight in itself is nothing to be concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> not recommended.|$|E
25|$|The album titled Mercenary was {{released}} on 8 September 1998 in Europe and on 10 November 1998 in the USA, and features 9 tracks. It is an overall slower album than its predecessors. However, it <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> very heavy and sounds very much like classic Bolt Thrower. Karl also returned to performing his previous style of singing; the hardcore punk influences have disappeared again. After the album recording, Karl left the band again and the band recruited Dave Ingram permanently after he left Benediction.|$|E

25|$|Puppies are {{generally}} vaccinated {{in a series}} of doses, extending from the earliest time that the immunity derived from the mother wears off until after that passive immunity <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> gone. Older puppies (16 weeks or older) are given 3 vaccinations 3 to 4 weeks apart. The duration of immunity of vaccines for CPV2 has been tested for all major vaccine manufacturers in the United States and {{has been found to be}} at least three years after the initial puppy series and a booster 1 year later.|$|E
25|$|Culture <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> beyond {{ethnicity}} and race. Healthcare professionals {{need to learn}} about the tolerance of other's beliefs and remember that the professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with our personal beliefs. Discovering our own beliefs and why we have them (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and actions at time when others are cared firwith different beliefs. As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.|$|E
25|$|Using the Debye model, the {{specific}} heat and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to T3, while the enthalpy and chemical potential are proportional to T4. (Guggenheim, p.111) These quantities drop toward their T=0 limiting values and approach with zero slopes. For {{the specific}} heats at least, the limiting value itself <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> zero, as {{borne out by}} experiments to below 10K. Even the less detailed Einstein model shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of thermal expansion. Maxwell's relations show that various other quantities also vanish. These phenomena were unanticipated.|$|E

25|$|There {{were few}} health care {{facilities}} other than local General Practitioner surgeries within the Municipality of Clarence prior to the Tasman Bridge Disaster. The isolation caused by the severing of the bridge, and the inability of patients to travel across the river for treatment highlighted the need for local health care services on the eastern shore. The Bayfield Healthcare Centre (now known as the Clarence Community Health Centre) was developed at considerable cost to the state government, but soon became the City's primary health care provider. Whilst it <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> not {{large enough to be}} considered a hospital, recent upgrading has seen the centre fall into the super clinic category.|$|E
25|$|Football (French: Le Foot) is {{the most}} popular sport in France. Other popular sports played in France are rugby union, cycling, tennis, handball, {{basketball}} and sailing. France is notable for holding and winning the FIFA World Cup in 1998, and holding the annual cycling race Tour de France, and the tennis Grand Slam tournament the French Open. Sport is encouraged in school, and local sports clubs receive financial support from the local governments. While football <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> the most popular, rugby union and rugby league takes dominance in the southwest, especially around the city of Toulouse (see: Rugby union in France and Rugby league in France).|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} Quaestiones <b>is</b> <b>{{definitely}}</b> after 8 July 1661, {{the date on}} which Newton arrived in Trinity College. It is also definitely before 9 December 1664, on which day (and the following) he made notes of his observations of a comet. Other datings of the first entries are based on his handwriting— which changed drastically between the early notes of 1661 and later notes which can be dated independently to 1665. The transitional handwriting which characterises the early parts of Quaestiones can only be independently dated to roughly 1664. It is interesting that this was written during a period when Newton was actively developing the notion of calculus, but mathematics made no real appearance in this notebook.|$|E
