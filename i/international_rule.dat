For example, a yacht designed under the First <b>International</b> <b>Rule</b> would have a wooden mast, gaff rig, and sails made of cotton; whereas yachts designed under the Third <b>International</b> <b>Rule,</b> such as Vim, had a metal mast, Bermuda rig, and sails made from Dacron.|$|E

25|$|Under the UN Partition Plan, Jerusalem was to {{be placed}} under <b>international</b> <b>rule</b> in a corpus separatum. Fighting {{nevertheless}} immediately {{broke out in the}} city between Jewish and Arab militias, with bombings and attacks by both sides. Starting in February 1948, Arab militia under Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni blockaded the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, preventing the supply of the Jewish population. This blockade was broken in mid-April by Operation Nachshon and Operation Maccabee. On 14 May and the following days, Etzioni and Harel brigades supported by Irgun troops launched several operations aiming to take over the Arab side of the city. In the meantime, the Arab Legion had deployed in the area of Palestine dedicated to the Arab state, not entering the Corpus separatum but massively garrisoning Latrun to blockade the Jewish city once again. Israeli victories against the Arab militias in the city pushed Abdallah of Jordan to order the Arab Legion to intervene. It deployed in East Jerusalem, fought the Israelis and took the Jewish quarter of the Old City. The population was expelled and the fighters taken prisoners to Jordan. The Israeli forces launched three assaults on Latrun to free the road to the city but without success. Israeli forces built an alternative road to Jerusalem before the truce imposed by UN on 11 June, breaking the blockade. During the period called the First Truce the Jewish city was supplied with food, ammunition, weapons and troops. Fighting didn't resume during the remaining months of the 1948 war. The city was split between Israel and Jordan after the war, Israel ruling West Jerusalem and Jordan ruling East Jerusalem with the Old City.|$|E

2500|$|The {{creation}} of the International Yacht Racing Union and the <b>International</b> <b>Rule</b> in 1907 provided a big boost to yacht building {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, and prior to World War I, the British yachting fleet had grown to around 3,900. [...] The emergence of a group of talented Clyde yacht designers such as William Fife III, George Lennox Watson, Alfred Mylne, James McGruer and David Boyd in the first half of the 20th century firmly established the pre-eminent position of Clyde yachts on the high seas. The River Clyde became, like Cowes and Kiel, a centre for yachting.|$|E
2500|$|The 12 Metre {{class is}} a rating class for racing sailboats that are {{designed}} to the <b>International</b> <b>rule.</b> It enables fair competition between boats that rate in the class whilst retaining the freedom to experiment with the details of their designs. The designation [...] "12 Metre" [...] does not refer to any single measurement on the boat, and is not referencing the vessels overall length, rather, measures the sum of the components directed by the formula which governs design and construction parameters. Typically 12 Metre class boats range from 65 to 75 feet (about 20 to 23 m) in length overall; they are most often sloop-rigged, with masts roughly 85 feet (26 m) tall.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable and {{influential}} precedent for universal jurisdiction were the mid-20th century Nuremberg Trials. U.S. Justice Robert H.

Indeed, one charge was Nazi law itself became a crime, law distorted into a bludgeon of oppression. The Nuremberg trials supposed universal standards by which one nation's laws, and acts of its officials, can be judged; an <b>international</b> <b>rule</b> of law unbound by national borders.|$|E

The series is played close to annually in October or November {{after the completion of}} the AFL Grand Final and the All-Ireland Football Final which are both traditionally played in late September. The matches are played using a set of compromise rules decided upon by both the two governing bodies; known formally as <b>international</b> <b>rules</b> football. While the <b>International</b> <b>Rules</b> Series matches use some rules from Australian rules football, the field, ball and uniforms of both teams are all from Gaelic football.|$|R

2500|$|The largest {{governing}} {{body for the}} sport is the Women's Flat Track Derby Association, with 397 Full Member Leagues, and 48 Apprentice Leagues. Other associations support either coed or men-only derby; {{among them is the}} largest organization supporting the growing trend of male roller derby, MRDA. Within the United States, roller derby played by those under 18 is governed by the Junior Roller Derby Association, which uses the widely used rule set of the WFTDA, with modifications for players who are minors (such as no hitting, or accelerating into a block). Outside of the United States many roller derby leagues enjoy support from their national skate federations such as the Skate Australia, the British Roller Sports Federation, and Roller Sports Canada. In Europe, roller derby otherwise received recognition as a legitimate sport by the Federation Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS) in Paris in 2010; this organization reports directly to the International Olympic Committee. As of 2017 FIRS has been accepted as the <b>international</b> <b>rule</b> set by the International Olympic Committee. USA Roller Sports (USARS) is recognized by the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS) and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) as the National Governing Body of competitive roller sports in the United States, including speed, figure, hockey, roller derby and slalom. Under FIRS rule set, teams will be competing at The World Roller Games 2017 in Nanjing, China. Although affiliation with a national organization has been declined by some American leagues who prefer governance on a grass roots level, the WFTDA and USARS maintain a [...] reciprocity agreement for insurance purposes. The former Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association worked with the American federation.|$|E
