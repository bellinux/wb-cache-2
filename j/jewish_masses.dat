25|$|Critics of Hasidic Judaism {{expressed}} concern that Hasidism might become a messianic sect as had occurred among the followers of both Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank. However The Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, {{came at a time}} when the <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> of Eastern Europe were reeling in bewilderment and disappointment engendered by the two Jewish false messiahs Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and Jacob Frank (1726–1791) in particular.|$|E
25|$|Hasidic Judaism {{was founded}} by Israel ben Eliezer (1700–1760), {{also known as the}} Baal Shem Tov. His disciples {{attracted}} many followers among Ashkenazi Jews, and established numerous Hasidic groups across Europe. The Baal Shem Tov came {{at a time when the}} <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> of Eastern Europe were reeling in bewilderment and disappointment engendered by the two notorious Jewish false messiahs, Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and Jacob Frank (1726–1791), and their respective followers. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{spiritual and}} mystical yearnings of many Jews {{remained}} frustrated {{after the death}} of Isaac Luria and his disciples and colleagues. No hope was in sight for many following the devastation and mass killings of the pogroms that followed {{in the wake of the}} Chmielnicki Uprising (1648–1654), the largest single massacre of Jews until the Holocaust, and it was at this time that a controversial scholar by the name of Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) captured the hearts and minds of the <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> of that time with the promise of a newly minted messianic Millennialism in the form of his own personage.|$|E

50|$|According to the German {{translation}} of the complete works of Stalin, Stalin Werke, published in East Berlin in 1950, Zionism was a 'reactionary nationalistic movement that had its followers among the Jewish bourgeoisie, the intellectual elite and the backward strata of the <b>Jewish</b> <b>mass</b> of workers. The Zionists strove for {{the isolation of the}} <b>Jewish</b> <b>mass</b> of workers from the collective struggle of the proletariat.|$|R

25|$|During {{the last}} decade of Schneersohn's life, from 1940 to 1950, he settled in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn in New York City. Schneersohn was already {{physically}} weak and ill from his suffering {{at the hands of the}} Communists and the Nazis, but he had a strong vision of rebuilding Orthodox Judaism in America, and he wanted his movement to spearhead it. In order to do so, he went on a building campaign to establish religious Jewish day schools and yeshivas for boys and girls, women and men. He established printing houses for the voluminous writings and publications of his movement, and started the process of spreading Jewish observance to the <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Many European Jewish fathers {{during the}} nineteenth century chose not to circumcise their sons, {{including}} Theodor Herzl. However, unlike many other forms of religious observance, it remained one of the last rituals Jewish communities could enforce. In most of Europe, both the government and the unlearned <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> believed circumcision to be a rite akin to baptism, and the law allowed communities not to register uncircumcised children as Jewish. This legal maneuver spurred several debates addressing the advisibility of its use, since many parents later chose to convert to Christianity. In early 20th-century Russia, Chaim Soloveitchik advised his colleagues to reject this measure, stating that uncircumcised Jewish males are no less Jewish than Jews who violate other commandments.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} most {{prominent}} was the popularization of the mystical lore of Kabbalah. For several centuries an esoteric teaching practiced surreptitiously only by a narrow stratum of the highly learned, it was transformed into almost household knowledge by a mass of cheap pamphlets printed by both Jewish and Christian publishers {{from the beginning of}} the century. The kabbalistic inundation was a major influence behind the rise of the heretical Sabbatean movement, led by Sabbatai Zevi, who declared himself Messiah in 1665. The propagation of Kabbalah made the <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> susceptible to Hasidic ideas, themselves in essence a popularized version of the teaching – indeed, Hasidism actually emerged when its founders determined to openly practice it instead of remaining a secret circle of aesthetics as was the manner of almost all past kabbalists. The correlation between publicizing the lore and Sabbateanism did not escape the rabbinic elite, and caused vehement opposition to the new movement.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{antisemitism}} {{prompted a}} wave of a <b>Jewish</b> <b>mass</b> emigration from Germany throughout the 1930s. Among the first wave were intellectuals, politically active individuals, and Zionists. However, as Nazi legislation worsened the Jews' situation, more Jews wished to leave Germany, with a panicked rush {{in the months after}} Kristallnacht in 1938.|$|R

25|$|Apart from that, Reform {{had little}} to no {{influence}} {{in the rest of}} the continent. Radical lay societies sprang in Hungary during the 1848 Revolution but soon dispersed. Only in Germany, commented Steven M. Lowenstein, did the extinction of old Jewish community life lead to the creation of a new, positive religious ideology that advocated principled change. In Western and Central Europe, personal observance disappeared, but the public was not interested in bridging the gap between themselves and the official faith. Secular education for clergy became mandated by mid-century, and yeshivas all closed due to lack of applicants, replaced by modern seminaries; the new academically-trained rabbinate, whether affirming basically traditional doctrines or liberal and influenced by Wissenschaft, was scarcely prone to anything beyond aesthetic modifications and de facto tolerance of the laity's apathy. Further to the east, among the unemancipated and unacculturated <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> in Poland, Romania and Russia, the stimulants that gave rise either to Reform or modernist Orthodoxy were virtually unheard of. The few rich and westernized Jews in cities like Odessa or Warsaw constructed modern synagogues where mild aesthetic reforms, like vernacular sermons or holding the wedding canopy indoors rather than under the sky, were introduced. Regarded as boldly innovative in their environs, these were long since considered trivial even by the most Orthodox in Germany, Bohemia or Moravia. In the east, the belated breakdown of old mores led not to the remodification of religion, but to the formulation of secular conceptions of Jewishness, especially nationalistic ones.|$|E
2500|$|With {{additional}} {{backing from}} the National Liberals, Straucher became a Senate {{candidate in the}} 1932 election, but did not receive the vote. According to McCagg, his last years were spent in a dispute with younger Yiddishist activists [...] "who felt that one could only get through to the <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> by using Yiddish." [...] The aging politician died in 1940, one year into World War II, and several months after the Soviet occupation of Northern Bukovina. He lies buried in the modern-style Straucher family crypt, at the Chernivtsi Israelite Cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|His charisma, mystical teachings that {{included}} repeated pronunciations {{of the holy}} Tetragrammaton in public, tied to an unstable personality, {{and with the help}} of his greatest enthusiast, Nathan of Gaza, convinced the <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> that the Jewish Messiah had finally come. It seemed that the esoteric teachings of Kabbalah had found their [...] "champion" [...] and had triumphed, but this era of Jewish history unravelled when Zevi became an apostate to Judaism by converting to Islam after he was arrested by the Ottoman Sultan and threatened with execution for attempting a plan to conquer the world and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. Unwilling to give up their messianic expectations, a minority of Zvi's Jewish followers converted to Islam along with him.|$|E

2500|$|Cohon and Freehof rose {{against the}} {{background}} of the Great Depression, when many congregations teetered on the threshold of collapse. Growing Antisemitism in Europe led German Liberals on similar paths. Rabbis Leo Baeck, Max Dienemann and Seligmann himself turned to stressing Jewish peoplehood and tradition. The Nazis' takeover in 1933 effected a religious revival in communities long plagued by apathy and assimilation. The great changes convinced the CCAR to adopt a new set of principles. On 29 May 1937, in Columbus, Ohio, a [...] "Declaration of Principles" [...] (eschewing the more formal, binding [...] "platform"), promoted a greater degree of ritual observance, supported Zionism – considered by the Classicists in the past as, at best, a remedy for the unemancipated <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> in Russia and Romania, while they did not regard the Jews as a nation in the modern sense – and opened not with theology but by the statement [...] "Judaism is the historical religious experience of the Jewish people." [...] The Columbus Principles signified the transformation from [...] "Classical" [...] to the [...] "New Reform Judaism", characterized by a lesser focus on abstract concepts and a more positive attitude to practice and traditional elements.|$|E
2500|$|In 1332, King Casimir III the Great (1303–1370) amplified and {{expanded}} Bolesław's old charter with the Wiślicki Statute. Under his reign, streams of Jewish immigrants headed east to Poland and Jewish settlements are first mentioned as existing in Lvov (1356), Sandomierz (1367), and Kazimierz near Kraków (1386). Casimir, who {{according to a}} legend had a Jewish lover named Esterka from Opoczno was especially friendly to the Jews, and his reign is regarded as an era of great prosperity for Polish Jewry, and was nicknamed by his contemporaries [...] "King of the serfs and Jews." [...] Under penalty of death, he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children {{for the purpose of}} enforced Christian baptism. He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. Nevertheless, while for the greater part of Casimir’s reign the Jews of Poland enjoyed tranquility, toward its close they were subjected to persecution on account of the Black Death. In 1348, the first blood libel accusation against Jews in Poland was recorded, and in 1367 the first pogrom took place in Poznań (Posen). Compared with the pitiless destruction of their co-religionists in Western Europe, however, the Polish Jews did not fare badly; and the <b>Jewish</b> <b>masses</b> of Germany fled to the more hospitable cities in Poland.|$|E

After one was blown up by a mine, killing a soldier, the front of each armoured car was fitted with a long bar propelling a pony truck intended to detonate any mine safely without injuring any of the armoured car's occupants.
