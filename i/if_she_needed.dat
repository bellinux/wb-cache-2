5|$|Another American {{victim of}} sexual trafficking, Sheila White, {{describes}} {{an incident in}} 2003 when she was beaten {{up next to the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She says that nobody even asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> help. White eventually escaped from being trafficked and went on to work with GEMS to raise awareness on the issue in New York. In 2012, after the film was released, Barack Obama, President of the United States, recognized White's work and told her story during a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 24, she {{returned}} to Brisbane and continued teaching aerobics, now to classes of hundreds of students. She also continued sewing activewear for herself and on request. Smith enjoyed producing activewear {{so much that she}} decided to give up instructing and make it her full-time occupation. In 1989, the owner of the gym at which she worked offered her space for a studio above the gym, and also casual work as a receptionist <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> extra money. She remembers the space as squalid, full of cockroach droppings that would be dislodged by the vibrations of people jumping around in the building. Her mother lent her money to fund increasing production, and to help her with her rent and costs of living.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Joe McGee, {{writing for}} The Patriot Ledger, {{summarized}} the incident: [...] "At a hairpin turn, {{she went off}} the road. Her car hit a tree. At that point, a person came along who was driving a bus. It was a neighbor. He asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> help. She refused. About 10 minutes later, police showed up to the scene and Maura Murray was gone." ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Monday, February 9, before she left the university campus, she emailed her professors and work supervisor, writing that she was taking a week off due to {{a death in the}} family; this claim could not be corroborated by her family. At 7:27pm, a local woman reported a car accident on a sharp corner of Route 112 adjacent to her home. A passing motorist who also lived nearby stopped at the scene, and asked the woman driving the car <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> assistance; she declined, claiming to have called roadside assistance. Upon arriving home several minutes later, the motorist reported the accident to emergency services. At 7:46pm, law enforcement arrived at the scene, but the woman had disappeared.|$|E
500|$|A single mother, Donna raised Angela {{and her two}} half-sisters {{with the}} help of {{government}} assistance. [...] They lived in a subsidized townhouse in the Flemingdon Park neighbourhood of Toronto. Donna worked as a bookkeeper and at the concession stand of the local arena. She battled depression and mental illness and her eldest daughter, Cindy, worked two part-time jobs at the age of 16 to help the family meet financial obligations. Angela was closest to her sister Kym, though the two [...] often fought as children. Her father never had a consistent place in her life growing up and did not provide financial support to the family, but was available <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> him. [...] As one of few black children in Flemingdon Park, Angela often faced insults, particularly over {{the fact that she was}} a mixed-race child with a white mother and sisters. She often got into fights over the slurs, forming a combative attitude she carried into the game of hockey. Her maternal grandparents never accepted Angela as a child, though they treated her sisters well.|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, during Mercedes' {{hospitalisation}} and recuperation she [...] "starts {{putting it}} on to get sympathy. She's determined to get what she wants". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes did not [...] "feel guilt at all - she just wants Riley back and she'll {{do whatever it takes}} to get him". Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. She thinks she loves Riley and will do what it takes to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her. I want to see what happens when they don't..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once the {{character}} had {{the majority of}} the Borg implants removed, a new costume was required. Ryan wore a silver jumpsuit for the first few episodes, which director Jesús Salvador Treviño said that during the filming of the episode [...] "Day of Honor" [...] caused problems as [...] "almost any camera angle inevitably winds up emphasising her sexuality." [...] Ryan described the new costume as [...] "a little snug", and wore a corset-like item which gave the appearance of mechanical ribs. At least one version of the costume had the corset built into it. In order to give her greater height, the shoes which formed part of her costume had four-inch (10 cm) high heels. She said in a 2012 interview that the suit by costume designer Robert Blackman was a [...] "feat of engineering", but required a 20-minute production shutdown <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to use the toilet, as she needed that time plus assistance to get into and out of it. She said that it was so fitted and figure hugging that [...] "it may have well been bodypaint".|$|E
60|$|Rose obeyed {{and went}} glibly down a page, doing {{her best to}} give the sense in her purest English. Presently she went more slowly, then skipped a {{sentence}} here and there, and finally stopped short, looking as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> a screen again.|$|E

6000|$|... "I know you, little maid, and I'm {{glad you}} came here, for I can show you a charming house for the winter. I heard you tell a field-mouse how lonely you were, and I saw tears {{dropping}} just now as you sat here thinking you had not {{a friend in the}} world," [...] said Dart, as he nodded at her and kindly cracked a chestnut to follow the acorn <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> more.|$|E
60|$|Since the {{beginning}} of his practice, Dr. Tolbridge had never gone away from Thorbury for an absence of any considerable duration without first calling on Miss Panney to see <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> any attention from him before he left, and on this occasion he determined not to depart from this custom. It is true, she was very angry with him, but so far as he could help it, he would not allow her anger to interfere with the preservation of a life which he considered valuable.|$|E
60|$|He {{failed to}} do so. Sylvia was a born coquette, and most {{dangerous}} in that her power of attraction was natural, and as a rule she appealed to the better and more chivalrous feelings of her victims. Fragile, and delicately pretty, she looked as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> some one to shelter and defend her from all troubles. Bland decided that, although she rarely said anything brilliant, and he had seen more beautiful women, he had not met one who, taken all round, could compare with Sylvia.|$|E

In the middle of chaos, Xiaoxing is left in the rain as he drives off.|$|R
60|$|Christmas passed off quietly. As {{soon as it}} {{was known}} that Lady Greendale had returned, the {{neighbours}} called, and {{for the next few months}} there was the usual round of dinner parties. To all remarks as to the length of time that she had been away, Lady Greendale merely replied that Bertha had been staying among friends, and that as she herself had not been in very good health, she had preferred staying in town, where she could always find a physician close at hand <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> one.|$|E
6000|$|The {{studio was}} deserted all that afternoon, for Psyche {{sat in the}} orchard drawing {{squirrels}} on the wall, pert robins hopping by, buttercups and mosses, elves and angels; while May lay contentedly enjoying sun and air, sisterly care, and the [...] "pretty things" [...] she loved so well. Psyche did not find the task a hard one; for this time her heart was in it, and <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> any reward she surely found it; for the little face on her knee lost its weary look, and the peace and beauty of nature soothed her own troubled spirit, cheered her heart, and did her more good than hours of solitary study.|$|E
60|$|Would she? To say the truth, the {{question}} as asked now had a very different air from {{the question}} as asked years before, when, full of life and hope and enthusiasm, she had devoted herself to making an ideal home for her father and brother. What other sympathy or communion, she had asked herself then, should she ever need than these friends, so very dear: and, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> more, there, in the future, was John's ideal wife, who, somehow, always came before her in the likeness of Rose Ferguson, and John's ideal children, whom {{she was sure she}} should love and pet as if they were her own.|$|E

60|$|It {{was time}} to dress. There {{was to be a}} dinner-party that day, the last of the parties which were held at the Grange as proper {{preliminaries}} to the wedding, and Dorothea was glad of a reason for moving away at once on the sound of the bell, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> more than her usual amount of preparation. She was ashamed of being irritated from some cause she could not define even to herself; for though she had no intention to be untruthful, her reply had not touched the real hurt within her. Mr. Casaubon's words had been quite reasonable, yet they had brought a vague instantaneous sense of aloofness on his part.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I am glad {{of it for}} my own," [...] said Ellesmere; [...] "and, indeed, for {{the sake}} of the whole house.--And your ladyship thinks she is not like to be married to him? Troth, I could never see how he should be such an idiot; but perhaps she is going to do worse; for she speaks here of coming to high preferment, and that scarce comes by honest {{servitude}} nowadays; then she writes me about sending her things, as if I were mistress of the wardrobe to her ladyship--ay, and recommends Master Julian to the care of my age and experience, forsooth, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to recommend the dear little jewel to me; and then, to speak of my age--But I will bundle away her rags to the Hall, with a witness!" ...|$|E
60|$|Austin, as usual, was {{satisfied}} {{to leave his}} wife alone. The evening reception was her business, and <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> his help he would know. In the meantime, he talked to Jefferson and Kit. Kit was half conscious that he owed his hostess much. His clothes were better and the colours did not clash. He had dropped one or two mannerisms Mrs. Austin quietly discouraged, and had begun to take for models her husband and Jefferson. Jefferson was thin and hard and often quiet, although his smile was friendly. Austin was urbane and looked languid, but Kit now imagined he was not. In fact, both had a calm and balance Kit admired. They had risked and done much, {{but they did not}} talk down to him; to feel they weighed his remarks was flattering.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Carmela spots Angie Bonpensiero at a {{supermarket}} and invites her to dinner. Angie explains her dog is very sick {{and that she}} cannot afford veterinarian bills after Big Pussy's disappearance. Carmela tells Tony, who visits the Bonpensiero residence and spots new Cadillac in the driveway. Because she had mentioned grievances that were not Carmela's business, he angrily damages the car with a baseball bat. He tells Angie that, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> money, <b>she</b> should come directly to him.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after that}} conversation, Janice becomes a widow; Bobby is murdered {{by two of}} Phil Leotardo's hit men while buying a model train in a hobby store. Tony visits her afterwards, and assures her that he is there for her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> him. Bobby III and Sophia's {{paternal}} grandmother wants to raise them, while Janice wants to keep them with her and Domenica. Their fate remains unknown, although the two have previously shown contempt for Janice.|$|R
