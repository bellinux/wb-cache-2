50|$|Coucou de Rennes is a French {{breed of}} chicken. The chicken was an {{historic}} Breton breed which had nearly disappeared {{by the late}} twentieth century. However following an effort at rebreeding, starting in 1988 that {{was carried out by}} the Ecomuseum of Rennes, the breed has since recovered. There is an association of Coucou de Rennes chicken producers that has breeding regulations. These state that the minimum age of slaughter must not be before 130 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fowl, 180 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hens and roosters, and 200 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> capons.|$|R
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1945–1946, Slotin shocked {{some of his colleagues}} with a bold action. He {{repaired}} an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, rather than wait an extra <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen.

40|$|Urinary {{excretion}} of chloroquine and its desethyl-metabolite was monitored {{for up to}} 395 {{days after}} the last dose of oral chloroquine (300 mg base) taken once weekly for 10 weeks as malaria prophylaxis. Concentrations in plasma could be followed for up to 70 days after the last dose. A three exponential decay {{was applied to the}} urinary excretion data. The half-life of the terminal phase varied from 45 to 55 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> chloroquine and from 59 to 67 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> metabolite. Mean residence time was approximately 20 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> parent compound and 35 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> metabolite, indicating that the terminal phases are of less importance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> effective half-lives...|$|R
40|$|This {{retrospective}} study evaluated {{the efficacy of}} radiotherapy used alone in macroscopic oral soft tissue sarcoma. Thirty-one dogs qualified <b>for</b> <b>the</b> study. Twenty dogs received curative radiotherapy (median total dose: 52. 5 Gy) and eleven dogs were treated palliatively (3 x 8 Gy or 5 x 6 Gy). <b>The</b> time-to-progression <b>for</b> <b>the</b> curatively-treated dogs was 333 days versus 180 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> palliatively-treated dogs (p= 0. 134).

5|$|A free buffet for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free Buffet Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 hours a <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945. It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north-south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet {{in the waiting room}} on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised Preston Passion of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).|$|E
5|$|After refit {{work was}} {{completed}} on 31 March 1942, Colorado carried out extensive training maneuvers along the West Coast, {{before returning to}} Pearl Harbor to complete her final preparations for action. She operated {{in the vicinity of}} the Fiji Islands and New Hebrides from 8 November 1942 to 17 September 1943 to prevent any further Japanese expansion in the Pacific. She sailed from Pearl Harbor on 21 October 1943 to provide pre-invasion shelling and fire support for the invasion of Tarawa, returning to port on 7 December 1943. After another overhaul on the West Coast, Colorado returned to Lahaina Roads, in the Hawaiian Islands, on 21 January 1944 and sortied the next <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Marshall Islands. She provided the pre-invasion bombardment and fire support for the invasions of Kwajalein and Eniwetok until 23 February, when she headed for the Puget Sound Navy Yard for another overhaul.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1998, {{it became}} clear that Braathens had {{increased}} capacity by 20%, but only achieved a 5.2% ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. The business market, in particular the large corporations with divisions in several large cities, were demanding high frequencies on the routes. Color Air could get by with fewer departures because they mainly targeted the leisure segment. In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million seats annually, but only 345,000 passengers, giving a 29% cabin load. Accumulated cabin load for Color Air was 32%, with 116,176 passengers. In {{the course of the last}} quarter of 1998, Color Air lost NOK91 million, or NOK1 million each <b>day.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> whole year, Color Air had an average ticket price of NOK453, giving a revenue of NOK 57 million. NOK45 million was used on taxes, giving NOK12 million to cover operating costs of NOK209 million. The company lost NOK197 million in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Cain {{started on}} Opening <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Giants in 2013. He pitched six shutout innings before being removed {{due to a}} high pitch count; however, Kershaw threw a shutout, and the Dodgers beat the Giants 40. On April 7, Cain threw two no-hit innings before giving up nine runs {{in the third inning}} and getting removed from the game, {{becoming}} the first Giants to allow nine runs in an inning since Ernie Shore in 1912. The Cardinals beat the Giants 14–3. On August 23 against the Pirates, Cain was hit by Gaby Sánchez's line drive in the pitching arm, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career. Cain would finish the season with a record of 8-10 in 30 starts. For the first time since 2006, Cain's ERA sat in the 4's, finishing with an exact 4.00 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Crossing Madagascar {{for a third}} time, Elita closely {{followed}} the trajectory of its second passage, emerging into the Indian Ocean near Manakara on February3. Despite initial forecasts of re-intensification, Elita accelerated southeastward and lost its remaining convection, leaving its center exposed {{under the influence of}} a strong upper-level trough. The structure resembled a subtropical cyclone as the surface circulation became broader. Late on February4, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and the MFR classified Elita as an extratropical cyclone on the next <b>day.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> next week, the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar. On February11, the residual circulation tracked southwestward, only to accelerate southeastward away from the region on February13, when the MFR ceased monitoring the system.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same reason. During this month, {{wear and tear on}} the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E
