5|$|Ptolemy {{decided to}} try to make a night dash from Citium, round Cape Greko, to Salamis, hoping to {{surprise}} Demetrius and combine his fleet with his brother’s sixty ships so they could then outnumber Demetrius. Demetrius, however, informed of Ptolemy's arrival, took steps just in order to prevent this from happening: he equipped his ships with missile-throwers, brought aboard his best troops as marines, and sailed his fleet to anchor just outside the harbour of the city, bottling up Menelaus in the harbour and <b>interposing</b> himself between the two enemy fleets. This meant that Demetrius took a calculated risk that {{he would be able to}} defeat Ptolemy before Menelaus could sail out of the harbour and attack him in the rear.|$|E

However, to ensure that command would not pass to Blamey {{in the event of}} something happening to Wavell, the British government promoted Sir Henry Maitland Wilson to general in June. Soon afterwards, Wavell was replaced by General Sir Claude Auchinleck. Blamey was subsequently promoted to the same rank on 24 September 1941, becoming only the fourth Australian to reach this rank, after Monash, Chauvel and White. During the Syrian campaign against the Vichy French, Blamey took decisive action to resolve the command difficulties caused by Wilson's attempt to direct the fighting from the King David Hotel in Jerusalem by <b>interposing</b> Lavarack's I Corps headquarters.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Isoperistaltic colon {{interposition}} is one {{of several}} surgical options available in the treatment of short bowel syndrome. It functions primarily by slowing the rapid intestinal transit that follows small bowel resection (SBR). Previous studies have <b>interposed</b> distal colonic segments and although there is evidence of adaptation by the <b>interposed</b> colon it is not known whether these segments develop histologic or functional small bowel characteristics. METHODS: In this study evidence was sought of metaplasia in the <b>interposed</b> segments after 80 % SBR and, because proximal colon is a midgut derivative, the differences between proximal and distal colonic segments were examined. RESULTS: There was no qualitative histological evidence of metaplasia by the <b>interposed</b> segments. There was a significant increase in crypt depth, mucosal thickness and maltase concentration of the <b>interposed</b> segments compared with the nontransposed colon of the controls. The maltase concentations were increased {{to the extent that they}} were not significantly different from the concentration present in normal ileum. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no gross evidence of small bowel intestinalization by the <b>interposed</b> segments, there was evidence of adaptation which was not merely an extension of the adaptive process seen after SBR alone. These changes resulted in the colon taking on some small bowel features. There was no significant difference between proximal vs distal <b>interposed</b> segments. David R.

5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; <b>interposing</b> a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E

25|$|On May 5, after Grant's army {{crossed the}} Rapidan River {{and entered the}} Wilderness of Spotsylvania, it was {{attacked}} by Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Although Lee was outnumbered, about 60,000 to 100,000, his men fought fiercely and the dense foliage provided a terrain advantage. After two days of fighting and almost 29,000 casualties, the results were inconclusive and neither army was able to obtain an advantage. Lee had stopped Grant, but had not turned him back; Grant had not destroyed Lee's army. Under similar circumstances, previous Union commanders had chosen to withdraw behind the Rappahannock, but Grant instead ordered Meade to move around Lee's right flank and seize the important crossroads at Spotsylvania Court House to the southeast, hoping that by <b>interposing</b> his army between Lee and Richmond, he could lure the Confederates into another battle on a more favorable field.|$|E

500|$|When it {{was time}} to call a vote, the {{presiding}} magistrate could bring up whatever proposals (in whatever order) he wished, and every vote was between a proposal and its negative. Quorums were required for votes to be held, and it is known that in 67 BC the size of a quorum was set at 200 senators (by the lex Cornelia de privilegiis). At any point before a motion passed, the proposed motion could be vetoed. Usually, vetoes were handed down by plebeian tribunes. If the Senate proposed a bill that the plebeian tribune (the magistrate who was the chief representative of the people) did not agree with, he issued a veto, which was backed by the promise to literally [...] "'interpose the sacrosanctity of his person'" [...] (or intercessio) if the Senate did not comply. If the Senate did not comply, he could physically prevent the Senate from acting, and any resistance could be criminally prosecuted as constituting a violation of his sacrosanctity. If the vetoed motion was proposed the next day, and the plebeian tribune who had vetoed it the day before was not present to interpose himself, the motion could be passed. In general, the plebeian tribune had to physically be present at the Senate meeting, otherwise his physical threat of <b>interposing</b> his person had no meaning. Ultimately, the plebeian tribune's veto was based in a promise of physical force.|$|E
