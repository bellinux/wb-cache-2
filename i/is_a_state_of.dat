5|$|Plasma <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> {{matter in}} which an ionised gaseous {{substance}} becomes highly electrically conductive {{to the point that}} long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter. This state can be contrasted with the other states: solid, liquid, and gas. Unlike these other states of matter, plasma mostly does not naturally exist on the Earth's surface under normal conditions, and must be artificially generated from neutral gases.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, {{the most common cause}} being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, the most common cause is iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, {{the most common cause of}} hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease. In addition, the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E

5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, {{one of two}} things must happen before the National Assembly can {{consider}} the measure: The president must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send a petition to the National Assembly. Both chambers of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments for a minimum of three months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E

Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, at which point microscopic quantum phenomena, particularly wavefunction interference, become apparent.

Nevertheless, it is still a state of thought, in contrast to Illumined Mind, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> vision and spiritual insight.|$|E
