Output includes extended x-ray-absorption fine structure (EXAFS), <b>full</b> <b>multiple</b> scattering calculations of various x-ray absorption spectra (XAS) and projected local densities of states (LDOS). The spectra include x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), x-ray natural circular dichroism (XNCD), and non-resonant x-ray emission spectra. Calculations of the x-ray scattering amplitude (Thomson and anomalous parts) and spin dependent calculations of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and spin polarized x-ray absorption spectra (SPXAS and SPEXAFS) are also possible, but less automated.|$|E

International High School athletes {{from as far away as}} Australia and New Zealand have competed here, Mexico is represented regularly. There is a [...] "Distance Carnival" [...] which provides a rare (American) opportunity to run in a highly competitive track 10,000 metres race. The meet is a popular gathering for many elite throwers. Seven world records in throwing events alone, including four in the Discus have been set at the Mt. SAC Relays. A <b>full</b> <b>multiple</b> event competition associated with the meet (Decathlon for men and now Heptathlon for women) is held at Azusa Pacific University. Racewalking events are held earlier in the month, with occasional elite races held on the day of the elite competition. And with this meet being held at a Community College, there is a full competition for that level. While the relays started in 1959, the first women weren't allowed to participate until 1961, with one race, a 440-yard dash, out of a 113 event schedule.|$|E
40|$|The local {{adsorption}} {{structure of}} ammonia on Cu(110) {{has been determined}} in a quantitative fashion using N 1 s scanned-energy mode photoelectron diffraction. While inversion of the photoelectron diffraction spectra using a direct method indicates that the adsorbed NH, molecules are near to atop sites, a <b>fuller</b> <b>multiple</b> scattering analysis shows that the molecule is actually displaced 0. 37 Angstrom off the atop site in a [100] azimuth. The result is ascribed to adsorbate-adsorbate interactions (steric hindrance) {{similar to those found}} in (2 x 1) -CO (pmg) structures seen on several fee (110) surfaces, although in the case of ammonia, it occurs at coverages well below saturation, implying that adsorbate-adsorbate attraction also occurs. These general conclusions are entirely consistent with those of a recent ESDIAD study of this system. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>full</b> <b>multiple</b> Dirichlet {{series of}} an {{automorphic}} cusp form is defined, in classical language, as a Dirichlet series of several complex variables {{over all the}} Fourier coefficients of the cusp form. It {{is different from the}} L-function of Godement and Jacquet, which is defined as a Dirichlet series in one complex variable over a one-dimensional array of the Fourier coefficients. In GL(2) and GL(3), the two notions are simply related. In this paper, we construct a kernel function that gives the <b>full</b> <b>multiple</b> Dirichlet series of automorphic cusp forms on GL(n,R). The kernel function is a new Poincaré series. Specifically, the inner product of a cusp form with this Poincaré series is the product of the <b>full</b> <b>multiple</b> Dirichlet series of the form times a function that is essentially the Mellin transform of Jacquet's Whittaker function. In the proof, the <b>full</b> <b>multiple</b> Dirichlet series is produced by applying the Lipschitz summation formula several times and by an integral which collapses the sum over SL(n− 1,Z) in the Fourier expansion of the cusp form...|$|E

40|$|Two {{effective}} medium {{models are}} presented {{and used to}} predict complex reflection and transmission coefficients of finite periodic arrays of resonant elastic shells {{as well as their}} effective density and bulk modulus at low frequencies. Comparisons with <b>full</b> <b>multiple</b> scattering theory and measurements show that the self-consistent model fails to correctly predict the shape of the transmission/reflection curves when scatterer resonances are close to the first Bragg bandgap. The low frequency grating model, which neglects the evanescent modes and considers scattered wave propagation only {{in the same direction as}} the incident one, gives a much better agreement with both measurements and the <b>full</b> <b>multiple</b> scattering theory. Moreover, because it does not require the wavelength to strongly exceed the size of scatterers, the model gives reliable predictions even at frequencies around the first periodicity related bandgap. In contrast to the self-consistent model, the low frequency grating model is applicable when the resonant scatterers have more than two low frequency resonances...|$|E
