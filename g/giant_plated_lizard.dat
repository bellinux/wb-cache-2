50|$|Rock monitor lizard, {{water monitor}} lizard, <b>giant</b> <b>plated</b> <b>lizard,</b> rainbow skink, ground agama and {{speckled}} thick toed gecko {{have all been}} seen in Mapungubwe National Park.There {{are estimated to be}} at least thirty-two species of snake in the park, although only fifteen have thus far been confirmed. Some of these species include the southern African python, snouted cobra, black mamba, both horned and puff adders, and at least three species of whip or sand snakes. Nile crocodile occur in and along the Limpopo River.|$|E
5000|$|In South Africa, the commonest foods were (in {{descending}} order of preference): Cape hyrax, Smith's red rock hare (Pronolagus rupertris), meerkat, mountain reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula), goats and sheep, scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), Cape francolin (Francolinus capensis), helmeted guineafowl(Numida meleagris), yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) and Angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata). In “poor food areas” of the Matobo Hills, three nests included 53.6% hyrax, 10.7% cane-rats, 7.1% monkeys, 7.1% mongoose and 3.6% antelope. [...] From 1997 to 2005 {{in the same}} area, non-hyrax prey (each representing less than 10 out of 1550 prey items at nests) included white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), domestic goat, vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), Jameson's red rock hare (Pronolagus randensis), helmeted guineafowl, Swainson's francolin (Pternistis swainsonii), Natal francolin (Pternistis natalensis), southern red-billed hornbill (Tockus rufirostris), rock pigeon (Columba livia), white-necked raven (Corvus albicollis), leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) and <b>giant</b> <b>plated</b> <b>lizard</b> (Gerrhosaurus validus). In the Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden of South Africa, the primary prey found around nests after a perceptible hyrax decline has become helmeted guineafowl and francolins, followed by cane rats, rabbits and dikdiks (Rhynchotragus ssp.). Young baboons may also be hunted, even the large-bodied chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) which have issued a predator alarm call {{in response to the}} presence of Verreaux's eagles. Carrion either fairly frequent or none at all. [...] A study of the taking of domestic lambs in the Karoo found only two cases of lambs being eaten by Verreaux's eagle and these were already dead when carried off. This contrasts with the golden eagle, which in some areas may eat many dead lambs and occasionally hunt lives ones. Although any prey weighing over 4.5 kg is rarely taken, some ungulates hunted by Verreaux's eagles can be considerably larger. Klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) lambs brought to the nest have weighed up to 12 kg. A Verreaux's eagle was observed to hunt and kill a mountain reedbuck lamb estimated to weigh 15 kg.|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>plated</b> <b>lizards,</b> {{species in the}} family Gerrhosauridae live {{in a range of}} habitats, from rocky crevices to sand dunes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plated</b> <b>lizards</b> {{are usually}} docile and they tame quickly with regular handling. Being omnivores they enjoy eating live crickets and other insects and {{small amounts of}} chopped fruits and {{vegetables}} such as kale, carrots, mango and strawberries. Citrus fruit (e.g. orange) and other acidic fruits should be avoided as this can cause stomach ulcers and digestion problems. Some also treat their <b>plated</b> <b>lizards</b> with the occasional small pinkie mouse, {{depending on the size}} of the individual.|$|R

40|$|The endemic <b>plated</b> <b>lizards</b> (Gerrhosauridae) of Madagascar {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse groups of lizards on the island (19 species) and are found in all ecoregions. On an island that {{presents}} so many interesting biological questions, <b>plated</b> <b>lizards</b> are an ideal group for examining patterns of diversification due to their high (but tractable) diversity and wide distribution. To resolve the taxonomy and evolutionary relationships of Malagasy <b>plated</b> <b>lizards,</b> and to explore their biogeographic history, we have generated a molecular phylogeny based on > 2 kb of both mitochondrial (cob, 1142 bp) and nuclear (NT- 3, 419 bp; c-mos, 542 bp) DNA sequences. Phylogenetic relationships and divergence-time estimates indicate Zonosaurinae are monophyletic, arising from a single colonization event, likely from Africa to Madagascar in the Paleogene (Paleocene/early Eocene), with subsequent radiation. Furthermore, our results reveal widespread mischaracterization of species delimitation and assignment based on phenotypic characteristics. Paraphyly of a number of zonosaurine species was strongly supported by our dataset, revealing not only instances of likely cryptic species (phenotypic conservatism) but also phenotypic/genotypic discordance in the delimitation of species (phenotypic variability). These results clearly demonstrate the complex history of biotic diversification on Madagascar and provide novel insight into biogeographic patterns on the island...|$|R

5000|$|A large lizard with a {{flattened}} head and body, its length is {{a maximum of}} 75 cm. The soles of the feet have black rubber-like balls, an adaptation to living on rock outcrops. It is called the <b>plated</b> <b>lizard</b> because of the platelike scales on the back. This lizard is very shy and hard to approach. When threatened, it will jam itself into rock crevices (aided by its flattened body) and inflate with air, {{making it impossible to}} extricate it.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of 18, single-copy, anonymous nuclear loci from the Malagasy <b>plated</b> <b>lizard</b> Zonosaurus madagascariensis. More than 140 clones from a genomic library were examined and 38 potential loci tested across both closely and distantly related lizards. Of the 18 loci reported here, more than half (10) work in closely related zonosaurines although only one successfully amplified a homologous fragment in the distantly related iguanid (Oplurus). Sequences of these loci revealed a high frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms, supporting previous reports of high levels of intraspecific variation in lizards...|$|R
