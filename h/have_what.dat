5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to <b>have</b> <b>what</b> we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to <b>have</b> <b>what</b> I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones <b>have</b> <b>what</b> can be {{described}} as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach and possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E

In this survey paper, we look back at the last five years to see <b>what</b> <b>has</b> changed, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> stagnated, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> succeeded, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> failed, and why. We also look at current trends with a view towards the future. ...|$|R

Its {{function is to}} sorrow over <b>what</b> <b>has</b> and <b>what</b> <b>has</b> not been done. It is manifested as remorse. Its proximate cause is <b>what</b> <b>has</b> and <b>what</b> <b>has</b> not been done (i.e. wrongs of commission and omission).|$|R

5|$|The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu pay special {{attention}} to detail depicting birds, snails, chameleons, and other natural aspects of the world such as a hatching bird. Other pieces include gourds and vessels which were often given handles. The pieces are so fine that small insects were included on the surfaces of some while others <b>have</b> <b>what</b> looks like bronze wires decorated around them. None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the evidence of an early bronze casting tradition in Nri.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Polish leader, Colonel Józef Beck, {{believed}} that Warsaw should act rapidly to forestall the German {{occupation of the}} city. At noon on 30 September, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czechoslovak troops and police and gave Prague time until noon the following day. At 11:45a.m. on 1 October the Czechoslovak foreign ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague {{and told him that}} Poland could <b>have</b> <b>what</b> it wanted. The Polish Army, commanded by General Władysław Bortnowski, annexed an area of 801.5km² with a population of 227,399 people. Administratively the annexed area was divided between two counties: Frysztat and Cieszyn County. At the same time Slovakia lost to Hungary 10,390km² with 854,277 inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|The film {{suggests}} Scotland {{had been}} under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace’s childhood, and {{in the run-up to}} the Battle of Falkirk Wallace says to the younger Bruce, “e'll <b>have</b> <b>what</b> none of us have ever had before, a country of our own.” In fact Scotland had been invaded by England only the year before Wallace's rebellion; prior to the death of King Alexander III it had been a fully separate kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The typical role of {{a bishop}} is to provide {{pastoral}} governance for a diocese. Bishops who fulfill this function are known as diocesan ordinaries, because they <b>have</b> <b>what</b> canon law calls ordinary (i.e. not delegated) authority for a diocese. These bishops may be known as hierarchs in the Eastern Catholic Churches. Other bishops may be appointed to assist ordinaries (auxiliary bishops and coadjutor bishops) or {{to carry out a}} function in a broader field of service to the Church, such as appointments as papal nuncios or as officials in the Roman Curia.|$|E

25|$|Global {{does not}} <b>have</b> <b>what</b> {{can be called}} a main schedule, apart from news. Even before the WIC purchase, the Global {{stations}} had widely varying program lineups, and the WIC purchase only exacerbated the differences. For example, CHAN still owned British Columbia rights to many shows that air on CTV until 2001 except for The Oprah Winfrey Show, and CKMI cannot air children's programming on weekdays due to provincial laws requiring children's programming to be shown weekdays and weekends commercial-free over the air. Factors influencing the stations' programming include time zone differences, local programming, and ratings for non-Global shows.|$|E
25|$|In {{intestinal}} schistosomiasis, eggs become {{lodged in}} the intestinal wall and cause an immune system reaction called a granulomatous reaction. This immune response can lead to obstruction of the colon and blood loss. The infected individual may <b>have</b> <b>what</b> {{appears to be a}} potbelly. Eggs can also become {{lodged in the}} liver, leading to high blood pressure through the liver, enlarged spleen, the buildup of fluid in the abdomen, and potentially life-threatening dilations or swollen areas in the esophagus or gastrointestinal tract that can tear and bleed profusely (esophageal varices). In rare instances, the central nervous system is affected. Individuals with chronic active schistosomiasis may not complain of typical symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Spastic {{cerebral}} palsy, or {{cerebral palsy}} where spasticity (muscle tightness) is the exclusive or almost exclusive impairment present, {{is by far}} the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, occurring in upwards of 70% of all cases. People with this type of CP are hypertonic and <b>have</b> <b>what</b> is essentially a neuromuscular mobility impairment (rather than hypotonia or paralysis) stemming from an upper motor neuron lesion in the brain as well as the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex. This damage impairs the ability of some nerve receptors in the spine to receive gamma-Aminobutyric acid properly, leading to hypertonia in the muscles signaled by those damaged nerves.|$|E

25|$|To {{ensure that}} even the largest structs do not cause a {{performance}} penalty when they are handed off, Swift uses copy on write so that the objects are copied only {{if and when the}} program attempts to change a value in them. This means that the various accessors <b>have</b> <b>what</b> is in effect a pointer to the same data storage, but this takes place far below the level of the language, in the computer's memory management unit (MMU). So while the data is physically stored as one instance in memory, {{at the level of the}} application, these values are separate, and physical separation is enforced by copy on write only if needed.|$|E
25|$|On 13 April {{while on}} his march from Villefranche to Castelnaudary the Marshal {{was caught up}} by the {{officers}} from Paris. They were met with a rebuff - Soult declared himself not convinced of the authenticity of their credentials. He definitely refused to acknowledge the provisional regime till he should <b>have,</b> <b>what</b> he considered, solid evidence of its legality. On receiving Soult's refusal to acknowledge the Provisional Government, Wellington sent him on 14 April a reply {{to the effect that}} no armistice would be granted until he made his submission; it was suspected that the Marshal wished to keep his army under his own hand for the purpose of Napoleonic intrigues. By 15 April Marshal Suchet at Perpignan had accepted the evidence, placed himself at the disposition of the new government and asked Wellington for an armistice.|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed, however, with some studies not finding significant problems in social skills while others <b>have.</b> <b>What</b> does seem clear is that the socially anxious perceive their own social skills to be low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming relationships or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, at least among the 'middle classes'. An interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal characteristics has also been argued to fuel perfectionism and feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.|$|E

25|$|For we {{all agree}} that the most {{excellent}} man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we <b>have,</b> <b>what</b> criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), {{it is clear that the}} intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.|$|E

Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference, and to prove her point, she vividly (fully clothed) fakes one as other diners watch. The scene ends with Sally casually returning to her meal as a nearby patron (played by Reiner's mother) places her order: [...] "I'll <b>have</b> <b>what</b> she's having." [...] When Estelle Reiner died at age 94 in 2008, The New York Times referred to her as the woman [...] "who delivered {{one of the most}} memorably funny lines in movie history".
