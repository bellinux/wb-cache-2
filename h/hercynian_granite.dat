40|$|A {{comparative}} study of P-T-X fluid evolution in several Iberian tungsten deposits {{has been carried out}} using microthermometric and Raman data on representative deposits of Northern Portugal (Panasqueira and Borralha) and Spanish Central System (San Rafael, Cabeza Mediana, Cabeza Lijar). ThTee main types of fluids have been distinguished: (i) magmatic hypersaline aqueous fluids (only present in Spanish Central System); (ii) "metamorphic" aqueous-carbonic fluids (H 20 -NaCI-C 02 - CH 4); and (iii) aqueous fluids (H 20 -NaCI). The fluid evolution is characterized by dilution of aqueous carbonic fluids, accompanied by a decrease of the volatile phase density and cooling. The W-mineralisation IS always related to aqueous-carbonic fluids, resulting from the interaction between water and C-hearing metamorphic host rocks. The <b>Hercynian</b> <b>granites</b> of Iberia are thus considered to have played a role on ore forming processes rather distinct than that previously thought, as no typical magmatic signature is found except in the earliest stages responsible for the greisen formation in the Spanish Central System. The main role of the granites appears to be a heat supply at the origin of fluid convection, rather than a fluid or a metal source...|$|R

40|$|The {{antimony}} {{occurrences of}} the Iberian peninsula {{are described in}} terms of mineralogi-cal associations, geochemical features, and chronostratigraphic distribution of the orebod-ies. A metallogenic and structural classification is proposed. This classification takes into account the mineral assemblages and the form and structure of the deposits, as well as the host-rock lithology. The relationship between the different types of mineralization and the age of the host rocks is discussed, and an attempt is made to establish the time sequence of the metallogenic processes. Eight mineralogical associations are found in the antimony deposits of the peninsula. They are: (1) quartz-stibnite, (2) quartz-stibnite-gold, (3) carbonate-quartz-stibnite-sphal-erite-gold, (4) carbonate-quartz-stibnite-galena-silver, (5) quartz-stibnite-sphalerite, (6) quartz-stibnite-scheelite, (7) quartz-stibnite-cinnabar, and (8) quartz-stibnite-copper. The most gold-rich Sb deposits are located in the northwest edge of the Iberian Hercyn-ian belt, in the upper Precambrian-Lower Cambrian basement. The quartz-stibnite-schee-lite and quartz-stibnite-cinnabar ssociations are characteristic of the calcareous formations of Paleozoic age, whereas the quartz-antimony-mercury assemblage occurs only in the lower Carboniferous of the Cantabrian zone. Some Iberian antimony deposits are interpreted {{to be the result of}} direct or indirect magmatic processes. In the Lower Ordovician, Silurian-Devonian, and lower Carbonifer-ous, antimony mineralizations are related to preorogenic volcanism, although some vein-type deposits are associated with <b>Hercynian</b> <b>granites.</b> Mineralizations related to postoroge-nic volcanism are of lesser importance.

40|$|Goban Spur {{lies on the}} {{continental}} margin of northwest Europe, southwest of Ireland. It is a marginal plateau underlain by <b>Hercynian</b> <b>granites</b> and Palaeozoic sediments, which form large horsts, grabens and tilted fault blocks with a trend that is approximately parallel to the main Celtic/Armorican Shelf edge. The spur {{is thought to be}} a westward continuation of the buoyant Cornubian Ridge, and is bounded to the north and south by large fault lines which probably represent reactivation of Hercynian structural trends. The continental basement is further divided longitudinally into a low-lying outer zone (Intermediate Zone) and a high inner region (Goban Spur proper). The ocean/continent boundary is thought to lie at {{the outer edge of the}} Intermediate Zone, Sea-floor spreading anomalies immediately west of the Intermediate Zone suggest that the adjacent ocean crust was created prior to anomaly 33 (say at ca. 90 m. y. B. P.). The sedimentary sequence on Goban Spur can be subdivided into four layers which can be tentatively correlated with the stratigraphic succession on the Meriadzek Terrace (IPOD sites). Such a correlation suggests that the lowermost sediment layer (?Jurassic-Albian) represents a tectono-sedimentary rift infill, and that Layers 2 – 4 (Upper Cretaceous to Quaternary) were deposited during slow epeirogenic downwarping of the plateau and that the sedimentary processes involved both draping and strong current moulding. The relatively buoyant nature of Inner Goban Spur has inhibited the accumulation of a thick post-rifting sedimentary sequence (700 – 1000 m), and has shielded the Intermediate Zone from downslope mass movements of material. This has resulted in the accumulation of an anomalously thin post-rift stage outer margin sediment prism (ca. 1000 m) compared to most continent rises (up to 10 km) ...|$|R

The island is low-lying with a top height of 18 m and the coast consists of boulder storm beaches. The effects of wind exposure, salt spray and lack of topography, restricts diversity and only 53 species of vascular plants have been recorded. The north of the island is dominated by a well developed, thick, thrift (Armeria maritima) turf whilst the southern part is dominated by dense stands of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), with some sand sedge (Carex arenaria) and Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus). Thickets of tree mallow (Lavatera arborea) have developed {{at the back of}} some of the boulder beaches. There were scattered colonies of shore dock (Rumex rupestris) until a storm in 1982 swept away some of the boulder beaches. One colony remains in the corner of a relatively sheltered beach in the south of the island at a freshwater seepage. Shore dock is one of the primary reasons for the selection of the Isles of Scilly as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Annet is the ″British stronghold″ for the lichen Roccella fuciformis.A description of the island by Hilda Quick, a former resident of St Agnes published in 1964 is still relevant today:Many people are disappointed at being unable to visit the famous bird sanctuary, but in fact, there is very little to see there by day. There will be shearwater corpses lying about, (victims of the gulls) several large colonies of gulls, some oystercatchers, rock pipits, and wrens. The walking on the island is horrid, much of it over loose stones hidden in long grass, some bramble and bracken, and awkward great clumps of thrift. What Annet is famous for is its colonies of Manx shearwaters and storm petrels; but since they nest underground, and only come and go in the dark, there is nothing to be seen of them by day.

The study area is one of mixed geology consisting mainly of the <b>Hercynian</b> <b>granites</b> of the Dartmoor mass, the metamorphosed sedimentary rocks of the adjoining "Killas" and some unmetamor-phosed sedimentary rocks of Carboniferous and Devonian ages. Tin mineralization occurs mainly within the granite area, although minor deposits have been found within the killas. Copper-zinc-arsenic mineralization {{is limited to the}} metamorphic and sedimentary sequences. Extensive mining of both types of deposits has been carried out in the past, and contamination is relatively widespread. The sediments of all the streams of the area were systematically sampled at an interval of approximately 1 kilometer. At each site two samples were collected - one panned and one unpanned. Each sample was sieved into a number of size fractions which were then divided into heavy and light components using bromoform. The material was then analysed for the elements listed above by atomic absorption spectro-photometry. Mineralogical investigations were employed in order to study the relationship between the geochemical patterns obtained and the mineralogical composition of the various sets of samples. The data obtained were treated by univariate and multivariate statistical-mathematical techniques, which proved to be of great value in making a reliable interpretation of the results obtained. Frequency distribution analysis, moving averages, correlation coefficients and semi-variograms were all employed. It was found that analysis of heavy concentrates can be used very effectively in exploration for tin and lead deposits. However the analysis of light minerals in the search for tin was found to be equally effective.

40|$|The Atrevida vein {{is located}} at the {{south-western}} edge of the Catalonian Coastal Ranges, Spain. This vein extends for more than 3 km and is hosted by Silurian and Carboniferous metasediments, late <b>Hercynian</b> <b>granites</b> and continental conglomerates of Lower Triassic age. The Silurian metasediments contain massive sulphide layers with disseminations of platinum-group element (PGE) -bearing, Fe-Ni arsenides. Vein filling largely consists of banded and brecciated baryte rimmed by a complex polymetallic assemblage of Co-Ni-As-Bi-Ag(-U) ores. The Ni arsenide and sulpharsenide assemblage occurs only where the vein cuts the sulphide-bearing Silurian metasediments, and consists of nickeline, maucherite, rammelsbergite, gersdorffite and Ni-skutterudite. These Ni arsenides and sulpharsenides display rosettes, spherules, colloform and botryoidal textures, as well as subhedral crystals. The chemical compositions of these arsenide-sulpharsenide minerals exhibit limited cation substitution but substantial anion substitution of As by S and Sb, exceeding the expected theoretical values at low temperatures. This suggests that most of them formed under disequilibrium conditions. Ni arsenides and sulpharsenides also contain trace PGE. Palladium (up to 157 ppm) is the most abundant PGE, and occurs in solid-solution in all the phases studied, but shows the highest values in rammelsbergite and Niskutterudite. Pt only occurs in massive nickeline (54 - 1338 ppm Pt) and in zoned gersdorffite (29 - 360 ppm Pt) formed {{at the end of the}} depositional sequence of arsenides. The Ni arsenide and sulpharsenide ores at the Atrevida mine formed by reduction of PGE-bearing, oxidizing fluids at temperatures close to, or slightly above 100 °C. These oxidizing fluids most probably collected their PGE budget from the nearby mineralized black shales. During the crystallization of the veined, Ni arsenide and sulpharsenide ores, Pd partly concentrated in the early nickeline and maucherite, but mainly fractionated to the late solutions from which rammelsbergite and Ni-skutterudite precipitated.

Important differences in the radon concentration were found between stations, with average values comprised between 102 and 2982 Bq m− 3 , which {{can be explained by}} the local presence of uranium anomalies in the regional late-orogenic <b>Hercynian</b> <b>granite,</b> usually associated with faults. One of the boreholes exhibits large radon anomalies lasting for several days, and two, contrary to the others, show a clear daily periodic behaviour, with minima around 19 : 00 LT and maxima around 07 : 00 LT. The different patterns observed in stations placed at such a short distance (< 100 m) has no clear explanation and deserves further investigation. Data analysis shows no evidence of soil-gas radon concentration changes during explosions carried out at the quarry. This is likely to result from the absence of a progressive stress field affecting the rock, as typically occurs before an earthquake...|$|E
40|$|At Segura, {{granitic}} pegmatite veins with cassiterite and lepidolite, hydrothermal Sn–W quartz {{veins and}} Ba–Pb–Zn quartz veins intruded the Cambrian schist–metagraywacke complex and <b>Hercynian</b> <b>granites.</b> Cassiterite from Sn–W quartz veins is richer in Ti and poorer in Nb and Nb + Ta than cassiterite from granitic pegmatite. Wolframite from Sn–W quartz veins is enriched in ferberite component. The Sn–W quartz veins contain pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, stannite, matildite and schapbachite and the Ba–Pb–Zn quartz veins have cobaltite, pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena and barite, which {{were analyzed by}} electron microprobe. The presently abandoned mining area was exploited for Sn, W, Ba and Pb until 1953. Stream sediments and soils have higher concentrations of metals than parent granites and schists. Sn, W, B, As and Cu anomalies found in stream sediments and soils are associated with Sn–W quartz veins, while Ba, Pb and Zn anomalies in stream sediments and soils are related to Ba–Pb–Zn quartz veins. Sn, W, B, As, Cu, Ba, Pb and Zn anomalies in stream sediments and soils are also related to the respective old mining activities, which increased the mobility of trace metals from mineralized veins to soils, stream sediments and waters. Stream sediments and soils are sinks of trace elements, which depend on their contents in mineralized veins and weathering processes, but Sn, Wand B depend mainly on a mechanic process. Soils {{must not be used}} for agriculture and human residence due to their Sn, B, As and Ba contents. Waters associated with mineralized veins were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) and ICP-AES have high As, Fe and Mn and should not be used for human consumption and agriculture activities. The highest As values in waters were all related to Sn–W quartz veins and the highest Fe and Mn values were associated with the Ba–Pb–Zn quartz veins. No significant acid drainage was found associated with the old mine workings...|$|R
40|$|In {{northern}} and central Portugal, {{there are different}} tin-bearing granites. Most of them are of S-type, others have mixed characteristics of I-type and S-type granites and a few are of I-type. Tin-tungsten deposits are commonly associat-ed with <b>Hercynian</b> tin-bearing S-type <b>granites.</b> Some quartz veins with wolf-ramite are associated with an I-type granite, which has a low Sn content. In suites of tin-bearing S-type granitic rocks, Sn content increases {{as a function of}} the degree of fractional crystallization. Greisenizations of two-mica S-type granites associated with tin-tungsten mineralizations are accompanied by an increase i...|$|R
40|$|A post-tectonic {{plutonic}} {{array of}} felsic I-type granites crops {{out in the}} western Hercynian Iberian Belt. Isotope (Sr, N d, Pb) data favour {{the absence of an}} important input of juvenile magmas in late- to post- tectonic Hercynian felsic magmatism in western Iberia, but suggest a reworking of different crustal protoliths, including oceanic metabasic rocks accreted to mid-to-Iower crustal levels during {{the early stages of the}} collision. I-type granites were derived from different meta-igneous protoliths ranging from metabasic to felsic compositions depending on their geographical position from the external (e. g. Galicia-N Portugal, GNP) to the innermost continental areas (Spanish Central System and Los Pedroches Batholiths). The GNP 1 - type pIu tons related to eo-Hercynian accretional terranes have lower initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, lower negative εNd values, and higher 206 PbP 04 Pb ratios than other I-type granites of the Central Iberian zone. These more isotopically primitive <b>Hercynian</b> I-type <b>granites</b> are important in tracking pre-Hercynian accreted oceanic lithosphere terranes...|$|R
