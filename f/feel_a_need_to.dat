5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections {{are similar to}} those of The Eolian Harp. They are set in the same location, and both {{describe}} Coleridge's relationship with his wife and sexual desire. The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and a rejection of the conclusion drawn in The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God in Coleridge's view, he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God's will. The poem details how men <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state. The poem reconciles these desires by claiming that the pursuer of truth can still reflect back on his time when he was simply enjoying nature and God's presence.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of theoretical agronomy, research in agronomy, more {{than in any other}} field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of ecoregions, because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate, which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, soil characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they lead}} a {{comfortable}} life within the Culture, {{many of its}} citizens <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be useful and {{to belong to a}} society that does not merely exist for their own sake but that also helps improve the lot of sentient beings throughout the galaxy. For that reason the Culture carries out [...] "good works", covertly or overtly interfering in the development of lesser civilizations, with the main aim to gradually guide them towards less damaging paths. As Culture citizens see it these good works provide the Culture with a [...] "moral right to exist".|$|E

2500|$|Craig Raine, in {{his books}} In Defence of T. S. Eliot (2001) and T. S. Eliot (2006), sought to defend Eliot from {{the charge of}} anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated {{that he was not}} {{convinced}} by Raine's argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, [...] "Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains." [...] In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic Terry Eagleton also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, [...] "Why do critics <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [...] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the Archangel Gabriel does him no favours." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian was [...] "heartsick" [...] that Pet Sounds didn't sell {{as highly}} as he expected, and {{interpreted}} the response as a rejection to his creative ideals. Some blamed Capitol Records for the album's underwhelming sales. Allegedly, {{they did not}} promote the album as heavily as previous releases. Carl stated that Capitol did not <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> promote the Beach Boys since they were getting so much airplay, {{and that they had}} a [...] "set image" [...] for the group which even Pet Sounds could not alter. Others assumed that the label considered the album a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience the Beach Boys built their commercial standing on. To Brian's dismay, within two months, Capitol assembled the group's first greatest hits compilation, Best of The Beach Boys, which was quickly certified gold by the RIAA. Capitol executive Karl Engemann later said: [...] "This is just conjecture on my part because it was so long ago... because the marketing people didn't believe that Pet Sounds was going to do that well, they were probably looking for some additional volume in that quarter. There's a good possibility that's what happened. Anyway, my real forte was dealing with artists and producers and making them feel comfortable so they could achieve their ends. And sometimes, particularly when the label wanted something that the artist didn't, it wasn't easy.|$|E
6000|$|Currant-loaf is now popular {{eating in}} all households. For {{weeks before the}} great morning, confectioners display stacks of Scots bun--a dense, black substance, inimical to life--and full moons of shortbread adorned with mottoes of peel or sugar-plum, in honour {{of the season and}} the family affections. [...] "Frae Auld Reekie," [...] "A guid New Year to ye a'," [...] "For the Auld Folk at Hame," [...] are among the most favoured of these devices.

For at this season, on the threshold of another year of calamity and stubborn conflict, men <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> draw closer the links that unite them; they reckon the number of their friends, like allies before a war; and the prayers grow longer in the morning as the absent are recommended by name into God's keeping.|$|E

Boredom is another source of stress for Artisans. When under stress, they can become reckless, and they may retaliate against the source of the stress.
