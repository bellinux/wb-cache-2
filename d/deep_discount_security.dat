5000|$|Franklin Savings {{was founded}} in 1889. In 1972, Ernest Fleischer, a tax lawyer bought control. In 1981, a new {{business}} plan was developed for the thrift, and its assets grew from $200 million to $11 billion. The thrift bought {{a large amount of}} mortgage-backed securities and had dealings in financial futures and interest rate swaps. They had various complex <b>securities</b> that included <b>deep</b> <b>discounted</b> <b>securities,</b> long call and put options and strips (both interest only and principal only). They had also purchased junk bonds. The thrift had few traditional home mortgage loans on its books. The thrift's liabilities consisted primarily of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and repurchase agreements. In addition, over 70% of its deposits were obtained through brokers or telephone marketing programs. [...] The thrift also bought the stock brokerage firms of L. F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., Stern Brothers & Company, and Underwood, Neuhaus & Company.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, two forms of price {{competition}} have emerged within the cigarette industry: the introduction and spread of <b>discount</b> and <b>deep</b> <b>discount</b> cigarettes and {{the increased use of}} price-related promotions. In this paper, we use quarterly market-level, scanner-based data on cigarette prices, promotions, and sales for 50 US markets over the period from 1994 -IV through 2002 -II to examine the impact of price and promotions on market shares for premium, <b>discount,</b> and <b>deep</b> <b>discount</b> brand cigarettes. Our estimates indicate that changes in relative prices, including those resulting from promotions, account for much of observed changes in market shares.

40|$|Transit {{properties}} in the USA have historically experienced loss of market share {{and low levels of}} farebox recovery. They resorted to service expansion to maximize subsidies. Experience suggests that: (a) fare increases have not had the desired effect; (b) fare reductions can boost ridership but can also reduce revenue and increase subsidies. The challenge lies with the adoption of such strategies as <b>deep</b> <b>discount</b> group pass programs that can produce more marginal revenue than cost. <b>Deep</b> <b>discount</b> transit pass programs provide groups of people with unlimited-ride transit passes in exchange for a contractual payment for or on behalf of pass users by an employer or other organizing body. i Although successes of <b>deep</b> <b>discount</b> group pass programs are documented, there is substantial skepticism toward their wide-scale deployment because transit management perceives them as “special treatments ” or “favors ” to participants. Management fears such perception could raise questions about equity because they fail to see the fundamental difference in the fare structure of the “group pass ” from individual ticket purchases. Group passes operate in a manner analogous to insurance programs. The <b>deep</b> <b>discount</b> program cases studied consistently revealed either higher revenues pe...|$|R

40|$|Market {{commentators}} {{have suggested that}} New Zealand's lax private placement and disclosure regulation allows private placement purchasers to immediately sell discounted shares without disclosing these transactions to the market. However, New Zealand firms with the <b>deepest</b> <b>discounts</b> tend to have higher risks, lower returns and higher costs associated with evaluating firm value. Therefore, the possibility that <b>deep</b> <b>discounts</b> may simply represent adequate compensation for the extra risk and cost private placement purchasers incur cannot be ruled out.

50|$|The sale of {{an entire}} {{inventory}} is not a bulk sale if it is sold to buyers {{in a manner that}} ensures adequate consideration. For example, if a merchant holds an auction sale for the entire contents of the business and the sale is in good faith, the buyer in not required to comply with bulk sales legislation. However, the buyer of a business with inventory would be expected to complete the bulk sales registration as part of the normal course of closing the sale. Similarly, if a merchant has a <b>deep</b> <b>discount</b> sale, that is not a bulk sale as <b>deep</b> <b>discounts</b> can be made in the ordinary course of business.|$|R
