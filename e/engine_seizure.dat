50|$|During {{practice}} for the 1952 Senior TT race, Barrington was riding a 500 cc Norton when <b>engine</b> <b>seizure</b> at the left-hand bend before the Barregarrow cross-roads resulted in a crash, and a broken thigh caused his retirement from motorcycle racing.|$|E
50|$|The single-cylinder class {{race was}} won by Charles R. Collier riding a Matchless in 4 hours, 8 minutes and 8 seconds {{at an average}} race speed of 38.21 mph. His brother Harry Collier, also riding a Matchless, had {{problems}} with an <b>engine</b> <b>seizure</b> on lap 2 and eventually retired on lap 9.|$|E
50|$|The car gave Clark {{his first}} World Championship Grand Prix victory, at Spa in 1962. He took another win in Britain {{and again in}} the USA, which put him in {{contention}} for the title, but while leading the final race in South Africa a much publicised <b>engine</b> <b>seizure</b> cost him the title to Graham Hill.|$|E
50|$|Suzuki {{began using}} {{automatic}} lubrication in 1966 to eliminate premixing {{of oil and}} fuel as had been the norm for all two strokes up until then. This system was launched to eliminate mixtures with far too much oil due to the operator's unnecessary effort to preclude <b>engine</b> <b>seizures.</b> The 550 had {{the latest version of}} this multipoint oil injection called Crankcase Cylinder Injection (CCI).|$|R
5000|$|The {{design was}} not a success, and no further {{examples}} were built. While the Class 15s also suffered problems with the Paxman engines, these were worse on Class 16 because inadequate ventilation resulted in frequent <b>engine</b> <b>seizures.</b> Another problem was coolant contamination of the oil, due to cylinder head failure. They were fitted with a non-standard type of electro-magnetic control equipment (coded [...] "red circle" [...] by BR) which was prone to failure, and they could not operate in multiple with locomotives fitted with the more common electro-pneumatic ("blue star") controls.|$|R
25|$|The 56th was one {{of three}} P-47 groups in England, and the only one to {{previously}} train on the Thunderbolt. The 4th Fighter Group at RAF Debden had been created the preceding September by incorporating the veteran RAF Eagle squadrons into the USAAF, and the newly arrived 78th Fighter Group at RAF Goxhill had previously flown P-38 Lightnings. Consequently, the 56th was the only group of the three to have confidence in their aircraft despite problems of compressibility in dives, and performance teething problems that included poor rate of climb, poor acceleration, numerous <b>engine</b> <b>seizures</b> to oil counterbalance seal failures, ignition system problems, radio interference, and lack of spare parts.|$|R
50|$|Originally named {{simply the}} Eos (for the Greek goddess of the dawn), {{it was shown}} at the 1973 EAA Fly-in at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, albeit in {{incomplete}} form. When finished, it crashed on its first flight due to an <b>engine</b> <b>seizure,</b> was extensively damaged, and abandoned as too expensive to repair. Nevertheless, the aircraft was rebuilt in 1978 and re-engined with a Volkswagen engine conversion. Plans to market the design were never realised, and the prototype remains the only example ever built.|$|E
50|$|They {{entered a}} new {{motorcycle}} event in the Isle of Man in 1907 for road-touring motorcycles. The new race was to be held on the St John's Short Course with two categories for single and twin-cylinder engines. The 1907 Isle of Man TT race single cylinder-class was won by Charlie Collier riding a Matchless in 4 hours, 8 minutes and 8 seconds at an average race speed of 38.21 mph. His brother Harry Collier, also riding a Matchless, had problems with an <b>engine</b> <b>seizure</b> on lap 2 and eventually retired on lap 9.|$|E
50|$|The works Fiat Rally team fielded four cars: two Fiat Abarth X1/9 {{prototype}}s (one {{driven by}} Ferrari F1 pilot Clay Regazzoni), a mysterious Abarth SE 030 prototype {{based on the}} yet unveiled Lancia Montecarlo (which scored a remarkable second place on its first outing), and finally a Group 4 124 Abarth Rally.Lancia was only represented by the Andruet/Biche's victorious Lancia Stratos Turbo.Another notable entrant was Arturo Merzario, on an ill-prepared Jolly Club Group 5 Stratos, stopped by an <b>engine</b> <b>seizure</b> already on the first day, at Casale.Of 85 on the starting grid, 52 finished the race.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the action that earned him the Military Cross, Cole was flying a Martinsyde G.100 [...] "Elephant" [...] over Tel el Sheria when {{he was hit by}} ground fire and forced to crash land behind enemy lines; after setting his {{aircraft}} alight he was picked up and rescued by Captain Richard Williams. On 26June, following an eight-plane raid on Turkish Fourth Army headquarters in Jerusalem, Cole and another pilot suffered <b>engine</b> <b>seizures</b> while undertaking a similar rescue of a downed comrade; all three airmen were forced to walk through no man's land before being picked up by an Australian Light Horse patrol.|$|R

50|$|During the {{occupation}} of France in the Second World War, Boulanger refused to meet Dr. Ferdinand Porsche or communicate with the German authorities except through intermediaries. He organized a 'go slow' of production of trucks for the Wehrmacht, {{many of which were}} sabotaged at the factory, by putting the notch on the oil dipstick in the wrong place resulting in <b>engine</b> <b>seizure.</b> In 1944 when the Gestapo headquarters in Paris was sacked by members of the French Resistance, his name was prominent on a German blacklist of the most important 'Enemies of the Reich' to be arrested {{in the event of an}} allied invasion of France.|$|E
50|$|Flight tests {{revealed}} excessive vibration, insufficient tail rotor thrust, {{as well as}} engine and main rotor gearbox overheating. These teething troubles were addressed during the development programme and type approval was given in 1977, despite a fatal crash of a prototype on 7 August 1972 at Princess Ridge (Gongzhuling, 公主岭) in Jilin province, killing all 6 occupants including the pilot, Mr. Fu Guifa (傅贵法). It was discovered {{that the cause of}} the accident was due to failure of a transmission component, resulting in <b>engine</b> <b>seizure.</b> Elimination of the seizure problem resulted in 11 design changes as well as those to rectify flight test faults.|$|E

50|$|During 1949, the Soviet Union {{provided}} surplus Yak-9P (VK-107) {{aircraft to}} some satellite {{states in the}} Soviet bloc {{in order to help}} them rebuild their air forces {{in the wake of the}} West Berlin blockade. A section of the aircraft's operating manual was accidentally omitted from the translation from Russian into some languages: before starting the Yak-9, it was necessary to hand-crank a small cockpit-mounted oil pump 25 times to provide initial lubrication to the Klimov V12 engine, unlike World War II German and Western fighters equipped with forced closed-cycle lubrication systems. Skipping this unusual but vital step resulted in frequent <b>engine</b> <b>seizures</b> during the takeoff roll and initial climb, causing several fatalities during 1950.|$|R
40|$|The 757 / 767 {{internal}} drive generator (IDG), which provides 400 Hz/ 120 volt ac {{power to the}} aircraft cabin experiences failures due to seizure of the scavenger drive pump and/or axial gears on the main drive shaft of the unit. These generators {{are an integral part}} of the aircraft`s engines sitting outboard, inside the <b>engine</b> cowling. The <b>seizure</b> of gears represents a significant loss with gear replacement estimated at $ 17, 000 and unit replacement costs at $ 250, 000. One of the U. S. commercial airline companies engaged Oak Ridge National Laboratory in a brief study to determine if a methodology could be developed to interrogate and diagnose gear wear with the ultimate goal of deploying an instrument for test stand and flight line use. Through a structured analysis it was determined that accelerometers mapped with higher order spectral analysis (HOSA) and/or wavelets could provide an analytic approach and basis for a diagnostic sensor/system capable of assessing IDG gear wear on the aircraft or the test stand...|$|R
50|$|Over the years, {{the cause}} of the {{accident}} was the subject to significant controversy. The original cause of the crash was attributed to a spill left on the track during the 350cc race when Walter Villa's Benelli began smoking and leaking oil on the penultimate lap. Race officials failed to remove the spillage prior to the 250cc race, and one rider, John Dodds, made his concerns known to authorities, only to meet with threats of ejection from the circuit by police. However, some articles have appeared showing photos of Pasolini's bike consistent with <b>engine</b> <b>seizure,</b> locking the rear wheel and causing the crash. Further the official inquiry into the accident, issued in September 1973 found that {{the cause of}} the accident was the seizure of the engine in the motorcycle of Renzo Pasolini.|$|E
5000|$|This type of clutch is {{designed}} to partially disengage or [...] "slip" [...] when the rear wheel tries to drive the engine faster than it would run under its own power. The engine braking forces in conventional clutches will normally be transmitted back along the drive chain causing the rear wheel to hop, chatter or lose traction. This is especially noted on larger displacement four-stroke engines, which have greater engine braking than their two-stroke or smaller displacement counterparts. Slipper clutches eliminate this extra loading on the rear suspension giving riders a more predictable ride and {{minimize the risk of}} over-revving the engine during downshifts. Slipper clutches can also prevent a catastrophic rear wheel lockup in case of <b>engine</b> <b>seizure.</b> Generally, the amount of force needed to disengage the clutch is adjustable to suit the application.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} an experimental study concerning {{the feasibility of}} using bio-oil obtained from flash pyrolysis of wood for fuelling diesel power plants. The research is based on various tests aimed at verifying relevant operative characteristics of the fuel: spray analyses, engine tests, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), single-drop reactor tests and corrosion tests. The spray analyses show that the achievement of a satisfactory atomisation with flash-pyrolysis oil is problematic. The engine experimentation shows that flash-pyrolysis oil needs to be modified or mixed (e. g. with alcohol) to make self ignition possible. Besides, unacceptable build-up of carbonaceous deposits, injection system clamping and <b>engine</b> <b>seizure</b> occur. Very large char generation is the main finding of the tests in the TGA apparatus and in the single-drop atmospheric reactor (“drop-tube”). The corrosion tests demonstrate that steel undergoes fast erosion by contact of flash-pyrolysis oil. All these findings show that characteristics of current-production flash-pyrolysis oil are not suited for its utilisation in diesel engines...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} paper presents {{load analysis}} of propulsion engine during ship’s speed acceleration. This process {{is carried out}} after manoeuvring in order to receive, as fast as possible, exploitation speeds of the ship, achieved during the voyage. The analysis concerns direct propulsion power system of low-speed engine of constant pitch propeller. Wrong steering process of engine load changes in temporary states, can cause engine overloading, {{as the result of}} its operation on the external limiting characteristic and can end up in <b>engine</b> <b>seizure.</b> Control of engine operation is carried on through selecting of adequate setting of rotational speed governor, which for specified external conditions can result in adequate position of fuel link and the choice of adequate fuel index arm dose. Equalization of the power delivered by the engine in given conditions of work with power required by the ship’s propeller cooperating with the hull, will establish adequate rotational speed of the engine and finally the speed of the vessel. In order to speed up the sip’s motion, there must occur an overflow of propeller thrust over the required thrust (resistance) and this, in turn, is connected with the necessity to ensure the engine power surplus over the power required for a given range of operation or in other words sailing speed. This article presents the working model of ship propelling system during speed acceleration and concerns mainly non-overload running of the engine. The model described above has been verified during tests in real conditions at sea...|$|E
40|$|Liquids and gases {{produced}} through biomass pyrolysis {{have potential}} as renewable fuels to replace fossil fuels in conventional internal combustion engines. This review compares {{the properties of}} pyrolysis fuels, produced {{from a variety of}} feedstocks and using different pyrolysis techniques, against those of fossil fuels. High acidity, the presence of solid particles, high water content, high viscosity, storage and thermal instability, and low energy content are typical characteristics of pyrolysis liquids. A survey of combustion, performance and exhaust emission results from the use of pyrolysis liquids (both crude and up-graded) in compression ignition engines is presented. With only a few exceptions, most authors have reported difficulties associated with the adverse properties of pyrolysis liquids, including: corrosion and clogging of the injectors, long ignition delay and short combustion duration, difficulty in engine start-up, unstable operation, coking of the piston and cylinders and subsequent <b>engine</b> <b>seizure.</b> Pyrolysis gas can be used more readily, either in spark ignition or compression ignition engines; however, NO reduction techniques are desirable. Various approaches to improve the properties of pyrolysis liquids are discussed and a comparison of the properties of up-graded vs. crude pyrolysis liquid is included. Further developments in up-gradation techniques, such as hydrocracking and bio-refinery approaches, could lead to the production of green diesel and green gasoline. Modifications required to engines for use with pyrolysis liquids, for example in the fuel supply and injection systems, are discussed. Storage stability and economic issues are also reviewed. Our study presents recent progress and important R&D areas for successful future use of pyrolysis fuels in internal combustion engines...|$|E
