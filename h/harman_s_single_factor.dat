However, there are few studies focusing on the preparation of its freeze-drying powder. This paper investigated the effect of lyoprotectants on the freeze-drying survival rate {{and the number of}} viable cells for vacuum freezedried powder of <b>S.</b> boulardii. <b>Single</b> <b>factor</b> experiment and Plackett-Burman design were conducted to obtain the optimal compound lyoprotectant formulations. The result showed that lactose, trehalose and sodium glutamate could significantly enhance the freeze-drying survival rate of S. boulardii. Meanwhile, all these three lyoprotectants showed positive effect on the freezedrying survival rate of the yeast, and the optimal lyoprotectant composition for S. boulardii was as follows: 18 g/ 100 mL lactose, 18 g/ 100 mL trehalose and 3 g/ 100 mL sodium glutamate...|$|R

The results indicate that a one-factor model was not completely adequate from a statistical point of view.

30|$|Since {{the data}} were {{collected}} from single informants we assessed common method bias using Harman’s [77] <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> test and a modified marker variable test [78 - 80]. Assessing the data using Harman’s <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> approach we found no <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> emerged from a factor analysis of all survey items. No one factor accounted {{for the majority of the}} variance in the model with one factor explaining only 33 % [78]. In addition to the Harman’s <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> approach we also performed Lindell and Whitney’s [81] marker variable test. We assessed the correlation between a theoretically unrelated construct (marker variable) and the other constructs. The results from the model indicate that the marker variable did not have any significant influence on the endogenous latent variables. Based on these results we conclude that common method bias does not seem to be a limiting factor in this model.|$|R
40|$|Through the {{analysis}} of four factors such as grain size, wheel speed, grinding depth and feed rate and the data obtained from the interaction between factors in orthogonal test, it is proved that grain size, playing a leading part, has the greatest effect on surface roughness. It is {{also found that the}} interaction between grain size and wheel speed has more effects than the <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> of wheel speed on the surface roughness, and meanwhile, the interaction between grain size and grinding depth has more effects than the <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> of grinding depth, and the interaction between grain size and workpiece speed has more effects than the <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> of workpiece speed. As a result, every grinding parameter should be determined in accordance with the law of the effect imposed on surface roughness by the interaction between grain size and grinding amount rather than that of <b>single</b> <b>factor.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Behind {{the media}} and {{political}} attention focused on California prisons, which are plagued with severe levels of crowding, and a federal court {{order to reduce the}} inmate population by over 40, 000, lies one of California's best-kept secrets: the state's youth correctional custodial population has declined over 80 % in just over the past decade. Just since 2004 the California Youth Authority (CYA) population declined by over 5, 000 inmates. The state has already closed five major juvenile facilities and four forestry camps for juvenile offenders. A number of factors have contributed significantly to the drop in the population of the CYA. The most frequently cited is the very negative media publicity in the early 2000 s about the conditions inside facilities, the case of Farrell v. Harper in 2003, and realignment legislation passed in 2007 that required that more youthful offenders be managed at the county level. However, the CYA population began declining as early as 1997. The trend towards increased costs for counties to send youth to the CYA, and doubt that the CYA was an appropriate setting for many of the youth being sent there, had already begun in the late 1990 <b>s.</b> While no <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> accounts for the drastic change in the CYA population, the research presented here points to multiple forces that came together in the mid- to late- 1990 s and early 2000 s to change public perception, judicial behaviors, probation programs, sentencing policies, and state funding streams. We also find that this population reduction is particularly notable because it did not result in an increase in juvenile crime, as some had erroneously predicted...|$|R

3000|$|The {{physical}} {{principles that}} affect fault sealing include principal stress sealing, lithological allocation sealing, shale smear sealing, time allocation sealing and occurrence allocation sealing (Liu 1998). <b>Single</b> <b>factors</b> include fault properties, fault plane pressure, lithological allocation, fault dip angle, shale smear and fault active time. Thus, being affected by numerous factors, fault sealing shows very strong complexity and randomness. Fortunately, the fuzzy evaluation method can take {{various types of}} <b>single</b> <b>factors</b> that affect fault sealing into consideration, and hence realize a comprehensive evaluation using the principle of fuzzy transformation and maximum membership degree. Using this mathematical method, fault sealing properties can be effectively identified. The process is as follows: First, based on regional geology and fault development, the <b>single</b> <b>factors</b> that affect fault sealing are selected and quantified {{in order to obtain}} a single-factor quantization matrix U_n × 1 (n is the number of <b>single</b> <b>factors).</b> Then, based on the general division of fault sealing and regional requirements, the number of evaluation grades is divided (m). Finally, a single-factor membership degree matrix is constructed {{based on the number of}} evaluation grades and the oil and gas exploration results of the work area, V_ 1 × m, based on which, U_n × 1 is evaluated in order to construct a fuzzy evaluation matrix R_n × m = U_n × 1 · V_ 1 × m. Since each <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> has different contributions to fault sealing, once the weighted matrix of each <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> is provided, W_ 1 × n, the fuzzy evaluation matrix B_ 1 × m = W_ 1 × n · R_n × m can be obtained. Finally, the maximum value of the fuzzy evaluation matrix B 1 ×m [...] is taken as the corresponding evaluation grades.|$|R

40|$|I {{estimate}} a <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> {{model of}} Swiss exchange rates during World War I for {{five of the}} primary belligerents: Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. At {{the outbreak of the}} war these nations suspended convertibility of their currencies into gold with the promise that after the war each would restore convertibility at the old par. However, once convertibility was suspended, each currency became a state-contingent claim; after the war it would pay off at (or near) the old par if the country won or pay off significantly less than par (perhaps nothing) if the country lost. The <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> extracted from the five exchange rates appears to contain information on contemporaries' expectations about the war's outcome.

2500|$|Napier (1963) {{argued that}} it was very {{unlikely}} that <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> drove the evolution of Bipedalism. He stated [...] "It seems unlikely that any <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> was responsible for such a dramatic change in behaviour. In addition to the advantages of accruing from ability to carry objects - food or otherwise - the improvement of the visual range and the freeing of the hands for purposes of defence and offence must equally have played their part as catalysts.” [...] Sigmon argued that chimpanzees demonstrate bipedalism in different contexts, and one <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> should be used to explain bipedalism: preadaptation for human bipedalism. Day (1986) emphasized three major pressures that drove evolution of bipedalism 1.food acquisition 2. predator avoidance 3. Reproductive success. Ko (2015) states there are two questions regarding bipedalism 1. Why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal 2. why did hominins become more bipedal over time. He argues that these questions can be answered with combination of prominent theories such as Savanna-based, Postural feeding, and Provisioning.|$|R
