25|$|Moringa oleifera is {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} species of the genus Moringa, {{which is the only}} genus in the family Moringaceae. English common names include: moringa, drumstick tree (from the appearance of the long, slender, triangular seed-pods), <b>horseradish</b> <b>tree</b> (from the taste of the roots, which resembles horseradish), ben oil tree, or benzoil tree (from the oil which is derived from the seeds). It is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree, native to the southern foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India, and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas where its young seed pods and leaves are used as vegetables. It can also be used for water purification and hand washing, and is sometimes used in herbal medicine.|$|E

40|$|A West German {{research}} team has discovered - by accident - {{a tree in}} the Sudan whose seeds can render drinking water safe. Moringa oleafera (the <b>horseradish</b> <b>tree)</b> {{has been used by}} villagers to remove from their water the mud washed down from the African highlands during the annual floods. Village women grind up the seeds and shake them up with clean water to make a concentrated solution which they add to river water. They stir the mixture for fve minutes, then allow the suspended material to settle for one or two hours; this removes most of the turbidity. Experiments bv Dr Samia Al Azharia Jahn have shown that the active agents in the seeds are polypeptides, which act as polyelectrolytes, binding large numbers of individual mud and clay particles to give a single heavy particle. In addition, Moringa seeds appear to have powerful pungent oils which have antimicrobial properties, and faecal coliform bactena the standard indicators of sewage pollution- are also removed with the mud particles.

40|$|Engineers {{from the}} Department of Microbiology at the University of Leicester are testing a {{prototype}} water decontamination system using seeds {{from the tree}} Moringa oleifera. This tree popularly called the <b>horseradish</b> <b>tree,</b> is widespread in Africa, India and Indonesia. The seeds contain proteins which make the particles in cloudy and contaminated water coagulate. The coagulated particles then settle, taking with them many of the bacteria and viruses that cause water-borne diseases. This method of purification saves {{the use of the}} more usual, but much more expensive, aluminium sulphate, thus saving scarce foreign exchange. Currently a trial project, funded by the UK's Overseas Development Administration (ODA), to test the prototype plant is being conducted in Malawi. Prior to this, the British team also worked with the Forestry Research Institute of Malawi to establish plantations of 4500 horseradish trees at three differing geographical locations. Further research is being undertaken to discover more about the biological activity of the protein coagulant, which accounts for around 30 - 40 % of the weight of each seed. It is thought that the protein acts as a 'polyelectrolyte', cross-linking charged particles.

40|$|You {{may know}} {{it as the}} <b>horseradish</b> <b>tree,</b> {{drumstick}} tree, ben tree, benzolive tree or Nebeda: the Moringaceae group of 14 species of which Moringa oleifera is the best-known. Modern enthusiasts rediscovering Moringa call it the Miracle tree because of its many uses. In Africa its leaves are used in medicine and in cooking, and, latterly, as dietary supplements for AIDS/HIV patients; in India its pods are preferred; its oil was used in Egypt 3, 000 years ago in perfume, and in Jamaica 200 years ago in cooking. The water cleansing qualities of its dirt-gathering (coagulant) powdered seeds have been known for centuries in Sudan, India and Indonesia. Encouraging its use and expanding its cultivation from family farms to plantation scale were the major topics of a workshop on the 'Development potential for Moringa products' held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, from 29 October to 2 November 2001. Organised by the plant resources network PROPAGE, in collaboration with CTA and four other partners, it was attended by more than 100 practitioners from public and private bodies from five continents. A productive workshop it was too (though perhaps not a miracle) with 22 practical proposals for research on genetic improvement, intensive cultivation, uses in fruit storage, improved oil extraction and market development.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize isolates of biovar 2 of Ralstonia solanacearum pathogenic to eucalyptus “urograndis” hybrid by means of biochemical tests, as well as evaluation of host range and identification by PCR with primers for species, biovar and phylotype. Carbohydrate utilization assays revealed that the eucalyptus isolates belong to phenotype Tropical of biovar 2 (2 T). From artificial inoculations it was possible to reproduce symptoms or recover the bacterium from: eucalyptus, potato, tomato, eggplant, datura, geranium, turnip, mustard, nasturtium, beetroot, sunflower, bean, French marigold, <b>horseradish</b> <b>tree,</b> and cashew. The PCR assays confirmed that the isolates belong to biovar 2, phylotype II of the bacterium.

40|$|Moringa oleifera, or the <b>horseradish</b> <b>tree,</b> is a pan-tropical {{species that}} is known by such {{regional}} names as benzolive, drumstick tree, kelor, marango, mlonge, mulangay, nébéday, saijhan, and sajna. Over the past two decades, many reports have appeared in mainstream scientific journals describing its nutritional and medicinal properties. Its utility as a non-food product has also been extensively described, but will not be discussed herein, (e. g. lumber, charcoal, fencing, water clarification, lubricating oil). As with many reports of the nutritional or medicinal value of a natural product, there are an alarming number of purveyors of “healthful ” food who are now promoting M. oleifera as a panacea. While much of this recent enthusiasm indeed appears to be justified, {{it is critical to}} separate rigorous scientific evidence from anecdote. Those who charge a premium for products containing Moringa spp. must be held to a high standard. Those who promote the cultivation and use of Moringa spp. in regions where hope is in short supply must be provided with the best available evidence, so as not to raise false hopes and to encourage the most fruitful use of scarce research capital. It is the purpose of this series of brief reviews to: (a) critically evaluate the published scientific evidence on M. oleifera, (b) highlight claims from the traditional and tribal medicinal lore and from non-peer reviewed sources that would benefit from further, rigorous scientific evaluation, and (c) suggest directions for future clinical research that could be carried out by local investigators in developing regions...|$|E
40|$|Moringa oleifera (<b>horseradish</b> <b>tree</b> - English) is a {{perennial}} plant, {{which has been}} found to possess high economic and cultural values in many countries of the world. This study was carried out to analyse the socio-cultural perception about Moringa oleifera according to farmers’ gender in Southwestern Nigeria. It specifically established the correlates of perception of Moringa oleifera among the farmers; described the socio-demographics of the farmers; examined the gender gaps in the level of awareness and propagation of Moringa oleifera; compared their willingness to adopt innovation on Moringa oleifera and analysed the constraints associated with men’s and women’s propagation of Moringa oleifera. A snow-ball sampling technique was used to select equal number of male and female respondents across the region. The results revealed amongst others, that widowhood and illiteracy were the likely interlocking system, which has reshaped oppression among the female respondents. Statistically significant gender gaps or inequalities at P ≤ 0. 05 level, existed in the level of awareness (F = 6. 29), propagation (F = 15. 56), willingness to adopt innovation (F = 12. 61) and socio-cultural perception of Moringa oleifera (F = 11. 34). The study concluded that the gender differential gaps could reverse the gains of innovations on Moringa oleifera by limiting the adoption of innovation and propagation of the plant among the farm families. It, therefore, recommended that the generated innovations should be properly screened to ensure that they do not upset the delicate economic power balance between {{men and women in the}} farming sector or widen the gender inequalities or create other vectors of oppression. So, policies that encourage women’s literacy as well as access to innovations and farm labour, most especially amongst the widows are indispensable in enhancing socio-cultural perceptions and adoption of innovation as well as propagation of Moringa oleifera for sustainable development in Southwest Nigeria...|$|E
