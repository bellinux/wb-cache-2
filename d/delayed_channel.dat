Because high priority flows have low channel utilization, the low priority flows throughputs can be amerced further. By introducing an additional delay at the MAC layer, before the channel access scheduling, it will retain aggregate sizes at higher numbers and consequently a better channel utilization. Also, {{in order to support}} both UDP and TCP transport layer protocols, the algorithm’s operational conditions are kept adaptive.

Thus far, good upper bounds on the capacities as well as computable capacities of general non-controllable FSCs with/without feedback are unknown. Here we consider the <b>delayed</b> <b>channel</b> state {{as part of the}} channel input and then mathematically define the directed information between the new channel input (including the source and the <b>delayed</b> <b>channel</b> state) and the channel output. With this technique, computable upper bounds on the capacities of non-controllable FSCs with/without feedback are developed. The upper bounds are achieved by conditional Markov sources, conditioned on the delayed feedback and the delayed state information.

With this scheme we show that the 2 user X channel with only <b>delayed</b> <b>channel</b> state information at the transmitters can achieve 8 / 7 DoF, while the interfer-ence channel with 3 users is able to achieve 9 / 8 DoF.

30|$|Many {{other models}} for imprecise network {{information}} {{have been considered}} for interference networks. These models range from having no channel state information at the sources [10 – 13], <b>delayed</b> <b>channel</b> state information [14 – 19], mismatched <b>delayed</b> <b>channel</b> state knowledge [20 – 22], or analog channel state feedback for fully connected interference channels [23]. Most of these works assume fully connected network or {{a small number of}} users. For networks with arbitrary connectivity, the first attempt to understand the role of limited network knowledge was initiated in [24, 25] in the context of single-layer networks. The authors used a message-passing abstraction of network protocols to formalize the notion of local view. The key result of [24, 25] is that local-view-based (decentralized) decisions can be either sum rate optimal or can be arbitrarily worse than the global-view (centralized) sum capacity. In this work, we focus on multi-layer setting and we show that several important additional ingredients are needed compared to the single-layer scenario.|$|E

We propose a first construction for the precoder which matches the previous results at infinite SNR yet reaches a useful trade-off between interference alignment and signal enhancement at finite SNR, allowing for significant performance improvements in practical settings. We present two general precoding methods with arbitrary number of users by means of virtual MMSE and mutual information optimization, achieving good compromise between signal enhancement and interference alignment.

40|$|Noncontrollable finite-state {{channels}} (FSCs) are FSCs {{in which}} the channel inputs have no influence on the channel states, i. e., the channel states evolve freely. Since single-letter formulae for the channel capacities are rarely available for general noncontrollable FSCs, computable bounds are usually utilized to numerically bound the capacities. In this paper, we take the <b>delayed</b> <b>channel</b> state {{as part of the}} channel input and then define the directed information rate from the new channel input (including the source and the <b>delayed</b> <b>channel</b> state) sequence to the channel output sequence. With this technique, we derive a series of upper bounds on the capacities of noncontrollable FSCs with/without feedback. These upper bounds can be achieved by conditional Markov sources and computed by solving an average reward per stage stochastic control problem (ARSCP) with a compact state space and a compact action space. By showing that the ARSCP has a uniformly continuous reward function, we transform the original ARSCP into a finite-state and finite-action ARSCP that can be solved by a value iteration method. Under a mild assumption, the value iteration algorithm is convergent and delivers a near-optimal stationary policy and a numerical upper bound.
