The e-mail consists of a promotion of and <b>installation</b> <b>instruction</b> for an imaginary antivirus product purported to remove unknown infections from the computer. While infection cannot occur until the attached worm is renamed and opened, it could spread to system folders {{in a matter of}} seconds. It is known to shut down or hang Windows Vista and Windows 7 when attempts to write on the system drive are denied by said operating systems. Also, the worm hides folders and makes them [...] "super hidden" [...] so that data contained in them are not easily accessed. Precision key logging is the main threat associated with Daprosy infection. Logged keystrokes containing sensitive data could be sent to its author using the worm’s improvised mailing system. Early strains are known to destabilize, corrupt and even stall the operating system due to programming bugs. Said strains appear to be incomplete and were probably created by students or amateur Visual Basic programmers as evidenced by using VB decompilers. Final or later releases of Daprosy worm are prolific online game password stealers. They also pose great threats to banking and other e-commerce establishments.|$|E

30|$|Our {{implementation}} {{consists of}} five steps. First, {{we set up}} the website and connect the website with the MySQL according to the <b>Installation</b> <b>Instruction</b> of the CodeIgniter’s website (EllisLab). Second, we create two MySQL tables named “Extended Access Log Table” and “User Information Table” {{that are responsible for}} recording accesses and saving users’ information. Third, we modify the server-side scripts. We rewrite all functions on generating URLs to make sure all links of our website have URL markers and are encrypted. We also modify the main controller of the website. The main controller is the entry of the website and this class is responsible for generating pages after the server receives requests. To handle the encrypted URLs of each request, we add a new function in the main controller to decrypt the encrypted URL and separate markers from the entire link. Then the function inspects the user identity. If the user is not a known crawler, we record this access as an extended access log, return the related page to user, and conduct heuristic detection for this request. Fourth, we install and run the monitoring program on the server side. The program is written in C language and it is responsible for finding out suspicious users and passing their long sessions’ features to machine learning program. When one long session is marked as suspicious, the monitoring program updates the corresponding user’s identity in “User Information Table”. Lastly, we install the machine learning program based on the code of LIBSVM (Chang and Lin 2011) at the server side to first detect crawlers and then further identify the type of the crawler. The results are sent to the monitoring program.|$|E

40|$|Challenges {{of energy}} security, low carbon transitions, and {{electricity}} network constraints {{have led to}} a shift to new, efficient technologies for household energy services. Studies of such technological innovations usually focus on consumer information and changes in behaviour to realise their full potential. We suggest that regarding such technologies in existing energy provision systems opens up questions concerning how and why such interventions are delivered. We argue that we must understand the ways by which energy systems are co-constituted through the habits and expectations of households, their technologies and appliances, alongside arrangements associated with large-scale socio-technical infrastructures. Drawing on research with air-source-to-water heat pumps (ASWHP), installed as part of a large trans-disciplinary, utility-led research and demonstration project in the north of England, we investigate how energy services provision and everyday practice shapes new technologies uptake, and how such technologies mediate and reconfigure relations between users, providers and infrastructure networks. While the installation of ASWHP has led to role differentiation through which energy services are provided, the space for new forms of co-provision to emerge is limited by existing commitments to delivering energy services. Simultaneously, new forms of interdependency emerge between users, providers and intermediaries through sites of <b>installation,</b> <b>instruction,</b> repair and feedback. We find that although new technologies do lead to the rearrangement of practices, this is often disrupted by obduracy in the conventions and habits around domestic heating and hot water practices that have been established in relation to existing systems of provision. Rather being simply a matter of increasing levels of knowledge {{in order to ensure that}} such technologies are adopted effi ciently and effectively, our paper demonstrates how systemic arrangements of energy provision and everyday practice are co-implicated in socio-technical innovation by changing the nature of energy supply and use...|$|E
