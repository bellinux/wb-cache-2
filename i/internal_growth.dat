40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to analyze and predict the influence of damage containment features that enhance damage tolerance in unitized structures, and to characterize the internal three dimensional crack growth behavior in integrally stiffened panels. To accomplish these research goals, both surface and <b>internal</b> crack <b>growth</b> were measured and analyzed, and a new analysis concept method was introduced to characterize the <b>internal</b> crack <b>growth</b> behavior. ^ Unitized structure {{is an important issue}} in the aerospace industry, since it has a significant economic advantage. There are, however, potential damage tolerance problems. Damage Containment Features (DCF), that retard or arrest fatigue crack growth, are one proposed solution for enhanced damage tolerance in unitized structures. For DCF design applications, it is essential to understand the relation between surface and <b>internal</b> fatigue crack <b>growth</b> behavior for obtaining maximum structural advantage. ^ Four DCF configurations were fatigue tested to investigate the characteristics of the surface and <b>internal</b> fatigue crack <b>growth</b> behavior in unitized structures. The results of surface and <b>internal</b> crack <b>growth</b> analyses clearly showed the characteristic reduction in fatigue crack growth rate as the crack grows into DCF. Subsequent stress intensity factors analysis also supported this DCF effect. A parametric study with various DCF geometries suggested a design factor that might be considered in designing unitized structures. The study suggested that internal fatigue crack shape change patterns could be determined by employing an Ellipse model approach. Moreover, these reconstructed elliptic crack model could provide the numerical representations of crack fronts for FEM analyses. ^ The results of this study are used to characterize and explain surface and <b>internal</b> fatigue crack <b>growth</b> behavior in unitized structures. All of the experimental data analyses were presented in tabular forms and figures. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} some of {{the health}} and economic concerns when dairies expand by <b>internal</b> herd <b>growth</b> and purchasing new animals. Recent {{research has shown that}} increased stocking density leads to decreased milk production, decreased reproductive performance, and increased lameness incidence. The limit of animal stocking density during an expansion must be carefully monitored to reduce animal illness, ensure economic profitability, and provide adequate facilities for the animals. Surveyed dairy producers admit to decreasing their biosecurity when purchasing animals for quantum growth. Appropriate vaccinations and quarantine will help reduce disease outbreaks.

25|$|In theory, {{slavery in}} Islamic {{law does not}} have a racial or color component, {{although}} this has not always been the case in practice. Slaves played various social and economic roles, from domestic worker to high-ranking positions in the government like Emir. Moreover, slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, pastoralism, and the army. Some rulers even relied on military and administrative slaves {{to such a degree that}} they seized power. In some cases, the treatment of slaves was so harsh that it led to uprisings, such as the Zanj Rebellion. However, this was an exception rather than the norm, as the vast majority of labor in the medieval Islamic world consisted of free, paid labour. For a variety of reasons, <b>internal</b> <b>growth</b> of the slave population was not enough to fulfill the demand in Muslim society. This resulted in massive importation, which involved enormous suffering and loss of life from the capture and transportation of slaves from non-Muslim lands.|$|E

Stark writes that the [...] "characteristics of the earliest members of a movement will tend to be reproduced in subsequent converts." [...] A significant percentage of Scientists remained single (Eddy placed little emphasis on marriage and family), or became Scientists when their children were adults and unlikely to be converted. Christian Science did not have missionaries, so it relied on <b>internal</b> <b>growth,</b> but the conversion rate within families was not high. In a study cited by Stark, of 80 people raised within Christian Science just 26 (33 percent) became Scientists themselves.|$|E

60|$|The Professor {{obtained}} {{his first}} hint of the new body by a mere accident. His friend, the Deputy Prosector of the Zoological Society, had mixed a draught for a sick raccoon at the Gardens, and, by some mistake in a bottle, had mixed it wrongly. (I purposely refrain from mentioning the ingredients, as they are drugs which can be easily obtained in isolation at any chemist's, though when compounded they form {{one of the most}} dangerous and difficult to detect of organic poisons. I do not desire to play into the hands of would-be criminals.) The compound on which the Deputy Prosector had thus accidentally lighted sent the raccoon to sleep in the most extraordinary manner. Indeed, the raccoon slept for thirty-six hours on end, all attempts to awake him, by pulling his tail or tweaking his hair being quite unavailing. This was a novelty in narcotics; so Sebastian was asked to come and look at the slumbering brute. He suggested the attempt to perform an operation on the somnolent raccoon by removing, under the influence of the drug, an <b>internal</b> <b>growth,</b> which was considered the probable cause of his illness. A surgeon was called in, the growth was found and removed, and the raccoon, to everybody's surprise, continued to slumber peacefully on his straw for five hours afterwards. At the end of that time he awoke, and stretched himself as if nothing had happened; and though he was, of course, very weak from loss of blood, he immediately displayed a most royal hunger. He ate up all the maize that was offered him for breakfast, and proceeded to manifest a desire for more by most unequivocal symptoms.|$|E
