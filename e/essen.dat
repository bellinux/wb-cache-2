5|$|During the {{domestic}} cup, Frauen DFB Pokal, Winters scored three goals: two during Potsdam's 5–3 win over SGS <b>Essen</b> on October 7, 2012 and the game-winning goal against SC 07 Bad Neuenahr. During the 2012-13 UEFA Women's Champions League, she scored a {{goal in the}} team's 3–4 loss to Arsenal L.F.C.. Winters made three Champions League appearances helping lift the club to the Round of 16.|$|E
5|$|Hibs {{played their}} first tie against Rot-Weiss <b>Essen,</b> winning 4–0 in the Georg-Melches-Stadion and drawing 1–1 at Easter Road. They {{defeated}} Djurgårdens IF {{to reach the}} semi-final, but in that tie they were defeated 3–0 on aggregate by Stade Reims, who had the famous France international player Raymond Kopa in their side. Reims lost 4–3 to Real Madrid in the Final.|$|E

5|$|During {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} war, most of the company's branch offices were destroyed, and {{employees}} in the East fled the Soviet advance. The head office in <b>Essen</b> suffered a direct hit from a bomb in March 1945, and regional offices and construction centres in Danzig, Halle, Katowice, Königsberg, Kraków, Leipzig and Magdeburg were lost as the territory they were in was allotted to Poland or the Soviet Zone of occupation. As Eugen Vögler was {{on the run from}} the new authorities, he was replaced as CEO by Artur Konrad.|$|E
5|$|Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft is a German {{construction}} {{company based in}} <b>Essen,</b> North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Hochtief is Germany's largest {{construction company}} and operates globally, ranking {{as one of the}} largest general construction companies in the United States through its Turner subsidiary, and in Australia through a 53.43% shareholding in CIMIC Group. In 2010 it employed more than 70,000 employees across five corporate divisions. One of these, Hochtief Concessions, is a major airport operator. The others are involved with construction project planning, finance, construction and operation. Work done in 2010 was €23.23 billion, with more than 80% coming from operations outside Germany.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, home matches {{were mostly}} played in smaller towns with no {{professional}} football clubs. As the team became more successful, {{especially after the}} World Cup win in 2003, the number of spectators rose accordingly. Today, the team usually plays in stadiums with 10,000 to 25,000 seats. The ten largest German cities have only hosted five international matches. The team have played twice in Frankfurt and Berlin, and once Hamburg. Bremen, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, <b>Essen,</b> Cologne, Munich and Stuttgart have never hosted an international match of the women's team.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, 2012, it was {{announced}} that Winters would join German Bundesliga side 1. FFC Turbine Potsdam effective July 1, 2012. During the team's season opener against VfL Sindelfingen, she scored the first goal helping her team win 9–1. Her second goal on the season came during the 45th minute of Potsdam's 5–1 victory over SGS <b>Essen</b> on November 4, 2012. She made nine appearances for the team during the 2012–2013 season, including eight starts.|$|E
5|$|The PWG World Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling world championship owned and copyrighted by Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG). The championship was created and debuted on August 30, 2003, at PWG's Bad Ass Mother 3000 – Stage 2 event. Originally called the PWG Championship, the title was renamed to the PWG World Championship in February 2006 after the title was defended outside the United States {{for the first and}} second time—that month, then-champion Joey Ryan defeated Emil Sitoci in <b>Essen,</b> Germany at European Vacation – Germany and Jonny Storm in Orpington, England at European Vacation – England.|$|E
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis <b>Essen</b> and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century much {{progress}} was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, Louis <b>Essen</b> determined the speed as , using cavity resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of caesium-133.|$|E
5|$|John Preston Hippisley {{inherited}} {{the house in}} 1956 {{on the death of}} his father Richard John Bayntun Hippisley and in order to settle the liability for inheritance tax he sold Ston Easton. Subsequently maintenance of the building was poor and the fabric decayed. In 1958 a Preservation Order was obtained to stop the building being demolished and adding to the growing trend of destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain. Restoration was undertaken by William Rees-Mogg who bought the building in 1964. Peter Smedley bought it from Rees-Mogg in 1977 or 1978 and carried out further restoration and converted it into a hotel. Notoriously he allowed the BBC to film his Dignitas assisted suicide. The house was sold again in 2001 to Von <b>Essen</b> Hotels.|$|E
5|$|Balmer relinquished {{command of}} No.100 Squadron in April 1943, and was posted from the South West Pacific to the European theatre that June. His planned {{secondment}} to the RAF was for two years. Partly {{in an effort}} to bolster Australian aspirations to form a distinct RAAF group within RAF Bomber Command, in August he was appointed commanding officer of No.467 Squadron, based at RAF Bottesford, Leicestershire. The squadron had been raised under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme, and operated Avro Lancaster heavy bombers. Balmer led his unit in a costly raid on Nuremberg the night of 27/28August, before attacking Hanover in September and October. From its new base at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, Balmer then took No.467 Squadron through the Battle of Berlin that commenced in November 1943 and continued until March 1944. The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50 per cent, and during the Battle of Berlin, loss rates were far higher. No.467 Squadron was the only Australian unit to take part in all sixteen heavy attacks against the German capital during the battle. In the same period it also raided Frankfurt, Leipzig, Stettin, Stuttgart, <b>Essen,</b> and Augsburg.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{forces had}} {{performed}} diversionary {{attacks on the}} outskirts of the city on two consecutive nights in order to tire the defenders, and at midnight on February 11, 1659, the main attack commenced. The main spearhead of the Swedish forces attacked from south of St. Jørgens lake with the King himself in overall command. A hundred cannons on Slotsholmen were brought to bear on the Swedish attackers with fast and accurate fire. The two attacking divisions advanced nevertheless, led by general-major Fabian von Fersen and general-major Johan von <b>Essen.</b> They reached the outer palisades on the ice, which were quickly breached, but the Swedes were immediately stopped by holes in the ice that the Danes had cut. The bridges they had brought were not long enough after the ice moats had been widened with the help of Dutch marines. Caught on the ice, the Swedes were in the open and subject to heavy fire. Longer bridges were eventually brought, and the attack continued towards the city walls. The battle was ferocious, with the attackers desperately trying to establish a bridgehead on the walls. But in the end, the defenders were successful and the Swedes were thrown back.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity was a {{successful}} large-scale airborne operation. All of the objectives that the airborne troops of the 17th had been tasked with had been captured and held, usually within {{only a few hours}} of the operation's beginning. The bridges over the Issel had been successfully captured, although one later had to be destroyed to prevent its capture by counter-attacking German forces. The Diersfordter Forest had been cleared of enemy troops, and the roads along which the Germans might have moved reinforcements against the advance had been cut by airborne troops. By nightfall of the 24th, the British 15th Infantry Division had joined up with elements of the British 6th Airborne Division, and by midnight the first light bridge was across the Rhine. By the 27th, twelve bridges suitable for heavy armour had been installed over the Rhine and the Allies had fourteen divisions on the east bank of the river which had penetrated up to ten miles. The division also gained its fourth Medal of Honor in the days following Operation Varsity, when Technical Sergeant Clinton Hedrick of the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment received the award posthumously after aiding in the capture of Lembeck Castle, which had been turned into a fortified position by the Germans. In terms of casualties, the 17th Airborne Division suffered a total of 1,346 casualties in the space of five days, between 24 and 29 March, when Operation Plunder came to an end. After it had participated in Operation Varsity, the 17th Airborne Division continued to advance through Germany as a part of XVIII Airborne Corps, engaging German forces around Wesel, <b>Essen</b> and Münster. When Germany unconditionally surrendered on 7 May 1945, the division was conducting occupation duties in northern Germany.|$|E
25|$|The Thirty Years' War necessitated {{the first}} {{evacuation}} of the sculpture. In 1634 the then abbess of <b>Essen,</b> Maria Clara von Spaur, Pflaum und Valör, sought shelter in Cologne {{and took the}} cathedral treasure with her. It would remain there {{until the end of}} the war in 1648. In these years the Madonna and the now lost Marsus shrine of the <b>Essen</b> treasure were paraded in processions, outshining the treasures of Cologne’s cathedral, as the annals of <b>Essen</b> Abbey proudly claim.|$|E
25|$|During World War II the <b>Essen</b> {{treasure}} {{was first}} evacuated to Warstein, then to Schloss Albrechtsburg in Saxony and finally moved to an air-raid shelter in Sieg, {{where it was}} discovered by American troops {{by the end of}} the war. Because the treasury in <b>Essen</b> had been destroyed by air raids, the Madonna could not return to its natural place until the 1950s. It was first brought to the Hessian State Museum in Marburg, then to Schloss Dyck near Rheydt. From April to June 1949 it was shown in an exhibition in Brussels, then through October in Amsterdam, and finally returned to <b>Essen.</b> Until the reconstruction of <b>Essen</b> Cathedral was completed the treasure was stored in the vault of Essen's savings bank. The Madonna has not left the city since.|$|E

25|$|The statue is dated {{around the}} year 980 and was thus created during the tenure of Mathilde, a granddaughter of Emperor Otto I, as abbess of <b>Essen</b> Abbey. Under her reign and those of her successors Sophia of Gandersheim (1012–1039) and Theophanu (1039–1058), the abbey {{acquired}} what is today considered the most precious {{of the works of}} art of the <b>Essen</b> treasury. The creator of the sculpture is unknown, but it is generally presumed to have been crafted in either Cologne or Hildesheim. Hildesheim is home to a Madonna slightly younger than the one in <b>Essen,</b> while Cologne seems more likely as the home of the artist since the folds in the Madonna’s gown resemble those of the Cross of Otto and Mathilde dated 982 which is also part of the <b>Essen</b> treasury but was doubtless created by a Cologne goldsmith as it shares many features with the Gero crucifix of Cologne Cathedral.|$|E
