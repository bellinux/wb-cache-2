60|$|The matter excited {{considerable}} {{interest in}} medical circles, {{and by the}} time that the institution was ready the number of applicants was greater than could be entertained. By this time Dr. Leeds and Netta were married. The engagement was a short one, and the wedding took place within two months of their going down into the country with Hilda. Being anxious that as many as possible should participate in the benefits of the system, the doors of the institute were at once opened to outdoor pupils, who were boarded in the neighborhood. Six of Netta's pupils in Hanover were brought over as teachers, and a few weeks from its being opened the institution was in full swing. As Dr. Leeds wished that no profit whatever be made by the undertaking, in which desire he was cordially joined by his wife and Hilda, the charges were extremely low, except in the case of children of wealthy parents, the surplus in their case being devoted to taking in, <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> children of the poor.|$|E

5000|$|Settlement {{involves}} {{the delivery of}} securities from one party to another. Delivery usually takes place against payment known as delivery versus payment, but some deliveries are made without a corresponding payment (sometimes {{referred to as a}} free delivery, <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> or FOP delivery, or in the United States, delivery versus free). Examples of a delivery without payment are the delivery of securities collateral against a loan of securities, and a delivery made pursuant to a margin call.|$|E

FOP settlement involves delivery of the securities without a simultaneous transfer of funds - hence 'free of payment'. Funds may either be remitted by other, mutually agreed means, or payment may not be made at all. This is the case in the transfer of securities gifted or inherited, or, in a country retaining paper securities certificates, in the dematerialisation of such securities, by transfer FOP into the name of the electronic custodian, with beneficial ownership retained by the transferor.|$|E

50|$|Schmidt met Yasuo Kuniyoshi in 1917 while {{studying}} at the League. When they married {{two years later}} Schmidt's parents cut her off from the family and formally disowned her, {{causing her to lose}} American citizenship. Because Kuniyoshi had little income and Schmidt none, they were fortunate to have been supported by Hamilton Easter Field's gift of places to stay during the winter at a house he owned in Brooklyn and during the summer in a small studio he had built in Ogunquit. While the summer place proved to be temporary, the apartment in Brooklyn was theirs to use, <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> from the time they married until their divorce in 1932. Despite careful budgeting of limited finances, they both had to take jobs, Schmidt as director of a sketch class at Whitney and as informal assistant to Juliana Force and Kuniyoshi as frame-maker and art photographer. They were able to earn enough to support a ten-month trip to Europe over 1926 and 1926, a return trip in 1928, and the purchase of a house in Woodstock, N.Y., in 1932.|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} housing privatization in Russia {{in the course of}} the 1990 s. Privatization was started to create a housing market in order to efficiently allocate resources in the use and production of housing, and to phase out the state budget financing of housing. The dwellings were offered to their residents <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> The objective of this study is to offer a better understanding of the structural components of privatization by formally modeling housing privatization decision from the household point of view. The model is based on a trade-off between certain value of renting and uncertain value of owning. Using the results of the theoretical model, an empirical model of the privatization decision from the point of view of the household is formulated. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{evolution}} <b>of</b> EU <b>payments</b> law for retail payments, identifying four phases of its development. In {{spite of the}} EU’s founding principle <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>payments,</b> the first two phases <b>of</b> EU <b>payments</b> law were characterized by negative integration and soft law measures with limited effects on the performance <b>of</b> cross-border <b>payments.</b> The introduction <b>of</b> the euro started the third phase <b>of</b> EU <b>payments</b> law in which the EU became more aggressive in its approach to regulating payments. Nevertheless, EU legislation was mainly aimed at triggering and supporting “voluntary self-regulation” by the banking industry. As a result, EU payments law acquired a hybrid character. The ensuing Single Euro Payments Area (“SEPA”) is composed of publicly- and privately-made rules which became mingled together into a single system. Finally, the fourth phase of the development <b>of</b> EU <b>payments</b> law has witnessed, on an unprecedented scale, EU public regulation colonizing areas {{that used to be}} in the private domain. It also marks a nuanced shift of objectives <b>of</b> EU <b>payments</b> law: integration is no longer the overarching objective but “regulation for competition” has surfaced as an equally important goal...|$|R
