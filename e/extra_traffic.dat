5|$|The only {{significant}} alteration {{to the structure}} of the bridge itself since the addition of the sculptures in 1907 came in 1973, when the Greater London Council (GLC) decided to add an <b>extra</b> <b>traffic</b> lane by reducing the width of the pavements. To counter the increased load of <b>extra</b> <b>traffic,</b> the council announced the replacement of the cast-iron balustrades with low box-girder structures. Despite formal objections from both Lambeth and Westminster Councils, the GLC ignored the objections. In 2015, the extra lane of motor traffic was removed in favour of a kerb-protected two-way cycle track, on the north-east side of the bridge. This forms part of Cycle Superhighway 5.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} {{this stretch of}} SR52 had many effects on the {{transportation}} of the East County region. Traffic decreased significantly on I-8 in early 1994, with an estimated 30,000 commuters switching from I-8 to SR52. Fewer cars traveled on {{the western part of}} Mission Gorge Road, leading to a decrease in revenue for businesses located along that road. On Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road in Santee, much more traffic was present, leading to residents complaining to the city. In 1998, the city began to widen Mission Gorge Road between Carlton Hills Drive and Fanita Road to handle the <b>extra</b> <b>traffic</b> from the incomplete SR52.|$|E

5|$|The Severn Railway Bridge (historically {{called the}} Severn Bridge) was a bridge {{carrying}} the railway across the River Severn between Sharpness and Lydney, Gloucestershire. It {{was built in}} the 1870s by the Severn Bridge Railway Company, primarily to carry coal from the Forest of Dean to the docks at Sharpness; at that time it was the furthest downstream bridge over the Severn. The company was taken over in 1893 by the Great Western Railway and the Midland Railway Companies when it got into financial difficulties. The bridge continued to be used for freight and passenger services until 1960, and saw temporary <b>extra</b> <b>traffic</b> on the occasions that the Severn Tunnel was closed for engineering work.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the New Road in 1756 bisected the Angel Inn site and the stable buildings were cut off on the southern side. The inn was on the northern side, {{on the corner of}} what is now the junction of Islington High Street and Pentonville Road, while the stables were now on what is St John Street, adjacent to the New Inn, which had been established in 1744. The Angel benefited from the <b>extra</b> <b>traffic</b> brought by the New Road, and in addition to accommodation provided a number of assembly rooms for public meetings. The author and political activist Thomas Paine is believed to have begun writing Rights of Man at the Angel in 1790, and there is a monument on Islington High Street commemorating this.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the {{southern}} regions of Perth to easier central business district access {{changed the nature of}} the metropolitan area, prompting dramatic population growth south of the river. This led to increased traffic on the bridge, causing regular traffic jams in peak hour. Over the years, governments suggested various ideas to reduce the traffic using the bridge, including introducing congestion pricing similar to that used in Singapore, charging vehicles to enter the central business district during peak periods. The government also encouraged voluntary car sharing. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, and by the 1990s, the bridge had become the city's worst traffic bottleneck, despite the addition of an <b>extra</b> <b>traffic</b> lane, bringing the total number of lanes to seven.|$|E

40|$|Despite large caches, main-memory access latencies still cause {{significant}} performance {{losses in}} many applications. Numerous {{hardware and software}} prefetching schemes have been proposed to tolerate these latencies. Software prefetching typically provides better prefetch accuracy than hardware, but is limited by prefetch instruction overheads and the compiler's limited ability to schedule prefetches sufficiently far in advance to cover level-two cache miss latencies. Hardware prefetching can be effective at hiding these large latencies, but generates many useless prefetches and consumes considerable memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a cooperative hardware-software prefetching scheme called Guided Region Prefetching (GRP), which uses compiler-generated hints encoded in load instructions to regulate an aggressive hardware prefetching engine. We compare GRP against a sophisticated pure hardware stride prefetcher and a scheduled region prefetching (SRP) engine. SRP and GRP show the best performance, with respective 22 % and 21 % gains over no prefetching, but SRP incurs 180 % <b>extra</b> memory <b>traffic</b> [...] -nearly tripling bandwidth requirements. GRP achieves performance close to SRP, but with a mere eighth of the <b>extra</b> prefetching <b>traffic,</b> a 23 % increase over no prefetching. The GRP hardware-software collaboration thus combines the accuracy of compilerbased program analysis with the performance potential of aggressive hardware prefetching, bringing the performance gap versus a perfect L 2 cache under 20 %...|$|R

40|$|IP–MAC pairing static, {{modify the}} {{existing}} ARP, patch operating systems {{of all the}} hosts etc. In this {{paper we propose a}} Discrete Event System (DES) approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for LAN specific attacks which do not require any extra constraint like static IP–MAC, changing the ARP etc. A DESmodel is built for the LAN under both a normal and compromised (i. e., spoofed request/response) situation based on the sequences of ARP related packets. Sequences of ARP events in normal and spoofed scenarios are similar thereby rendering the same DES models for both the cases. To create different ARP events under normal and spoofed conditions the proposed technique uses active ARP probing. However, this probing adds <b>extra</b> ARP <b>traffic</b> in the LAN. Following that a DES detector is built to determine from observed ARP related events, whether the LAN is operating under a normal or compromised situation. The scheme also minimizes <b>extra</b> ARP <b>traffic</b> by probing the source IP–MAC pair of only those ARP packets which are yet to be determined as genuine/spoofed by the detector. Also, spoofed IP–MACpairs determinedby the detector are stored in tables to detect other LAN attacks triggered by spoofing namely, man-in-the-middle (MiTM), denial of service etc. The scheme is successfully validated in a test bed. © 2010 ISA.

2500|$|On November 29, 1975, Mirabel International Airport {{went into}} service. With an {{operations}} zone of [...] and a buffer zone of , {{it became the}} largest airport in the world. Many connecting flights to Canadian centres were transferred to Mirabel and 23 international airlines moved their overseas activities there. As a consequence, the mission of Montréal–Dorval was redefined to service domestic flights and transborder flights to the United States. Mirabel's traffic decreased due to the advent in the 1980s of longer-range jets that {{did not need to}} refuel in Montreal before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Montreal's economic decline in the late 1970s and 1980s had a significant effect on the airport's traffic, as international flights bypassed Montreal altogether in favour of Toronto Pearson International Airport. The Trudeau government had developed Mirabel Airport to handle an expected growth in international traffic and eventually, to replace Dorval. The <b>extra</b> <b>traffic</b> never materialized and due to its closer proximity to downtown Montreal all scheduled air services have now returned to Dorval/Trudeau, while Mirabel ceased passenger operations in 2004. In May 2007 it was reported that the International Centre of Advanced Racing had signed a 25-year lease with Aéroports de Montréal to use part of the airport as a racetrack, the Circuit ICAR. At the same time the fixed-base operator Hélibellule opened a facility there which caters to private planes. The company also provides a helicopter passenger service from Mirabel to destinations in Canada and the United States. They operate two different types of helicopters; the Bell 222 and the Aérospatiale Gazelle.|$|E

[...] The district negotiated a reprieve for three years, promising <b>extra</b> <b>traffic,</b> and DJ class diesel locomotives replaced steam locomotives on the line in January 1969, but less than 24,000 tonnes were carried annually and through trains ceased running in October 1970, replaced with two shunting services, one from Gore to Riversdale and the other from Lumsden to Kingston Crossing, leaving a 9km gap of line unused, although the tracks were still in place and closure of most of the line came on 1 April 1971. A number of excursion trains ran on the line in its final weeks. Demolition of the line from Balfour back to Gore began in the later part of 1971. Although there were proposals to retain the line from Gore to Mandeville as an industrial siding to serve a proposed freezing works in the area, this proposal never eventuated and the line was lifted from Balfour {{all the way back to}} Gore. The last 2km section of line from the junction points at Gore to the Gore Gravel and Crushing Company's plant was retained as an industrial siding until it too was closed on 1 October 1972.

With this approach, we just need low processing power on some specific edge routers as well as a little <b>extra</b> network <b>traffic</b> to settle it. Furthermore, distilling mark from packets is easy since the mark is in plain text format. ...|$|R
