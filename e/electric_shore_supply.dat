40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis was {{an investigation of}} the causes that prevented large numbers of Pacific Fleet units' NSA expenditures from processing through the Fleet Resource Accounting Module (FRAM) at the Fleet Accounting and Disbursing Center Pacific (FAADCPAC), San Diego, CA. Six consecutive months' NSA expenditure errors from December 1989 to May 1990 were used in the analysis. The researcher concluded that the major cause of the problem was the use of wrong fund codes by the fleet units when they requisitioned their materials from the <b>shore</b> <b>supply</b> activities. The researcher identified inadequate training of shipboard supply personnel and the lack of an edit/validation process at the <b>shore</b> <b>supply</b> activities, as the major deficiencies. Recommendations designed to prevent large numbers of NSA expenditure errors and to improve the current accounting system were provided. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, it is {{becoming}} an increasingly common requirement for ships to shut down ship generators and connect to high voltage shore power {{for as long as}} practicable while in port. Ship electrical equipment shall only be connected to <b>shore</b> <b>supplies</b> that are able to maintain harbor distribution system voltage quality. Voltage drop, which is produced by the possible loading conditions of a ship when connected to a <b>shore</b> <b>supply,</b> may result in unsatisfactory operation of, and damage to, electrical and electronic equipment on board and thus, must be considered in the harbor distribution system design in order to comply with the requirements of international standards. A simple and fast method able to estimate the expected magnitude of voltage drops and provide information about the effectiveness of the various mitigation methods is essential. This paper presents the methodology and results for evaluation of the voltage drops of a practical harbor electrical distribution system with high voltage shore connection (HVSC). The potential voltage drops of the implemented HVSC are quantified using standard analytical formulas. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the critical parameters that significantly affect voltage drops. The parameters that have great improvement benefits should have high priority for implementation in other distribution systems with HVSC. The results obtained in this paper can provide engineers with useful information regarding the actual magnitude of voltage drops, {{as well as on the}} effectiveness of mitigation options for voltage drops, which would greatly enhance HV <b>shore</b> <b>supply</b> quality...|$|R

40|$|Shore power connection, a {{practice}} whereby shore-side electrical power is provided to vessels at berth in a port, {{is set to}} play a major role in shaping the future energy requirements of the commercial shipping industry. Short circuit level compatibility of systems is a problem when a ship power system is connected to a shore electrical distribution system. A method that is able to evaluate the shore-side and ship-side impedances and determine the prospective short circuit current level is essential. This paper aims at presenting a methodology for calculating the short circuit current in the shore power connection system. Two analysis models: IEC std. 61363 - 1 and IEC std. 60909 - 0 combined with IEC std. 60909 - 0 are developed and used in this paper for short circuit current analysis. Performance of the proposed method is validated by short circuit current calculation results gathered from several visiting ship scenarios in a practical shore power connection system. The proposed method can provide engineers with useful information about the prospective magnitude of short circuit currents, as well as on the effect of <b>shore</b> <b>supply</b> on ship power system, to assist them in ensuring short circuit level compatibility and allowing the selection and setting of protective devices...|$|R
