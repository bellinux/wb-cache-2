The first part defines terms such as <b>dumping,</b> <b>price</b> discrimination, supply, demand, protection of competition, price elasticity and pricing. The second part show practical examples of creation of dumping prices and their consequent impact on the market. Examined market is beer in the Czech Republic and selected products for the analysis represent four best selling light draft beers - Gambrinus, Braník, Kozel and Staropramen. The thesis approaches consequences cause by dumping practices of retailers to suppliers [...] irritation of direct distribution and subsequent difficulties with pricing.

40|$|Although cost-plus pricing {{is often}} used in B 2 B markets it has the serious {{drawback}} that it ignores both customer price sensitivity and potential competitor action. Most B 2 B markets are oligopolies {{so that there is}} an ever-present risk of a price-war if any of the competitors engage in aggressive price-cutting. Firms should be encouraged to think of pricing as a continuous process rather than a once-off decision. This process involves several different departments, which may have rather different views on pricing priorities (for example, sales people tend to over-estimate the responsiveness of customers to price, while accountants tend to focus on the short-term cash-flow implications of pricing rather than longer-term strategy). Two aspects of pricing that are particularly important in B 2 B markets are bid pricing and price-setting within long-term buyer-seller relationships. Pricing raises a number of important ethical issues, notably anti-competitive pricing, price fixing, price collusion, price discrimination, predatory <b>pricing</b> (<b>dumping)</b> and <b>price</b> gougin...|$|R

50|$|Since {{the soviet}} union dissolved, the Federal Postal Service {{consisted}} {{of a network of}} 90 disparate entities which were mainly listed as state institutions or federal state unitary enterprises. In legal terms, they were completely independent concerns. They were linked to the Federal Postal Network only by a trunk intrazonal and inter-district transmission and delivery system. The most ridiculous part of the whole system was that different parts of the same system connected by a single mechanism in adjacent regions were competing against each other, which mainly involved trying to lure big corporate clients away from the other competitors often at <b>dumping</b> <b>prices.</b> Also there were no uniform budgeting, planning or other processes. These companies operated using outdated and worn-out postal facilities representing about 50 different IT solutions in terms of industry technology. In accordance with the concept of restructuring the federal postal service, adopted by the Government Decree on 28 June 2002, the postal industry in the Russian Federation carried out the reorganization, aimed at creating a single, highly efficient and competitive company able to make a significant contribution to the solution of urgent problems on the accelerated development of the economy and resulted in the establishment of a single unified operator- Federal Unitary Enterprise Russian Post. By 2005 the reform was completed.|$|R
40|$|Before World War II, Dutch State Mines, the national, {{state owned}} coal corporation, {{was confronted with}} major challenges, {{specifically}} that foreign coal was sold at <b>dumping</b> <b>prices</b> in the home market. At the same time, coal cleaning needed to be improved in order to offer higher quality coal against lower coal processing costs. In this paper we illustrate how State Mines relied on its innovative capacity in order to overcome the economic, technological and market changes. The coal cleaning innovations at State Mines show how absorptive capacity was of prime importance for the firm's innovative capacity. External knowledge acquisition as well as internal knowledge building proved to be relevant, although the balance changed over time. While initially acquisition and assimilation of external knowledge (potential absorptive capacity) were essential to improve the existing coal cleaning processes, internal knowledge building was needed to come to real improvements in coal cleaning. The establishment of a licensing company was essential to exploit this knowledge. An important feature was that State Mines was always well aware of its lack of capabilities and knowledge and open to search for and learn from knowledge outside its firm boundaries. Moreover, expectations determined the search for external knowledge. innovation, knowledge, absorptive capacity, expectations, Dutch State Mines, coal cleaning, hydrocyclone, Tromp system, loess washing system, Barvoys system,...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{the state}} {{bureaucracy}} in Japan has been enjoying great prestige although remunerations earned by that group are {{not among the}} highest. The high social position results from {{the role played by}} the state administration (together with the private sector) in overcoming Japan's economic backwardness and in making it the second superpower in the world. The question is what are the sources of the longstanding cooperation between the government and business. Undoubtedly, {{one of them is the}} practice of amakudari - the retiring bureaucrats assume lucrative positions in the industry, on the whole in this industry which they supervised during their active professional life. The essential roots of this cooperation date back to the period of accelerated economic growth in 1954 - 1971 and they lie in the positive attitude taken by the government and by MITI in particular to the institution of price-production cartel. Organized in exporting industries, this cartel has contributed to a real expansion of Japanese products in the world (often at <b>dumping</b> <b>prices).</b> In spite of the fact that the international situation has changed radically, MITI continues to represent the acquiescent attitude to the institution of cartel, which implies harmful consequences, both economic and political.

40|$|The report {{identifies}} {{concerns with}} the EU anti-dumping instrument, as applied today, {{regardless of the}} fact that the investigation procedures and methods might be in line with the current regulation and practice. The report's arguments are based on the recent anti-dumping investigation – and imposition of anti-dumping measures – on imports of ceramic tiles from China, but the observations and conclusions from the analysis are valid for most EU anti-dumping investigations. The report observes that <b>price</b> <b>dumping</b> is evaluated differently depending on whether the product is manufactured in the EU or imported from third countries. What is considered to be <b>price</b> <b>dumping</b> when imported is considered normal competition for a product manufactured in the EU. This is due to the fact that spatial price differentiation within the EU is covered by competition rules, and that competition rules have higher requirements for market share and price undercutting than the anti-dumping legislation. The report, accordingly, advocates that the criteria for imposing anti-dumping duties should be harmonized to the EU competition rules in order to ensure fair competition on the EU market. In the absence of a reformed anti-dumping regulation, the anti-dumping measures will most likely only contribute to a distorted competition where the complaining EU manufacturing industry will be protected to the detriment of the consumers. ...|$|R

40|$|Poultry {{breeding}} {{presents an}} important part of agricultural production. Its importance is growing in relation with globalization of market. Egg production is {{a very important part of}} that. After a period of stable growth of eggs production during 80 s and 90 s of last century, we can currently observe stagnation and decline of the production. Import of consumption eggs for <b>dumping</b> <b>prices</b> and very strict and difficult conditions for eggs production business in the frame of EU, seriously endanger future existence of eggs producers is the Czech Republic. The intention of each breeder of poultry for eggs production is to minimize the costs and maximize the production. An important tool for reaching this target is using the poultry for maximal possible period of time. That means for the second yielding cycle after molting. Although the yield of eggs during the second cycle is less frequent, the eggs are bigger and heavier. This method ensures costs savings in acquisition of new poultry. Any improvements during any faze of the eggs production, that would bring cost savings is highly appreciated. There was done a comparison of eggs production under the standard method and also under the method of using controlled molting and second yielding cycle. The project took three years. The key area of comparison was the ratio of expenses to production unit. ISA Brown poultry was used for the project. The objective was to verify the influence of molting to the efficiency of poultry in the second yielding cycle. I have focused on the economical results, such as average efficiency, costs intensity and realization price of eggs. The conclusion for the project is following: Controlled molting of layers is important economical tool to production costs savings. During the period of the project economical result (profit) achieved was higher for 617. 414 Czk at the group of molted poultry, compared to the standard yielding group. The reasons are on the costs side, the most significant savings are: i) Acquisition of poultry (two times during the period of 3 years) ii) Lower costs of fodder iii) Costs of disinfection of breeding hall...|$|R
