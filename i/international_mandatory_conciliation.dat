The {{survey respondents}} agreed that seafarers {{have access to}} good quality food and drinking water given the regulated hygienic conditions. To a large extent, the general standards of the <b>international</b> <b>mandatory</b> requirements shown in section A are upheld. The MLC provides well-supported, structural and organised legal documents to improve compliance with international requirements. To facilitate {{the implementation of the}} mandatory requirements (i.e., the Regulations and the Code), the ratifying countries have established close relationships with the designated authorities. The survey respondents indicated that they have positive views of maritime stakeholders’ ability to obtain key information (i.e., ILO Regulations and the Code) without time and spatial restrictions because of technological advancements.|$|R
50|$|Although several {{international}} conventions against pollution are in place, as of 2003 {{there was still}} no formal body setting <b>international</b> <b>mandatory</b> standards, although the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals (ISGOTT) does provide guidelines giving advise on optimum use and safety, such as recommending that ballast tanks are not entered while loaded with cargo, and that weekly samples are made of the atmosphere inside for hydrocarbon gas. Due to the difficulties of maintenance, ship builders have been competitive in producing double-hulled ships which are easier to inspect, such as ballast and cargo tanks which are easily accessible and easier to spot corrosion in the hull. The Tanker Structure Cooperative Forum (TSCF) published the Guide to Inspection and Maintenance of Double-Hull Tanker Structures in 1995 giving advice based on experience of operating double-hulled tankers.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} tackle {{climate change and}} build a {{low-carbon}} economy, China has selected seven provinces and cities as carbon trading pilots and plans to establish the national emissions trading scheme (ETS) in 2017. However, since China has not yet reached peak carbon emissions, and as a major developing country, the conflict between increasing energy demand and the requirement to reduce emissions brings challenges {{to the design of}} a national ETS suitable for China’s development. In this paper, we summarize the current situation of China’s seven ETS pilots with respect to coverage, allowance allocation, transactions, punishment mechanisms and especially the market performance. By analyzing the common practice of three <b>international</b> <b>mandatory</b> schemes, combined with China’s current circumstances and characteristics of market construction and regulation, we emphasize China’s own economic reality, and propose several recommendations for building a suitable and effective national ETS. This paper could provide new perspectives towards scheme design for China and other similar countries...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Respective European Union member states’ {{interest}} in using spending reviews varies {{as there are}} no <b>international</b> <b>mandatory</b> regulations. The EU legislation contains general indications as to maintaining a rational fscal policy, from {{the provisions of the}} TFUE, expanded in the Pact for Stability and Growth, and elaborated in 2011. Methodology: Adopting an interpretative research approach, this article elaborates a multiple explanatory case study design to discover how existing theories about public spending reviews are conceptualized by practitioners in their natural contexts. Findings: The deteriorated state of many countries’ public fnances, {{as a result of the}} global fnancial crisis, has increased the {{interest in}} advanced innovative consolidation and fscal stabilization methods. Spending reviews are among the most developed and advanced methods. Such reviews were conducted both by countries that had applied this instrument before (Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, United Kingdom, Australia), and by those that introduced them for the frst time (Ireland, Canada, France). However, reviews are applied in countries characterized by signifcant economic advancement and mature public management systems. Originality: This article analyses and draws conclusions from several selected countries’ experience to date in using spending reviews. The budget functions are compared using information from the implementation of the spending reviews. This article contributes to flling two main gaps identifed in the literature review. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Occupational {{therapists}} play a {{key role}} in the provision of wheelchairs and seating. Wheelchair and seating educational training is not mandated in occupational therapy programmes in the Republic of Ireland which is a major concern for wheelchair users who may have received inadequate provision from clinicians with insufficient training. Objective: To investigate the training and education afforded to practicing clinicians in developed countries and to prioritise building sustainable wheelchair and seating education systems for future practicing clinicians on an international level. Method: A qualitative scoping review of scientific and grey literature was undertaken internationally of 10 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Results: A review of the scientific literature revealed that no universal education and training mandates have been established internationally to ensure effective provision of wheelchair and seating. Grey literature also revealed that the WFOT approved programmes investigated in the study have developed ad hoc frameworks for education and training frameworks for wheelchair and seating provision, as no national or <b>international</b> <b>mandatory</b> guidelines exist. Conclusion: There is a need for mandatory training courses or programmes to exist as part of undergraduate or graduate educational programmes on an international level. In order for appropriate wheelchair and seating provision to become a practical reality, policy-makers and health professionals should recognise and appreciate training inadequacies in the delivery of educational programmes internationally and aim to alleviate long-term healthcare expenses...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the plethora}} of {{international}} elements of a contract to arbitrate, i. e. nationalities of the parties, nature of the transaction and the legal background of the arbitrator, questions of law applicable to {{the substance of the}} dispute are always at stake. In the course of arbitral proceedings, issues of law applicable to the arbitral dispute are raised after a concise examination of the law applicable to the arbitration agreement, namely whether the parties have consented to arbitrate the subject-matter in issue and the law applicable to the arbitral procedure. The present study draws upon the principle of party autonomy, in both theoretical and practical aspects {{in the context of the}} freedom of contract principle. It further considers the restrictive role of mandatory rules upon the above principle. Light shall also be shed on the current trends of <b>international</b> <b>mandatory</b> rules and public policy as discussed in ICC awards by experienced arbitrators and solely developed within the ambit of international commercial arbitration. Furthermore, a consistent examination of possible choices of law and rules of law such as a-national rules i. e. lex mercatoria and general trade usages will sketch the existing variety of possibilities in choice of law both on the parties and lawyers leading arbitrations. The last Section will independently examine an absence of choice of law, and several doctrines which envisaged the stance of the three distinguished European arbitral systems: English, Swiss and French. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{are plenty}} of {{trademarks}} consisting of product shapes that effectively deter competition, although the original work or the invention giving the shape to the product (and to the trademark) {{is already in the}} public domain and should be free to be used by anyone. Trademark laws typically contain provisions declaring certain kinds of trademarks not protectable on the basis of absolute grounds for refusal. However, the legal practice reveals that these mechanisms within the trademark laws are not sufficient to safeguard the public domain. Companies frequently try to deter free competition by registering trademarks consisting of the shape of a product after they lose the exclusivity in the patent, industrial design or work that gave its value to the product and meanwhile belongs to the public domain. This problem occurs in particular in relation to popular inventions, but also to designs or characters of works that are of high commercial value. Not only in developing countries, courts seem to hesitate assessing an invention, design or work {{to be part of the}} public domain if the popularity and value of the product are significant. The most appropriate approach to solve this problem is to introduce an <b>international</b> <b>mandatory</b> regulation that overarches all intellectual property rights and explicitly safeguards the public domain. Such general principle in international law should particularly ensure that the free use of inventions, designs or works is not affected by trademarks once the underlying intellectual property right expires...|$|R

40|$|A {{constantly}} growing intercontinental {{trade and}} modernization of transport infrastructure transformed the traditional patterns of {{carriage of goods}} globally. The majority of manufactured goods nowadays are transported in by sea in containers; however, transportation by land precedes and follows the sea carriage. These developments have created the preconditions {{for the development of}} multimodal transportation, which implies door-to-door delivery of goods by different modes of transport under a single contract. The existing transport conventions deal with one specific mode of transport, such as sea, road, rail, air and inland waterways, while an <b>international</b> <b>mandatory</b> convention related to multimodal transportation is lacking. The previous attempts to create an international legal instrument to govern this type of carriage have not been successful. In respond to that a new transport convention was adopted in 2008 - “United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea” (The Rotterdam Rules). This Convention has introduced the new concept of “maritime plus”, and thus will govern the whole of a contract of carriage, which comprises an international sea leg, including those segments that are to be performed by other transport modes. The controversies surrounding the “maritime plus” regime of the Rotterdam Rules have provided the impetus for the EU to instigate discussions on whether it needs to adopt its own legislation concerning multimodal transport and not just wait for an international solution. The principal purpose of this thesis is to examine and evaluate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the “maritime plus” regime under the Rotterdam Rules. The analysis will include a critical review of existing international conventions and their provisions pertaining to multimodal transportation and the “maritime plus” regime of the Rotterdam Rules. A key issue in this thesis is uniformity and harmonization in transport law which will be complemented by examining the regional harmonization in the context of EU law-making and jurisprudence in the field of international transport. The author will also critically examine how the Rotterdam Rules as a Convention can contribute to universal uniformity on carriage of goods, in light of the carriage being “maritime plus” instead of multimodal and also implications for the European carriage of goods...|$|R

Nevertheless, helicopter rescue procedures are extremely dangerous and there are no standards in the U.S. and in most countries outside the U.S. about their implementation. The landing procedures and the rescue operations are in this case very dangerous due to the air turbulence (Biava et al. 2012) and updrafts caused by smoke and heat.|$|R

For solving these problems, the virtual environment must guarantee an in-depth protection {{in order to control}} the information flows that starts in a Virtual Machine (vm) and finishes in another one. In contrast with existing MAC approaches, PIGA-Virt is a MAC protec- tion controlling the different levels of a virtual system. It eases the man- agement of the required security objectives. The PIGA-Virt approach guarantees the required security objectives while controlling efficiently the information flows. PIGA-Virt supports a large range of predefined protection canvas whose efficiency has been demonstrated during the ANR Sec&Si 1 security challenge. The paper shows how the PIGA-Virt approach guarantees advanced confidentiality and integrity properties by controlling complex combinations of transitive information flows passing through intermediate resources. As far as we know, PIGA-Virt is the first operational solution providing in-depth MAC protection, addressing ad- vanced security requirements and controlling efficiently information flows inside and between virtual machines.
