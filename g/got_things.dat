5|$|The National League <b>got</b> <b>things</b> {{started in}} the bottom of the first when José Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter Dan Haren and {{proceeded}} to steal second. He scored on an RBI single by Ken Griffey, Jr. to give the NL a 1–0 lead. Barry Bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for {{in the bottom of}} the third when, with Reyes on second, he lofted a high fly ball to left field, but it was snared at the warning track by Magglio Ordóñez. The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when Alex Rodriguez attempted to score on a two-out single by Iván Rodríguez. However, the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed Russell Martin to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning. The AL would score one inning later when, after Chris Young issued a leadoff walk to Brian Roberts, Ichiro Suzuki hit a long fly ball off the right field wall. Instead of caroming straight to Griffey, the ball took an unusual bounce off a sign and ricocheted to Griffey's right. This allowed Ichiro to score on what became the first and only inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history. The homer gave the AL a 2–1 lead and resulted in Ichiro's MVP win.|$|E

500|$|Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer {{came to an}} end in February 1944 {{when the}} BBC decided to direct their {{programming}} at the general armed forces, rather than the barrage balloon crews. A month later Horne and Murdoch had expanded the idea of the remote and fictitious Royal Air Force station, Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. The pair took the idea to the BBC producer Leslie Bridgemont who was responsible for the show Merry-go-Round, which featured, in weekly rotation, shows based on the Army, Navy and RAF. Bridgemont included a Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh section in Merry-go-Round on 31 March 1944; Horne played [...] "an officer so dim that even the other officers noticed", with Murdoch as his harassed second-in-command and Sam Costa as an [...] "amiable chump who always <b>got</b> <b>things</b> wrong".|$|E

500|$|Reaction to the film's preview segment was mixed. Kotaku heavily {{praised the}} effects, {{undertone}} and music, {{stating that the}} staff loved it, though lamented that an official film of this kind would join {{a long line of}} [...] "ill-advised live-action adaptations". Game Informer called it [...] "absurd", stating that while it was a possible proof of concept film it was more likely completely fake, and adding [...] "It looks goofy as hell, and Pokéfans are sure to get a couple chuckles out of it if nothing else." [...] ComicsAlliance called it [...] "somewhere in the middle" [...] of presenting a better take on the franchise and a reminder that [...] "some intellectual properties <b>got</b> <b>things</b> right (or inherently wrong) the first time", though called the effect [...] "surprisingly competent" [...] and it both generally fun and funny. Crave Online heavily criticized the film, calling the story formulaic and the production values [...] "threadbare", and further adding that they dreaded the idea of it inspiring an actual live-action film on the series in light of Capcom's [...]|$|E
500|$|On May 11, 2011, Down {{announced}} on their Facebook page that they [...] "demoed {{a brand new}} tune." [...] Down played at Download Festival on Saturday 11 June 2011. They played alongside System of a Down, Avenged Sevenfold and Alice Cooper. Rex did not tour with Down during their spring 2011 shows. Crowbar bassist Pat Bruders filled in for Rex during those shows. [...] "Rex is not gonna be with us," [...] said Keenan. [...] "He's <b>got</b> <b>things</b> he needs to deal with, and we gave him an ultimatum and he's trying to work things out. We've got Pat (Bruders) from Crowbar playing bass, and he's ass-kickin' in the same way. He plays with his fingers—which is really cool; he's got the whole Geezer Butler thing going on." [...] When asked whether or not Brown was still considered {{a part of the}} band, Keenan was hopeful but hesitant: [...] "I don't know what to really say on that; he's not out of the band, but he's not playing with us live." [...] On June 22, 2011, Jimmy Bower announced that Rex Brown would not be returning to Down, and that Pat Bruders is his replacement.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I <b>got,</b> <b>things</b> were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, Sinatra {{released}} Watertown, one of {{his most}} acclaimed concept albums, with music by Bob Gaudio (of the Four Seasons) and lyrics by Jake Holmes. However, it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position of 101. He left Caesars Palace in September that year after an incident where executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him. He performed several charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records before his self-imposed retirement, announced the following June at a concert in Hollywood {{to raise money for the}} Motion Picture and TV Relief Fund. He finished the concert with a [...] "rousing" [...] performance of [...] "That's Life", and stated [...] "Excuse me while I disappear" [...] as he left the stage. He told LIFE journalist Thomas Thompson that [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>things</b> to do, like the first thing is not to do [...] at all for eight months... maybe a year", while Barbara Sinatra later claimed that Sinatra had grown [...] "tired of entertaining people, especially when all they really wanted were the same old tunes he had long ago become bored by". While he was in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign. Sinatra obliged and chose to sing [...] "My Kind of Town" [...] for the rally held in Chicago on October 20, 1972.|$|E

On August 14, 1967, the trustees of Baptist-affiliated Baton Rouge General Hospital named Kirkpatrick as hospital administrator. He was elevated to president of the hospital in 1970 and served in that capacity until 1981. Dr. Charles Prosser, a fellow hospital director and friend of Kirkpatrick's, recalled him as [...] "a man of many talents and a most affable fellow who <b>got</b> <b>things</b> done by impressing people with their importance and worth.

2500|$|In March 2002, Mayor Anthony A. Williams {{announced}} {{an investigation into}} two assistant chiefs and a deputy chief who also may have been improperly hired by Few. Williams said Assistant Chief Marcus Anderson, Assistant Chief Gary Garland, and Deputy Chief Bruce Cowan falsified their résumés by claiming high-level jobs they did not hold and listing certification and educational credentials they never earned. Few had initially raised department morale in August 2000 by reversing a number of transfers ordered by former interim Fire Chief Kenneth B. Ellerbe (and viewed as punitive by the rank and file). But the hiring of Anderson, Garland, and Cowan deeply undercut morale again.

2500|$|Over the {{following}} hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that {{ran into the}} early hours of {{the following}} morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had [...] "been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people", most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as [...] "male prostitutes", [...] "hustlers" [...] and [...] "liars" [...] whom he would give [...] "the rope trick". On other occasions, he stated he would wake up to find [...] "dead, strangled kids" [...] on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back. In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was [...] "crying, scared". As a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: [...] "Well, I can't think about this right now. I've <b>got</b> <b>things</b> to do." [...] Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.|$|E
2500|$|Hex said, [...] "It takes {{a week of}} {{long hours}} and hard work to put {{together}} a review on the show. Gaming, capturing all the game footage, logging all the footage, writing the review, re-writing, editing, filming, re-editing... the finished product is something I'm really proud of." [...] Bajo described the editing process as [...] "a bit like Machinima". Both he and Hex checked edits remotely during the period of the week when they had finished their filming {{and the rest of the}} crew [...] "shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show". Hex said that during the playing of games and filming she became quite attached to her avatars and wanted to show off what her own character did. Hex says, [...] "We've tried our best on the show to present both sides of the argument in any stories we've done". Bajo explained: [...] "Mondays we finish of reviews, log footage, swap games, read scripts and sub everything after a production meeting, Tuesdays we make GG and GG: Pocket, Wednesdays are GGSP and any green screen stuff, then Hex and I are off to review for the rest of the week, while the gang shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show. We check edits remotely usually which is my favourite part of the job. changes week to week but that's the general schedule" [...] Bajo has stated that [...] "often segment ideas are pretty spontaneous". When asked about taking on Good Game: Spawn Point as well as the original show, Bajo responded: [...] "we're busier than ever, but we've <b>got</b> <b>things</b> down to a pretty tight production schedule now".|$|E
2500|$|Viewing the {{battlefield}} from horseback {{on the hill}} at Jebel Surgham, Kitchener commented: [...] "Well, we have given them a damn good dusting". As the British and Egyptians advanced in columns, the Khalifa attempted to outflank and encircle the columns; this led to desperate hand-to-hand fighting. Churchill wrote of his own experience as the 21st Lancers cut {{their way through the}} Ansar: [...] "The collision was prodigious and for perhaps ten wonderful seconds, no man heeded his enemy. Terrified horses wedged in the crowd, bruised and shaken men, sprawling in heaps, struggle dazed and stupid, to their feet, panted and looked about them". The Lancers' onslaught carried them through the 12-men-deep Ansar line [...] with the Lancers losing about 70 dead while killing hundreds of the enemy. Following the annihilation of his army, the Khalifa ordered a retreat and early in the afternoon, Kitchener rode in triumph into Omdurman and immediately ordered that the thousands of Christians enslaved by the Ansar were now all free people. Kitchener lost fewer than 500 men while killing about 11,000 and wounding 17,000 of the Ansar. Burleigh summed the general mood of the British troops: [...] "At Last! Gordon has been avenged and justified. The dervishes have been overwhelming routed, Mahdism has been [...] "smashed", while the Khalifa's capital of Omdurman has been stripped of its barbaric halo of sanctity and invulnerability." [...] Kitchener promptly had the Mahdi's tomb blown up and his bones scattered. Queen Victoria, who had wept when she heard of General Gordon's death, now wept for the man who had vanquished Gordon, asking whether it had been really necessary for Kitchener to desecrate the Mahdi's tomb. In a letter to his mother, Churchill wrote that the victory at Omdurman had been [...] "disgraced by the inhuman slaughter of the wounded and...Kitchener is responsible for this". There is no evidence that Kitchener ordered his men to shoot the wounded Ansar on the field of Omdurman, but he did give before the battle what the British journalist Mark Urban called a [...] "mixed message", saying that mercy should be given, {{while at the same time}} saying [...] "Remember Gordon" [...] and that the enemy were all [...] "murderers" [...] of Gordon. The victory at Omdurman made Kitchener into a popular war hero, and gave him a reputation for efficiency and as a man who <b>got</b> <b>things</b> done. The journalist G. W. Steevens wrote in the Daily Mail that [...] "He [...] is more like a machine than a man. You feel that he ought to be patented and shown with pride at the Paris International Exhibition. British Empire: Exhibit No. 1 hors concours, the Sudan Machine". The shooting of the wounded at Omdurman, along with the desecration of the Mahdi's tomb, gave Kitchener a reputation for brutality that was to dog him for the rest of his life, and posthumously.|$|E
