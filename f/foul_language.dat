The study also claimed instances in which there was profanity, but the offending word was bleeped out.|$|E

500|$|The play widely {{regarded}} as Synge's masterpiece, The Playboy of the Western World, was first performed at the Abbey Theatre on 26 January 1907. A comedy about apparent patricide, it attracted a hostile reaction from sections of the Irish public. The Freeman's Journal described it as [...] "an unmitigated, protracted libel upon Irish peasant men, and worse still upon Irish girlhood". Arthur Griffith, who believed that the Abbey Theatre was insufficiently politically committed, described the play as [...] "a vile and inhuman story told in the <b>foulest</b> <b>language</b> we have ever listened to from a public platform", and perceived a slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood in the line [...] "...a drift of chosen females, standing in their shifts..." ...|$|R

25|$|Batty was {{involved}} in an unsavoury incident while deputising as captain for Surrey in a Championship match against Somerset at Taunton in 2012. Murali Kartik, a spinner who had previously played for Somerset, ran out Somerset batsman Alex Barrow who was backing-up at the non-striker's end. Batty declined several invitations by the umpires to withdraw the appeal leading to bad feeling between the teams and around the ground. In August 2013, he was suspended from the T20 finals day after a clash with Somerset batsman Peter Trego. The ECB banned him for two games after he apparently physically confronted Trego and hurled <b>foul</b> <b>language</b> after dismissing him in a quarter-final match.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fact that}} the play {{was based on a}} story of {{apparent}} patricide also attracted a hostile public reaction.

Nevertheless, press opinion soon turned against the rioters and the protests petered out.|$|R

25|$|The Whitlam Government {{used its}} {{constitutional}} powers to overrule racially discriminatory State legislation.

The Whitlam Government, using the race power, enacted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 to override the State laws and eliminate racial discrimination against Aboriginal people.

[...] He argues that documentation does not support many of these details. Bushnell suggests, however, that the fact that the novel is not entirely historically accurate does not necessarily distinguish it from the work of professional historians. The main difference, Bushnell believes, is that García Márquez's work [...] "is far more readable" [...] than a pure history.|$|E

The anger expressed by onlookers at the Miles Wagner trial in The Good Wife reflected the passionate emotions the real-life Madoff scandal evoked.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that women possess the {{required}} knowledge, skills, competencies, training and experiences to perform effectively and efficiently in construction industry, they experience entry and career advancement barriers. This research examines the effects of glass ceiling syndrome on women career advancement in construction industry. Data were obtained through structured questionnaire distributed to workers of selected construction companies. The findings reveal that some of the barriers mentioned in the literature against women career advancement in construction are prevalent in Nigeria, except the existence of equality in respect of male and female in terms of employment and career development opportunity. Also, low women participation in Nigerian construction industry begins in choosing course, education and continues throughout recruitment process. The aim is to encourage women's participation in construction industry and employers to tackle the industry‟s environmental issues by introducing flexible work hour, reducing workload and making the works less tedious and stressful. Also, use of <b>foul</b> <b>languages,</b> harassment of women should be eradicated and continuous supports to balance and family responsibilities should be given. Keywords...|$|R

500|$|When Hamilton {{moved from}} Illinois to Wisconsin {{in the late}} 1820s he {{established}} a lead ore mine that became known as Hamilton's Diggings; he later renamed the settlement Wiota. During the 1832 Black Hawk War a fort was erected at Hamilton's Diggings, it was known as Fort Hamilton. Two contemporary descriptions of Hamilton's Diggings provide {{a glimpse into the}} mining life of Hamilton and the others settled at present-day Wiota. An 1831 account from Juliette Kinzie noted the unkempt conditions as [...] "shabby" [...] and [...] "unpromising". Kinzie also decried the <b>foul</b> <b>language</b> from the miners, whom she called the [...] "roughest-looking set of men I ever beheld." [...] The other description of early Wiota was provided by Theodore Rodolf in 1834. Rodolf, a one-time political opponent of Hamilton, contrasted the settlement's apparently rough exterior with small, finer details, such as the presence of a quarto edition of Voltaire's works, printed in Paris.|$|E

Manuel Peña wrote that after 1989, Selena's popularity increased and she became a sex icon following the release of her debut album. Charles Tatum said Selena drew most attention from her [...] "beauty, sexuality, and youthful impact on the Tejano music scene". Selena said she never wanted to record explicit songs because of her upbringing and because her fan base consisted largely of young children, who regarded her as a role model. She further commented on the question of her sexual appeal to men during her crossover attempt, asserting that she will [...] "stay the same" [...] and that her English-language recordings will refrain from <b>foul</b> <b>language</b> and sexual themes. In 1997, María Celeste Arrarás wrote in her book about Selena's death that the singer was a [...] "sweet and charismatic girl".
