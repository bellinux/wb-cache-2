Tesseract’s design {{is based on the}} 4 D architecture, which advocates the decomposition of the network control plane into decision, dissemination, discovery, and data planes. Tesseract provides two primary abstract services to enable direct control: the dissemination service that carries opaque control information from the network <b>decision</b> <b>element</b> to the nodes in the network, and the node configuration service which provides the interface for the <b>decision</b> <b>element</b> to command the nodes in the network to carry out the desired control policies. Tesseract is designed to enable easy innovation. The neighbor discovery, dissemination and node configuration services, which are agnostic to network control policies, are the only distributed functions implemented in the switch nodes. A variety of network control policies can be implemented outside of switch nodes without the need for introducing new distributed protocols. Tesseract also minimizes the need for manual node configurations to reduce human errors. We evaluate Tesseract’s responsiveness and robustness when applied to backbone and enterprise network topologies in the Emulab environment. We find that Tesseract is resilient to component failures. Its responsiveness for intra-domain routing control is sufficiently scalable to handle a thousand nodes. Moreover, we demonstrate Tesseract’s flexibility by showing its application in joint packet forwarding and policy based filtering for IP networks, and in link-cost driven Ethernet packet forwarding. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} performing the prioritization of <b>decision</b> <b>elements</b> within the multicriteria optimization method, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), with incomplete information. An approach is proposed on how {{to fill in the}} gap in the pair-wise comparison matrix generated within an AHP standard procedure; that is, to reproduce one missing judgment of the decision maker while assuring the reproduced judgment belongs to the same ratio scale used while other judgments are elicited. The first-level transitivity rule (FLTR) approach is proposed based on screening matrix entries in the neighborhood of a missing one. Scaling (where necessary) and geometric averaging of screened entries allows filling of the gap in the matrix and later prioritization of involved <b>decision</b> <b>elements</b> by the eigenvector, or any other known method. Illustrative examples are provided to compare the proposed method with the other two known methods also aimed to fill-in gaps in AHP matrices. The results indicate some similarities in attaining consistency. However, unlike other methods, the FLTR assures coherency of the generating process in a sense that all numeric values in a matrix (original entries, plus one generated) come from the same ratio scale and have correct element-wise semantic equivalents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With {{increased}} connectivity {{to public}} networks, information system security {{has started to}} become an issue also for automation and process control systems used to operate industrial manufacturing plants and critical infrastructure like power plants, or electricity/water/gas transmission grids. A solid security architecture for a networked system should contain not only defensive mechanisms like firewalls, but also detection and reaction capabilities. In today’s automation system security systems the latter two tend to be neglected, as the existing mechanisms are not a good fit to the specific characteristics and requirements of such systems, and only few dedicated concepts and mechanisms exist. In this paper we present an approach to intrusion detection for process control systems that includes the human process operator, who is not an IT security expert, as a critical detection and <b>decision</b> <b>element</b> in the detection process, by utilizing his specific process control experience.

40|$|Consistency and transitivity are {{important}} and leading research topics {{in the study of}} decision-making in terms of pairwise comparison matrices. In this paper, we search for conditions that, in case of inconsistency, guarantee ordinal compatibility between ordinal ranking (actual ranking) derived from a transitive matrix and cardinal rankings provided by the most usual priority vectors proposed in the scientific literature. We provide the notion of weak consistency; it is a condition weaker than consistency and stronger than transitivity and ensures that vectors associated with a matrix, by means of a strictly increasing synthesis functional, provide a preference order, on the related set of decision elements, equal to the actual ranking. This notion extends, to the case in which the decision-maker can be indifferent between two or more alternatives/criteria, weak consistency introduced in previous papers under constraint of no indifference. Finally, we introduce an order relation on the rows of the matrix, that is, a simple order if and only if weak consistency is satisfied; this simple order allows us to easily determine the actual ranking on the set of <b>decision</b> <b>element...</b>|$|E
40|$|The general {{objective}} of formal neuron adaptation {{is to give}} the reliable inputs more influence in determining the output than the unreliable inputs have. Adaptation is introduced into the threshold <b>decision</b> <b>element</b> by a circuit that performs two operations: estimates the error probability of each input and uses the estimate to change each vote-weight. A cyclic error-counting adaptation procedure is the one in which vote-weights are changed periodically (cyclically), based on data collected during computations in a period (cycle). If appropriate incremental adjustments are made to the estimate of inputs ' each error after each computation, then we deal with continuous adaptation. There are two methods for detecting errors: comparison with the output decision (closed-loop adaptation) and comparison with an externally supplied correct answer (open-loop adaptation). In this paper, the input weighted sum is compared with the desired value of this sum, which is multiplied by the correct binary answer. Our results for incremental changes of the input weights of the adaptive formal neuron are based on the Widrow-Hoff algorithm and stochastic approximation method...|$|E

The use of in-line NOLMs as a general technique for all-optical passive 2 R (reamplification, reshaping) regeneration of return-to-zero (RZ) on-off keyed signals in both high-speed, ultralong-distance transmission systems and terrestrial photonic networks is reviewed.

Very few have addressed networks of spiking neurons, which are relevant for understanding the biological networks themselves and also {{for the development of}} neuromorphic electronic neurons that commmunicate by action potential like address-events. Here, we make steps in that direction by using a simplified Markov model of the spiking network to examine analytically the ability of a spike-based WTA network to discriminate the statistics of inputs ranging from stationary regular to nonstationary Poisson events. Our work extends previous theoretical results showing that a WTA recurrent network receiving regular spike inputs can select the correct winner within one interspike interval. We show first for the case of spike rate inputs that input discrimination and the effects of selfexcitation and inhibition on this discrimination are consistent with results obtained from the standard rate-based WTA models. We also extend this discrimination analysis of spiking WTAs to nonstationary inputs with time-varying spike rates resembling statistics of real-world sensory stimuli. We conclude that spiking WTAs are consistent with their continuous counterparts for steady-state inputs, but they also exhibit high discrimination performance with nonstationary inputs...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Automatic {{locomotive}} signaling {{of continuous}} type with a numeric coding (ALSN) has several disadvantages: {{a small number}} of signal indications, low noise stability, high inertia and low functional flexibility. Search for new and more advanced methods of signal processing for automatic locomotive signaling, synthesis of the noise proof digital locomotive receiver are essential. Methodology. The proposed algorithm of detection and identification locomotive signaling codes is based on the definition of mutual correlations of received oscillation and reference signals. For selecting threshold levels of <b>decision</b> <b>element</b> the following criterion has been formulated: the locomotive receiver should maximum set the correct solution for a given probability of dangerous errors. Findings. It has been found that the random nature of the ALSN signal amplitude does not affect the detection algorithm.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an introduction to}} multicriteria decision making using two decision tools: the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and its generalization to dependence and feedback – the Analytic Network Process (ANP). The discussion involves theoretical aspects of these methods and some examples of their applications, (e. g. the first application of the ANP, in improving of food quality products, in Poland), in organizational and management problems solving. AHP and ANP introduced by Thomas L. Saaty from the University in Pittsburgh, USA. The Analytic Hierarchy Process {{has been one of}} the fastest developing mathematical methods over the recent years used for solving multi-criteria decision problems. The AHP is a general theory of measurement based on some mathematical and psychological principles. In that method a hierarchic decision scheme is constructed, by the breaking the problem into decision elements: goal, criteria, subcriteria, sub-subcriteria (…) and decision alternatives. The goal is on the top of hierarchy, whereas alternatives create the lowest level of hierarchy. The importance of every <b>decision</b> <b>element</b> is established, through the pair-wise comparison of elements on each level of the hierarchic structure, with regard to elements on the level above. To do the comparisons it is using the Saaty’s fundamental scale for paired comparisons for the analysis of both quantitative and qualitative variables. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is a new theory that extends the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The basic structures are networks, which allow interactions and feedback within the clusters and between the clusters. So, it can be applied for solving more sophisticated decision problems. Authors’ intention was to showing utility of these methods, which can be successfully applied in the solution of any multicriteria enterprise. multiple criteria decision making methods, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Analytic Network Process (ANP) ...|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{information}} and communication technologies (ICT) promise to significantly transform enterprises, their business processes and services, improve employee productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency, and create new competitive advantages and business agility. Despite the plethora of potential benefits, however, widespread enterprise adoption of mobile ICT has not been as extensive as initially anticipated. Drawing on the extant information systems, technology management, and organizational innovation literature, this dissertation investigates the salient drivers and inhibitors of emerging ICT adoption, in general, and mobile ICT in particular, and develops an integrative ICT adoption decision framework. From this synthesis we identify four broad elements that influence an enterprise s decision to adopt mobile ICT: (1) business value, (2) costs and economics, (3) strategic alignment, and (4) enterprise readiness. The latter <b>decision</b> <b>element</b> has received only little theoretical and practical attention. In order to fill this gap, this dissertation explored the concept of enterprise readiness in further detail and identified eight key dimensions and their associated assessment indicators. Using a two-stage expert study and experimental design approach, we empirically validated these dimensions and determined their relative importance. Results indicated that leadership readiness followed by technology, data and information, and resource readiness, contributed the most to enterprise readiness for mobile ICT. The results are implemented into a web-based readiness diagnostic tool (RDT) that enables decision makers to assess an enterprise s readiness for mobile ICT. The benefits of the RDT are multifold: first, it navigates the decision maker through the complex readiness assessment space; second, it identifies potential organizational deficiencies and provides a means to assess potential sources of risks associated with the adoption and implementation of mobile ICT; and third, it enables decision makers to benchmark their level of readiness against other organizations. The dissertation concludes by highlighting both theoretical and practical implications for emerging and mobile ICT adoption management and suggesting directions for future research. Ph. D.

40|$|A major {{application}} for developed satellite navigation systems is the in-vehicle route guidance market. As systems become cheaper to purchase {{and easier to}} install and indeed car manufacturers begin to fit the equipment as standard in new vehicles, the potential market for such systems {{in the developed world}} is massive. But what are the consequences of giving navigational assistance to car drivers? How will drivers respond to this information? Such information is liable to have a big impact upon driver route choice behaviour and is also subject to their interpretation of the guidance and action upon receiving it. This response may change under different travel circumstances. The impact of collective response to driver guidance is also of importance to traffic engineers and city planners, since routing through environmentally sensitive areas or heavily congested corridors should be avoided. The overall network effects are therefore of key importance to ensure efficient routing and minimal disruption to the road network. It is quite difficult to observe real-life behaviour on a consistent basis, since there are so many confounding variables in the real-world, traffic is never the same two days running, let alone hour by hour and a rigorous experimental environment is required, since control of experimental conditions is paramount to being able to confidently predict driver behaviour in response to navigational aids. Also the take up of guidance systems is still in its infancy, so far available only to a niche market of specialist professionals and those with disposable income. A need to test the common publics’ response to route guidance systems is therefore required. The development of travel simulation techniques, using portable computers and specialist software, gives robust experimental advantages. Although not totally realistic of the driving task, these techniques are sufficient in their realism of the <b>decision</b> <b>element</b> of route selection, enough to conduct experimental studies into drivers’ route choice behaviour under conditions of receiving simulated guidance advice. In this manner driver response to in-vehicle route guidance systems can be tested under a range of hypothetical journey making travel scenarios. This paper will outline the development of travel simulation techniques as a tool for in-vehicle route guidance research, including different methods and key simulation design requirements. The second half of the paper will report in detail on the findings from a recently conducted experiment investigating drivers’ response to route guidance when in familiar and unfamiliar road networks. The results will indicate the importance of providing meaningful information to drivers under these two real-life circumstances and report on how demands for route guidance information may vary by type of journey. Findings indicate that the guidance acceptance need not only depend on the optimum route choice criteria, it is also affected by network familiarity, quality and credibility of guidance advice and personal attributes of the drivers...|$|E

An exploratory analysis of RCT abstracts is undertaken to investigate the feasibility of using decision trees as a semantic structure. Quality-of-paper measures are also examined. Methods A subset of 455 abstracts (randomly selected from a set of 7620 retrieved from Medline from 1998 – 2006) are examined for the quality of RCT reporting, the identifiability of RCTs from abstracts, and the completeness and complexity of RCT abstracts with respect to key <b>decision</b> tree <b>elements.</b> Abstracts were manually assigned to 6 sub-groups distinguishing whether they were primary RCTs versus other design types. For primary RCT studies, we analyzed and annotated the reporting of intervention comparison, population assignment and outcome values. To measure completeness, the frequencies by which complete intervention, population and outcome information are reported in abstracts were measured. A qualitative examination of the reporting language was conducted. Results <b>Decision</b> tree <b>elements</b> are manually identifiable in the majority of primary RCT abstracts. 73. 8 % of a random subset was primary studies with a single population assigned to two or more interventions. 68 % of these primary RCT abstracts were structured. 63 % contained pharmaceutical interventions. 84 % reported the total number of study subjects. In a subset of 21 abstracts examined, 71 % reported numerical outcome values.
