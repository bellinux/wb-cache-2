5000|$|Halohydrin dehalogenases {{mechanistically}} cleaves the carbon-halogen bond {{through the}} formation of an epoxide from a vicinal hydroxyl group. [...] The substrate binds to the active site through hydrogen bonding that is coordinated by Ser132 and the deprotonated form of Tyr145. Failure to deprotonate Tyr145 by the Arg149 residue results in destabilization of the interaction between the enzyme and substrate resulting in reduced biological activity. The oxygen in Tyr145 deprotonates the hydroxyl group of the substrate. The deprotonated oxygen then acts as a nucleophile and performs a Sn2 reaction on the vicinal carbon that is bonded to the halogen; this releases a <b>halogen</b> <b>ion</b> and simultaneously forms an epoxide. Dehalogenases are also able to catalyze the ring-opening of the epoxide. The active site is large enough to accommodate a nucleophile which can perform a nucleophilic attack on the epoxide, opening the epoxide ring and adding a new functional group to the substrate.|$|E
