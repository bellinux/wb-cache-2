5000|$|<b>Filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> {{with the}} {{ingredients}} is called charging. The BOS process is autogenous, i.e. the required thermal energy is produced during the oxidation process. Maintaining the proper charge balance, {{the ratio of}} hot metal, from melt, to cold scrap, is therefore very important. The BOS vessel can be tilted up to 360° and is tilted towards the deslagging side for charging scrap and hot metal. The BOS vessel is charged with steel or iron scrap (25%-30%) if required. Molten iron from the ladle is added as required for the charge balance. A typical chemistry of hotmetal charged into the BOS vessel is: 4% C, 0.2-0.8% Si, 0.08%-0.18% P, and 0.01-0.04% S, {{all of which can}} be oxidised by the supplied oxygen except sulphur (which requires reducing conditions).|$|E
50|$|The most {{effective}} method for producing intense turbulence {{is by the}} impingement of one flame on another. This action is secured {{through the use of}} burners located {{in each of the four}} corners of <b>the</b> <b>furnace,</b> close to <b>the</b> floor or the water-screen. The burner nozzles are so directed that the streams of coal and air are projected along a line tangent to a small circle, lying in a horizontal plane, at the center of <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> Intensive mixing occurs where these streams meet. A scrubbing action is present which assures contact between the combustible and oxygen, thus promoting rapid combustion and reducing carbon loss. A rotative motion, similar to that of a cyclone, is imparted to the flame body, which spreads out and <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> area. <b>The</b> ignition at each burner is aided by the flame from the preceding one.|$|R
500|$|The committee, which met in private, heard {{numerous}} theories as to {{the causes}} of the fire, including the lax attitude of plumbers working in the Lords, carelessness of the servants at Howard's Coffee House—situated inside the palace—and a gas explosion. Other rumours began to circulate; the Prime Minister received an anonymous letter claiming that the fire was an arson attack. The committee issued its report on 8 November, which identified the burning of the tallies as the cause of the fire. The committee thought it unlikely that Cross and Furlong had been as careful in <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> as they had claimed, and the report stated that [...] "it is unfortunate that Mr Weobley did not more effectively superintend the burning of the tallies".|$|R
500|$|Sediment <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> subsiding <b>Furnace</b> Creek Basin as {{the area}} was pulled apart by Basin and Range extension. <b>The</b> {{resulting}} -thick <b>Furnace</b> Creek Formation is made of lakebed sediments that consist of saline muds, gravels from nearby mountains and ash from the then-active Black Mountain volcanic field. Boron, which is abundant in this formation, is dissolved by ground water and flows out onto {{the northern end of}} the Death Valley playa. Today this formation is most-prominently exposed in the badlands at Zabriskie Point. Additional subsidence of <b>the</b> <b>Furnace</b> Creek Basin was <b>filled</b> by <b>the</b> four-million-year-old Funeral Formation, which consists of [...] of conglomerates, sand, mud and volcanic material. Another smaller basin to <b>the</b> south was <b>filled</b> by <b>the</b> Copper Canyon Formation around the same time. Footprints and fossils of camels, horses, and mammoths are in all three of these Pliocene formations.|$|R
40|$|Problems {{associated}} with boilers {{are a major}} contributor to load losses in coal-fired power plants. <b>The</b> boiler <b>furnace</b> exit temperature is a key indicator of the combustion and heat transfer processes taking place and has a profound impact on the operation of the heat exchangers downstream of <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> Having a model that can predict <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> exit temperature and heat flux distributions may enable furnace performance to be predicted without having to conduct extensive experimentation. Also, comparing the results with measurements taken on the plant may enable the identification of operating problems and potential sources of losses. Thermal radiation is the dominant mode of heat transfer in <b>the</b> boiler <b>furnace.</b> <b>The</b> primary objective {{of this study is to}} develop and implement a radiation heat transfer network solution methodology based on the zonal method that may be applied to boiler <b>furnace</b> modelling. <b>The</b> zonal method allows for the prediction of heat flux and temperature distributions on the walls, inside, and at the exit of <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> Direct exchange areas are the basis of the zonal method and are a function of <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> geometry and radiative properties of the walls and the participating medium that <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> volume. <b>The</b> evaluation of direct exchange areas is done by discrete numerical integration, after which it needs to be smoothed to satisfy energy conservation. After evaluating two different smoothing techniques, the least squares technique using Lagrange multipliers was selected for this study. Following this, the solution of the radiation heat transfer network was implemented for an emitting-absorbing-scattering participating medium for two different scenarios, namely (i) solving surface and volume heat fluxes for known surface and medium temperatures, and (ii) solving surface heat fluxes and medium temperature distributions for known surface temperatures and volume heat source terms. Intermediate verification and validation steps throughout the development process show good agreement with other numerical techniques and correlations available in literature. In order to illustrate the applicability of the final model, a number of case studies are conducted. These include an illustration of the effect of slagging on <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> walls, of a faulty burner and of changes in the radiative properties of the participating medium. The results of the case studies show that the trends of the heat flux and temperature distributions obtained with the new model are in agreement with those found in literature...|$|R
50|$|Another major {{field that}} is {{currently}} being looked into is the further development of in-bed heat exchanger used with circulating fluidized bed technology. With this design, <b>the</b> bed materials <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> in-bed heat exchanger through the open top of the circulating fluidized bed <b>furnace,</b> which enables <b>the</b> control of materials through the in-bed heat exchanger. By being {{able to control the}} materials throughput rate, better control of heat absorption as well as bed temperature in <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> is achievable. With further development in this field, {{we will be able to}} fully utilize the energy required to drive <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> with minimum energy wastage.|$|R
50|$|The Kievan Rus {{technique}} for niello application was first shaping silver or gold by repoussé work, embossing, and casting.

5000|$|On 4 May 1943, Cradock and a colleague, Albert Sterry, {{were working}} on a boiler when a valve Sterry was fixing exploded, <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> boiler house with {{scalding}} steam and boiling water. Sterry was trapped in a well between <b>the</b> boiler and <b>furnace</b> and although Cradock, who {{was on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> at <b>the</b> time, could have jumped to safety he called for a ladder and attempted to climb down to rescue his workmate.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{multipurpose}} furnace designed for studies using synchrotron radiation on polycrystalline materials, namely, metals, ceramics, and (semi) crystalline polymers. <b>The</b> <b>furnace</b> {{has been designed}} to carry out three-dimensional (3 D) x-ray diffraction measurements but can also be used for other types of synchrotron radiation research. <b>The</b> <b>furnace</b> has a very low thermal gradient across the specimen (< 0. 2 °C/mm). Accurate determination of the temperature can be carried out by welding a thermocouple to <b>the</b> specimen. <b>The</b> <b>furnace</b> can be rotated over an angle of 90 ° {{in order to determine the}} crystallographic orientation of each individual grain. It is possible to follow growth kinetics of all grains in the illuminated volume of the specimen. The specimen environment can be controlled varying from vacuum (up to 10 ? 5 mbar) to gas or air <b>filled.</b> <b>The</b> maximum temperature of operation is 1500 °C, with the possibility of achieving high heating (up to 20 °C/ s) and cooling rates (up to 30 °C/ s without quenching gas). 3 D maps of the microstructure of the specimen can be generated at elevated temperatures by bringing the high-resolution detector close to the specimen. We show an example of a simulation of the heat affected zone during the thermal cycle of a weld in a transformation-induced plasticity steel carried out using <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> <b>The</b> unique characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> open possibility of new fields in materials research using synchrotron radiation.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{were sold}} to William Butz, who {{dismantled}} most of the buildings for scrap iron and lumber. However, the masonry structures were allowed to remain, albeit in a decayed condition.

40|$|Nowadays, various kind of reactor {{furnaces}} {{are widely}} used for the production in industry. The raw materials charged into <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> generate reaction heat produced by blowing gas. Generally speaking, the reaction heat generated in <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> is remarkably high. Therefore the occurrence of an inappropriate temperature distribution in <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> may make damege or serious accident of <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> This is <b>the</b> motivation of <b>furnace</b> control. <b>The</b> author is considering the application of studied results to <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> control of Blast Furnace in steel industry. To the propose, the approximated and simplified Macro Model of <b>the</b> Blast <b>Furnace</b> is constructed which has the function of representation of qualitative characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> in dynamical sense. <b>The</b> <b>furnace</b> temperature, distribution greatly effects both on the producting and the product quality of <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> Needless to say, stable furnace operation is indispensable for the economical prosperity of the industry.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>furnace</b> {{was built}} by Joseph Dilliard, who had {{experience}} running iron works in his native Pennsylvania, Virginia and in Tennessee.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is the {{analysis}} of potential use of new materials in <b>the</b> electric <b>furnace</b> hearth lining and indication of the operating effects for <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> resulting from their use. The impact of the application of new hearth lining materials on a total power needed to receive through air cooling system of <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> hearth was also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Within the frameworks of research, electric furnace operational properties were compiled and a furnace mathematical model {{on the basis of the}} finite element method was created. Based on operational data the created model was calibrated. Analysis of the influence of new hearth lining materials on <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> operation was performed. In analysis the change of materials properties resulting from <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> operation over <b>the</b> years was taken into consideration. Findings: As a result of carried out calculations and analysis the amounts of heat flux transferred, in successive periods of operation, through hearth working layer to cooling installations were acquired. Basing on simulations and calculations, for the above mentioned heat flux, temperatures were calculated on the bottom shell of <b>furnace,</b> in <b>the</b> electrodes axes for different periods of furnace operation. Practical implications: To achieve a decrease in thermal load of hearth it is advisable to reduce thickness of <b>filling</b> material near <b>the</b> vertical wall of <b>furnace</b> and <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> acquired space with new graphite blocks applied to the last layer of hearth. Those information were crucial and had an actual impact on a final design of furnace lining. Originality/value: Carried out analysis have crucial meaning for furnace user, as they allow to predict the probable operation of furnace with new lining materials over the years. This will also make it easier to control the state of lining materials wear and will allow for a better process control...|$|R

In order to utilise the industrial waste, an attempt is made to stabilise the red soil by adding blast furnace slag. This project work aims to evaluate the effect of addition of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % blast furnace slag in order to stabilize the red soil and to verify its suitability {{to be used as}} a construction material for road, embankment and structural <b>fills.</b> <b>The</b> blast <b>furnace</b> slag is collected from Rourkela Steel Plant and the red soil is collected from the campus of National Institute of Technology Rourkela for evaluating its suitability as a construction material for various geotechnical works. Its consistency properties, compaction properties, and strength parameter are tested. In this project the effects of addition of blast furnace slag is investigated and is compared with that of the virgin red soil. The overall testing program was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the physical, and chemical engineering properties of the red soil samples were studied by conducting Hydrometer analysis, Light compaction test and UCS test.
