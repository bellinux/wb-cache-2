40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{automobile}} fuel efficiency {{policies in the}} presence of two externalities i) a global environmental problem and ii) international innovation spillovers. Using a simple model with two regions, we show that both a fuel tax and a tax on vehicles based on their fuel economy rating are needed to decentralize the first best. We also show that if policies are not coordinated between regions, the resulting gas taxes will be set too low and each region will use the tax on <b>fuel</b> <b>rating,</b> to reduce the damage caused by foreign drivers. If standards are used instead of taxes, we find that spillovers may alleviate free-riding. Under some conditions, a strict standard in one region may favour the adoption of a strict standard in the other one.

40|$|Electronics {{have become}} a {{standard}} in agricultural equipment and the trend of “smarter” equipment is on the rise. To have “smarter” equipment, a working knowledge of {{the accuracy of the}} data being transmitted throughout that equipment is needed. The controller area network (CAN) bus is the current interface to machine operation data transmitted between electronic control units (ECUs). Because CAN bus has been around for nearly thirty years, numerous devices have been created for interfacing with the bus. Choosing a device can be a challenge, especially without knowing if there are differences between the logging methods for true data representation. By logging simultaneously with three different methods, data was analyzed to determine if excessive error existed between logged datasets. Additionally because many messages are calculated (e. g., not measured directly), determining the accuracy of those messages can be important for management decisions or research studies. One calculated CAN bus message that holds a great deal of value is the engine <b>fuel</b> <b>rate,</b> and because it is calculated rather than measured, excessive error may exist in the CAN bus value. A comparison between the calculated CAN bus <b>fuel</b> <b>rate</b> message and a physically measured <b>fuel</b> <b>rate</b> provided information on the message accuracy. The Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory (NTTL) has a certified <b>fuel</b> <b>rate</b> measuring system capable of ± 0. 5 % accuracy. Results showed that error between logging methods was quite low, however file size was an issue with some of the logging methods. Waveform file logging required only 6 % memory space compared to the frame logging methods. <b>Fuel</b> <b>rate</b> as recorded from the CAN bus resulted in a ± 5 % error from physically measured <b>fuel</b> <b>rates.</b> Error for higher <b>fuel</b> <b>rates</b> within the torque curve were closer to ± 1 %. These results indicated that the <b>fuel</b> <b>rate</b> given by the CAN bus can indeed be used for management or research purposes. Adviser: Joe D. Luc...|$|R

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{alternative to}} fossil fuel for Diesel engines {{is the use}} of Diesel-like oil from plastic wastes: such a solution yields the double advantage of recovering the valuable energy content of wastes, as well as of mitigating the disposal problem of the very large amount of plastic wastes produced by both domestic and industrial activities. The present paper describes the experimental campaign carried out on a current production indirect injection, naturally aspirated diesel engine, running on standard Commercial Diesel Oil (CDO) and on a Waste Plastic Oil (WPO) derived from the pyrolysis of plastics. Tests have been carried out at both full and partial load, while in-cylinder pressure traces have been measured in order to analyze the combustion phase. The results of the experimental campaign showed a slight reduction of engine performance for the WPO, basically due to a lower volumetric <b>fuel</b> <b>rating,</b> but better brake specific fuel consumption and brake fuel conversion efficiency (differences up to 8 %). In-cylinder pressure traces, measured at the same load, revealed some difference {{in the first part of}} the combustion process, in particular at high speeds, where for WPO heat release is smoother. Engine soot emissions are always lower running on WPO, with difference up to 50 % at full load...|$|E

30|$|The {{variation}} of common emission indices with <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rate</b> indicates that linear relationships are present for certain fuel flow fragments, where fuel flow fragments are the <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rate</b> regions {{for a given}} flight phase {{for all of the}} engines. For instance, the given <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rates</b> for the climb phases of all the engine models constitute a fuel flow region, while there are other specific fuel flow ranges for the other three flight phases: takeoff, approach, and landing. In other words, there is specific fuel flow region for each flight phase for the engines of each group. For these regions, the relationship between the emission indices and the <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rates</b> can be straightforwardly identified. However, for <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rates</b> outside the specified regions, particularly between the two regions, the approach based on the aforementioned relationship can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, one needs additional methods which can be obtained utilizing the sequential regions. For instance, if the overall fuel flow ranges are divided into three parts (highest, medium, and lowest regions indicating the amount of fuel flow), then the region between the highest and medium <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rates</b> and also between the medium and the lowest <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rates</b> can be described by additional relationships. The required model descriptions are presented in the following section.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} define in-field tractor load states offers the {{potential}} to better specify and characterize <b>fuel</b> consumption <b>rate</b> for various field operations. For the same field operation, the tractor experiences diverse load demands and corresponding <b>fuel</b> use <b>rates</b> as it maneuvers through straight passes, turns, suspended operation for adjustments, repair and maintenance, and biomass or other material transfer operations. It is challenging to determine the actual <b>fuel</b> <b>rate</b> and load states of agricultural machinery using force prediction models, and hence, some form of in-field data acquisition capability is required. Controller Area Networks (CAN) available on the current model tractors provide engine performance data {{which can be used}} to determine tractor load states in field conditions. In this study, CAN message data containing <b>fuel</b> <b>rate,</b> engine speed and percent torque were logged from the tractor’s diagnostic port during anhydrous NH 3 application, field cultivation and planting operations. Time series and frequency plots of <b>fuel</b> <b>rate</b> and percent torque were generated to evaluate tractor load states. Based on the percent torque, engine speed and rated engine power, actual load on the tractor was calculated in each tractor load state. Anhydrous NH 3 application and field cultivation were characterized by three distinct tractor load states (TS-I, TS-II and TS-III) corresponding to idle states, parallel and headland passes, and turns, whereas corn planting was characterized by two load states (TS-I and TS-II) : idle, and a combined state with parallel, headland passes and turns. For anhydrous NH 3 application and field cultivation at ground speeds of 7. 64 km h– 1 and 8. 68 km h– 1, average tractor load per tool and <b>fuel</b> use <b>rate</b> per tool of the implement were found to be 7. 21 kW tool– 1, 3. 28 L h– 1 tool– 1, and 1. 31 kW tool– 1, 0. 64 L h– 1 tool– 1, respectively.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) establishes for the Department of Defense (DOD) the price DOD will use for pricing crude oil when constructing its budget for upcoming fiscal years. DOD in turn uses OMB's price in establishing the standard price {{to be used for}} a barrel of fuel for budgeting purposes by DOD fuel customers such as the military services. Because of the volatility of world petroleum prices, the standard price for a barrel of fuel included in the President's annual budget request for DOD may be lower or higher than the actual price established by the world market at any point in time after DOD's budget request is submitted to the Congress. During the fiscal year, DOD pays for fuel at the actual market rate, which typically varies from the budgeted rate. As a result, if the actual price of crude oil increases above the price DOD charges its customers, more dollars are needed to pay for fuel than originally budgeted. If the actual price is lower than what DOD charges its customers, DOD has more dollars than needed. Additionally, if DOD responds to increases in the world market crude oil prices by increasing the price it charges its customers above what they initially budgeted, the customers will have additional funding needs to pay their fuel bills. Concerned as to whether DOD's method for setting fuel prices has produced realistic budget estimates, last year the Congress required DOD to consider alternative methods. Specifically, the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the <b>fuel</b> <b>rate</b> and cost projection used in the annual DOD budget presentation. The act required that DOD identify alternative approaches, including approaches used by other federal departments and agencies and the feasibility of using private economic forecasting organizations, for selecting <b>fuel</b> <b>rates</b> that would produce more realistic estimates of the amounts required for DOD to accommodate <b>fuel</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuations. DOD is also required to discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each approach and to identify the department's preferred approach among the alternatives and provide a rationale for preferring that approach. Finally, the act further requires that GAO review DOD's report, including the basis for the Secretary's conclusions for the preferred approach. DOD submitted its report to the Congress on February 27, 2007. In response to the act, we determined (1) the extent to which DOD identified and evaluated alternative crude oil forecasts that could be used in setting its <b>fuel</b> <b>rates</b> [...] such as forecasts used by other federal departments and agencies and private economic forecasting organizations, and (2) DOD's basis for selecting its preferred <b>fuel</b> <b>rate</b> setting approach. ...|$|R
