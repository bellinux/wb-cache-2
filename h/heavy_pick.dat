I filibustered twelve hours a day with a <b>heavy</b> <b>pick</b> and a spade, choppin' away the luxurious {{landscape}} that grew upon the right of way. We worked in swamps that smelled {{like there was a}} leak in the gas mains, trampin' down a fine assortment of the most expensive hothouse plants and vegetables. The scene was tropical beyond the wildest imagination of the geography man. The trees was all sky-scrapers; the underbrush was full of needles and pins; there was monkeys jumpin' around and crocodiles and pink-tailed mockin'-birds, and ye stood knee-deep in the rotten water and grabbled roots for the liberation of Guatemala. Of nights we would build smudges in camp to discourage the mosquitoes, and sit in the smoke, with the guards pacin' all around us. There was two hundred men workin' on the road--mostly Dagoes, nigger-men, Spanish-men and Swedes. Three or four were Irish.|$|E

50|$|Generally, a <b>heavier</b> <b>pick</b> {{produces}} a darker sound than a lighter pick, but {{the shape of}} the tip has the most influence on the sound. A pointed tip {{produces a}} brighter, more focused sound, while a rounded tip produces a rounder, less defined sound.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of picks available, {{but due to}} the thicker, heavier strings of the electric bass, bassists tend to use <b>heavier</b> <b>picks</b> than those used for electric guitar, typically ranging from 1.14 mm-3.00 mm (3.00 is unusual). Different materials are used for picks, including plastic, nylon, rubber, and felt, all of which produce different tones. Felt and rubber picks are used to emulate a fingerstyle tone.|$|R

5000|$|An {{issue with}} the unit was the bridge itself, which Leo Fender over-engineered. The six {{individual}} bridge saddles were multi-grooved [...] "barrels". The individual barrels were not grooved deeply enough for secure holding of the strings in <b>heavy</b> <b>pick</b> attack, and each barrel had a tiny adjustment screw at each end. Adding the intonation adjustment screws, and the screws {{at each end of}} the bridge saddle to raise or lower the bridge as a whole, gave the bridge twenty separate adjustment possibilities. The great majority of players found this much too [...] "fiddly", and, adding the tendency of the strings to jump out of their individual saddles in aggressive playing, the overall reception was rather lukewarm for what was essentially an excellent [...] - [...] but over-engineered [...] - [...] design. Later, many players of the Jazzmaster and Jaguar found that the bridge on these instruments could be replaced with no retrofitting by the standard bridge from the Fender Mustang (below), which eliminated several of the worst problems with the original bridge.|$|E

50|$|Ourrouar II is 500 m east of {{the bridge}} over Nahr Ghedir on slopes of {{cemented}} conglomerates behind two empty houses. The site was discovered and Heavy Neolithic material recovered along with traces of other morphologies by Peter Wescombe in 1965. Finds included a rough, celt-shaped axe, numerous short, <b>heavy</b> <b>picks,</b> a chopper, burins, flakes and blades in poor quality grey flint, several of which were rather large in size. Another smaller group of tools {{was found on the}} lower and western slopes made of flint that had patinated to white that included steep-scrapers and sickle blade elements. The lower slopes of the site were destroyed during new road construction. Material is held by the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Andrew Moore suggested that the station was a factory site for Heavy Neolithic tools of the Qaraoun culture.|$|R

50|$|Pineapple {{picking and}} {{planting}} {{were the primary}} work-related activities, although mulching fields, weeding, planting, driving pineapple trucks, cooking, and other activities were also done. A specified gang from each location was dedicated as Caf-staff and arose earlier than other gangs to keep meals for the entire camp. Night-shifts were needed during <b>heavy</b> <b>picking</b> seasons to get the mature fruit from the fields for MLP. Gangs (work teams from 14 to 20 boys with an adult Luna leader) that were nomintated by camp leadership worked under night-lighted harvester (booms) worked the late swing shifts, returning to camp after the other gangs had already to sleep. Some gangs were also permitted {{to work at the}} Maui Canning facility, integrating with local workers. Truck drivers had to be licensed to drive and be 18 years old. They kept separate sleeping and living quarters from the youth and kept most activities separately, with exception of camp meetings and holidays.|$|R

5000|$|Taking turns, the Wrights made four brief, low-altitude flights that day. The flight paths {{were all}} {{essentially}} straight; turns were not attempted.

Soon after, a <b>heavy</b> gust <b>picked</b> up the Flyer and tumbled it end over end, damaging it beyond any hope of quick repair. It was never flown again.|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} a new realization of type-II seesaw for neutrino masses and baryon asymmetry by extending {{the standard model}} with one light and two heavy singlet scalars besides one Higgs triplet. The <b>heavy</b> singlets <b>pick</b> up small vacuum expectation values to give a suppressed trilinear coupling between the triplet and doublet Higgs bosons after the light singlet drives the spontaneous breaking of lepton number. The Higgs triplet can thus remain light and be accessible at the LHC. The lepton number conserving decays of the heavy singlets can generate a lepton asymmetry stored in the Higgs triplet {{to account for the}} matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. We further introduce stable gauge bosons from a hidden sector, which obtain masses and annihilate into the Higgs triplet after spontaneous breaking of the associated non-Abelian gauge symmetry. With Breit-Wigner enhancement, the stable gauge bosons can simultaneously explain the relic density of dark matter and the cosmic positron/electron excesses.

50|$|Wadi Sallah is an {{branch of}} the Wadi Fa'rah where a small cave {{is located in the}} Palestinian Tubas Governorate in the northeastern West Bank, located five {{kilometers}} southwest of Tubas. The cave was discovered and excavated by Francis Turville-Petre between 1925 and 1926. It contained an occupational Heavy Neolithic archaeological site of the Qaraoun culture. This culture was without pottery and typically used large axes for chopping lumber, cutting wood and felling trees such as the cedars of Lebanon in preparation for the domestication of emmer wheat and the Neolithic Revolution. Levels II and III of Turville-Petre's excavations revealed deposits of flints and potsherds. The pottery was later in date that the Heavy Neolithic material, which included <b>heavy</b> blades (<b>picks,</b> adzes, borers and flake scrapers), massive flake scrapers, and pieces with denticulation, all similar to those found at Shemouniyeh and Wadi Fa'rah. Several arrowheads were also found that were pressure flaked, generally tanged and leaf-shaped. One of these was of the Amuq 2 type.|$|R
5000|$|The Neolithic {{wall was}} complemented by a stone tower built into it.

Furthermore, the construction of such a project implies some sort of social organization, division of labour, and classes. Surrounding the wall was a ditch 8.2 m wide by 2.7 m deep, cut through solid bedrock with a circumference around the town of as much as 600 m. Kathleen Kenyon commented on the work involved in the construction of the ditch: [...] "The labor involved in excavating this ditch out of solid rock must have been tremendous.
