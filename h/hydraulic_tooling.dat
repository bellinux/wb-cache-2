40|$|Many {{conventional}} truck and working machines {{are equipped with}} additional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tooling</b> or manipulation systems which are usually fed through a mechanical connection with the internal combustion engine, involving a poor efficiency. In particular, {{this is a common}} situation for industrial vehicles whose mission profiles involves a relevant consumption of energy by the on board hydraulic systems, respect to the one really needed for only traction purpose. In this work it is proposed an innovative solution based on the adoption of a system aimed to recover braking energy in order to feed an efficient on board hydraulic actuation system. The proposed system is then adopted to a real application, an Isuzu truck equipped with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tooling</b> for garbage collection. A prototype of the system has been designed, assembled and tested showing a relevant improvement of system efficiency and the feasibility of the proposed approach. In the paper the proposed solution is presented, showing the simulation models and preliminary validation results including experimental devices assembled to perform the tests...|$|E
40|$|On April 5, 1991, a {{solid rocket}} booster (SRB) forward skirt serial number (S/N) 20022 {{sustained}} buckling damage during water impact after {{the launch of}} Space Transportation System Flight 37 (STS- 37). As of that date, five forward skirts had been lost during water impact. Repair attempts began with the least damaged skirt available (S/N 20022). Sp ecial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tooling</b> {{was used to remove}} buckled areas of the skirt. Afterwards, its aft clevis pinholes were found to be out of alignment with the redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) check gauge, but weld passes were used to correct this condition. Meanwhile, USA Analytics generated mechanical property data for buckled and subsequently debuckled material. Their analysis suggested that structural integrity might be improved by adding stringer reinforcements, stiffeners, to the aft bay section of the skirt. This improvement was recommended as a fleet modification to be implemented on a case-by-case basis...|$|E
