5|$|Although spiders {{are widely}} feared, {{only a few}} species are {{dangerous}} to people. Spiders will only bite humans <b>in</b> <b>self-defense,</b> and few produce worse effects than a mosquito bite or bee-sting. Most of those with medically serious bites, such as recluse spiders and widow spiders, would rather flee and bite only when trapped, although this can easily arise by accident. Funnel web spiders' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom, although they rarely inject much, has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 years. They have been deemed to be the world's most dangerous spiders on clinical and venom toxicity grounds, though this claim has also been attributed to the Brazilian wandering spider, due to much more frequent accidents.|$|E

50|$|As Johnson {{explains}} both <b>in</b> Logical <b>Self-Defense</b> {{as well as}} {{his journal}} article Making Sense of “Informal Logic,” that Informal Logic is the philosophical practice of understanding and evaluating natural language argumentation.

However, more simply the idea is to evaluate arguments based upon three essential criteria, again as explained in both Making Sense of “Informal Logic,” and more thoroughly explained <b>in</b> Logical <b>Self-Defense,</b> the premises of arguments must be relevant to the conclusion, sufficient to support it, and acceptable to the audience. In this approach to logic, fallacies such as the straw man, red herring etc. point to a deficiency in the premises in one of these three criteria.|$|R
