25|$|Part of the {{previous}} permissive dialing plan included a mass calling prefix for radio station contests, introduced in the 1960s because some contests put unacceptable loads on the Bay Area's telephone switches. Until the 1980s, radio station call-in contests throughout the Bay Area used 575-numbers. <b>Electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> <b>equipment</b> of the day had been engineered to accommodate large call volumes to 575-numbers.

50|$|The {{attempts}} {{to replace the}} <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> matrices by semiconductor cross point switches were not immediately successful, particularly in large exchanges. As a result, many space division <b>switching</b> systems used <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> networks with SPC. Nonetheless, private automatic branch exchanges (PABX) and smaller exchanges do use electronic switching devices. The two types of space division electronic switching systems are using <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> network and the other using electronic switching network. The second type is fully electronic.|$|R
