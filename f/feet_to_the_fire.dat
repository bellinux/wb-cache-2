6000|$|... "That's another queer thing. Tea is your panacea for {{all human}} ills yet there isn't any {{nourishment}} in it. I'd {{rather have a}} glass of milk, thank you," [...] said Mac, taking an easy chair and stretching his <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} these Indians lay {{side by side on}} their {{outspread}} blankets, with their <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> gazing through the branches at the stars, and puffing away in profound silence, but probably deep thought. At least a sudden exclamation by Mozwa warrants that conclusion.|$|E
60|$|Several {{times as}} these stories had been told, {{the group had}} risen <b>to</b> their <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> watch <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> that were burning {{in various parts of}} the town, and just as the {{sergeant}} brought his story <b>to</b> a close, <b>the</b> assembly sounded.|$|R

50|$|On {{the evening}} of March 23, 1916, Kenney drove <b>to</b> a <b>fire</b> at <b>the</b> El Dorado Oil Works (a {{processor}} of coconut oil and copra) located {{at the foot of}} University Avenue in Berkeley. He ran his car into a telephone pole, disabling the car, but emerged from the wreck uninjured. He then proceeded on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> a few blocks away. After assisting with a hose, Kenney led a group of firefighters into the burning plant, but they were forced <b>to</b> retreat from <b>the</b> heat and smoke. Kenney collapsed on the sidewalk, and his cousin, Stephen Kenney, a fire captain, got him to a car and rushed him to Roosevelt Hospital (later called Herrick Hospital, today, a part of Alta Bates Summit Medical Center). He was announced dead on arrival.|$|R
6000|$|Bunco {{grinned at}} this, and {{observed}} {{that it was}} [...] "time for hims be go sleep." [...] Whereupon he rolled his blanket about him and lay down with his <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Will Osten also lay down and fell asleep almost immediately. Larry, too, stretched himself out in repose, leaving Big Ben still engaged with the buffalo beef.|$|E
60|$|After {{putting on}} such dry clothes as we had, and hanging {{the others to}} dry on the pole which the Indian {{arranged}} over the fire, we ate our supper, {{and lay down on}} the pebbly shore with our <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> without pitching our tent, making a thin bed of grass to cover the stones.|$|E
60|$|All {{had plenty}} of wraps, so the girls nestled into the three large chairs, Bob and Tony rolled {{themselves}} up in the robe, with their <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and were soon snoring like weary hunters. Mark pillowed his head on a log, and was sound asleep in ten minutes {{in spite of his}} promise to be sentinel.|$|E
50|$|A banished Indian Prince was shipwrecked and the Goddess of Earth, Manimekalai, taking pity {{created a}} rocky shelf {{for him to}} save his life and that {{subsequently}} he headed <b>to</b> Unawatuna. <b>The</b> Goddess of Chastity, Pattini, created a wall of fire to prevent him coming ashore, but being a person of some supreme power, he set in motion a tsunami with his <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> extinguish <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and set foot on the shores of Unawatuna.|$|R
60|$|Being thus invited, I {{consented to}} spin them a yarn. The old gentleman settled {{himself in his}} chair, my mother {{smoothed}} her apron, folded her hands, and looked meekly into my face. Tom Lokins filled his pipe, stretched out his <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> poke <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> with <b>the</b> toe of his shoe, and began to smoke like a steam-engine; then I cleared my throat and began my tale, and before I had done talking that night, I had told them all that I have told in this little book, almost word for word.|$|R
50|$|In one of {{his last}} public statements, Berrigan said,The American people are, more and more, making their voices heard against Bush and his warrior clones. Bush and his minions slip out of control, {{determined}} to go to war, determined to go it alone, determined <b>to</b> endanger <b>the</b> Palestinians further, determined to control Iraqi oil, determined to ravage further a suffering people and their shattered society. The American people can stop Bush, can yank his <b>feet</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> can banish <b>the</b> war makers from Washington D.C., can turn this society around and restore it to faith and sanity.|$|R
60|$|Camp {{was made}} in an open wood. Darkness fell and the men were resting on bough beds, <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> with Tom curled up close by, and the horses still {{drooping}} {{where they had been}} unsaddled. Morning, however, discovered them grazing on the long, bleached grass. John shook his head when he looked at them.|$|E
60|$|There was a quiet, easy-going lowness in {{the speech}} and motions of the two friends, which showed {{that they were just}} in a state of {{readiness}} to fall into the arms of the drowsy god. They rolled themselves in their blankets, placed their rifles by their sides, their heads on their saddles, and their <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was not long, however, ere appetites were appeased, and the voyagers sought repose; for men {{who have}} to work hard all day at a healthy {{occupation}} are not addicted to late hours--at least not in the wildernesses of the nor'-west. Ere long every man was rolled in his blanket, stretched out with his <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and his head on his coat, while the blaze sank low, until at last the red embers alone remained to render darkness visible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{slippers}} are new," [...] he said. [...] "You {{could not}} have had them {{more than a few}} weeks. The soles which you are at this moment presenting to me are slightly scorched. For a moment I thought they might have got wet and been burned in the drying. But near the instep there is a small circular wafer of paper with the shopman's hieroglyphics upon it. Damp would of course have removed this. You had, then, been sitting with your <b>feet</b> outstretched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> which a man would hardly do even in so wet a June as this if he were in his full health." ...|$|R
60|$|Four other men, bound {{hand and}} <b>foot,</b> lay close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> By its flames Malcolm saw the green scarves that {{told they were}} Scotchmen of his own brigade, and he {{determined}} at once to rescue them or die in the attempt. He crept forward {{until he reached the}} edge of the road; then he raised a pistol and with a steady aim fired at one of the natives, who fell dead across <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R
40|$|What is {{consensus}} in economic policy advice? If most or even all economists agree on some economic claim, {{that does not}} make the claim correct; that is, passing for true is not being true. That is perhaps the unifying message of the fourteen chapters in this edited volume. Furthermore, economic theory is urged to develop in ways such that economists can have their <b>feet</b> held <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> sparked by their advice <b>to</b> policymakers. <b>The</b> volume explores these messages through a series of overarching themes, including the effect of uncertainty in economists' policy analyses, the role of truth in the advice given by economists, and specific topics in the philosophy of economic science, especially the potential for pragmatic theories to deploy standards of truth in order to address uncertainty in policymaking...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wi' that I {{knocked the}} ashes out o' my pipe, {{stretched}} myself out wi' my <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> an' rolled my blanket round me. The critter larfed again {{at this as}} if it was a great joke, but he shut up his book, put it and the bag o' leetle birds under his head for a pillow, spread himself out over the camp like a great spider that was awk'ard in the use o' its limbs, an' went off to sleep even before I did--an' that was sharp practice, let me tell you.|$|E
6000|$|Dick had {{purposely}} {{kept the}} dog's supper back from him, {{in order that}} they might eat it in company. And between every bite and sup that Dick took, he gave a bite--but not a sup--to Crusoe. Thus lovingly they ate together; and, when Dick lay that night under the willow branches looking up through them at the stars, with his <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and Crusoe close along his side, he thought it the best and sweetest supper he ever ate, and the happiest evening he ever spent--so wonderfully do circumstances modify our notions of felicity! ...|$|E
6000|$|Thirlwell knitted {{his brows}} and lighted his pipe, {{which he had}} put near the fire to thaw, and there was silence until the Metis arrived with the sledge, when they took the missionary to their camp and gave him food. After he had eaten they lay down with their <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and Thirlwell said: [...] "If the man had seen your fire and come to borrow {{something}} or find out who you were, he would have spoken. There's nobody I can think of who has not some grounds for wishing you well, but {{it looks as if}} the fellow thought you were asleep and meant to let you starve." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this the}} man knew. The {{old-timer}} on Sulphur Creek {{had told him}} about it the previous fall, and now he was appreciating the advice. Already all sensation had gone out of his <b>feet.</b> <b>To</b> build <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> he had been forced to remove his mittens, and the fingers had quickly gone numb. His pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface of his body and <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> extremities. But the instant he stopped, the action of the pump eased down. The cold of space smote the unprotected tip of the planet, and he, being on that unprotected tip, received the full force of the blow. The blood of his body recoiled before it. The blood was alive, like the dog, and like the dog it wanted to hide away and cover itself up from the fearful cold. So long as he walked four miles an hour, he pumped that blood, willy-nilly, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface; but now it ebbed away and sank down into the recesses of his body. The extremities were <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> feel its absence. His wet feet froze the faster, and his exposed fingers numbed the faster, though they had not yet begun to freeze. Nose and cheeks were already freezing, while the skin of all his body chilled as it lost its blood.|$|R
50|$|The {{next stage}} of this short <b>the</b> {{carriage}} continues <b>to</b> climb a tall hill in the track. The two reach {{the top of the}} drop which is exaggerated <b>to</b> reach beyond <b>the</b> clouds and into space. Roger looks down and sees the world. Moments later the carriage drops down thousands of meters. The speed of the drop is maintained throughout the remainder of the chase. After a few twist and turns (in the track) a shot of Jessica Rabbit appears, where she is tied down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tracks, unable <b>to</b> move. She calls out to be saved before Roger and Baby Herman's carriage crushes her. As the cart draws near, it topples over and fortunately bounces over Jessica avoiding her completely. The camera moves along and beside her appears Droopy for a quick one-liner. The story then continues. Roger grasps onto Baby Herman, tumbling and losing their carriage, leaving Roger sliding along the tracks with his feet, gradually gaining friction causing his <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> catch <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> tracks run into a dark tunnel and then stumbles across a 'wrong way sign'. Finally Herman and Roger crash through the sign and into a real-life filming studio. A direct reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reality/cartoon crossover in the feature film.|$|R
500|$|With 3 RAR {{achieving}} limited {{results in}} AO Manly, MacDonald suggested that Dunstan establish the battalion {{in a new}} location east of Route 16 in order to locate and destroy the North Vietnamese bases suspected <b>to</b> be in <b>the</b> area. 3 RAR subsequently occupied FSB Balmoral in AO Newport, [...] north of Coral, on 24 May {{in the hope of}} provoking another battle. Shelton was keen <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> mistakes that had been made during the earlier occupation of FSB Coral however, and he sent two companies forward on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> occupy <b>the</b> new <b>fire</b> support base while the battalion tactical headquarters accompanied them in APCs. During the insertion {{there were a number of}} contacts between the Australians and North Vietnamese, with at least one North Vietnamese soldier being killed. Yet with B and D Companies securing the landing zone, the remainder of 3 RAR was inserted by helicopter from FSB Coogee in the late afternoon. FSB Balmoral would be developed as a battalion defensive position only, and 161st Battery RNZA was subsequently flown to FSB Coral, in order to concentrate all of the artillery in that location from where they would be able <b>to</b> cover <b>the</b> whole of the new AO. Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese had been caught by surprise and, with no time prepare an attack, they were unable <b>to</b> respond on <b>the</b> first evening. Regardless, 3 RAR worked quickly to establish their defensive position, digging in and laying wire and claymore mines.|$|R
60|$|At {{the close}} of this amicable dispute, each man rolled himself in his blanket and lay down to sleep with his <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Being {{in a part of}} the country where there were very few Indians, and these few on pretty good terms with the white trappers, no watch was set. Bertram lay down with his tattered cloak around him, and, taking a little book from his pocket, read it, or {{appeared}} to read it, till he fell asleep-- on observing which, March Marston crept noiselessly to his side, and, lying gently down beside him, covered him with a portion of his own blanket. Ere long the camp was buried in repose.|$|E
60|$|But, {{whatever}} the thoughts suggested, the whole camp soon afterwards sank into repose. Tent-doors were drawn and curtains of waggon-tilts let down. The boers, sticking their big pipes in their hatbands, wrapped themselves in greatcoats, and, regardless of snake or scorpion, stretched their limbs {{on the bare}} ground, while Hottentots, negroes, and Bushmen, rolling themselves in sheepskin karosses, lay coiled up like balls with their <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Only once was the camp a little disturbed, during {{the early part of}} the night, by the mournful howl of a distant hyena. It was the first that the newcomers had heard, and most of those who were awake raised themselves on their elbows eagerly to listen.|$|E
60|$|That {{night we}} lay in our snow camp, {{gazing up at}} the stars, with our <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> talking of gold and {{diamonds}} with all the eagerness of veritable misers--though it is but justice to myself to add that Eve's blue eyes outshone, in my imagination, all the diamonds that ever decked the brow of Wealth or Beauty! When at last we slept, our dreams partook of the same glittering ideas--coupled, of course, {{with much of the}} monstrous absurdity to which dreams are liable. I had just discovered a gem which was so large that I experienced the utmost difficulty in thrusting it into my coat-pocket, and was busy shovelling small diamonds of the purest water into a wheelbarrow, when a tremendous whack on my nose awoke me.|$|E
50|$|The {{number two}} engine {{incorrectly}} signaled an under temperature reading, causing <b>the</b> flight engineer <b>to</b> enrich <b>the</b> fuel mixture <b>to</b> that engine, {{leading to an}} actual over temperature situation. <b>The</b> engine caught <b>fire,</b> and after two attempts by one of <b>the</b> flight crew <b>to</b> quench <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>the</b> engine reignited causing SUMIT38 <b>to</b> fall 26,000 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, killing its six crew members.|$|R
60|$|Manston drove hastily <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{turning of}} the road, tied his horse, and ran on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site of <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R
50|$|The canal {{starts at}} the Birmingham Level, descends 45 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Walsall Level, then rises 65 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wolverhampton Level.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman who}} had been shaken out of her sleep by Thomasin had hastily dressed herself and lighted a fire, the other servant being left to snore on in peace {{at the back of the}} house. The insensible forms of Eustacia, Clym, and Wildeve were then brought in and laid on the carpet, with their <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> when such {{restorative}} processes as could be thought of were adopted at once, the stableman being in the meantime sent for a doctor. But there seemed to be not a whiff of life left in either of the bodies. Then Thomasin, whose stupor of grief had been thrust off awhile by frantic action, applied a bottle of hartshorn to Clym's nostrils, having tried it in vain upon the othertwo. He sighed.|$|E
6000|$|General Remarks.--Although tents are {{not worth}} the trouble of pitching, on dry nights, in a healthy climate, they are {{invaluable}} protectors to a well-equipped traveller against rain, dew, and malaria. But {{a man who is}} not so equipped, who has no change of clothes, and no bedstead to sleep on, will do better to sleep in the open air, in front of a good camp fire. Napoleon I., speaking of soldiers, says ('Maximes de Guerre'):--"Tents are not healthy; it is better for the soldier to bivouac, because he sleeps with his <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> whose neighbourhood quickly dries the ground on which he lies; some planks or a little straw shelter him from the wind. Nevertheless a tent is necessary for superior officers, who have need to write and to consult a map." [...] To a party encamped for a few days, tents are of great use as storehouses for property, which otherwise becomes scattered about, at the risk of being lost or pilfered.|$|E
6000|$|Thorne {{rolled in}} his blanket close beside Mercedes. Then {{one by one}} the rangers {{stretched}} out, <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Gale found that he could not sleep. His eyes were weary, but they would not stay shut; his body ached for rest, yet he could not lie still. The night was so somber, so gloomy, and the lava-encompassed arroyo full of shadows. The dark velvet sky, fretted with white fire, seemed to be close. There was an absolute silence, as of death. Nothing moved--nothing outside of Gale's body appeared to live. The Yaqui sat like an image carved out of lava. The others lay prone and quiet. Would another night see any of them lie that way, quiet forever? Gale felt a ripple pass over him that was at once a shudder and a contraction of muscles. Used as he was to the desert and its oppression, why should he feel to-night as if the weight of its lava and the burden of its mystery were bearing him down? ...|$|E
60|$|Dinner was over, and {{the table}} cleared before Holmes alluded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> matter again. He had lit his pipe and held his slippered <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cheerful blaze of <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Suddenly {{he looked at his}} watch.|$|R
6000|$|Then he rose {{up in his}} littleness, {{and began}} to dance slowly from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, waving his lean arms over <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and singing, in the secret {{language}} of the Mulla-mulgars, as loud as ever he could: ...|$|R
50|$|Left-foot braking is the {{technique}} of using <b>the</b> left <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> operate <b>the</b> brake pedal in an automobile, leaving <b>the</b> right <b>foot</b> dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throttle pedal. It contrasts with the practice of using <b>the</b> left <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> operate <b>the</b> clutch pedal, leaving <b>the</b> right <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> share <b>the</b> duties of controlling both brake and accelerator pedals.|$|R
