40|$|Objectives: This study aims to {{describe}} a cycle of development leading to sustainable methods for involving consumers {{in the management of}} a program commissioning health technology assessment. Methods: Staff time was dedicated to developing procedures for recruiting and briefing consumers to participate in prioritizing, commissioning, and reporting research. Resources and support were developed in light of early feedback from consumers and those working with them. These were piloted and amended before being used routinely. Results: Over 4 years, procedures and resources have been developed to support six consumers attending seven to eight prioritization meetings a year; thirty to forty-five consumers each year commenting on research need for particular topics; thirty consumers a year commenting on research proposals, and twenty a year commenting on research reports. The procedures include clear <b>job</b> descriptions, <b>induction</b> and development days, clear briefing materials, payment for substantial tasks, and regularly seeking feedback to improve procedures. Conclusions: Explicit, inclusive, and reproducible methods for supporting consumer involvement that satisfy National Health Service policy recommendations for involving consumers in research require dedicated staff time to support a cycle of organizational development...|$|R
40|$|Nurses suffer disproportionate {{levels of}} stress and {{are at risk of}} sickness-absence and {{turnover}} intentions but {{there is a lack of}} research clarifying preventions. This study investigated the impact of <b>inductions</b> (<b>job</b> preparation courses) about mental health for nurses’ job stress, general health and organizational commitment. Data from 6, 656 nurses were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), showing that mental health <b>inductions</b> increase nurses’ <b>job</b> satisfaction, which reduces their occupational stress and improves their health. SEM showed that these occupational health benefits increase the nurses’ commitment to the organization. Job satisfaction (feeling valued, rewarded) also had a direct effect on nurses’ intentions to continue working for the organization. Mental health inductions are therefore beneficial beyond job performance: they increase occupational health in the nursing profession...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we study}} {{recently}} graduated employees who work as kindergarten teachers {{and who have}} completed either university degree (kindergarten teacher) or polytechnic degree (social pedagogue). We compare the respondents’ conception of their work profiles, perceived competencies and stress. The data consist of a survey answers (N = 54), that were analyzed by applying quantitative methods. Both respondent groups recognized the ambiguities in job description and division of labour between kindergarten teachers and nursery nurses. Both respondent groups had difficulties in getting time for planning and preparation work, however, the social pedagogues found this issue more problematic. The difference was statistically significant. Overall, the social pedagogues evaluated their work stress being heavier than teachers with kindergarten teacher’s training. The number of statistically significant differences was not many, but the evaluations give a wholesome picture {{of the differences between}} employees who work as kindergarten teachers with different educational backgrounds.

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} are tested: (1) {{education and}} training increase the employability of workers at other tasks within the firm and {{reduce the need for}} help from supervisors when workers encounter small problems, and (2) greater employability and problem solving capability increase wages. The empirical results show that greater employability and problem solving capability are independent from each other. Formal work-related training increases employability. Workers in <b>jobs</b> requiring no <b>induction</b> training are less employable at other jobs or departments. Both general and specific human capital increase the ability of workers to solve problems on their own. Greater employability does not increase wages. Male workers who solve problems on their own earn more than men who need help from others. The effects of human capital variables on employability and problem solving capability do not differ between and men and women. However, it is found that the ability to solve problems on one's own has a pay off for men but not for women. ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{previous}} investigations {{suggest that}} temporary workers are {{at higher risk}} of occupational injury. And it’s perhaps easy to imagine why this could be— possibilities include lack of <b>job</b> experience, inadequate <b>induction</b> and safety training, and deployment to the most hazardous jobs. Benavides et al 1 hypothesise {{that a combination of}} these factors account for the excess risk. To investigate, they examined fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries for 2000 – 01, systematically collected by the Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and classified by occupation, length of employment, and whether the contract of employment was permanent or temporary. The analysis included more than 1. 8 million occupational injuries. Temporary workers were 2. 5 times more likely to suffer a fatal injury at work and nearly {{three times more likely to}} incur a non-fatal one. After allowing for age, gender, occupation, and length of employment, all of the excess in temporary contract workers disappeared, a finding that tends to confirm the importance of knowledge and job experience in worker safety.

5000|$|Anderson {{was elected}} to the Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 2000. Although he managed 17 seasons in Detroit and just 9 seasons in Cincinnati, his Hall of Fame plaque has him wearing a Cincinnati Reds uniform. He chose to wear the Reds cap at his {{induction}} in honor of former GM Bob Howsam, who gave Anderson his first chance at a major-league managing <b>job.</b> Before his <b>induction,</b> Anderson had refused to go inside the Hall because he felt unworthy, saying [...] "I didn't ever want to go into the most precious place in the world unless I belonged." [...] In his acceptance speech he gave a lot of credit to his players, saying there were two kinds of managers, [...] "One, it ain't very smart. He gets bad players, loses games and gets fired. There was somebody like me that was a genius. I got good players, stayed out of the way, let 'em win a lot, and then just hung around for 26 years." [...] He was very proud of his Hall induction, [...] "I never wore a World Series ring ... I will wear this ring until I die." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{online learning}} programme {{with more than}} 200 courses was built by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies between starting with 2009 and 2015, offering development opportunities to the Red Cross and Red Crescent (RCRC) volunteers and staff to broaden their understanding, to strengthen their organisations, and to be better prepared in providing humanitarian aid. While {{it is difficult to}} say to what extent factors such as training, <b>job</b> mentoring, and <b>induction</b> programmes contribute to job performance and to an organisation’s efficiency, it is certain that staff and volunteers willing to undertake courses are more open to transformative and creative approaches, more prepared to tackle with new challenges, {{more likely to have a}} stock of knowledge and competencies broader than their own specialisation. Learning and “knowing to learn” are conditions for competitiveness and high performance. Over time, generally speaking, implementation of training as a priority personnel policy proved to have the most significant effects on productivity growth, therefore, efforts towards building a learning culture and delivering quality (online) learning are key for developing organisations, their staff, and the quality of services provided. An online training would make a significant difference in learners’ behaviour if it follows several practical guidelines in development, accompanied by thorough checklists to ensure relevance, consistency, alignment and to assist training programmes’ lifecycle. ...|$|R
40|$|Context: Anganwadi worker (AWW) is an {{important}} functionary in integrated child development scheme (ICDS). Aim: To study perceived responsibilities, workload, operational difficulties, and satisfaction level of AWWs. Materials and Methods: Prospective observational cross-sectional study of 66 AWWs using a pre-designed proforma: Analysis using Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 11. 5. Results: Pre-school education, house visits, records-keeping were perceived as important activities by 92. 4 %, 60. 6 %, and 57. 6 %, respectively, growth monitoring and immunization by 3 % and 4. 5 %, respectively; 51. 5 % did not have adequate time for duties, and 74. 2 % were doing non-ICDS duties. Heavy workload was the major perceived operational difficulty for 66. 7 % of the respondents. Timely supplementary food was available as per 92. 4 %. Inadequacies in equipments, workspace, training, and staffing were noted by 47 %, 18. 2 %, 7. 6 %, 7. 6 %, respectively. No operational difficulties were seen by 10. 6 %. <b>Induction</b> <b>job</b> training was provided to 36 (54. 5 %), and 17 / 66 (25. 8 %) felt they were inadequately trained despite yearly refresher courses. Dissatisfaction with monthly honorarium, availability of equipment, supplementary food, and maintenance of registries was reported by 89. 4 %, 53 %, 54. 6 %, and 43. 9 %, respectively. Despite this, 62. 1 % (40 / 66) were satisfied. Conclusions: Supplementary nutrition, growth monitoring, and immunization of children along with health education though being primary duties were given less emphasis. Heavy workload was the major perceived operational difficulty. Adequate staff, workspace, equipments, timely monthly honorarium should be provided along with training and avoidance of non-ICDS duties would help in achieving the objectives of ICDS...|$|R
40|$|Induction is {{the process}} by which we reason from the {{particular}} to the general. In this paper we use ideas from the theory of abstract machines and recursion theory to study this process. We focus on pure induction in which the conclusions “go beyond the information given” in the premises from which they are derived and on simple induction, which is rather a stark kind of induction that deals with computable predicates on the integers in rather straightforward ways. Our basic question is “What are the relationships between the kinds of abstract machinery we bring to bear on the <b>job</b> of doing <b>induction</b> and our ability to do that job well?” Our conclusions are as follows: (1) If we use only the abstract machinery of the digital computer in a computing center (which we assume to be capable of only evaluating totally computable functionals or functionals in Σ 0 of the Arithmetic Hierarchy) then a single inductive procedure can only develop finitely many sound theories. (2) If we use only the abstract machinery of the mathematician (which we assume to be the machinery required to evaluate a functional in Σ 2 of the Arithmetic Hierarchy) then we can develop inductive procedures that generate infinitely many sound theories but no procedure that is analytic {{in the sense that the}} theories it puts forth as sound will be sound in “all possible worlds”. (3) If we use the machinery of the trial and error machine (or the machinery required to evaluate functionals in Σ 2 of the Arithmetic Hierarchy) then we can develop consistent procedures for induction but none that are complete in the sense that they generate all useful theories in a fairly natural sense of “useful”. (4) Finally, if we use the machinery of the hyper-trial-anderror machine (or the machinery required to evaluate functionals in Σ 3 of the Arithmetic Hierarchy) then we can develop procedures that are both consistent and complete...|$|R

The study of principals as learners is important because the landscape of public education is changing. Schools are becoming more diverse and the demands on schools more varied and complex. The role of the principal is increasingly ambiguous, complex, and varied. Principals must adapt and develop their professional practice. Effective principals learn from experience to meet the shifting expectations of the role and the needs of the school. Multiple learning experiences help principals become more proficient in their <b>jobs.</b> Initial certification, <b>induction</b> into the role, continuing professional education, and learning from experiences are means to the development of expertise. This study provided a rich description of how principals learn from on-the-job experiences through reflective practices and how reflection can develop expertise. This study was concerned with school principals as learners and how principals can learn from experiences. Principals develop expertise through reflecting on their practice. The study examined how principals learn from experience, how principals monitor their understanding and practice, how principals integrate new understandings into practice, and how principals reframe their understandings based on experience. The conceptual framework for this study included the literature on the development of expertise, reflective practice, and cognition. Literature on principal preparation, induction, and continuing education are included. Reflective practice as a means to learn from experience and develop professional expertise are addressed in depth. The research methods for this study are grounded in phenomenology. Phenomenological research methods focus on the meaning of lived experience of principals. The results provide a rich description of how school principals learn from experiences situated in practice through reflection. The essences of the experiences of how principals learn from experiences in practice are the ability to learn from experiences through reflective meaning construction, the principal's ability to regulate learning and practice, and the ability to exercise professional judgment in practice. The participants described the ability to reflect on practice and regulate learning and performance. The phenomena as experienced by the principals in this study form a model of professional expertise in the principalship...|$|R
