5|$|The tramway {{was closed}} between 1950 and 1956, {{after which the}} {{operation}} became the Edinburgh Corporation Transport Department. In 1965, it purchased its first rear-engined <b>double-decker</b> bus, ESF801C, a Leyland Atlantean PDR1/1, which is currently preserved at the Scottish Vintage Bus Museum in Fife. Almost 600 buses {{were added to the}} fleet over the next 17 years.|$|E
5|$|A Private act, {{passed in}} September 1881, allowed the {{construction}} of more private horse tramways and additional acts were passed authorising more line construction and services by more companies. Most of the companies operated <b>double-decker</b> tram, although some were single level cabs with many built by John Stephenson Co, Duncan & Fraser of Adelaide, and from 1897 by the A at Kensington. The trams ran at an average speed of , usually two horses pulling each tram {{from a pool of}} four to ten.|$|E
50|$|In {{regions where}} <b>double-deckers</b> are not common, the term single-decker may lack common usage, as in one sense, all other main types of bus {{have a single}} deck. Also, the term may become synonymous with the name transit bus or related terms, which can {{correctly}} be applied to <b>double-deckers</b> too.|$|R

5|$|Bus {{transport}} {{across the}} country is widespread; major companies include National Express, Arriva and Go-Ahead Group. The red <b>double-decker</b> buses in London have {{become a symbol of}} England. There is a rapid transit network in two English cities: the London Underground; and the Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle, Gateshead and Sunderland. There are several tram networks, such as the Blackpool tramway, Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram and Midland Metro, and the Tramlink system centred on Croydon in South London.|$|E
5|$|In August 2016, the Baku Chess Olympiad Operating Committee branded two <b>double-decker</b> buses of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism {{to operate}} in the city in the run-up and during the Olympiad. They were officially {{launched}} in late August with a ceremony during which members of the Azerbaijani national team were playing chess inside. The buses operated free of charge and took passengers to Baku's main sights. The passengers have the chance to play chess inside the buses and obtain information about the Olympiad. The buses ended operating on 14 September.|$|E
5|$|The Greater London Council was {{abolished}} in 1986, {{which left}} London without a central administration until 2000 when London-wide government was restored, {{with the creation}} of the Greater London Authority. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed. On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times.

5|$|A$330million {{expansion}} programme for Terminal 2 {{was announced}} in 2007 and was completed in 2012. The objectives of this project include new lounges and retail facilities, a new satellite terminal, increased luggage capacity and a redesign of customs and security areas. A new satellite terminal features floor-to-ceiling windows offers views of the North-South runway. The new concourse includes three <b>double-decker</b> aerobridges which are gates 16, 18 and 20, each accommodating an A380 aircraft or two smaller aircraft and one single aerobridge. The baggage handling capacity will be increased, and two new baggage carousels will cater to increased A380 traffic. Work commenced in November 2007 and will be completed in 2011 but was opened in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In the Avon Valley to {{the east}} of Bath the classic {{geographical}} example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found: road, rail, river, canal. The canal passes the remains of a loading dock, once used for Bath Stone from the quarries on Bathampton Down, which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the Dry Arch rock bridge (demolished in 1958 to allow <b>double-decker</b> buses to use the A36). Next, the canal passes the waterwheel-powered Claverton Pumping Station, which pumped water from the River Avon into the canal. The building was completed in 1810 and the pump was working by 1813.|$|E
5|$|London's {{bus network}} {{is one of}} the largest in the world, running 24 hours a day, with about 8,500 buses, more than 700 bus routes and around 19,500 bus stops. In 2013, the network had more than 2 billion {{commuter}} trips per annum, more than the Underground. Around £850million is taken in revenue each year. London has the largest wheelchair accessible network in the world and, from the 3rd quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced. The distinctive red <b>double-decker</b> buses are an internationally recognised trademark of London transport along with black cabs and the Tube.|$|E

50|$|By 1940, KMB had 140 single-deckers {{operating}} on 17 routes. As {{only a handful}} of buses survived World War II, some lorries were temporarily converted into buses. By the late 1940s, KMB ridership increased with the huge influx of immigration from China. In 1949, KMB bought 20 Daimler <b>double-deckers</b> from England, becoming the first operator of <b>double-deckers</b> in Hong Kong.|$|R

5|$|Skopje has a {{bus network}} {{managed by the}} city and {{operated}} by three companies. The oldest and largest is JSP Skopje, a public company founded in 1948. JSP lost its monopoly on public transport in 1990 and two new companies, Sloboda Prevoz and Mak Ekspres, obtained several lines. However, most of the network {{is still in the}} hands of JSP which operates 67 lines on 80. Only 24 lines are urban, the others serving localities around the city. Many of the JSP buses are (by Chinese buse builder Yutong) red <b>double-decker</b> buses designed to look like the British-made buses that were in use in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Stagecoach's {{operations}} in the Burnley area were sold to the Blazefield Group on 15 April 2001 and rebranded as Burnley & Pendle.In June 2001 one X43 journey in each direction was extended through to Skipton and Hawes on summer Sundays. This proved relatively successful, and the single-deck coach initially used {{was replaced by a}} <b>double-decker.</b> It continued to operate into 2003, but was withdrawn at the end of September. Fares on the route increased by 30% in the two years up to August 2004, prompting some passengers to abandon the route in favour of a car sharing scheme. Despite this, the route saw an average of 12% yearly growth between 2001 and 2004.|$|E

50|$|In 1970, CMB started fitting more {{powerful}} engines to its Guy Arab <b>double-deckers,</b> giving them enough power for climbing up slopes and servicing {{areas such as}} the Mid-levels. In the same year, CMB also decided to convert its Guy Arab MkV single-deckers to <b>double-deckers.</b> Some of the short-wheelbase buses were rebodied with low-height double-deck bodies, enabling them to provide service on the Victoria Peak.|$|R

5|$|Historically, {{passenger}} services were {{provided to the}} Sydney Central by steam locomotives. The first services to Hurstville were run by steam locomotives of the Q.158 and R.285 classes. When the City Underground opened to St James in 1926, a new electric service was provided to run there. From {{the time when the}} line to the Royal National Park was electrified, passengers received a steam train service at first, then when this became expensive, it was replaced by a rail motor service. This arrangement continued until the line was electrified to Waterfall, and the Eastern Suburbs Line was opened. In 1979 the Eastern Suburbs Line being the first line to only use S set <b>double-decker</b> rolling stock. The current running operations for {{passenger services}} have remained generally unchanged since 1981 with the integration of the Illawarra line and the Eastern Suburbs Railway. Suburban services utilise Erskineville Junction and proceed to Central and Bondi Junction.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the greater}} {{volume of traffic}} using the humpbacked bridge, which had poor {{visibility}} and narrow approach roads, led to a rise in accidents {{and an increase in}} bypass proposals. Many similar bridge towers were completely demolished starting as early as the 18th century due to the desire of local authorities to clear carriageways of all obstructions to improve traffic flow. The bridge and gate were formally protected as an Ancient Monument in 1923, and proposals for a new road bridge began to be made about the same time. The new A40, built in 1965–6, relieved the town of much through traffic, and a town centre plan, prepared by the District Council in 1981, again proposed a new bridge. Repairs had to be undertaken in 1982 following a collision on 18 May in which a <b>double-decker</b> bus struck the bridge, resulting in its closure for a month. Damage to the bridge and gate through accidents continued, and in the early 1990s, two drivers were prosecuted after crossing the bridge with vehicles significantly exceeding the weight and height limits.|$|E
50|$|The 2000s {{also saw}} the {{withdrawal}} of second generation rear-engined <b>double-deckers.</b> Actually CMB had already withdrawn several in the 1990s. When NWFB took over in 1998, they withdrew {{the rest of these}} buses, with the last leaving the fleet in 2002. KMB also started to withdraw these <b>double-deckers</b> from 2000, including Leyland Olympians, Dennis Dominators/Dragons and MCW Metrobus, The withdrawal process of these buses was underway throughout the 2000s.|$|R
