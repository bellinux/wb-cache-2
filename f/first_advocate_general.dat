Keywords: computational complexity, average time complexity classes, hierarchy, Average-P, logarithmico-exponential ACM Computing Reviews Subject Category: F. 1. 3 1 Introduction One {{of the central}} issues in complexity theory for any complexity-theoretic measure {{is the question of}} fine hierarchies. Here we consider this issue for average case complexity. The average complexity of a problem is, in many cases, a more significant measure than its worst case complexity. This has motivated a rich area in algorithms research, but Levin [Lev 86] was the <b>first</b> to <b>advocate</b> the <b>general</b> study of average case complexity. An average case complexity class consists of pairs, called distributional problems. Each pair consists of a decision problem and a probability distribution on problem instances.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{examines the}} issue of Community competence to adopt restrictive measures, such as the freezing of funds, against individuals or entities, in particular {{in the implementation of}} sanctions decided upon by the UN Security Council. We are thus concerned with so-called ‘smart sanctions’, those directed at groups or at individuals, whether or not members of a third country government or ruling regime, which have become more commonly used in the last decade, in particular by the UN Security Council as part of its counterterrorism policy since 1999. The focus here is on Community, as opposed to Union, competence, although we will as a result touch upon {{the issue of}} the relationship between Community and Union powers. The core of the paper is a critique of the different approaches to this issue taken by the Court of <b>First</b> Instance, the <b>Advocate</b> <b>General,</b> and the European Court of Justice in the Kadi case, and some conclusions on the implications of this judgment, but we will begin by putting that specific competence debate into the context of the evolution of Community competence to adopt sanctions at all...|$|R
