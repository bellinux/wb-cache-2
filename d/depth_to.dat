5|$|Debts {{continued}} to increase, as the commissioners borrowed {{more money to}} fund the improvements. The new weir and lock at Pickerings failed in 1761 and both had to be rebuilt. Work had started on Witton Brook in 1756, but the plans were revised in 1764 to increase the navigable <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> , and this work was completed in 1765.|$|E
5|$|Graphically, F.E.A.R. uses normal mapping and {{parallax}} mapping to give textures a {{more realistic}} appearance; the latter is used to {{give the appearance of}} <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> flat bullet hole sprites on walls. Volumetric lighting and lightmapping are included {{with the addition of a}} per-pixel lighting model, allowing complex lighting effects to be developed. Vertex, pixel and high-level shaders, including a host of additional special effects, are also featured in Jupiter EX.|$|E

5|$|On November 12, 1942, the (Japanese) Imperial Navy had {{the better}} ships {{and the better}} tactics. After November15, 1942, its leaders lost heart and it lacked the {{strategic}} <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> face the burgeoning U.S. Navy and its vastly improving weapons and tactics. The Japanese never got better while, after November 1942, the U.S. Navy never stopped getting better.|$|E
5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together. Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them. This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} underwater protection {{was replaced}} by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo warhead. It lacked enough <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ships' increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.|$|E

5|$|After the break, Colangelo traded Jones for Juan Dixon, a {{versatile}} guard. Luke Jackson was also signed to provide <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> Toronto's bench. Following a win against the Charlotte Bobcats on 1 April 2007, Toronto clinched a playoff berth {{for the first}} time in five years. They then claimed their first division title when they defeated the Philadelphia 76ers five days later, winning the Atlantic Division crown. Another franchise record was set when Toronto won the next game against the Bulls, this time for most home wins.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed {{to maintain the status quo}} and believed that her country's military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on their terms. Egypt, on the other hand, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things that}} made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|E

5|$|Geologically, a {{predominant}} {{feature of}} the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely believed that the <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas, and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas. However, {{research has shown that}} economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|Halo: First Strike {{opens with}} the arrival of the Covenant armada at the human stronghold planet of Reach. The book follows both the {{unsuccessful}} attempt to defend Reach by the SPARTAN-IIs who were on the planet's surface and the adventures of the rag-tag survivors of the battle at Alpha Halo. The book also reveals that humanity's worst fear is going to come true: the Covenant is on its way to Earth. The book was well received by critics and sold well, making The New York Times Best Seller list. Critics found it added <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> the Halo video games and that it was exciting throughout.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E

5|$|Later in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, {{including}} the one that Lester carries for several effects. The idea {{was influenced by the}} Star Wars franchise, but added <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> the gameplay by giving the player more options. He also found that repeated laser fire by the enemies helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game. Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.|$|E
5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only be relevant to a limited range of depths. As the parameters {{move away from the}} base conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team {{decided to}} give all {{characters}} in the game voices as Iizuka believed that full dialogue helps add <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> both the story and gameplay. With Nights already designed as an androgynous character, the team wanted to leave impressions regarding gender up to the player, despite Nights having a female voice in the game. The team designed the Nights franchise to have a distinctly British style, in contrast to Sonic the Hedgehog, {{which was designed to}} be more American. Thus, Bellbridge—the game's main setting—closely resembles London, and all of the game's characters have English accents. The development team consisted of 26 members of Sonic Team in the United States, while all sound work and CGI was developed in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Square Enix {{chose to}} update Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2s {{graphics}} for a remastered release in high-definition. With a production cycle longer than two years, the graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models and textures. Kitase commented {{that he wanted}} to excite new and returning players and added more <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> do so and opened up the possibility of further remasters based on reception. Many views could not simply be reframed to 16:9 because that would reveal characters waiting for their cues off-screen, so the remastering team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to the visuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} component was criticized, with Polygon {{calling it}} one of the least necessary multiplayer additions to a typically single-player experience. The gameplay was described as a mediocre shooter, incapable of supporting the necessary use of guns by its villains and with poor control of movement. GameSpot noted that poor weapon accuracy and movement controls made the thugs seem weak and inept, while playing as the heroes lacked empowerment because of more restrictive combat ability and less resistance to damage. Other reviewers called the experience fun and hectic, but lacking sufficient <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> retain long-term interest.|$|E
5|$|The trend had {{substantial}} {{implications for}} many early skyscrapers. Some were redesigned to fit new tastes. Much of the ornate detail {{was removed from}} the Metropolitan Life Tower in the 1960s, for example, to fit contemporary, plainer fashions. Many older skyscrapers could not be adapted, however, as they lacked the physical <b>depth</b> <b>to</b> build larger modern offices or the space for new service facilities. Some were demolished to make way for new, larger structures. Amongst these was the Singer Tower, demolished in 1968 and replaced by the international style United States Steel Building. In the 21st century, buildings such as 90 West Street have been renovated as upmarket housing, partially because of their extensive windows and access to sunlight.|$|E
