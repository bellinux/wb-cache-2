30|$|NRM, SIRM, IRM− 300, and k {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} on all samples. Additional measurements on pilot samples included the acquisition of IRM in a stepwise increasing forward field up to 2.4 T (IRM acquisition curve) and in a subsequent reverse field (backfield curve). A composite of IRMs were imparted along three orthogonal axes of a sample with strong (2.4 T), moderate (0.4 T), and weak (0.12 T) magnetic fields, respectively (Lowrie, 1990). The composite IRMs were then thermally <b>demagnetized</b> <b>to</b> obtain the unblocking temperature spectrums using an ASC-TD 48 thermal demagnetizer with an internal residual field lower than 10 nT. Thermomagnetic curves (k-T) were measured in air up to 700 °C using a CS- 3 heating unit that was attached to a KLY- 3 S kappabridge.|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that a dynamo once {{existed in the}} moon, and hence {{was the source of}} lunar paleomagnetism, is tested using a model for the global thermoremanent magnetization of spherical lithospheres. Various models of an ancient lunar dipole field are used which incorporate intensity variations and reversals, and which are consistent with lunar sample paleointensities. It is found that non-reversing lunar dynamos which have simple exponential decay histories beginning at 4. 6 b. y. ago are inconsistent with this limit, unless the moon has been thoroughly <b>demagnetized</b> <b>to</b> a depth of tens of kilometers by impacts or other processes. An early lunar dynamo cannot be excluded by global scalar measurements unless the permanent lunar dipole moment is shown to be significantly less than 10 to the 13 th power G/cu cm by future spacecraft measurements, which may be technologically impossible; vector measurements of lunar magnetic anomalies over the whole moon offer a possibility of determining the source of the field which magnetized the lunar crust...|$|R

30|$|Ferromagnetic {{materials}} {{can be categorized}} into soft and hard magnets (Mody et al. 2013). Soft magnets have a low coercivity (Hc), {{so they can be}} demagnetized at low magnetic field.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{theoretical}} study of fronts propagating into an uniaxial ferromagnetic medium with velocity v, when the magnetization, M, is driven by a DC applied magnetic field, H 0, from the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>to</b> the magnetized state. It is assumed that the dynamics of M is govern by the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation (LLGE). We also consider an effective field that includes in-plane uniaxial, HU, and shape anisotropy fields, HD. We show that, in the particular case of uniformly translating profiles, this equation reduces to a damped-forced Duffing's equation, with a family of solutions that describe periodic oscillating (PO), damped oscillating (DO) or exponential front profiles (EF). Of particular interest is {{the existence of a}} critical speed, v 0, below which there are no stable states for the magnetization. When the velocity of the profile exactly equals vosc, the only stable states are the PO profiles. Above vosc, there is an asymptotic speed, v*, that separates the DO profiles from EF profiles. This velocity (v*) is connected with the existence of a non-linear marginal stability point for front propagation. Both v 0 and v* depend on the applied field and on the anisotropy constants of the material. A stability diagram for front propagation and magnetization curves are also calculated.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{presence}} of a non-magnetic phase at multi-junctions of Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains on the demagnetization process of Nd-Fe-B magnets was investigated by micromagnetic simulations, while varying the size of the non-magnetic phase and the Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains. While the demagnetizing field created by the non-magnetic phase assisted the nucleation of a reverse domain, its effect was only significant when its size exceeded a critical value. This critical size effect can be explained by a change in the spatial distribution of the demagnetizing field. In addition, the calculations indicated that microstructural refinement would also increase the coercivity. This increase in coercivity could also be attributed to a change in the spatial distribution of the <b>demagnetizing</b> field due <b>to</b> the presence of a non-magnetic phase. Changes in the spatial distribution of the <b>demagnetizing</b> field due <b>to</b> such a non-magnetic phase could represent a mechanism by which microstructural refinement leads to increased coercivity...|$|R
5000|$|A ferrite {{is a type}} {{of ceramic}} {{compound}} composed of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) combined chemically with one or more additional metallic elements. [...] They are both electrically nonconductive and ferrimagnetic, meaning they can be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrites can be divided into two families based on their magnetic coercivity, their resistance <b>to</b> being <b>demagnetized.</b> Hard ferrites have high coercivity, hence they are difficult <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize.</b> They are used to make magnets, for devices such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers and small electric motors. Soft ferrites have low coercivity. They are used in the electronics industry to make ferrite cores for inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components. Ferrite compounds have extremely low cost, being made of iron oxide (i.e. rusted iron), and also have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize,</b> and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a sensitive bolometric receiver for low background space applications. In a 10 percent bandwidth at 1 THz, this receiver is approximately 100 times more sensitive than a quantum limited heterodyne receiver with a 1 GHz IF bandwidth. This receiver {{is designed to be}} used for the long wavelength band (200 - 700 microns) in the MIPS instrument on NASA's SIRTF satellite. The bolometers are cooled to 100 mK by an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator. Roughly 60 g of cesium chrome alum salt is partially <b>demagnetized</b> <b>to</b> 100 mK, followed by a slow regulated downramp to compensate for the heat leak. The hold time of the ADR system is about 18 hours with a temperature stability of delta T(sub rms) approx. equals 10 micro-K. The composite bolometers have electrical responsivities of 10 (exp 9) V/W and electrical NEP's of about 3 x 10 (exp - 17) W/square root of Hz. The bolometer signals are read out by JFET preamplifiers located on the helium plate and operated at 120 K. We have addressed a number of space qualification issues, such as the development of an analog magnet controller, construction of a cryogenic shake-table for bolometers and selection of the paramagnetic salt CCA which can survive a bakeout at 50 C. The receiver is scheduled to be flown in the spring of 1992 on a balloon telescope. This flight has a dual purpose. One is to provide realistic test of the capabilities of the new receiver.

40|$|A strong {{grouping}} of the directions of natural remanent magnetization {{in a collection}} of Ordovician limestones and dolomites, prior to correction for the in situ orientation of the samples, led us to suspect the presence of a substantial spurious magnetization acquired during sample collection and preparation. A close correspondence between the directions of the remanence vectors and the direction of the ambient magnetic field during sawing and drilling of the samples suggested that the remanence was dominated by a component acquired during cutting of the samples. Ten specimens of the Camp Nelson Limestone and Shakopee Dolomite were <b>demagnetized</b> <b>to</b> 100 mT, given an anhysteretic remanence along their axes, and then sawed again. A substantial magnetization parallel to the ambient field during cutting was acquired by all of the specimens, and the resultant directions deviated by 7 - 70 d {{from the direction of the}} anhysteretic magnetization. Stepwise alternating-field and thermal cleaning to 60 mT and 400 dC respectively failed to remove preferentially the cutting-induced magnetic contamination. Since the fraction of magnetite grains cut during drilling and sawing must be a linear function of grain size, modified Lowrie-Fuller tests were carried out and the results are interpreted to indicate the presence of a multidomain magnetite fraction in the Shakopee Dolomite, Camp Nelson Limestone and Oregon Dolomite. Ratios of initial to anhysteretic susceptibility (X / X ARM) correlate well with the angular deviation of magnetic directions produced by sawing. This indicates that acquisition of drilling-induced remanence is a function of magnetite grain size, compatible with the notion that the drilling-induced component resides in large magnetite grains which have been cut...|$|R

40|$|Gyro {{is one of}} {{the major}} parts of the space vehicle. Gyro is used to measure the {{rotational}} rate of the space vehicle. One of the Laser technologies is used in the gyro. The laser beam must be incident on the photo diode without any abstraction. If any magnetic field is present, the laser beam is bending. But it must be avoided. But sometimes due to external influences gyro will effect by the magnetic field. So, we need <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize</b> the gyro. <b>To</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> the gyro, one method is used namely known as degaussing. Degaussing is the process of decreasing or eliminating an unwanted magnetic field. But it is generally not possible to reduce a magnetic field completely to zero, so degaussing typically induces a very small "known " field referred to as bias. The original method of degaussing was to install electromagnetic coils into system, known simply as coiling. The paper is how to degauss the gyro using microcontroller AT 90 S 2313. To degaussing the gyro, applied voltage time must be controlled. This is achieved by pulse width modulation by changing the duty cycle. In PWM, the period remains Constant, but the duty cycle changes. For PWM wave generation, the count for the total period is calculated and the ON time is subtracted from it to get the off time, this is given by T=Ton +Toff. Once pwm wave is generated it must be amplified by the power amplifier because the magnetic coil has a low resistance. Due to this it draws more power; if we connect the coils directly to the microcontroller it cannot supply such amount of power. For this purpose L 6203 full bridge power amplifier is used. Power on reset is a process of reset the micro controller before functioning. Generally every micro controller has a prescribed voltage level. If voltage fallen below the prescribed level it must be shut down. For this purpose ADM 706 supervisory circuit is used...|$|R

40|$|The temperature-dependent {{fundamental}} ac susceptibility of a granular superconductor in {{the absence}} of dc fields has been analyzed by developing a phenomenological model for effective magnetic fields, taking into account the influence of the magnetic interaction between the intergranular and the intragranular magnetizations due <b>to</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> effects. For this purpose a policrystal Fe-based superconductor FeSe 0. 5 Te 0. 5 sample has been studied. By the frequency dependence of the peaks of the temperature-dependent imaginary part of the fundamental complex susceptibility, the dependence on temperature of the characteristic times both for intergranular and intragranular relaxations of magnetic flux are derived, and the corresponding relaxation processes due to combinations of the flux creep, the flux flow and the thermally activated flux flow regimes are identified {{on the basis of the}} effective magnetic fields both at the sample surface and at the grains' surfaces. Such characteristic times, through the Havriliak–Negami function, determine the temperature and the frequency dependences of the complex susceptibility.
