40|$|With the {{exception}} of Burkina Faso and Mali, the growth experience for WAEMU countries has been disappointing, even {{when compared to other}} sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The main objective of the paper is to investigate why the quest for a growth takeoff has been more elusive in the WAEMU countries compared to other SSA countries. To do this, the paper focuses on the determinants of growth accelerations and <b>decelerations</b> <b>in</b> SSA and the WAEMU. It finds that the variables most closely associated with growth accelerations and <b>decelerations</b> <b>in</b> SSA are changes in terms of trade, private investment, civil tension, real exchange rates, and inflation. Second, as found elsewhere in the literature, there is a certain asymmetry between accelerations and <b>decelerations,</b> <b>in</b> both frequency and determinants, and that the WAEMU region {{is quite different from the}} rest of SSA.

The construction industry benefitted from capacity expansion programs in the production sector. The improvement in the labour market continued, inflation accelerated at a lower rate than in other countries. In April, the rate of inflation was 2. 4 percent, markedly below the rates in the U. S.

The world economy also kept its momentum in the spring: Economic activity was very brisk in continental Europe and Japan, but now there are signs of a gentle slowdown in the U.

In terms of gross production productivity growth in both sectors is virtually the same (0. 6 % and 0. 7 % respectively) because of the relative lower weight of intermediate inputs in producing services. During the latest cyclical expansion, 1995 - 1999, we have observed a marked <b>deceleration</b> <b>in</b> labor productivity, associated {{to an increase in}} employment, and to a <b>deceleration</b> <b>in</b> the capital-labor ratio, while total factor productivity has remained more stable. productivity, growth rate, labour...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{features}} of the auditory system is its ability to efficiently process events that occur in rapid succession. The aim of the present study is to propose a new way of investigating sensitivity to auditory tempo changes. More specifically, it proposes to compare the relative sensitivity (bias) to acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>in</b> both musical and monotonal conditions. Bias was measured with (1) a conventional psy-chophysical method known as the method of constant stimuli (MCS) and (2) a so-called method of dynamic stimuli (MDS). The latter method consists in responding with a finger press as soon as a near-continual tempo change is detected. With the MCS, there was no preference, as estimated by the point of subjective equality, between acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>in</b> the monotonal condition, but there was a preference in the musical condition that indicated more facility for estimating deceler-ations than accelerations. The results obtained with the MDS are con-sistent with the MCS results, given that the response time was faster for <b>decelerations</b> than accelerations <b>in</b> the musical condition but not in the monotonal condition. We conclude that the MDS is a sensitive tool for investigating slight tempo variations...|$|R
