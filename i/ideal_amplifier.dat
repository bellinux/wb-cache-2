40|$|We {{analyze and}} compare the {{characterization}} of a quantum device in terms of noise, transmitted bit-error-rate (BER) and mutual information, showing how the noise description is meaningful only for Gaussian channels. After reviewing the description of a quantum communication channel, we study the insertion of an amplifier. We {{focus attention on the}} case of direct detection, where the linear amplifier has a 3 decibels noise figure, which is usually considered an unsurpassable limit, referred to as the standard quantum limit (SQL). Both noise and BER could be reduced using an <b>ideal</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which is feasible in principle. However, just a reduction of noise beyond the SQL does not generally correspond to an improvement of the BER or of the mutual information. This is the case of a laser amplifier, where saturation can greatly reduce the noise figure, although there is no corresponding improvement of the BER. Such mechanism is illustrated on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} controlled high-gain amplifier {{has been designed}} for sensitive detection of optical signals. Based {{on the use of}} digital-to-analog converters DACs, the gain and offset of a transimpedance amplifier are adjusted through a computer trying to match <b>ideal</b> <b>amplifier</b> parameters for optical detection with different experimental conditions. The amplifying modules have been developed for optical-rheometry techniques that provide information about the microstructural properties of fluids by measuring optical anisotropies induced by transient flows. Characterization of these programmable gain amplifiers shows that they provide gains and bandwidths more than adequate for experiments involving signals that evolve rapidly and with a large dynamic range. Hence, the use of DACs allows for the possibility of computer controlling both gain and offset in real time, with a significant reduction of the spurious contributions from the amplifying stages during data acquisition. In spite of being designed for optical rheometry, the amplifiers could be useful for any other laboratory arrangements requiring an amplifying stage with real-time gain and offset adjustment capabilities.
