25|$|While it is {{possible}} to do some types of research using an <b>irradiator</b> much like that used for gamma sterilization, it is common in some areas of science to use a time resolved experiment where a material is subjected to a pulse of radiation (normally electrons from a LINAC). After the pulse of radiation, the concentration of different substances within the material are measured by emission spectroscopy or Absorption spectroscopy, hence the rates of reactions can be determined. This allows the relative abilities of substances to react with the reactive species generated by the action of radiation on the solvent (commonly water) to be measured. This experiment is known as pulse radiolysis which is closely related to Flash photolysis.|$|E

25|$|The cost of food {{irradiation}} {{is influenced by}} dose requirements, the food's tolerance of radiation, handling conditions, i.e., packaging and stacking requirements, construction costs, financing arrangements, and other variables particular to the situation. Irradiation is a capital-intensive technology requiring a substantial initial investment, ranging from $1million to $5million. In the case of large research or contract irradiation facilities, major capital costs include a radiation source, hardware (<b>irradiator,</b> totes and conveyors, control systems, and other auxiliary equipment), land (1 to 1.5acres), radiation shield, and warehouse. Operating costs include salaries (for fixed and variable labor), utilities, maintenance, taxes/insurance, cobalt-60 replenishment, general utilities, and miscellaneous operating costs. Perishable food items, like fruits, vegetables and meats would still require to be handled in the cold chain, so all other supply chain costs remain the same.|$|E

2500|$|To process materials, {{either a}} gamma source or an {{electron}} beam can be used. The international type IV (wet storage) <b>irradiator</b> {{is a common}} design, of which the JS6300 and JS6500 gamma sterilizers (made by 'Nordion International', which used to trade as 'Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd') are typical examples. In these irradiation plants, the source is stored in a deep well filled with water when not in use. When the source is required, it is moved by a steel wire to the irradiation room where the products which are to be treated are present; these objects are placed inside boxes which are moved through the room by an automatic mechanism. By moving the boxes from one point to another, the contents are given a uniform dose. After treatment, the product is moved by the automatic mechanism out of the room. The irradiation room has very thick concrete walls (about 3 m thick) to prevent gamma rays from escaping. The source consists of [...] 60Co rods sealed within two layers of stainless steel, the rods are combined with inert dummy rods to form a rack with a total activity of about 12.6PBq (340kCi).|$|E

40|$|In {{industrial}} irradiation facilities, {{the determination}} of maximum photon or electron energy is important for regulated processes, such as food irradiation, and for assurance of treatment reproducibility. With electron beam <b>irradiators,</b> this {{has been done by}} measuring the depth-dose distribution in a homogeneous material. For X-ray <b>irradiators,</b> an analogous method has not yet been recommended. This paper describes a procedure suitable for typical industrial irradiation processes, which is based on common practice in the field of therapeutic X-ray treatment. It utilizes a measurement of the slope of the exponential attenuation curve of X-rays in a thick stack of polyethylene plates. Monte Carlo simulations and experimental tests have been performed to verify the suitability and accuracy of the method between 3 MeV and 8 MeV. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Transfusion {{of blood}} and blood {{components}} in patients with immunosuppression and malignant diseases is life-saving; however, it can result in some serious fatal side effects such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). T-lymphocytes of the donor proliferate and damage the recipient’s target organs, especially the bone marrow, skin, liver and the gastrointestinal system. In an effort to eliminate this problem, blood and cellular blood components are exposed to ionizing gamma radiation prior to transfusion. Irradiation of the blood and its components with gamma radiation and X-rays in established practices {{for the prevention of}} transfusion-associated (TA) -GVHD is the only acceptable method. This process renders T-lymphocytes incapable of proliferating due to the level of irradiation-induced damage in the DNA. Most blood centers rely on a nominal dose of 25 - 30 Gy with no less than 15 Gy delivered to any area of the bag to inactivate lymphocytes in cellular products for transfusion. Accordingly to our survey, there are 24 Cesium- 137 blood <b>irradiators</b> throughout Turkey in University Medical Faculties, Health Ministry Hospitals and Our Leukemia Children’s Foundation for irradiation of chemical material and only 1 unit for medical sterilization. There are two types of blood <b>irradiators</b> in Turkey: a) CIS BIO International France, IBL 437 C type units and b) MSD Nordion Canada Gammacell- 3000 units. These two types are monitored by an electronic controller and they cannot be activated without the canister being in the irradiation chamber and fully self-protected irradiation units. Radiation levels {{on the surface of the}} IBL 437 C are below 25 μSv/h (2. 5 mR/h), in compliance with relevant international regulations. All blood <b>irradiators</b> are radiation-emitting devices. For these reasons, all physical and dosimetric measurements, dose calculations, quality assurance, and control procedures must be performed by Qualified Medical Radiation physicists in Turkey. There are 24 <b>irradiators</b> licensed by TAEK (Turkey Atomic Energy Authority) and 24 specialists, medical radiation oncology physicists and radiation physicists; quality control should be done regularly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract There is {{currently}} {{renewed interest in}} assessing the feasibility of the sterile insect technique (SIT) to control African malaria vectors in designated areas. The SIT relies on the sterilization of males before mass release, with sterilization currently being achieved {{through the use of}} ionizing radiation. This paper reviews previous work on radiation sterilization of Anopheles mosquitoes. In general, the pupal stage was irradiated due to ease of handling compared to the adult stage. The dose-response curve between the induced sterility and log (dose) was shown to be sigmoid, and there was a marked species difference in radiation sensitivity. Mating competitiveness studies have generally been performed under laboratory conditions. The competitiveness of males irradiated at high doses was relatively poor, but with increasing ratios of sterile males, egg hatch could be lowered effectively. Males irradiated as pupae had a lower competitiveness compared to males irradiated as adults, but the use of partially-sterilizing doses has not been studied extensively. Methods to reduce somatic damage during the irradiation process as well as the use of other agents or techniques to induce sterility are discussed. It is concluded that the optimal radiation dose chosen for insects that are to be released during an SIT programme should ensure a balance between induced sterility of males and their field competitiveness, with competitiveness being determined under (semi-) field conditions.
