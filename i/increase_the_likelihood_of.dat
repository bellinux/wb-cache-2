5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are first}} {{visible from the}} 13th to the 16th week of fetal development, as bulgings off hair follicles. Sebaceous glands develop from the same tissue that {{gives rise to the}} {{epidermis}} of the skin.

5|$|DNA damage, due to {{environmental}} factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs {{at a rate}} of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
5|$|Frog {{mutations}} {{and genetic}} defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes {{have been identified}} or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn {{on the surface of}} ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae. Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An {{increase in the number of}} frogs eaten by birds may actually <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} success of implants is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> failures.|$|E
5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{most states}} in the USA require newborns to be {{screened}} for phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism, among other congenital disorders.

25|$|Survival {{for most}} animal species depends upon maximizing contact with {{beneficial}} stimuli and minimizing contact with harmful stimuli.

40|$|Using {{data from}} {{the first wave of}} the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (NKPS) for 2867 women and 2195 men aged 40 to 79, this study {{examines}} to what extent educational, employment and marital pathways shape <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> remaining childless, and whether these pathways are gendered. The findings indicate that women and men have distinctive pathways into childlessness. Educational attainment <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> remaining childless among women only. A stable career <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> remaining childless among women, but it <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> entering fatherhood. Years without a partner is positively associated with childlessness among both women and men. Not having had a partnership and having had multiple partnerships are strong determinants of childlessness, especially among men. ...|$|R
40|$|The Texas Statewide Youth Leadership Forum (TXYLF) {{provides}} self-advocacy {{training to}} high school youths with disabilities. TXYLF is an enhanced version of the Youth Leadership Forum (YLF) that is comprised of an initial five day training, a nine month support phase, regional YLFs, and the opportunity for participants {{to return to the}} five day training to serve as a mentor to their peers. This study?s purpose was to examine the TXYLF participants? post-training outcomes and the relationships among advocacy involvement and adult outcomes. To achieve this purpose, former TXYLF participants were surveyed between one and six years after their participation in TXYLF. The correlational study analyzed descriptively the participants? outcomes and inferentially, through logistic regression, the relationships among participants? adult outcomes, self-advocacy involvement, and the various TXYLF participation components. The results demonstrated that TXYLF participants? post-training postsecondary education attendance was higher than the national average for adults with disabilities. Participants with low incidence disabilities were involved in inclusive employment more often than the national average. A minority status <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> involvement in secondary education advocacy, having a high incident disability <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> post-training employment, and being under 21 years old <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> living independently post-training, involvement in postsecondary education advocacy, and involvement in employment advocacy. Involvement in TXYLF for one full year, including involvement as a mentor, <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> post-training employment; involvement in TXYLF?s nine month support phase and involvement as a mentor <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> post-training postsecondary education attendance, postsecondary education advocacy, and employment advocacy. Attending a regional YLF further <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> postsecondary education and postsecondary education advocacy. Furthermore, involvement in TXYLF as a mentor <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> post-training employment, postsecondary education, and independent living. No significant relationships were observed for self-advocacy and adult-outcomes. Future research is needed that takes {{the findings of this study}} and establishes a causal relationship through a randomized group experimental design...|$|R
