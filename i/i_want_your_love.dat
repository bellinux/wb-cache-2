6000|$|His {{answer was}} definite: [...] "You need not fear. The city {{will never again}} {{dominate}} me. I have found myself--through you. With you to inspire me I cannot fail. Public life! Do you mean politics? I am now fit for only one thing--to write. I have found my work. And do you think I could live anywhere without hope of seeing you? My whole life is directed towards you--to be worthy of you, to be justified in asking you to join your life to mine. These are my ambitions, my audacious desires. I love you, and you must know that I cannot be content with your friendship--your affection--which I know I have. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> <b>love</b> in return. Not now--not while I am a man of words merely. As I now feel Alessandra is a little thing compared with the sacrifice you have made for me. I have stripped away all my foolish egotism, and when I return to {{see you on the}} opening night I shall rejoice in your success without a tinge of bitterness. It isn't as if the melodrama were degrading in its appeal. It does not represent my literary ideals, of course, but it is not contemptible, it is merely conventional. My mind has cleared since I came here. I see myself in proper relation to you and to the public. I see now that with the large theatre, with the long 'run' ideals, a play must be very general in its appeal, and with such conditions it is folly for us to quarrel. We must have our own little theatre wherein we can play the subtler phases of American life--the phases we both rejoice in. If Alessandra should pay my debt to you--- you see how my mind comes back to that thought--we will use it to build our own temple of art. As I think of you there, toiling without me, I am wild with desire to return to be doing something. I am ready now to turn my hand to any humble thing--to direct rehearsals, to design costumes, anything, only to be near you. One word from you and I will come." ...|$|E
