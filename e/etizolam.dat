5000|$|When {{multiple}} {{doses of}} <b>etizolam,</b> or lorazepam, {{were administered to}} rat neurons, lorazepam caused downregulation of alpha-1 benzodiazepine binding sites (tolerance/dependence), while <b>etizolam</b> caused an increase in alpha-2 benzodiazepine binding sites (reverse tolerance to anti-anxiety effects). [...] Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of lorazepam was observed, but no significant tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of <b>etizolam</b> was observed. <b>Etizolam</b> therefore has a reduced liability to induce tolerance, and dependence, compared with classic benzodiazepines.|$|E

50|$|Prolactin {{secretion}} in the pituitary {{is normally}} suppressed by the brain chemical dopamine. Drugs that block {{the effects of}} dopamine at the pituitary or deplete dopamine stores in the brain may cause the pituitary to secrete prolactin. These drugs include the major tranquillizers (phenothiazines), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), and haloperidol (Haldol); antipsychotic medications, such as risperidone and quetiapine; metoclopramide (Reglan), domperidone, cisapride used to treat gastro-oesophageal reflux; medication-induced nausea (such as cancer drugs); and, less often, alpha-methyldopa and reserpine, used to control hypertension; and estrogens and TRH. The sleep drug ramelteon (Rozerem) also {{increases the risk of}} hyperprolactinaemia. A benzodiazepine analog, <b>etizolam,</b> can also increase the risk of hyperprolactinaemia. In particular, the dopamine antagonists metoclopramide and domperidone are both powerful prolactin stimulators and have been used to stimulate breast milk secretion for decades. However, since prolactin is antagonized by dopamine and the body depends on the two being in balance, the risk of prolactin stimulation is generally present with all drugs that deplete dopamine, either directly or as a rebound effect.|$|E

The treatment of benzodiazepine dependence is difficult. We report a case of successful dosage reduction in a 24 -year-old female patient with <b>etizolam</b> dependence. She was diagnosed with <b>etizolam</b> dependence at the age of 22 years old. We proposed a benzodiazepine dependence treatment that involved replacing <b>etizolam</b> with a long-acting benzodiazepine class drug in conjunction with a long-term weaning plan. However, the patient refused the treatment and insisted that reducing the number of tablets would increase her anxiety. After providing a detailed explanation and receiving consent from the patient, a treatment regimen consisting of fine granules of <b>etizolam</b> mixed with lactose granules was begun with the aim of reducing the percentage of <b>etizolam</b> at a rate of 0. 3 mg/week.

Exposure of rat hippocampal neurons in culture to 10 mu M <b>etizolam</b> for 5 days reduced the amounts of alpha 5 and gamma 2 S receptor subunit mRNAs, whereas <b>etizolam</b> withdrawal was associated with a persistent reduction in gamma 2 S mRNA and an increase in alpha 2 and alpha 3 mRNAs. Neither chronic exposure to nor withdrawal of <b>etizolam</b> affected the acute modulatory effects of <b>etizolam</b> or lorazepam on GABA-evoked Cl- current. Treatment with 10 mu M lorazepam for 5 days reduced the amounts of a I and gamma 2 S subunit mRNAs and increased that of alpha 3 mRNA, whereas lorazepam withdrawal was associated with persistence of the changes in alpha 3 and gamma 2 S mRNAs and an increase in alpha 2 and alpha 4 mRNAs. Parallel changes in the abundance of alpha 1 and alpha 4 subunit proteins induced by chronic exposure to and withdrawal of lorazepam, but not <b>etizolam,</b> were detected by immunocytofluorescence analysis. Chronic lorazepam treatment resulted in a reversible reduction in the modulatory efficacy of this drug and conferred on flumazenil the ability to potentiate GABA-evoked Cl- current. The anticonvulsant action of <b>etizolam</b> was not altered in mice chronically treated with this drug, whereas lorazepam-treated animals became tolerant to the acute anticonvulsant effect of this benzodiazepine.

40|$|Background: <b>Etizolam</b> is an {{anxiolytic}} drug with a pharmacologic profile {{similar to}} that of the classic benzodiazepines. Neurochemical research suggests that <b>etizolam</b> may have selectivity for the subpopulation of Y-aminobutyric acid type A receptors associated with anxiety (ie, α 1, β 2, γ 2). This property, plus its characterization as a ligand with fewer of the adverse events typical of full agonists (impaired cognitive function, tolerance, and dependence), led to its selection for this study. Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to test for the noninferiority of <b>etizolam</b> 0. 5 mg BID versus placebo in affecting cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate anxiety disorder of recent onset (< 1 month). Anxiety measures and tolerability were also assessed. Methods: Patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years were eligible for enrollment. This doubleblind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 5 centers in Italy using a 2 -treatment, 3 -period crossover design. Patients were randomized to 3 -week sequences of either etizolam-placebo-placebo or placebo-etizolam-etizolam. They were evaluated at 4 scheduled visits (screening and days 7, 14, and 21). Cognitive function was assessed using scores from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Digit Span test (total forward and backward scores and the time required to perform the test). Anxiety was measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for screening and to monitor adequacy of therapy. Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and adverse events were also recorded. Results: A total of 77 white patients were enrolled (mean age, 33. 3 years [range, 22 - 60 years]; 62. 3 % female; mean weight, 65. 2 kg). With a power of 0. 80, the difference between the effects of <b>etizolam</b> and placebo on WAIS Digit Span performance was not significant for total score (0. 102 [90 % CI, - 0. 130 to 0. 335]) or time required for completion (0. 029 second [90 % CI, - 0. 574 to 0. 632]). Anxiety, as measured using the HAM-A and STAI instruments, did not differ significantly between groups. No significant differences were found between <b>etizolam</b> 0. 5 mg BID and placebo for cardiovascular events, weight changes, or adverse events. Mild or moderate somnolence was reported by 7 of 77 patients (9. 1 % [3 patients while receiving <b>etizolam</b> and 4 patients while receiving <b>etizolam</b> and placebo]). Conclusions: No significant differences between <b>etizolam</b> 0. 5 mg BID and placebo were found for cognitive function or anxiety measures in these patients with anxiety. <b>Etizolam</b> was well tolerated. © 2009 Excerpta Medica Inc.
