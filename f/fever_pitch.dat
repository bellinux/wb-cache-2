It was the venue for the 1966 World Heavyweight boxing title bout between Henry Cooper and Muhammad Ali, which Ali won. It has {{featured on the}} silver screen as well, having been the backdrop {{for at least two}} movies: The Arsenal Stadium Mystery, and <b>Fever</b> <b>Pitch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{match is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most dramatic conclusions to a league season in the history of the English game. It is also regarded as the starting point of a renaissance in English football; the ban on English clubs playing in European football was lifted a year later and a new top-flight division – the Premier League, was formed in 1992 which generated more revenue for clubs. The title decider also formed the centrepiece of Nick Hornby's book <b>Fever</b> <b>Pitch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to <b>fever</b> <b>pitch.</b> When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|E

40|$|The Latin American media {{environment}} currently faces serious challenges {{which range from}} historical factors to regional political problems and gradual shifts in cultural attitudes. As Fox and Waisbord (2002, ix) have claimed, both local politics and media globalization have significantly shaped {{the development of the}} Latin American media in the 1990 ’s. Argentina for instance has seen a situation of limited competition and TV networks controlled by the state slowly give way to an internationalized market environment. In Brazil, as my last work (Matos, 2008) has shown, market expansionism from the 1990 ’s onwards occurred in parallel with the growth of political liberalization and with a widening of public debate in the mediated public sphere. In such a scenario, calls for the strengthening of the public media grounded on public interest purposes have became <b>fever</b> <b>pitched.</b> A key question investigated here is how media democratization can assist in the deepening of the political democratization project in Brazil. In an increasing globalized world, it can be affirmed that the public media can stand as a space for the fortification of national culture, but not in opposition to globalization, being further a vehicle which can be capable of reinforcing both local and national identities and cultures in negotiation with the global sphere. This paper, taken from one of the chapters of the forthcoming book, Media and Politics in Latin America: globalization, democracy and identity (IB Tauris, 2012), attempts to give an overview of the development of media systems in Latin America in a comparative perspective, emphasizing the specific situation of Brazil and the relationship that has been established between public communications and the public interest. It focuses particularly on examining the ways in which private interests have shaped the evolution of commercial broadcasting in opposition to the lack of a tradition of media regulation. It thus examines current debates put forward by governments which strive to reverse the historical deficiency of public communication structures and their misuse in favor of personal and/or political interests...|$|R
5|$|In 2005, Strickland {{garnered}} positive critical {{comment for}} the romantic comedy <b>Fever</b> <b>Pitch,</b> and in 2007, {{she was a}} cast regular in the television show The Wedding Bells and subsequently {{was added to the}} cast of Private Practice. Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community, in which she says her Southern U.S. background has helped to distinguish herself from other blonde-haired actors. She has spoken of an affinity for her strong female characters and a desire to avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman. She also has worked closely with the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) after participating in a storyline in which her Private Practice character Charlotte King was raped.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the most}} {{successful}} teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the backdrop to {{one of the}} earliest football-related novels, The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (1939), which was made into a film in the same year. The story centres on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves in the film and manager George Allison was given a speaking part. More recently, the book <b>Fever</b> <b>Pitch</b> by Nick Hornby was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was twice adapted for the cinema– the 1997 British film focuses on Arsenal's 1988–89 title win, and a 2005 American version features a fan of baseball's Boston Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} August, Simon & Schuster published Faithful, a {{book which}} collected e-mails about the Red Sox between American writers and Red Sox fans Stephen King and Stewart O'Nan during the 2004 season. In March 2005, Houghton Mifflin Company published Reversing the Curse, {{a book by}} Shaughnessy, author of the bestselling The Curse of the Bambino, chronicling the 2004 Red Sox season. ESPN's Bill Simmons published Now I Can Die In Peace, a collection of his columns with updated annotations and notes, including columns {{for each of the}} last four games of the ALCS and each World Series game – with Game 4 being a running diary. The Farrelly Brothers altered the ending of their 2005 film <b>Fever</b> <b>Pitch</b> – which includes appearances by Damon, Nixon and Varitek – to coincide with the actual end of the series. They and their crew, plus stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon, flew to St. Louis and Barrymore and Fallon attended Game 4 in character, complete with the two of them running onto the field at Busch Stadium and kissing once the final out was made.|$|E
5000|$|Film Threat found {{potential}} in the film, writing, [...] "There is a great film {{in the first half}} of Jordan Harris and Andrew Schrader's Fever Night", making special note that [...] "the film's set up is brilliant", but they felt the potential was not fully met. [...] In a positive review, Quiet Earth wrote, [...] "There's enough material, visually and semantically, in there to get you brain fried and scrambled, and leave you with a stupid contented face for hours." [...] Fatally-Yours stated that they were so impressed with the film that they were initially at a loss for words and found it difficult to express the emotions engendered after having watched it. Fangoria wrote that the film's subtitle, Band of Satanic Outsiders was a favorite that [...] "howls that this film is full of fun Mephistopilean escapades!". [...] The Movies Made Me reviewer stated that he was [...] "never big on the overly psychedelic style of film", but that the trailer [...] "looked like it had a lot of fun to offer" [...] and after having watched the film he found no reason to regret having done so, as the psychedelic aspects were selectively used. Though he stated the acting was better than expected, he faulted the film's pacing in the last 30 minutes. [...] 10,000 Bullets wrote that, from a production standpoint, [...] "just about every aspect of <b>Fever</b> Night is <b>pitch</b> perfect. The direction is stylish, the film's ambient sounds capes are superbly realized and the acting fare exceeded my expectations," [...] but by the film's finale, it began [...] "to lose its way". [...] At BadMovieRealm.com, Derek Miller wrote that the film has style and atmosphere, but the film seemed a bit disjointed and that the psychedelic effects sometimes distracted rather than added to atmosphere. In summary, he wrote [...] "To my surprise, Fever Night is actually a pretty entertaining film. As I said earlier, it definitely isn't a film which I would've normally sought out, but I am glad it was brought to my attention; the touching tribute to Deliverance notwithstanding." ...|$|R

25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, {{opposition}} to Trujillo's regime was building to a <b>fever</b> <b>pitch.</b> A {{younger generation of}} Dominicans had no memory of the instability and poverty that had preceded him. Many clamored for democratization. The Trujillo regime responded with greater repression. The Military Intelligence Service (SIM) secret police, led by Johnny Abbes, remained as ubiquitous as before. Other nations ostracized the Dominican Republic, compounding the dictator's paranoia.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} use Malthus's ideas to change the Poor Laws came in 1807, and the {{controversy}} was stirred to a <b>fever</b> <b>pitch.</b> Hazlitt, {{one of a number}} of liberal critics of Malthus, contributed a series of letters to Cobbett's Political Register, which were later, with additional material, published as a pamphlet. As one of the first critics of Malthusian theory, Hazlitt was afterward noted to have influenced later Malthusian critics, though he was typically uncredited. Hazlitt, often openly bitter, pursued his own critical attacks in several publications over many years.|$|E
25|$|By 1950, the {{two teams}} met one another 11 times in the post-season. The rivalry {{heightened}} to a <b>fever</b> <b>pitch</b> due to an incident in the 1950 playoffs when the Red Wings' young star, Gordie Howe, mistimed a check on Maple Leafs' Ted Kennedy and fell head-first into the boards, suffering severe injuries and needing emergency surgery to save his life. While Kennedy was exonerated by the NHL, Red Wings' management and fans accused him of deliberately injuring Howe. The result was a violent playoff series won by the Red Wings and increased animosity between the teams.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 mid-term elections, the Republicans {{gained control}} of the Senate, and the Democrats retook the House after {{absorbing}} the remaining Whigs. The state still only had one US Senator, and the governor was hoping to have the assembly elect one, and nominate Jesse D. Bright {{to return to the}} Senate. The opposition was more hostile to Bright, primarily because of his actions regarding slavery. The Republicans were still angry over Willard's blocking their Senate pick, so the Senate decided to reciprocate his actions, refusing to enter the joint session necessary to elect a senator. Willard instructed the Democrats to meet without the Republicans and elect a Senator anyway. The dubious legality of the issue was considered outrageous by the Republicans and raised the tension to a <b>fever</b> <b>pitch.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rivalry {{heightened}} to a <b>fever</b> <b>pitch</b> due to {{an incident}} in the 1950 playoffs when Detroit's young star, Gordie Howe, mistimed a check on Toronto's Ted Kennedy and fell head-first into the boards, suffering severe injuries and needing emergency surgery to save his life. While Kennedy was exonerated by the NHL, Detroit management and fans accused him of deliberately injuring Howe. The result was a violent playoff series and increased animosity between the teams. The teams' proximity to each other – Toronto and Detroit are approximately 240 miles (380km) apart, mainly using Ontario Highway 401 – {{and a number of}} shared fans (particularly in markets such as Windsor, Ontario) added to the rivalry. After the Leafs moved to the Eastern Conference in 1998, they faced each other less often, and the rivalry was more often found in the stands than on the ice.|$|E
25|$|As Secretary of State for Employment, she {{was also}} {{appointed}} First Secretary of State by Wilson, bringing her firmly {{into the heart of}} government. She was never far from controversy which reached a <b>fever</b> <b>pitch</b> when the trade unions rebelled against her proposals to reduce their powers in her 1969 white paper, 'In Place of Strife'. This also involved a major cabinet split, with threatened resignations, hot tempers and her future nemesis James Callaghan breaking ranks to publicly try to undermine the bill. The whole episode alienated her from many of her friends on the left, with the Tribune newspaper railing very hard against the bill, which they held to be attacking the workers without attacking the bosses. The split is often said to be partly responsible for Labour's defeat at the 1970 general election. The eventual deal with the unions dropped most of the contentious clauses.|$|E
25|$|Arnold's Wildcats were {{a highly}} {{successful}} team, as they finished the regular season as minor premiers with a 22–4 record. After another successful regular season, the Wildcats entered the finals brimming with confidence. The Wildcats easily accounted for long-term rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the Semi Finals to then find themselves against the highly-rated Eastside Spectres in the Grand Final. The Wildcats had {{a unique opportunity to}} win back-to-back titles, a feat only achieved by two other teams to that point {{in the history of the}} NBL. Everything looked on track when the Wildcats were able to defeat the Spectres in Game 1 in Melbourne by 26 points (109–83). Perth had hit <b>fever</b> <b>pitch</b> and another sold-out crowd awaited the Wildcats for Game 2 back at home. However, with their backs against the wall, the Spectres performed with a never-say-die attitude and upset the favourites at home by five points (86–81). Game 2 was played on a Friday night and Game 3 was scheduled for Sunday, leaving the Wildcats little time to formulate a new strategy. However, in front of an electric Perth crowd, the Wildcats were victorious in the deciding third game by 10 points (90–80) and became the third team in history to win back-to-back NBL Championships. Hansen was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 17.3 points per game over the three games.|$|E
500|$|The {{events of}} the night formed the pivotal point of the 1997 film <b>Fever</b> <b>Pitch,</b> an {{adaptation}} of Nick Hornby's bestselling book of the same name.

500|$|In {{the midst}} of the lengthy world tour {{supporting}} 1995's multi-platinum Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Chamberlin's father died, and his substance abuse hit a <b>fever</b> <b>pitch.</b> Of this period, Chamberlin later said, [...] "I learned that escapism was better than emotion, and that's where I hid... It got to the point that I really didn't care. Life was scary for me." [...] Prior to shows scheduled July '96 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Chamberlin and touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin overdosed on heroin; Melvoin subsequently died, and Chamberlin was kicked out of the band, ostensibly to protect his health.|$|E
500|$|With {{political}} combat {{reaching a}} <b>fever</b> <b>pitch,</b> the Committee {{introduced a bill}} to establish a newer version of the [...] "Law of Suspects" [...] – the Law of 22 Prairial. With it, a new category of [...] "enemies of the people" [...] was established in terms so vague that virtually anyone could be accused. Defendants were not permitted legal counsel and the Revolutionary Tribunal was instructed to impose no sentence other than death. The bill was swiftly shepherded into law by Robespierre, and although Saint-Just was not directly involved in its composition, he was certainly supportive. The new statutes defined the Great Terror: in their first month, the average of executions in Paris rose from five per day to seventeen, soaring in the following month to twenty-six.|$|E
500|$|This {{association}} between Virgil and Christianity reached a <b>fever</b> <b>pitch</b> in the fourteenth century, when the Divine Comedy was published; the work, by Dante Alighieri, prominently features Virgil {{as the main}} character's guide through Hell. Notably, in the second book Purgatorio, Dante and Virgil meet the poet Statius, who, having [...] "read a hidden meaning in lines of Virgil's own", was allowed passage into Purgatory, and eventually Heaven. Bourne argued that this reference is proof enough that Dante, like those before him, believed Virgil {{to have been an}} unknowing Christian prophet. In the fifteenth century, a popular story concerning Secundian, Marcellian and Verianwho started out as persecutors of Christians during the reign of the Roman emperor Deciusemerged. The story claims that the trio were alarmed by the calm manner in which their Christian victims died, and so they turned to literature and chanced upon Eclogue 4, which eventually caused their conversions.|$|E
500|$|The social {{environment}} {{created by the}} publicity of the Payne Fund Studies and religious protests reached such a <b>fever</b> <b>pitch</b> that {{a member of the}} Hays Office described it as a [...] "state of war". However, newspapers including The Plain Dealer (Cleveland), New Orleans Times Picayune, Chicago Daily News, Atlanta Journal, Saint Paul Dispatch, the Philadelphia Record and Public Ledger, the Boston American and New York's Daily News, Daily Mirror, and Evening Post all lambasted the studies. When discussing the Supreme Court's 1915 decision, film historian Gregory Black argues that the efforts of reformers might have been lessened had [...] "filmmakers been willing to produce films for specialized audiences (adults only, family, no children) … but the movers and shakers of the industry wanted or needed the largest possible market." [...] The most provocative pictures were the most profitable, with the 25% of the motion picture industry's output that was the most sensational supporting the cleaner 75%.|$|E
500|$|The game {{took place}} on a Friday evening and was {{televised}} to a national audience of over 12 million. Graham made a slight adjustment to his team's formation, bringing David O'Leary in to play as a sweeper in a back five. His thinking was to nullify Liverpool's attacking threat and {{for much of the}} first half, Arsenal stemmed their opponents' usual passing game. In the second half, Smith scored, but it looked increasingly likely the title would remain at Anfield as Arsenal struggled to increase their lead. However, deep into stoppage time, Thomas evaded a challenge by Steve Nicol and raced into the penalty area, before slipping the ball past advancing Bruce Grobbelaar to make the score 2–0. The final whistle was blown seconds later, ending Arsenal's 18-year wait to be crowned league champions. Described as [...] "the most dramatic finish in the 120-year history of the English top flight" [...] by BBC Sport in 2008, the title decider at Anfield generated interest in the sport and the events were depicted in Nick Hornby's best-selling book <b>Fever</b> <b>Pitch.</b>|$|E
500|$|The fictional {{journalist}} Bridget Jones (in reality Helen Fielding of The Independent) {{wrote of}} her love of the serial in the paper's Bridget Jones's Diary column during the original British broadcast, mentioning her [...] "simple human need for Darcy to get off with Elizabeth" [...] and regarding the couple as her [...] "chosen representatives {{in the field of}} shagging, or rather courtship". Fielding loosely reworked the plot of Pride And Prejudice in her 1996 novel of the column, naming Bridget's uptight love interest [...] "Mark Darcy" [...] and describing him exactly like Colin Firth. Following a first meeting with Firth during his filming of <b>Fever</b> <b>Pitch</b> in 1996, Fielding asked Firth to collaborate in what would become a multi-page interview between Bridget Jones and Firth in her 1999 sequel novel, [...] Conducting the real interview with Firth in Rome, Fielding lapsed into Bridget Jones mode and obsessed over Darcy in his wet shirt for the fictional interview. Firth participated in the editing of what critics called [...] "one of the funniest sequences in the diary's sequel". Both novels make various other references to the BBC serial.|$|E
500|$|... "Essence" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V.

Handlen was complimentary towards the installment's [...] "tremendous sense of purpose [...] builds to a <b>fever</b> <b>pitch</b> that makes questions of who exactly wants what largely irrelevant." [...] While he offered a pessimistic opinion in regards to the series' mythology as a whole, Handlen concluded that the eighth season's sense of purpose, as exemplified in [...] "Essence", made the episode successful. George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of Contra Costa Times praised the episode, writing [...] "where have nifty episodes like [...] been the last two years?" [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Praising the storyline, he noted that [...] "Thanks to 'Essence', I've become a believer again." [...] John Keegan of Critical Myth gave the episode a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "overall, this was a wonderful episode that served to prepare us for the final installment of the alien mythology (presumably) and managed to keep us in our seats the entire way." [...] Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone was positive toward both [...] "Essence" [...] and [...] "Existence". Wigmore gave the episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "the reason that this two-parter works is that its plot is simple enough for the audience to still have a handle on".
