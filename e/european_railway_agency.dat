2500|$|In January 2010, the European {{railway network}} was opened to a {{liberalisation}} intended to allow greater competition. Both Air France-KLM and Deutsche Bahn have indicated {{their desire to}} take advantage of the new laws to run new services via the Channel Tunnel and the High Speed 1 route that terminates at London St Pancras. [...] A test run of an ICE train through the Channel Tunnel took place on 19 October 2010. Passenger-carrying ICE trains, however, will have to meet safety requirements in order to transit the Channel Tunnel. Although the requirement for splittable trains was lifted, concerns remain over the shorter length of ICE trainsets, fire safety, and the ICE's distributed power arrangements. There have been suggestions that French interests have advocated stringent enforcement to delay a competitor on the route. Eurostar also recently chose Siemens Velaro-based rolling stock; there were concerns that Alstom (builders of the passenger trains that already use the Tunnel) and the French Government would take the matter to court. In October 2010, the French transport minister suggested that the <b>European</b> <b>Railway</b> <b>Agency</b> (based in France) should arbitrate. After safety rule changes which might permit the use of Siemens Velaro rolling stock, the French government dismissed their delegate to the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, and brought in a replacement.|$|E

30|$|Although, for example, {{timetables}} {{are generally}} {{in the public}} domain, {{there is still the}} perception of such data as commercially sensitive information; hence the difficulty in identifying a harmonized, comprehensive and detailed European database. Various attempts to improve this situation are currently on-going, especially but not limited to infrastructure data (i.e. the International Union of Railway’s ERIM Project [4] and RailTopoModel [5], the RailML initiative [6], the <b>European</b> <b>Railway</b> <b>Agency’s</b> Register of Infrastructure [7], the MERITS database [8], etc.).|$|R

50|$|The European Commission has {{mandated}} that <b>European</b> <b>railways</b> to publish their deployment planning {{up to the}} 5 July 2017. This {{will be used to}} create a geographical and technical database (TENtec) that can show the ETCS deployment status on the Trans-European Network. From the comparative overview the commission wants to identify the needs for additional coordination measures to support the implementation. Synchronous with the publication of ETCS SRS 3.6.0 on 15 June 2017 the Regulation 2016/796/EC was published. It mandates the replacement of the <b>European</b> <b>Railways</b> <b>Agency</b> by the <b>European</b> Union <b>Agency</b> for <b>Railways.</b> The <b>agency</b> was tasked with the creation of a regulatory framework for a Single <b>European</b> <b>Railway</b> Area (SERA) in the 4th Railway Package to be resolved in late June 2016. A week later the new EU <b>Agency</b> for <b>Railways</b> emphasized the stability of B3R2 and the usage as the foundation for oncoming ETCS implementations in the EU. Based on projections in the Rhine-Alps-Corridor a break-even of the cross-border ETCS implementation is expected in the early 2030s. A new memorandum of understanding was signed on InnoTrans in September 2016 for a completion of the first ETCS Deployment Plan targets by 2022. The new planning was accepted by the European Commission in January 2017 with a goal to have 50% of the Core Network Corridors equipped by 2023 and the remainder in a second phase up to 2030.|$|R
