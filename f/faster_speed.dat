Unusually for an Apple release by a former Beatle, the single was packaged in a plain sleeve in the main markets of Britain and the United States. A variety of picture sleeves were available in European countries, including a design incorporating Harrison's signature and a red Om symbol, both of which were aspects of Tom Wilkes's artwork for the Material World album.|$|E

Jetman also {{has the ability to}} boost, which will temporarily make him move at a much <b>faster</b> <b>speed,</b> although boosts will need to recharge once they are depleted.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first showed signs of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa at a <b>faster</b> <b>speed</b> than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection in conjunction with a well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E
50|$|Previous {{screw mount}} Leicas used two {{separate}} shutter speed dials for slow and <b>fast</b> <b>speeds</b> (the <b>fast</b> <b>speed</b> dial {{on top of}} the camera rotated during firing). The M3 combined slower and <b>faster</b> <b>speeds</b> and the dial does not rotate during firing. Supposedly, this reduces vibrations in the camera. Early models used a non-geometrical series of shutter speeds. On later models this became the international standard of 1s to 1/1000s.|$|R

5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At <b>faster</b> <b>speed,</b> aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
25|$|Clipper ships sacrificed cargo {{capacity}} for speed, {{but in some}} markets, the fast service allowed their owners to charge premium rates (Tea from China tasted better if it was fresh, so the cargo on the first ship of the season to arrive in New York was worth more). Also, <b>faster</b> <b>speed</b> meant that the vessel could complete more voyages in a given time period, which also helped {{make up for the}} diminished {{cargo capacity}}.|$|E
25|$|Momentum is conserved {{through a}} wormhole, so an object will exit a Stargate {{at the same}} speed at which it entered. However, in early episodes (and the film) objects are seen to exit at a <b>faster</b> <b>speed</b> than entry. This is {{possibly}} explained by the 'freezing effect' also witnessed – heat energy is converted to kinetic energy, both cooling the object and increasing its velocity. These effects were countered during an upgrade of Stargate Command's dialing computer.|$|E

25|$|With the {{completion}} of electrification between New Haven and Boston, all trains on the line have become faster {{partly because of the}} removal of a 10‑minute delay in New Haven while swapping diesel and electric locomotives, partly from a faster acceleration away from station stops enabled by electric locomotives, and partly because of the <b>faster</b> <b>speed</b> achieved on some sections of track. Acela travels between Boston and New York in about {{three and a half hours}} (an improvement of half an hour); New York to Washington runs take two hours and forty-five minutes. These schedules, as well as the relative convenience of rail as opposed to air travel especially after the September 11 attacks, and direct downtown-to-downtown service have made the Acela Express more competitive with the air shuttles.|$|E

500|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to locate and destroy four specific demons. Each demon is vulnerable to a particular object which must be collected by the player: a hammer, a Bible, a crucifix and an hourglass. Once the four items have been collected, the player must track down a specific demon and cast the correct item at it in order to destroy it. Once all four demons have been destroyed, the game will end. In order to defend against other enemies such as vampires and monsters, the player can arm themselves with [...] "antibodies", which can then be thrown at enemies. Antibodies can be found in houses around the village, and will slowly deplete once used by the player. Other collectible items include extra lives and boots, the latter of which enables the player character to run at a <b>faster</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 6 August, Karlsruhe rendezvoused {{with the}} {{passenger}} ship [...] about [...] north of Watling Island. Karlsruhe {{was in the}} process of transferring guns and equipment to the liner when Craddock, in his flagship , appeared to the south. The Germans had only managed to transfer two 8.8cm guns, a machine gun, and some sailors by the time Suffolk arrived. The two ships quickly departed in different directions; Suffolk followed Karlsruhe and other cruisers were ordered to intercept her. Karlsruhes <b>faster</b> <b>speed</b> allowed her to quickly outpace Craddock, but at 20:15, [...] joined the pursuit and briefly fired on the German cruiser. The German gunners scored two hits on Bristol during the short engagement. Karlsruhe turned east and again used her high speed to evade the British ships. The British failed to relocate her, and by 9 August, Karlsruhe reached Puerto Rico with only 12 tons of coal in her bunkers.|$|E

500|$|Despite its obsolescence, the PanzerI {{was also}} used in the {{invasion}} of France in May 1940. Of 2,574 tanks available for the campaign, no fewer than 523 were Panzer Is, while there were [...] 627 PanzerIIIs and IVs, 955 PanzerII, 106 Czech Panzer 35(t), and 228 Panzer38(t). For their defense, the French boasted up to 4,000 tanks, including 300 Char B1, armed with a 47mm (1.7in) gun in the turret and a larger 75mm (2.95in) low-velocity gun in the hull. The French also had around 250 Somua S-35, widely {{regarded as one of}} the best tanks of the period, armed with the same 47mm main gun and protected by almost 55mm (2.17in) of armour at its thickest point. Nevertheless, the French also deployed over 3,000 light tanks, including about 500 World War I-vintage FT-17s. The two main advantages that German armor enjoyed were radios allowing them to coordinate faster than their British or French counterparts, and superior tactical doctrine, in addition to markedly <b>faster</b> <b>speed,</b> generally.|$|E
500|$|The breed {{exhibits}} a natural ambling gait, called the single-foot, which replaces the trot {{seen in a}} majority of horse breeds. Both gaits are an intermediate speed between a walk and a canter or gallop; ambling gaits are four-beat gaits, whereas the trot is a two-beat gait. The extra footfalls provide additional smoothness to a rider because the horse always {{has at least one}} foot on the ground. [...] This minimizes movement of the horse's topline and removes the bounce of a two-beat gait, caused by a moment of suspension followed by the jolt of two feet hitting the ground as the horse shifts from one pair of legs to the other. The value of an intermediate speed is that the horse conserves energy. [...] More than thirty horse breeds are [...] "gaited," [...] able to perform a four-beat ambling gait, and some can also trot. Thus, a Rocky Mountain Horse, with rider, can use the single-foot to cover rough ground at around [...] and short stretches of smooth ground at up to [...] The <b>faster</b> <b>speed</b> is known as the rack.

Defence participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau, but Rear-Admiral Ernest Troubridge decided not to engage Goeben due to the latter's more powerful guns, heavier armour and <b>faster</b> <b>speed.</b> She then blockaded the German ships inside the Dardanelles.
