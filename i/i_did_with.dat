5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

500|$|Although Noel rejoined Oasis a {{few weeks}} later, the band's {{management}} and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that [...] "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move {{would have been to}} take {{the rest of the year}} off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it." [...] Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that [...] "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record Be Here Now in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." [...] He described the Mustique demos as [...] "the last good recordings <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Noel" [...] and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} had {{a ripple}} effect, weakening Nickelodeon's commitment to Junktown. Bakshi has {{also stated that}} [...] "we were trying something different [...] but a series didn't make sense. It just didn't work". The series was scrapped, and the completed pilot aired as a special, Christmas in Tattertown, in December 1988. It was the first original animated special created for Nickelodeon. Bakshi moved into a warehouse loft in downtown Los Angeles to clear his head, and was offered $50,000 to direct a half-hour live-action film for PBS's Imagining America anthology series. Mark Bakshi produced the film, This Ain't Bebop, his first professional collaboration with his father. Bakshi wrote a poem influenced by Jack Kerouac, jazz, the Beat Generation and Brooklyn {{that served as the}} narration, which was spoken by Harvey Keitel. After a car crash, Bakshi completed the post-production in stitches and casts. Bakshi said of the work, [...] "It's the most proud I've been of a picture since Coonskin—the last real thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> total integrity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{compilation}} album includes 19 {{songs by}} various artists. Thirteen {{of the tracks}} were previously unreleased; the six existing recordings were: [...] "Wish for You" [...] by Faith Hill, Sade's [...] "The Sweetest Gift", [...] "I Remember" [...] by Lauryn Hill, Seal's [...] "Secret", [...] "Fragilidad" [...] (1988) by Sting, and David Bowie's [...] "Everyone Says 'Hi'". Turlington said of the album: I went to friends first, as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the first CD. Bono and Chris Martin were great supporters of the project the first time around, and when I knew I wanted to include men on this album they were obvious choices. They are also both fathers to daughters. Others, such as Patti Smith and Rita Wilson, I've {{known for a long}} time, and some, like Edie Brickell and Paul Simon, I only met briefly but was a huge admirer. I generally wanted a diverse group of artists who were parents, {{or in the case of}} Edward Sharpe, who will be soon. We wanted to reach a broad audience on this issue with this particular project and with a range of perspectives.|$|E
500|$|A day later, {{producer}} David Kahne stated on {{the same}} site that the leaked listing was bogus. In an interview with Billboard magazine in May 2007, McCartney said that the album's material was [...] "in some ways a little bit retrospective. Some of them are of now, some of them hark back to the past, {{but all of them}} are songs I'm very proud of." [...] McCartney played mandolin on the song [...] "Dance Tonight". He comments that [...] "In searching the instrument to try and find chords, which <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the guitar when I was 14, probably, that freshness was brought back." [...] "Ever Present Past", which McCartney called [...] "personal", originally started out as a song called [...] "Perfect Lover". [...] "Ever Present Past" [...] also includes references to the Beatles. In June 2007, McCartney revealed that [...] "See Your Sunshine" [...] "is pretty much an out-and-out love song for Heather. A lot of the album was done before, during and after our separation. I didn't go back and take out any songs to do with her." [...] "You Tell Me" [...] is about McCartney's memories of his previous wife, Linda.|$|E

500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E
500|$|The rating did {{not come}} without its share of controversy. Reginald Dennis {{described}} to the reaction that followed Minya Oh's review: [...] "I was happy, Jon was happy, Nas was happy, everybody was happy — except {{for all of the}} people who felt that The Chronic should have also gotten a 5." [...] Only two years prior, Dr. Dre's groundbreaking The Chronic failed to earn the coveted rating, despite redefining the musical landscape of hip hop. It was later revealed that while everybody at the magazine knew it was an instant classic, they decided to comply with the strict policy of staying away from a perfect rating. Subsequently, when Nas's album was exempted from this moratorium, many fans pointed to this decision as a confirmation of journalistic bias towards East Coast hip hop. Despite receiving criticism over his staff's earlier review of The Chronic, Reginald Dennis continues to defend the decision to award Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating: [...] "I’m just happy that Illmatic is universally acclaimed as a classic, so no one can accuse me of dropping the ball... And if I hadn’t gone through what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> The Chronic, I wouldn’t have had the flexibility to allow for the bending of my policy. So I think it all worked out well.” ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the {{original}} remix with André, Kesha and co-producer of the track, Luke, decided that they wanted to remix the track again with the intention of adding some of Kesha's desired future collaborations. The first to add their verses to the track was Lil Wayne. Kesha and Wayne both {{happened to be in the}} studio on the same day as each other and she took the opportunity to ask him if he would participate in the remixing of the song. Following this Wiz Khalifa and T.I. were then asked to collaborate on the track. All three rappers agreed to write and appear on the song and with this the remix was completed. According to Kesha, the four rappers on the remix, titled [...] "Sleazy Remix 2.0: Get Sleazier", are included because they are four of her favorite rappers. On December 7, 2011, she posted the following message on the internet, revealing that the song would be released exclusively to iTunes on December 13, 2011: [...] "Get ready to get even $leazier with this sick collaboration <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> 4 of my favorite MCs of all time: Weezy, André 3000, Wiz Khalifa, and T.I., I opened the ‘Get $leazy’ tour with this song every night and it always got the party started ...

500|$|In January1994, Simon co-created with comedian George Carlin {{the sitcom}} The George Carlin Show for Fox. It aired for 27 episodes before being {{canceled}} in December1995. Simon served as showrunner throughout its run and directed several episodes. Simon persuaded Carlin {{to do the}} show after writing it as something which would not be [...] "typically sitcomy." [...] He conceived the show as what Carlin's {{life would have been}} like had he never become a comedian; Carlin played a heavy drinking New York taxi driver. Simon commented: [...] "When I was doing The Simpsons, people couldn't see how smart {{it was because of the}} low moments. There's something about this show. People who like it say it's classy. They don't see how vulgar it is." [...] Carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with Simon. On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly." [...] Simon described himself as [...] "combative" [...] and said that most people see him as having a [...] "bad attitude".|$|E
500|$|Themes in Lavigne's music include {{messages}} of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. Lavigne believes her [...] "songs are about being yourself {{no matter what}} and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true." [...] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as [...] "Losing Grip", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as [...] "Complicated", saying that [...] "the songs <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the Matrix... were good for my first record, but I don't {{want to be that}} pop anymore." [...] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that [...] "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about... Like boys, like dating or relationships". Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style. [...] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. [...] "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [...] Her objective in writing the album was simply to [...] "make it fun". The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as [...] "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". Ian McKellen defined her as [...] "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" [...] on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.|$|E
