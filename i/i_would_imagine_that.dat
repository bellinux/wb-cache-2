The day after the speech the company's stock went down by 20 percent. Einhorn alleged the company of defrauding the Small Business Administration while Allied said that Einhorn was engaging in market manipulation, and illegally accessed his phone records using pretexting. In June 2007, after a lengthy investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it found that Allied broke securities laws relating to the accounting and valuation of illiquid securities it held. After the incident, Einhorn has published a book, Fooling Some of the People All of the Time regarding this six-year fight. Reviews of the book were generally positive; Seeking Alpha, said of the book: [...] "the case against Allied Capital is laid out to the last detail. Because of the immense amount of data in the book, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> some readers may want to skip a page here and there. However, the book is by no means dull. This book proves that truth is really stranger than fiction." [...] Einhorn would come to view Allied as a microcosm of market trends: [...] "What we've seen a year later is that Allied was the tip of an iceberg; that this kind of questionable ethic, philosophy and business practice was far more widespread than I recognized at the time...Our country, our economy, is paying a huge price for that." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{recent review}} of dental {{services}} lead by Professor Jimmy Steele recommends that quality {{be addressed in}} dental service provision in England. Therefore the concept of quality {{needs to be made}} explicit in order to avoid ambiguity. The difficulties surrounding quality definitions saw the emergence of quality standards in the 1980 s. The British Standard BS 5750 became popular with organisations throughout this period and now through various revisions since the early 1990 s it has been replaced by the ISO 9000 standard. This is a written standard which has to be adhered to by any organisation wishing to be accredited with the quality ISO 9000 kite mark. One of the fundamental issues to be dealt with in any organisation utilising the ISO 9000 standard is that of its product. Without knowing the product it is impossible for an organisation to know if its activities have resulted in effective product realisation. So what is our product as a profession? Historically, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> we would have defined it as activities reacting to the vast amount of disease present in the population. Today our product includes restorative care but that is {{only a small part of}} what we now consider oral health to be. Therefore, we can surely say that as a profession our product is oral health. Contemporary definitions of oral health embrace a more three dimensional holistic 'social model of health' view rather than a two dimensional physical 'medical model of health' view. There is much in the dental literature demonstrating how the former contemporary definition can be measured using oral health-related quality of life measures. Should these measures not be fundamental to professional product realisation within a quality system...|$|E
40|$|This is {{our second}} survey on the {{measurement}} of forecast error. We reported {{the results of our}} first survey in the Summer 2008 issue of Foresight (Green & Tashman, 2008). The question we asked in that survey was whether to define forecast error as Actual minus Forecast (A-F) or Forecast minus Actual (F-A). Respondents made good arguments for both of the alternatives. In the current survey, we asked how percentage forecast error should be measured. In particular: What should the denominator be when calculating percentage error? We posed the question to the International Institute of Forecasters discussion list as well as to Foresight subscribers, in the following way: To calculate a percentage error, it is better to use… (Check or write in) 1. The actual value (A) as the denominator [] 2. The forecast (F) as the denominator [] 3. Neither (A) nor (F) but some other value [] I recommend my choice of denominator, because: The first two options in the questionnaire have each been used when calculating the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for multiple forecast periods. The first option is the more traditional form. One popular alternative to using either A or F as the denominator is to take an average of the two: (A+F) / 2. Calculated over multiple forecast periods, this measure is most commonly called the symmetric MAPE (sMAPE) and has been used in recent forecasting competitions to compare the accuracy of forecasts from different methods. See, for example, www. neural-forecasting-competition. com/index. htm. SURVEY RESULTS We received 61 usable responses. 34 of these (a majority of 56 %) preferred option 1 : using the Actual as the denominator for the percentage error. 15 % preferred option 2, using the Forecast as the denominator, while 29 % chose option 3, something other than the actual or the forecast.
