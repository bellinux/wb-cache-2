2500|$|In {{social and}} {{political}} philosophy, economics underlies much of the debate. Bernard de Mandeville's The Fable of the Bees (1714) became a centre-point of controversy regarding trade, morality, and social ethics. [...] Mandeville argued that wastefulness, lust, pride, {{and all the other}} [...] "private" [...] vices were good for the society at large, for each led the individual to employ others, to spend freely, and to <b>free</b> <b>capital</b> to flow through the economy. Mandeville's work is full of paradox and is meant, at least partially, to problematize what he saw as the naive philosophy of human progress and inherent virtue. [...] However, Mandeville's arguments, initially an attack on graft of the War of the Spanish Succession, would be quoted often by economists who wished to strip morality away from questions of trade.|$|E
2500|$|Free {{movement}} of capital was traditionally {{seen as the}} fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original Treaty of Rome required that restrictions on <b>free</b> <b>capital</b> flows only be removed {{to the extent necessary}} for the common market. From the Treaty of Maastricht, now in TFEU article 63, [...] "all restrictions on the {{movement of}} capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited". This means capital controls of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying company shares or financial assets, or government approval requirements for foreign investment. By contrast, taxation of capital, including corporate tax, capital gains tax and Financial transaction tax are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the Capital Movement Directive 1988, Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered. In Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren the Court of Justice held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a [...] "definite influence" [...] through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor. That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, TFEU article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent tax evasion. Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of Advocate General Maduro, a series of cases held that government owned golden shares were unlawful. In Commission v Germany the Commission claimed the German Volkswagen Act 1960 violated article 63, in that §2(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and §4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the Lower Saxony government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the Court of Justice's Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders. Similarly, in Commission v Portugal the Court of Justice held that Portugal infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in Portugal Telecom that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a [...] "deterrent effect on portfolio investments" [...] and reduing [...] "the attractiveness of an investment". This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with TFEU article 345.|$|E
40|$|Researchers have {{observed}} that the growth of hourly compensation in the U. S. has lagged behind the labour productivity growth since 1970 (Fleck, Glaser, & Sprague, 2011). The disparity between productivity and compensation, which {{is known as the}} productivity-compensation gap (Mishel & Gee, 2011), suggests that workers do not benefit directly from the increase in the productivity growth. The dynamism between labour productivity and compensation may be influenced by the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). By raising labour productivity, ICT saves (labour) costs - in this thesis, the money that is saved due to productivity growth, or freed by productivity growth, is called ‘freed capital’. In principle, the <b>freed</b> <b>capital</b> can in turn be used to expand the production and create new jobs for those whose work is made redundant by ICT. But is this the best possible societal option {{for the use of the}} <b>freed</b> <b>capital?</b> While increasing labour productivity, ICT may also reduce work and/or alter work relationships, implying significant shifts in responsibility and hence in remuneration. Following this, two main research questions are formulated: First, what is the impact of ICT on the productivity-compensation gap? Second, what principle that should guide the use of <b>freed</b> <b>capital?</b> In particular, could it be used to counter the impact of ICT on the productivity-compensation gap? Does a theoretical principle exist that would support such use of <b>freed</b> <b>capital?</b> In the end, this thesis finds that the impact of ICT on the productivity-compensation gap is hard to be measured, mainly because the impact of ICT on the hours worked is still inconclusive. Nonetheless, this thesis provides two insights that shows ICT still have influences on works: first, ICT contributes to around $ 1. 06 trillion (in constant 2005 US$) of the U. S. value added in period 1970 - 2005. This means that while, apparently, ICT does not have significant impact on the total hours worked, it still increases labour productivity (output per hour). Secondly, ICT is shown to have a positive correlation with the increase of both high-skill and low-skill works, while it has an opposite effect on the medium-skill works. This means that while ICT is assumed to open up new work opportunities, it may also cause a job polarization, in which the medium-skill workers might end up competing for a lower-skill works. Following this result, this thesis reviews various economic theories to review principles that may guide the <b>freed</b> <b>capital</b> towards activities that may counter the impact of ICT on the productivity-compensation gap. This thesis then argues that the answer for such question will depend on which value that is important from the economic perspective. If utility maximization is accepted as the value that organize economic activities, the <b>freed</b> <b>capital</b> can find its place in the expansion of production, as what neoclassical and Schumpeterian perspective prescribe. However, if human beings are perceived to have a higher capacity than merely satisfaction of utility, then the <b>freed</b> <b>capital</b> should also be used for the development of human capacities and character. Just like the investment in innovation that need a great commitment, the investment in the development of human capacities and character will also need one, even greater.

40|$|<b>Free</b> {{movement}} of <b>capital</b> {{has been one}} of the main objectives of Article 3 of the EC Treaty, as part of the development of the common market. Nowadays, the domestic market and almost all of other freedoms (eg. workers, goods and services) depends on the freedom of {{movement of}} capital. Unlike other freedoms, freedom of movement is more liberalized. European investment, cross-border transfers, bank accounts, purchases and authorization of purchases of real estate, inheritance etc., are included in the <b>free</b> movement of <b>capital.</b> <b>Free</b> movement of <b>capital</b> has lost somehow its sense with the entry into force of EMU and the introduction of the Euro. This liberalization aimed at realizing a collaboration and coordination of economic policies and to some extent even political at the higher levels of the central banks where the fulfillment of the convergence criteria (four criteria), was a prerequisite for a country to adopt the single currency.
