It has a low {{platform}} at its southeastern corner, where 48 severed heads were excavated immediately to the west. Schele and Mathews have speculated that these may be the heads of the K'iche' kings Tepupul and Itzayul together with other members of the K'iche' court who were captured by the Kaqchikels and decapitated. Most of the skulls were found with associated obsidian blades.

40|$|International audienceMemory {{testing of}} an {{integrated}} circuit is a real industrial challenge, and presents several interesting original combinatorial opti- mization problems. A simple model for testing a set of memories, tak- ing into account their test time and power, is first presented. Feasible solutions consist on <b>grouping</b> memories <b>into</b> <b>lots</b> of a maximum fixed power. The aim is to minimize the overall test time for a unique sequen- tial tester. The problem includes the classical Bin-Packing problem and thus is N P -hard. A simple lower bound of the overall test time is first obtained using a continuous version of the problem. A simple heuris- tic issued from a Next Fit Decreasing strategy is then presented and its performance ratio is proved to be bounded by 2...|$|R
40|$|Low measles {{vaccination}} coverage (VC) leads to recurrent epidemics in many African countries. We describe VC {{before and after}} late reinforcement of vaccination activities during a measles epidemic in Niamey, Niger (2003 - 2004) assessed by Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS). Neighborhoods of Niamey were <b>grouped</b> <b>into</b> 46 <b>lots</b> based on geographic proximity and population homogeneity. Before reinforcement activities, 96 % of lots had a VC below 70 %. After reinforcement, this proportion fell to 78 %. During the intervention 50 % of children who had no previous record of measles vaccination received their first dose (vaccination card or parental recall). Our results highlight the benefits and limitations of vaccine reinforcement activities performed late in the epidemic...|$|R

40|$|Gamma {{irradiation}} {{of seeds}} {{is known as}} {{an important factor in}} stimulating biochemical and physiological processes. This paper investigates the effect of seed irradiation on the seed germination, storability, and seedling growth traits of Magnolia champaca. Seeds were irradiated with 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 Gy by Cobalt- 60. The treated seeds were <b>grouped</b> <b>into</b> three <b>lots,</b> namely germination test, storage test and seedling growth characteristics. Observations were made for seed germination percentage, germination index, mean germination time, germination value and growth traits such as height, collar diameter, number of leaves, root length, and dry weight. Results showed that irradiation at a dose of 30 Gy was close to LD 50, and irradiation at doses of 80 Gy and higher caused lethal effect. The maximum increase of germination parameters on irradiated seed was recorded at a dose of 10 Gy, and then it decreased. Growth rate in terms of seedling height, collar diameter, number of leaves, and dry weight have also increased in gamma irradiation doses up to 80 Gy, but the dose of 10 Gy resulted in survival and growth that was more stable and gave the highest values for most of the parameters. Hence, lower dose (10 Gy) of irradiation treatment can be used to increase seed germination, storability and seedling growth of M. champaca...|$|R
40|$|Wool may be classed (i. e., <b>grouped</b> <b>into</b> {{reasonably}} uniform <b>lots</b> {{prior to}} sale) either immediately after shearing in the shearing shed {{or it may}} be packed into bales and sent to a wool store for classing. The second type of operation (especially when applied to relatively small quantities of wool) is known as bulk classing. With bulk classing the individual grower's wool loses its identity and is offered for sale in mixed lots. There {{are a number of other}} methods of preparation of wool for sale. Of these the only one which will be considered here specifically is "interlotting" which consists of shed classed bales from a number of growers being matched and sold as one lot. Interlotting is purely an operation to increase the size of lots (i. e., the number of bales per lot sold) so as to attract more competition from buyers or to reduce the valuing, inspection and bidding work of buyers and othersLivestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is {{a network}} {{comprising}} of wirelessly linked sensor nodes. These low computational, tiny devices can communicate in short distances. Each sensor node consists of sensing, data processing, and communication components. To ensure scalability {{and to increase}} the efficiency of the network operation, sensor nodes are often <b>grouped</b> <b>into</b> clusters. A <b>lot</b> of work is being done in this field; however, there is still a scope of improvement with modern meta-heuristic route optimization technique inspired from natural swarm. The area of WSN always needs research and development to contribute the more advancement to this era of technology. This paper deals with the energy conservation {{and at the same time}} on basis of energy the load balancing of existing network. Since network traffic is growing day by day the energy conservation and some fruitful measures are still needed to maintain its smooth working. In this paper, we develop an algorithm by integrating techniques such as greedy algorithm and ant colony optimization (ACO) thus making it a hybrid approach in balancing load in a WSN. This approach is simulated in java and also a same approach is implemented and the result parameters are analyzed...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at the Sheep Experimental Farm of Federal University of Mato Grosso/Brazil, along the months of February to May 2008, during the rainy and the water-dry transition seasons. The area where the experiment were totaled 4500 m 2, formed by the Marandu palisadegrass. This area was divided into 45 paddocks of 100 m 2. We used 27 lambs Santa Inês (purebred) with 4 months of age and average weight of 22 kg. The lambs were <b>grouped</b> <b>into</b> nine <b>lots</b> of similar weights. The treatments consisted of three stocking rates, 2, 3 and 4 female lambs / paddocks, corresponding respectively to 40, 60 and 80 lambs / ha. Each treatment was represented by 15 repetitions totaling 45 plots, each representing a paddock of 100 m 2. The paddocks were managed under the system of intermittent stocking with 7 days of occupation and 28 days of rest. All paddocks had the height measured in 10 points. We used the found height as a criterion for the choice of where to sample the plot residual forage mass. The cutting height was 5 cm in the ground. The samples were weighed and submitted to fractionation: leaf, stem and senescent material. We calculated the leaf: stem ratio, dividing the amount of dry residual amount of green leaves by stem + sheath. The data collected were submitted to variance and regression analysis at 5 % significance level. There was a linear decrease as the stocking rate increased for leaf: stem + sheath, and the estimated values of 0. 22, 0. 17 and 0. 11. A similar effect was also observed for the post grazing sward height, where each animal unit added to the stocking rate reduced 0. 32 cm in the pasture height. The estimated values were 56. 32, 49. 50 and 43. 34 cm, respectively for 40, 60 and 80 lambs / ha. There was higher areas excluded by the animals, being possible to display high heterogeneity kept in paddocks with lower stocking rate.
