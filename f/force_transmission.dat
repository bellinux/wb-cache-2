40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of blocked stations that appears in some spatial configurations of multi-hop wireless networks based on the 802. 11 DCF (Distributed Coordination Function). The problem leads to starvation {{of at least one}} station caused by the presence of neighbor stations within its carrier sensing range that do not hear each other. We propose <b>Forced</b> <b>Transmissions,</b> a simple and efficient solution to this problem. It consists of detecting that a station is blocked by others stations and <b>forcing</b> a <b>transmission.</b> This results in a collision that increases the contention windows of blocking stations and leaves some channel time to the blocked station for transmitting. The blocked station <b>forces</b> <b>transmission</b> only with some proba-bility adjusted in function of the time spent waiting for the channel. Our simulations show that the proposed method increases the minimal throughput of the blocked stations at the expense of a slight degradation of the total throughput, which is unavoidable in any DCF based solution. 1...|$|R

40|$|The multiple-input single-output {{interference}} {{channel is}} considered. Each transmitter {{is assumed to}} know the channels between itself and all receivers perfectly and the receivers are assumed to treat interference as additive noise. In this setting, noncooperative transmission {{does not take into}} account the interference generated at other receivers which generally leads to inefficient performance of the links. To improve this situation, we study cooperation between the links using coalitional games. The players (links) in a coalition either perform zero <b>forcing</b> <b>transmission</b> or Wiener filter precoding to each other. The epsilon-core is a solution concept for coalitional games that takes into account the overhead required in coalition deviation. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the strong and weak epsilon-core of our coalitional game not to be empty with zero <b>forcing</b> <b>transmission.</b> Since, the epsilon-core only considers the possibility of joint cooperation of all links, we study coalitional games in partition form in which several distinct coalitions can form. We propose a polynomial-time distributed coalition formation algorithm based on coalition merging and prove that its solution lies in the coalition structure stable set of our coalition formation game. Simulation results reveal the cooperation gains for different coalition formation complexities and deviation overhead models. QC 20150113 </p...|$|R

Since pennate fibers insert at an angle, the anatomical cross-sectional area cannot be used as {{in parallel}} fibered muscles.
