40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis has}} been undertaken of the polarization properties of birefringent vertical-cavity surfaceemitting lasers (VCSEL's) subject to weak optical feedback in an external cavity configuration. Attention is focussed on {{the competition between}} two orthogonal polarizations of the fundamental (LP 01) transverse mode of the device. It is shown that control of the emission polarization can be exercised even for very small external reflectivities (10 04 %) by appropriate choice of optical feedback delays. The polarization selectivity is shown to be dependent upon the strength of optical feedback. Polarization is also shown to be highly sensitive to small changes in optical feedback delay.

In this paper, we study the performance of six algorithms in NK [...] landscapes with low and high dimension while keeping the amount of epistatic interactions constant.

The performance model allows the system designer to evaluate the architecture and implementation approaches in term {{of their ability to}} achieve required performance. We show our method in action using a J 2 EE application, Stock-Online, and validate the predictions by implementing the design and measuring its performance.

Quasi-static and dynamic problems are considered and two particular frictional conditions, full stick friction and frictionless cases, are addressed. Lagrange multipliers and regularized formulations of the contact problem, such as penalty or augmented Lagrangian methods, are avoided and a new direct elimination method is proposed. Conserving algorithms are also introduced for the proposed formulation for dynamic contact problems. An assessment of <b>he</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> the resulting formulation is shown {{in a number of}} selected benchmark tests and numerical examples, including both quasi-static and dynamic contact problems under full stick friction and frictionless contact conditions. Conservation of key discrete properties exhibited by the time stepping algorithm used for dynamic contact problems is also shown in an example. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The characteristics of U W B and size of data packets in FCS are take n into account in the CSMA/CA protocol with D-UF.

T he fading gain value is partitioned {{into a number of}} regions by which the modulation is adapted in terms of the region the fading gain falls in. The fading gain switching thresholds for attaining maximum spectrum efficiency under a target BER and fixed power constraint are achieved. Based on the se results, we derive the theoretical calculation formulae for the system spectrum efficiency and average BER in detail. As a result, the closed-form expressions for the spectrum efficiency and average BER are respectively obtained for perfect feedback. Besides, the system performance with delayed feedback information is analyzed, and t he accurate and approximate BER expressions of the systems with imperfect feedback are derived, respectively. The obtained theoretical formulae will have more accuracy than the existing formulae. Simulation results show that the theoretical SE and BER are in good agreement with the corresponding simulated values, and the system has slight BER performance degradation for the normalized time delay less than 0. 01. </span...|$|E
