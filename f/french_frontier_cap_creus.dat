40|$|The <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> {{continental}} shelf and <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> canyon {{are located in}} the southern most sector of the Gulf of Lions, in the northwestern Mediterranean. The <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> {{continental shelf}} contains sandy and muddy sediments and an abrupt morpho­ logy, with rocky outcrops, relict bioherms, erosive features, and planar bedforms. The <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> canyon breaches the shelf at a depth of 110 m and denotes a marked dif­ ference in the morphology between the northern and the southern flank, reflecting a different depositional regime. The most common substrates correspond to coarse and medium sands (28 %) and silty sediments (40 %). The most common megabenthic assemblages of the shelf correspond to the communities of "offshore detritic" (31. 95 %) and "coastal terrigenous muds" (36. 99 %), mostly dominated by sea pens, alcyonaceans, and ceriantharians. The northern flank of the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> canyon is predominantly depositional, whereas the southern flank is erosional. Rocky outcrops provide the sub­ stratum for cold­water coral (CWC) communities' development, in which the white coral Madrepora oculata is the most abundant species...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} an integrated {{study of a}} typical Mediterranean flood event in the Gulf of Lions. A flood with a 5 -year return interval occurred in the Têt River basin and adjacent inner-shelf in the Gulf of Lions, northwest Mediterranean, during April 2004. Data were collected during this flood as part of event-response investigations of the EU-funded Eurostrataform (European Margin Strata Formation) project. Southeasterly storm winds led to a flood which directly modified the inner-shelf hydrodynamics. Sediment delivery to the coastal zone during this flood represented {{more than half of}} the mean annual discharge of the Têt River to the Gulf of Lions. This river transported a large amount of sand in suspension, representing 25 % of the total suspended load, and as bedload representing 8 % of the total load, during this event. Sand introduced in the nearshore was transported northwards during the peak storm and nourished a small delta. Fine sediments were separated from coarse sediments at the river mouth, and were advected southwards and seawards by the counter-clockwise general circulation. Fine-grained sediments were transported via a hypopycnal plume along the coast towards the southern tip of the Gulf of Lions and the <b>Cap</b> <b>Creus</b> canyon. The along-shore currents, which intensified from north to south of the Gulf of Lions, particularly between the <b>Cap</b> <b>Creus</b> promontory and the <b>Cap</b> <b>Creus</b> canyon, favoured the transfer of fine-grained sediments from the continental shelf of the Gulf of Lions towards the continental slope.

40|$|The <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> and the Palamós {{submarine}} canyon heads were instrumented during two consecutive winters to study their respective {{role in the}} dynamics of the sediment transport on the north-western Mediterranean Sea. Several events of dense shelf-water cascading (DSWC) were identified simultaneously at both canyons and compared between them. DSWC events were characterized by abrupt drops of temperature, increases of current speeds, and peaks of high suspended-sediment concentrations (SSC). Concentrations up to 170 mg l⁻ ¹ were recorded in both studied winters at the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> Canyon coinciding with the first DSWC event of the winter concurrent with an eastern storm. Overall, the amount of sediment transported during the DSWC events was one order of magnitude greater at the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> Canyon than at the Palamós Canyon. Results from this study have identified {{for the first time the}} presence of DSWC events also in the Palamós Canyon head, south of the Gulf of Lions (GoL), and corroborated previous findings that the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> Canyon is the main pathway for DSWC and the associated sediment transport from the GoL down to the deeper regions of the north-western Mediterranean. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|New petrological and U–Pb zircon geochronological {{information}} has been obtained from intrusive plutonic rocks and migmatites from the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> massif (Eastern Pyrenees) in order to constrain {{the timing of the}} thermal and tectonic evolution of this northeasternmost segment of Iberia during late Palaeozoic time. Zircons from a deformed syntectonic quartz diorite from the northern <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> Tudela migmatitic complex yield a mean age of 298. 8 ± 3. 8 Ma. A syntectonic granodiorite from the Roses pluton in the southern area of lowest metamorphic grade of the massif has been dated at 290. 8 ± 2. 9 Ma. All the analysed zircons from two samples of migmatitic rocks yield inherited ages from the Precambrian metasedimentary protolith (with two main age clusters at c. 730 – 542 Ma and c. 2. 9 – 2. 2 Ga). However, field structural relationships indicate that migmatization occurred synchronously with the emplacement of the quartz dioritic magmas at c. 299 Ma. Thus, {{the results of this study}} suggest that subduction-related calc-alkaline magmatic activity in the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> was coeval and coupled with D 2 dextral transpression involving NNW–SSE crustal shortening during Late Carboniferous – Early Permian time (c. 299 – 291 Ma). Since these age determinations are within the range of those obtained for undeformed (or slightly deformed) calc-alkaline igneous rocks from NE Iberia, it follows that the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> massif would represent a zone of intense localization of D 2 transpression and subsequent D 3 ductile wrenching that extended into the Lower Permian during a transitional stage between the Variscan and Cimmerian cycles...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> canyon, northwestern Mediterranean Sea, {{belongs to}} a complex network of {{submarine}} canyons cutting the western Gulf of Lion continental shelf and opening into the larger Sète canyon. Swath bathymetry data, MAK- 1 M deep-towed side-scan sonar imagery and 5 kHz high resolution seismic reflection profiles show striking morphologies in the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> canyon floor and walls. As {{a consequence of the}} canyon head and the upper reach severe incision, the continental shelf dramatically narrows in front of the Creus Cape promontory. The upper canyon has a flat-bottomed thalweg incised in a mega-scale sediment furrow field displaying hyperbolic seismic facies. The tens of kilometres long linear furrows extend also over the middle canyon down to 1400 m of water depth. The furrows {{on either side of the}} canyon are not parallel but oblique and display varying degrees of excavation. Mid-channel sediment bars are locally present in the thalweg, which is made of sandy lag deposits, as revealed by its acoustic response and verified by sediment samples. The middle canyon is linear and steep, with an up to 700 m high southern wall, contrasting with the sinuous, smooth lower canyon, which is controlled by flowage of the underlying Messinian evaporites. Large sections of the canyon are affected by sediment instability processes. The lower <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> canyon hangs up to 260 m over its distalmost reach and the Sète canyon through a narrow, less than 1 km wide, gorge. Numerous scours up to 10 m deep suggesting bed load transport occupy the lower Sète canyon immediately downstream of the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> canyon mouth. The data set provides the first complete very-high resolution imaging of a submarine canyon from its upper part down to its distalmost reach. The observations evidence a wide set of erosion, transport and deposition processes along the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> canyon, including sediment entrapment at the canyon head, furrow-generating dense water cascading through the southern wall, along-channel currents strong enough to excavate specific sections of the channel floor and bed load sediment transport as demonstrated by the presence of mega-ripples, crescent scours and grooves in the lower canyon...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> {{peninsula}} in NE Spain {{consists of}} greenschist- to amphibolite-facies metasediments and granitoid {{bodies of the}} Variscan Axial Zone of the Pyrenees, overprinted in the north by anastomosed greenschist-facies shear zones. Current tectonic interpretations ascribe these shear zones to the waning stages of the Variscan orogeny. We present muscovite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data from the shear zones, yielding Middle Jurassic ages between 159. 33 [*]±[*] 0. 43 and 175. 18 [*]±[*] 1. 10  Ma and one Tertiary age of 58. 57 [*]±[*] 0. 55  Ma. We suggest that the present-day structure at <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> resulted from Variscan deformation and HT–LP metamorphism, followed during the Jurassic by crustal stretching and development of ductile normal faults reflecting pre-drift continental extension related to opening of the Piemonte–Ligurian basin east of Iberia. Tilting during Alpine convergence caused steepening {{in the northern part}} of the penisula, with the ductile normal faults rotated to their present orientations appearing as dextral reverse shear zones. The shear zone yielding a Tertiary age could reflect either an Alpine structure or reactivation of an earlier, presumably Jurassic shear zone. The <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> structure may thus represent a continental margin that has undergone ductile stretching equivalent to the now-buried west Iberian or Newfoundland margin...|$|R

40|$|Intrusive rocks may be {{arranged}} {{in the form}} of strings of lenses or beads, as found on the <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> Peninsula, NE Spain, and in the South Finland Migmatite-Granite Belt. These structures first appear {{to be the result of}} stretching and boudinage of intrusive sheets or dykes. However, closer examination reveals that they are not boudins, but are instead primary intrusive structures. A detailed study was performed on a swarm of pegmatite intrusions at <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus.</b> Layering is often continuous between beads, and, in some cases, individual beads exhibit a very irregular shape. These observations are shown to be incompatible with an origin by boudinage. Analogue experiments were used to test the effect of the two models (boudinage and emplacement) on the structures around beads, and show that an emplacement model of local expansion and collapse of magmatic sheets is the most compatible with field observations. Such structures can only form when dykes intrude hot rocks, when magma solidifies slowly enough to allow enough ductile flow of the wall rock to accommodate the formation of the beads. The fact that the pegmatite bead strings are not boudins has repercussions for the interpretation of the deformation at <b>Cap</b> de <b>Creus</b> and necessitates caution in the interpretation of deformation based on apparent boudins in intrusive rocks in other areas. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
