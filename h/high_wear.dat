25|$|The Union-Garratt did {{not enjoy}} {{the success of the}} {{standard}} Garratt. It was soon evident that mechanical stokers could function perfectly across the connection between a Garratt's boiler and engine unit, making the rationale for the Union-Garratt obsolete. The Union-Garratts' extended boiler frames and the position of the bunker and hind water tank upon those frames meant that they suffered from many of the problems which beset the Mallet design; the SAR U and GH classes had much heavier axle-loadings than Garratts of comparable size, weight and power, and the movement of water at the extreme ends of the long main frames generated <b>high</b> <b>wear</b> on the hind pivot between the boiler and engine unit. The Union-Garratt, like the Golwe and Modified Fairlie, was not perpetuated on anything like the scale of the Garratt, and no known examples survive.|$|E

This <b>higher</b> <b>wear</b> rate in water has been observed with the AFM, Hysitron Triboindenter, and additionally in single pass scratch tests performed with the Taber Shear/Scratch tester. These tests were preformed using silicon nitride cantilevers in the AFM and a diamond tip in Hysitron and in the Taber instrument. Tests performed in the ambient atmosphere resulted in slightly reduced surface roughness, while much <b>higher</b> <b>wear</b> rate was observed in water. Ambient scratch tests consistently produced slightly shallower scratch trenches than wet scratches {{as a function of}} increasing normal load. Single scan lines provide valuable information about the mechanisms and progression of the nanoscale wear.

Tribo-oxide layer possessing protective effect generated at 200 ℃ for H 13 steel, but appeared at 400 ℃ for H 21 steel with obviously lower amount than that of H 13 steel due to relatively high alloy contents. <b>Higher</b> <b>wear</b> resistance of H 21 steel is attributed to the undissolved carbides and high thermal strength...|$|R

40|$|Friction and dry wear {{behaviour}} {{of glass}} fibre reinforced epoxy (GFRE) and glass fibre reinforced polyester (GFRP) composites are {{studied in the}} current project. Three sliding orientations of fibre {{with respect to the}} sliding distance are considered in the investigation, i. e. parallel orientation (P-O), anti-parallel orientation (AP-O), and normal orientation (N-O). On the other hand, different sliding distances (0 - 15) km are accounted. The adhesive wear experiments were carried out using block-onring(BOR) configuration at room temperature, applied load of (30 N), and sliding velocity of (2. 8 m/s). Interface temperature and frictional force were captured and recorded during the sliding. Worn surfaces were examined by using (SEM) to classify the damage. The results revealed that the <b>highest</b> <b>wear</b> rate is taken place in (AP-O) of GFRE. (P-O) is the <b>highest</b> <b>wear</b> rate of GFRP. On the other hand, the lowest wear rate is exhibited for (N-O) at longer sliding distance. The maximum friction coefficient is observed when sliding take place in (N-O and P-O) at higher speed level. Although, (AP-O) shows 0. 25 which is the lowest friction coefficient value than other orientations. (P-O) orientation of GFRP gave <b>higher</b> <b>wear</b> rate at maximum speed test in comparing to normal orientation. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} aimed to {{investigate}} microstructure and wear performance of combine wire arc sprayed Zn-Al 12 Si coating {{compared to those}} of Zn and Al 12 Si coatings sprayed by ordinary twin wire arc spray. Coating characterization including microstructural characterization by optical microscope, porosity evaluation by image analysis, Vickers microhardness measurment and wear test by dry sand rubber wheel abrasion tester were carried out in this work. It was found that combine Zn-Al 12 Si coating had higher hardness with slightly <b>higher</b> <b>wear</b> resistance than Zn coating. The Al 12 Si coating had <b>highest</b> hardness and <b>wear</b> resistance above all coatings. This suggested that improved hardness of Zn coating could be obtained by adding Al 12 Si into Zn coating to gain <b>higher</b> <b>wear</b> resistance. However, corrosion resistance needs to be further studied to evaluate full advantage of combine wire arc sprayed Zn-Al 12 Si coating for both wear and corrosion applications...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This in situ study {{evaluated}} the protective effect of green tea on dentin erosion (ERO) and erosion-abrasion (ABR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten volunteers wore intraoral palatal appliances with bovine dentin specimens subjected to ERO or ERO + toothbrushing abrasion performed immediately (ERO+I-ABR) or 30 min after erosion (ERO+ 30 -min-ABR). During 2 experimental 5 -day crossover phases, the volunteers rinsed with green tea or water (control, 1 min) between each erosive (5 min, cola drink) and abrasive challenge (30 s, toothbrushing), 4 x/day. Dentin wear {{was measured by}} profilometry. RESULTS: The green tea reduced the dentin wear significantly for all conditions compared to control. ERO+I-ABR led to significantly <b>higher</b> <b>wear</b> than ERO, {{but it was not}} significantly different from ERO+ 30 -min-ABR.
