50|$|Technology changes. We are {{now able}} to color these comics with an {{infinite}} palette, and to reproduce the artists' linework much more clearly. If these new computer generated color techniques had been available in the 1950s, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Bill</b> Gaines would have used it because it makes the EC work even more beautiful. So the EC material has been printed three different ways: with the old color, as originally published back in the 1950s, without any color, as it was drawn by the EC artists (the EC Library), and with the best color we can do with modern technology (the EC Archives). It has been my experience that the most dedicated EC fans are not satisfied to have them reprinted only one, or two, ways. They want them all. Those fans will have the old comics in the EC Annuals, the black and white art in the EC Library, and the best color we can produce in the EC Archives. There's room there for everyone.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the {{recording}} of Never Say Die! the members of Black Sabbath were all heavily involved in drug and alcohol abuse. Prior to recording, vocalist Osbourne briefly quit the band and was temporarily replaced by former Savoy Brown and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Dave Walker. In 1992, guitarist Tony Iommi explained to Guitar World, [...] "We never wanted him to leave, and I think he wanted to come back - but no one would tell the other how they felt. So we had to bring in another singer and write all new material." [...] The band wrote a handful of songs with Walker, with that short-lived line-up even performing an early version of what would later become [...] "Junior's Eyes" [...] on the BBC programme Look Hear. Osbourne eventually rejoined the band, refusing to sing any of the songs written with Walker. Iommi elaborated in the 1992 Guitar World piece, ... Bill Ward had to sing on one track ("Swinging The Chain") because Ozzy refused to sing it. We ended up having to write in the day so we could record in the evening, and we never had time to review the tracks and make changes. As a result, the album sounds very confused. [...] The songs with Walker were redone, including [...] "Junior's Eyes", which was rewritten to be about the then-recent death of Osbourne's father. [...] "We had a few internal problems", Osbourne admitted to Sounds magazine at the time. [...] "My father was dying, so that put us out for over three months with the funeral and everything. I left the band for three months before we got back together to record it." [...] However, the writing was on the wall, with Osbourne stating in his memoir I Am Ozzy, [...] "No one really talked about what had happened. I just turned up in the studio one day - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Bill</b> had been trying to act as peacemaker on the phone - {{and that was the end}} of it. But it was obvious things had changed, especially between me and Tony. I don't think anyone's heart was in it anymore." ...|$|E

Big as he is, I have carried him eighty-one miles between nightfall and sunrise on the scout; and I am good for fifty, {{day in and}} day out, and all the time.

He is Chief of Scouts to the Army of the Frontier, and it makes us very important. In such a position as I hold in the military service one needs to be of good family and possess an education much above the common to be worthy of the place.

40|$|When {{we compare}} stress {{patterns}} of sentence-final adverbials in related Germanic languages like English and Dutch, we observe a striking difference. Adverbials like {{yesterday at the}} end of subordinate clauses can be contrastively stressed in English (indicated by the capital letters in (1 a)), while such final stress is entirely impossible in Dutch (1 b) : (1) a. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he saw Bill YESTERDAY b. *Ik denk dat hij Wim zag GISTEREN <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he <b>Bill</b> saw yesterday In Dutch, the adverbial must be unstressed and separated {{from the rest of the}} sentence by a comma intonation (unstressed adverbial in italics), or at least by an intonation as flat as the intonation of the verb: (2) Ik denk dat hij WIM zag, gisteren This pattern (with neutral stress on the direct object) is also possible in English (cf. Cinque (1993) for insightful discussion) : (3) <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he saw BILL, yesterday Dutch differs from English in that it has verb-final (OV) order in subordinate clauses. Why would this make a difference with respect to stress? A possible answer may be suggested by the fact the Dutch adverbial can also be stressed sentence-finally, but only after application of the Verb Second rule that derives the VO order of main clauses: (4) Hij zag Wim GISTEREN he saw Bill yesterday The explanation is simple and straightforward and implicit in the original arguments given for the rule of Verb Second (see Koster (1975)). In Dutch subordinate clauses, adverbials like gisteren ("yesterday") can only be contrastively stressed in positions preceding the finite verb: (5) [...] . dat hij Wim GISTEREN zag that he Bill yesterday sa...|$|R
2500|$|On December 15, 2014, Coburn stalled the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act {{aimed at}} {{stemming}} veteran suicides. [...] The bill {{would require a}} report on successful veteran suicide prevention programs and allow the VA to pay incentives to hire psychiatrists. Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that despite {{his reputation as a}} budget hawk, Coburn should have recognized that the $22 million cost of the bill is worth the lives it would have saved. [...] “It’s a shame that after two decades of service in Washington, Sen. Coburn will always be remembered for this final, misguided attack on veterans nationwide,” he said. “If it takes 90 days for the new Congress to re-pass this bill, the statistics tell us another 1,980 vets will have died by suicide. That should be a heavy burden on the conscience of Sen. Coburn and this Congress.” Speaking out against the legislation, Coburn said “I object, not because I don’t want to save suicides, but because <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> this <b>bill</b> will do the first thing to change what’s happening,” arguing the bill" [...] "throws money and doesn’t solve the real problem" ...|$|R
