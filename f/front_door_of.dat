5|$|A similar {{situation}} arose outside the apartment. A crowd {{gathered by the}} <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> 5A, including next to the children's bedroom window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted the bedroom window's exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> {{the house}} {{that appear to be}} human.

Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house {{in order to get to}} Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E

5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were due}} to be arraigned on May 25. Between 11:30 and midnight on May 24, a group of between a dozen and 40 men arrived at the jail. They entered it through the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the sheriff's office. Payne, the jailer, said he had left it {{unlocked}} to let in a detective from McAlester, who was looking for an escaped prisoner. He said the men bound, gagged and blindfolded him at gunpoint, took his keys, and cut the telephone line. He was unable to identify them.|$|E
5|$|On October 22, Schlesselman and Cowart {{shot at a}} {{glass window}} on the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the Allen Baptist Church in Brownsville, Tennessee. The two men bragged to a female friend about the shooting; the friend told her mother, who {{notified}} the Haywood County Sheriff's Department. Investigators traced the shell casings to Schlesselman and Cowart, and notified the Crockett County Sheriff's Department, who took the pair into custody after spotting the Swastikas, slurs and 88 and 14 numbers on their car.|$|E

5|$|Somehow King {{walked in}} the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the jail {{and a few minutes}} later out the back. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} noise of explosions, the on-duty U.S. {{technicians}} rushed out the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> their operations building where they were met by North Vietnamese gunfire. Blanton, the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other U.S. technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to {{the west side of}} the mountain, where they hid on the edge of the cliff. From their hideout, the U.S. technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M-16 rifles and hand grenades. At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the U.S. technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting. Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.|$|E
5|$|The Everett Station complex also {{includes}} a bus station with 26 bus bays that serve as a major transfer station for routes from Snohomish County. Everett Transit operates {{the majority of its}} bus routes out of their 12 bus bays on Smith Avenue. Community Transit has six routes at the station, serving as the terminus for local service from Smokey Point, Marysville, Snohomish, Lake Stevens, and Monroe; CT also debuted their Swift bus rapid transit service in 2009, with Everett Station as the northern terminus of the route along the Highway 99 corridor to Shoreline. Sound Transit runs three of its ST Express bus routes out of Everett Station, with peak-only, limited-stop service to Seattle and Bellevue, as well as all-day service to Seattle via Lynnwood Transit Center, along Interstate 5 and Interstate 405. Skagit Transit runs a weekday inter-county express route (Route 90X) from the station to the Skagit Transportation Center in Mount Vernon and Chuckanut Park & Ride in Burlington; Island Transit also runs a peak-only weekday express route (Route 412C) from Everett Station to Stanwood and Camano Island.

5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by {{one of the men who}} pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E
