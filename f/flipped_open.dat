25|$|After his {{hospitalization}} Barkhorn {{was invited}} by Adolf Galland {{to join the}} elite Jagdverband 44 (JV44—44th Fighter Detachment) flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet-fighter. He found flying the Me 262 over the western front difficult {{and he did not}} score any victories in it. On 21 April 1945, he flew his 1,104th and last mission. One of the engines of his aircraft flamed out as he was approaching an enemy bomber formation and he was forced to make an emergency landing. As he approached the airfield, his jet was attacked by several prowling North American P-51 Mustang fighters. Barkhorn managed to land his burning plane though he received a slight wound {{as a result of this}} action when the cockpit canopy — which on the Me 262A, <b>flipped</b> <b>open</b> to starboard, like a Bf 109's did — prior to crash landing, slammed shut on his neck. Taken prisoner by the Western Allies while still in hospital, he was released from Allied captivity in September 1945.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{had first}} {{performed}} [...] "Vogue" [...] at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, {{where she and}} her dancers were clad in 18th century-inspired fashions, inspired by Marie Antoinette. Madonna re-created an 18th-century French court, with sexual innuendo in the performance. At one point the singer <b>flipped</b> <b>open</b> her large skirt, allowing one of her dancers to crawl inside and come out through the other side. Her dancer Carlton Wilborn explained that [...] " [...] level of production had never been done on MTV. The costumes, the fans, the drama... MTV just had no idea, we just came out and rocked." [...] O'Brien described the performance as a [...] "moment of inspired brilliance", while Taraborrelli noted it as a [...] "classic, camp show that elevated the standards of future performances on that program". It was later ranked by Billboard as the sixth best performance {{in the history of the}} award show.|$|E
2500|$|... "Every time Prescott {{opens his}} mouth, it's like someone has <b>flipped</b> <b>open</b> {{his head and}} stuck in an egg whisk." [...] An oft-quoted but unverified story in Jeremy Paxman's The Political Animal is that, before being {{accepted}} as transcribers to the Parliamentary record Hansard, applicants must listen to one of Prescott's speeches and write down what they think {{he was trying to}} say. However Liz Davies wrote that on the Labour National Executive Committee Prescott [...] "spoke in clear, concise sentences and his point was always understandable. Contrary to his television and parliamentary image, he appears to choose his words with care." ...|$|E

50|$|There {{was also}} a dash of {{theatrical}} whimsy to Candela's design. The elevator {{that leads to the}} grand penthouse has a panel in the Mahogany wood interior that <b>flips</b> <b>open</b> to reveal {{the front door of the}} penthouse. The access to the other apartments is through a standard elevator door.|$|R

5000|$|Freestyle phone {{throwing}} is {{an event}} held in which contestants enter a mat that is around 1" [...] thick to soften the impact in case a phone is dropped. Players begin performing a series of tricks that include various flips, spins, high throws, etc. If one drops one's mobile phone, {{he or she is}} automatically out, and judges take his score from that point. One minute is given for a total [...] "run time", and after the minute is up, if one has not dropped one's phone, he or she gets a score from 1 to 100. Phone classes include standard phones, which are free, to $50 phones with either no moving device such as slide or <b>flip</b> <b>open,</b> or with the standard <b>flip</b> <b>open</b> style. Second class is the [...] "Advanced" [...] class, which includes phones with full keyboards, slide movement devices, side-kick flip devices, or touch screens. This class is {{based on the fact that}} if the phone is dropped, there is more of a consequence since the phones are so elaborate and/or expensive.|$|R
50|$|Throughout Star Trek: Enterprise and TOS, on-ship {{communication}} is achieved via communicator panels on desks and walls, and sometimes {{through the use}} of videophones. While on away missions, the crew carried hand-held communicators that <b>flip</b> <b>open.</b> The top section contains a transceiver antenna and the bottom contains user controls, a speaker and a microphone. The device was designed and built by Wah Chang, who also built many of the other props used in the series.|$|R
50|$|IBPDMS {{emerged as}} the RIM-7H, which was {{essentially}} the RIM-7A with the mid-mounted wings modified {{to be able to}} fold. This was done in a fashion similar to carrier-based aircraft; the wings were hinged at a point about 50% along the span, with the outer portions rotated back toward the body of the missile. This allowed them to be stored in tighter container tubes in the new Mark 29 launcher, and <b>flip</b> <b>open</b> automatically when they were released from the tube.|$|R
50|$|A flip or {{clamshell}} phone {{consists of}} two or more sections that are connected by hinges, allowing the phone to flip open then fold closed in order to become more compact. When <b>flipped</b> <b>open,</b> the phone's speaker and microphone are placed closer to the operator's ear and mouth, improving usability. When flipped shut, the phone becomes much smaller and more portable than when it is opened for use.|$|E

The book that Bemis was reading in the vault and that <b>flips</b> <b>open</b> when the bomb explodes is A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus by Washington Irving.|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{increasing}} number of notes and varieties of notes, many cash drawers are designed to store notes upright & facing forward, instead of the traditional flat & facing upright position. This enables faster access to each note and allows more varieties of notes to be stored. Sometimes the cashier will even divide the notes without any physical divider at all. Some cash drawers are flip top in design, where they <b>flip</b> <b>open</b> instead of sliding out like an ordinary drawer, resembling a cashbox instead.|$|R

50|$|The term {{trapdoor}} also {{refers to}} a plate in the entry vestibule of a passenger railcar that permits access to high-level platforms when lying flat against {{the floor of the}} car, and which can be <b>flipped</b> <b>open</b> to expose steps for accessing ground-level platforms. Many American commuter railroads which operate the Comet railcars made by Bombardier have trapdoors to accommodate passengers boarding and alighting on both high-level and ground-level platforms. Amtrak's Viewliner, Amfleet, and Horizon railcar fleets all have trapdoors.|$|E
50|$|On 22 January 2005, a {{pneumatic}} load tyre suddenly {{burst and}} caused two women passengers to be injured.

The burst tyre caused a rubber sidewall panel to <b>flip</b> <b>open</b> which then hit the side of a passenger seat and injured a woman's legs and another woman's hands. Train services were suspended for about 30 minutes following the incident.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{increasing}} amount of notes and varieties of notes, many cash drawers have opted to store notes in a vertical side facing position instead of the traditional horizontal upward facing position. This enables faster access to each note and allows more varieties of notes to be stored. Sometimes the cashier will even divide the notes without any physical divider at all. Some cash drawers are also flip top in design, where they <b>flip</b> <b>open</b> instead of sliding out like an ordinary drawer, resembling a cashbox instead.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{illustration}} of this distinction {{is to compare}} an ancient scroll (sequential; all material prior to the data needed must be unrolled) and the book (direct: can be immediately <b>flipped</b> <b>open</b> to any arbitrary page).

50|$|A {{braille watch}} is a {{portable}} timepiece {{used by the}} {{blind or visually impaired}} to tell time. It is used by touching the dial and noticing the embossments. Both analog and digital versions are available. The analog versions have a protective glass or crystal cover that is <b>flipped</b> <b>open</b> when time needs to be read and the clock-hands are constructed to not be susceptible to movement at the mere touch of the finger that a blind person uses to observe their positions. In the digital form, the dots (like braille script) keep changing position as time changes. In this case, one must understand the Braille alphabet to read the watch.|$|E
50|$|The {{complete}} camera top, hinged at the front, is a flush {{cover with}} no protruding controls. When <b>flipped</b> <b>open,</b> it reveals the waist-level finder. On {{the right-hand side}} is the single-stroke wind-on lever with the manual reset frame counter on top, and next to it the remote-release-threaded shutter button. On the left-hand side is the rewind knob with a film reminder on top. When the top lid is fully opened, the large square magnifier swings up over the focusing screen. An action finder is also incorporated into the top cover. At the base are the ¼ inch tripod socket, the A/R (advance/rewind) switch, and a release button for the removable back.|$|E
