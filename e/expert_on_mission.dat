40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Missiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. It was {{the aim of}} this {{research}} to investigate Hugo du Plessis' contribution to the GKSA' struggle for a relevant mission and missiology. It became apparent {{in the course of the}} research that Du Plessis contributed in a meaningful way towards the Reformed paradigm for a relevant mission and missiology. In the Dopper churches. Hugo had a great reputation, which is fully justified. He was the first Dopper missionary who stayed in a mission field for a considerable period and who, as a result, could show a church that endured after years. Many people admired him as "our missionary, the <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> <b>mission</b> and on the language and cultural anthropology of the black peoples". Mission-minded Doppers were not critical of him at all. On the other hand, in those years mission and intensive contact with black people on a spiritual level were still relative novelties to the average Dopper mind. There were those who did not trust any missionary, because they suspected him of undermining "their Apartheid policy". Between these two extremes, there was a majority who were neither enthusiastic nor hostile towards mission. This picture only changed radically when Dr Jan Schutte succeeded in bringing Prof J H Bavinck to Potchefstroom for a year. Knowing how much suspicion he might create, Hugo was very careful not to offend the Afrikaners. One should understand this attitude, since suspicion against him of being a "liberalist" might slow down the flow of funds for mission and eventually force him to leave the mission field. At that time the very fact that one was a missionary was sufficient to mark one as "eccentric" in some circles. So if one finds traces of racism and support of "Apartheid" in the life and works of du Plessis, one should keep in mind that he was a child of his times, even though he was ahead of most of his compatriots in his views. The very fact that he and his wife were willing to endure the hardships of a mission field at that time speaks of his dedication. However, it seems he was a far greater success as a theologian than as a missionary. Doctora...|$|E

5000|$|It {{would also}} have been during this time that Rollestone’s notoriety as a well-heeled Presbyterian would have {{caught the eye of}} Dr. Robert E.

He was an <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> <b>missions</b> {{worldwide}} and visited missions in Persia and China where Rollestone’s sister, Lavinia served for thirty years. [...] Both were men of faith and attuned to the Presbyterian’s key work in education abroad. Dr. Speer persuaded Rollestone to pay a princely sum to underwrite the cost of Alborz College’s central campus building. There is no evidence that Mr. Rollestone ever visited Persia or even met the visionary President of Alborz College, Presbyterian missionary Dr. Samuel M. Jordan.|$|R
40|$|As {{a growing}} number of stories unravelled the {{involvement}} of United Nations peacekeepers in human trafficking and sexual exploitation cases, the United Nations adopted in 2003 and implemented a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual encounters between peacekeepers and local women. This article argues that this policy is flawed for a number of reasons. First, it does not apply to all United Nations-related personnel and thereby fails to target those who are mostly engaged in such activities. Second, it only provides for disciplinary measures, a flaw only partially remedied by the draft convention on the criminal accountability of United Nations officials and <b>experts</b> <b>on</b> <b>mission.</b> Third, it {{does not take into account}} the jurisprudence of international criminal tribunals on sexual offences, for it negates the possibility of consent...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} the Draft Convention on the Criminal Accountability of UN Officials and <b>Experts</b> <b>on</b> <b>Mission</b> as {{drafted by the}} Group of Legal Experts {{at the end of}} 2006. The Draft Convention arose out of a mandate given by the UN Secretary-General to the Group of Legal Experts. The mandate was to determine how to ensure accountability of UN staff and <b>experts</b> <b>on</b> <b>mission</b> with respect to criminal acts committed in peacekeeping operations. The need for examination of such issues arose from the incidences of sexual abuse and exploitation that have been committed by peacekeeping personnel in recent years. Ultimately, ensuring accountability for criminal misconduct by peacekeepers is a question of jurisdiction. The Group's main recommendation is that jurisdictional priority be given to the host state, and this is echoed in the text of the Draft Convention. The Group states the aim of the convention to be the creation of "conditions which make it easier for any applicable immunity to be waived, without prejudice to the rights of the alleged offender". The draft convention "sets out obligations on the part of States parties to take measures to investigate, arrest, prosecute and extradite offenders and to render mutual legal assistance [and] {{to protect the rights of}} victims". Taking into account that this is only a first draft of a potential convention, there are many questions that arise, some of which will be addressed by this paper. Such questions include: What would a convention achieve that other UN rules and regulations would not? What are the strengths and the limitations of the Draft Convention? How can the effectiveness of the Draft Convention in preventing and prosecuting criminal conduct by peacekeepers, in particular sexual abuse and exploitation, be maximised? Will a convention solve the current problem of impunity for peacekeeping criminal misconduct?No Full Tex...|$|R
30|$|For example, Buss (2009) {{shows how}} the {{conceptualisation}} of sexual violence as an ‘instrument of genocide’ in Rwanda renders invisible victims other than Tutsi women, such as women and men of Hutu or Twa 3 ethnicities. In a similar vein, the weapon of war explanation explains sexual violence as an instrument used by armed combatants, causing violence perpetrated by civilians, such as intimate partners (see, for example, Clark et al. 2010; Freedman 2011; Tayler-Smith et al. 2012) to ‘disappear’. Likewise, sexual violence acts committed by UN or African Union (AU) peacekeepers; personnel deployed <b>on</b> UN operations; <b>experts</b> <b>on</b> <b>mission</b> (including military observers); UN volunteers; and contractors, consultants, and police units (see, for example, Burke 2014) become exempted from critical enquiry—let alone sexual violence among humanitarians (see, for example, Norbert 2015 a, b).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the most effective jurisdiction for criminal accountability for UN peacekeeping personnel who engage in sexual exploitation and abuse of women, and other conduct amounting to violence against women. As criminalisation is sought as the appropriate method of prevention and punishment of such conduct, it is first examined why criminalisation is necessary. The impact of sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) on women in the territories in which peace operations are located is detailed as harms {{in the form of}} violations of the rights of these women. Alternatives to criminal sanctions are then considered, in particular the actions of the UN towards prevention and prohibition of SEA. While such regulations are necessary, they are ultimately inadequate in preventing and punishing SEA. Included is an assessment of the Draft Convention on Criminal Accountability of UN Officials and <b>Experts</b> <b>on</b> <b>Mission,</b> the adoption of which would support criminalisation. However, the UN itself is unable to exercise criminal jurisdiction, and thus it is essential to examine which jurisdictions would be most effective in undertaking criminal prosecution of peacekeeping personnel. The choice between national jurisdictions and international criminal justice is debated. Which jurisdiction offers a more effectual forum for ensuring accountability? What potential impediments exist and how can such hindrances can be overcome? This thesis argues that gender-based crimes by UN peacekeepers should be criminalised, and that, while the International Criminal Court should not be discounted as a potential forum for prosecuting perpetrators, domestic prosecutions are far more likely and far more effective...|$|R
40|$|Examining {{bilateral}} donors in particular, this artic/,e discusses {{how these}} agencies {{have tried to}} overcome the prob/,ems associated with TC and why reforms have lagged during the decade since fundamental flaws began emerging clearly. Both TC and the project approach associated with it will probably remain major modes of channeling ODA- simply because no viable alternatives exist in certain recipient countries and for certain activities. Whatever the case, TC can spur capacity if donors {{bear in mind the}} need to: (1) coordinate aid; (2) address conflicts within the donor community explicitly; (3) educate home publics; (4) develop capacity within aid organi-sations; (5) use national execution modalities wherever possible. Technical cooperation (TC) comes in many colours. For some, it is the use of expa-triate <b>experts</b> <b>on</b> long-term <b>missions,</b> working with local counterparts. For others, it is mainly "gap-filling", i. e., the use of foreign expertise for functions for which local capacity is insufficient. For still others, it amounts to capacity development, a prob-lematic term in itself. The OECD-DAC database defines TC as both "grants to nationals of aid recipient countries receiving education or training at home or abroad " and "payment to con...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations Military <b>Experts</b> <b>on</b> <b>Mission</b> (UNMEM) course aims {{to prepare}} Military Officers for service as United Nations' Military Observers, Military Liaison Officers or Military Advisors in any ongoing or future United Nations {{peacekeeping}} operations. This report {{reflects on the}} experiences of UNMEM 2 / 2017 arranged by the Finnish Defence Forces International Centre FINCENT in cooperation with Nordic Defence Cooperation NORDEFCO and the Crisis Management Center Finland between 4 August and 1 September 2017. This was the first UNMEM course ever {{where the majority of}} the participants were female. Therefore, I was invited to conduct an observation analysis of the course looking to answer the question of how the new course composition reflects on learning. In practice, the UNMEM aim is to generally prepare the participant for duties in a peacekeeping operation so that he/she can fulfil the military aspects of UN peacekeeping mandates in accordance with DPKO principles and guidelines, perform his/her duties in an effective, professional and integrated manner and demonstrate the core values and competencies of the United Nations (see: UN Ref. 2016. 25, Annex J, UNSCR 2242 / 2015, UN Ref. 2010. 30, FINCENT 2017). These principles and guidelines were used as the backbone of the observation process. The main observation from UNMEM 2 / 2017 was that the course instructors and students together created a learning environment where all students had the possibility to learn and grow professionally. From the student performance perspective, it is notable that individual team skills as well as proficiency in the English language {{played a major role in}} the overall learning process. In short, the experiences from UNMEM 2 / 2017 strongly suggest that group composition should be 50 % males and 50 % female. Performance and the learning process under the spotlight of the observation In this unstructured observation study, the United Nations Military Observers (UNMO) Skill Set Requirements (UN Ref. 2016. 25, Annex J) were generally reflected in the detectable behaviour and action of the participants both during classroom and outdoor sessions. In addition, the spontaneous and unofficial discussions with the participants and instructors as well as the formal feedback are noted in this report...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} the so called {{knowledge}} industries in the industrialized countries is a trend that has no visible traits in the Third World. The insight {{about the role of}} knowledge and information as important components in policy making has not come to surface. Also other components for the decision making process, such as skilled manpower, equipment, energy and dynamism may be lacking. However, together these components form a complex that can help {{to improve the quality of}} the decision making process. Few of the less developed countries - the LDCs - realize that knowledge and information could transpire out of libraries, information services, specialist groups, research teams or consultants. All these could give information support to decision makers in government and local administration. They could also act as promotors of the use of the new information technology in the decision making process. Instead, it seems as the needs for information prior to decision of ten are supplied by any source whatsoever, except by libraries and information services. Libraries in the LDCs are supposed to support the educational system, and librarians 2 ̆ 7 potentials as part of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s intelligence system are impeded by the ruler 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on other advisers who give him emotional or moral support during his difficult decision making. Librarians and information specialists of ten have low status in the LDCs. The same status label also sticks to the international <b>experts</b> <b>on</b> <b>mission.</b> Their reports and recommendations, endorsed by Unesco, do not sensitize the policy makers in the same way as, for instance, the advice by vendors of hardware or equipment. There seems to be a great communication gap to fill here. That information activities are regarded as a lower type of work calls for reviewing the means of communicating the significance of information services for development. The traditional talk about libraries as providers of scientific and technical information - STI - does not ring a bell in the ruler 2 ̆ 7 s mind. A better concept to use may be to talk about the need for a 2 ̆ 2 social intelligence function 2 ̆ 2, i. e. a capability to tap and analyze the world 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge stores for policy making, and help to establish a function that can improve the quality of policy making, and lead to social development and evolution. The paper deals with the conceptual and organizational aspects of such a new approach by taking into account e. g. scenario writing, new vocabulary, organizational problems and ministerial networks...|$|R
