It is common to attack batsmen who have recently come to the wicket with successive short-pitched balls or bouncers with the dual aim of getting them out and stopping them from settling into an attacking mode of play for as long as possible. Short balls are more risky against batsmen who have settled at the crease since they make easy boundaries, but most bowlers will still mix a few in during a spell, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the batsman guessing.|$|E

Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E

During her time in New Zealand with the Sisters of St Joseph, a school was established in Arrowtown, near Queenstown, South Island. Located in the grounds of St Patrick's Church, the small yellow cottage now known as Mary MacKillop cottage was originally built as a miner's house around 1870. It was bought by the church and incorporated into the church school in 1882 and then in 1897, Sister Mary MacKillop had the cottage and some of the school converted to a convent for the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart who worked in New Zealand and Australia.|$|E

(In this episode however, one of [...] "the Others" [...] tells Jack that his tattoo translates as: [...] "He walks among us, but he is not one of us." [...] Jack replies, [...] "That's what they say, that's not what they mean.") [...] The number 5 can also be seen on Fox's forearm; he got that tattoo while working on Party of Five, along with another cast member. In an interview, Fox said that for him, getting a tattoo was a [...] "pretty intense experience", and something he would not do in the [...] "spur of the moment". He thought Jack having tattoos was a [...] "really cool idea". Since Fox used tattoos to represent memories or meaningful events in his life, the writers took a similar approach when dealing with Jack's tattoos.|$|E

Zenke, writing in June 2007 for online gaming magazine The Escapist, criticized the public for its failure to respond to the rating change, and emphasized what the change would mean to moddable games. At the core of Zenke's article was concern that a developer or publisher could be punished for content they neither produced nor distributed. Echoing Romero's concerns, Zenke saw the rating change as a threat, not only to modders, but to developers as well. Zenke asked what the ESRB would do in response to [...] "Game 3.0" [...] concepts, where community involvement is key. Referring to Sony's LittleBigPlanet, Zenke asked, [...] "Will Sony provide personnel to review every fan-made level for offensive content? Will the ESRB?" ...|$|E
