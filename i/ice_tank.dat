2500|$|The {{development}} of the oblique icebreaker concept began in 1997, when Kværner Masa-Yards Arctic Technology Centre (MARC) established a project to develop new ways of assisting large tankers in ice conditions. Traditionally, escorting large ships up to [...] wide required two conventional icebreakers with a beam of , a practice that was not very efficient and economical. Analysis of Finnish harbour statistics and icebreaker logbooks showed that with a beam of , the icebreaker would be wide enough to provide assistance to most merchant ships in need of towing. The larger ships, fewer in number, could then be assisted with an unconventional method. The result was an asymmetrical, triangle-shaped vessel with three azimuth thrusters in the [...] "corners" [...] pushing the icebreaker with a 50-degree angle of attack— almost sideways— in ice. Model tests in an <b>ice</b> <b>tank</b> showed that the proposed concept was viable and that the resistance of a large cargo ship was considerably reduced in both level ice as well as frozen brash ice when operating behind the oblique icebreaker. The concept has been patented.|$|E

We assume a player, the so-called aggregator which aims to utilize the flexibility in large-scale consumers with thermal energy storage. An aggregator design is proposed to mange the power consump-tion of flexible demands during {{a certain period of}} time. The setup consists of an MPC-like controller to optimally operate the consumption units for upward and downward regulating power provision. To handle the uncertainties arise from model mismatch, a series of feedback loop are also considered along with the central optimization. We formulate the problem for two specific case studies which are supermarket refrigeration systems and chiller systems in conjunction with <b>ice</b> <b>tanks.</b> Simulation results are provided for these specific consumers.

50|$|On 16 April 2013, the Finnish Transport Agency {{awarded the}} {{contract}} {{for the design of}} the new icebreaker to two Finnish engineering companies specializing in the design of icebreaking ships. The vessel would be designed by Aker Arctic Technology Inc in co-operation with ILS Oy. In addition to conceptual design, which included comparing two concept alternatives — a conventional icebreaker with two azimuth thrusters and a new concept with three propulsion units — in terms of performance and cost, the companies would prepare the technical material needed to arrange the tender for the construction of the vessel and assist the Finnish Transport Agency in negotiations with shipyards. Aker Arctic would also carry out model tests in the company's <b>ice</b> <b>tank</b> to verify the performance of the new icebreaker.

50|$|When an {{icebreaker}} is designed, one of {{the main}} goals is to minimize the forces resulting from crushing and breaking the ice, and submerging the broken floes under the vessel. The average value of the longitudinal components of these instantaneous forces is called the ship's ice resistance. Naval architects who design icebreakers use the so-called h-v-curve to determine the icebreaking capability of the vessel. It shows the speed (v) that the ship is able to achieve as a function of ice thickness (h). This is done by calculating the velocity at which the thrust from the propellers equals the combined hydrodynamic and ice resistance of the vessel. An alternative means to determine the icebreaking capability of a vessel in different ice conditions such as pressure ridges is to perform model tests in an <b>ice</b> <b>tank.</b> Regardless of the method, the actual performance of new icebreakers is verified in full scale ice trials once the ship has been built.|$|E

Even the electricity peak due to the air conditioning is often {{at the same time}} with the industry trade peak, which worsen creates the peak electric power resources shortage, and the electricity difference between on-peak hours and off-peak hours is becoming larger. The ice-storage air conditioning system, as a powerful technology of balancing electric loads from on-peak hours, has the great significance to the electric network. The dynamic ice cold storage technique is the important research direction of the ice storage air conditioning system, In order to obtain guidelines for engineering applications, experiments were conducted using the dynamic ice cold storage air conditioning system developed by Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion,and the paper mainly focused on the following aspects; 1) The influences of different initial cool thermal storage rate, different cooling load of end-users, different discharge water flow rate and different ice-melting velocity on the discharging characteristics were analyzed in detail, the results show that the ice-melting velocity {{plays an important role in}} discharging characteristics, and initial cool thermal storage rate, discharge water flow rate and cooling load of end-users have little effect on the discharging characteristics. 2) In order to get the optimum pipeline designs in <b>ice</b> storage <b>tank</b> during the <b>ice</b> charging process, several ice-melting experiments were conducted. The results show that there exists an optimum pipeline arrangement in the discharging process considering ice discharging efficiency, and the output water of the <b>ice</b> storage <b>tank</b> has little effect on the velocity of ice-melting. 3) The influence on the discharging efficiency of the velocity field in the <b>ice</b> storage <b>tank</b> produced by the input water and output water was analyzed.
