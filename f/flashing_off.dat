Walking over a high table-land of stubbles, which would be grass in England; and yet with all its tillage is perhaps not worth more than English grass would be, thanks to that small-farm system much be-praised by some who know not wheat from turnips.

50|$|PIR sensors {{may be used}} {{to control}} {{lighting}} in such areas. They avoid the need to press a push-button but otherwise operate as for electronic timers. As PIR sensors are not perfectly reliable a timer is needed to avoid the lights <b>flashing</b> <b>off</b> and on as the occupier moves out of detector range. The timer interval is short though compared to a push-button timer; it times the interval between sightings of the occupier, not the time of occupancy.|$|E
5000|$|An {{occulting}} light is a rhythmic light {{in which the}} duration of light in each period is longer than the total duration of darkness. In other words, it is the opposite to a flashing light where the total duration of darkness is longer than the duration of light. It has the appearance of <b>flashing</b> <b>off,</b> rather than flashing on. Like a flashing light, {{it can be used}} for a single {{occulting light}} that exhibits only a single period of darkness or the periods of darkness can be grouped and repeated at regular intervals (abbreviated [...] "Oc"), a group (Oc (3)) or a composite group (Oc (2+1)).|$|E

50|$|In the 1940s Mitchell and Godbolt started {{performing}} at local clubs {{and on the}} burlesque circuit calling themselves the Slyde Brothers. This in turn caused Godbolt to be renamed forevermore, Jimmy “Slyde.” Their acts included action tricks similar to those the Nicholas Brothers performed; however, they used slides as their trademark move. One dance critic, Sally Sommer, explained his slides as such, “He’s upstage left and sliding downstage right as fast and smooth as a skier, arms held out to the side, head tilted. He stops the cascade by banking backward, slips into a fast flurry of taps, working quick and low {{to the floor and}} ends the phrase by pulling up high and <b>flashing</b> <b>off</b> a triple turn.” The act was such a hit, they received invitations to go on the road to perform with big band names of the time, including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Barry Harris. Their tapping was part of the bands’ songs where they would create the music for many measures and then the band would come back in, and they would trade off back and forth like that the entire act.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Energy Conversion and Management and the definitive published version is available at [URL] carbonisation (HTC) has the capability to convert wet biomass such as sewage sludge to a lignite-like renewable solid fuel of high calorific value. However, to date assessment of the energy efficiency of the HTC process has not been fully investigated. In this work, mass and energy balances of semi-continuous HTC of faecal waste conducted at 200 °C and at a reaction time of 30 min are presented. This analysis is based on recovering steam from the process as well as energy from the solid fuel (hydrochar) and methane from digestion of the liquid product. The effect of the feedstock solids content and the quantity of feed on the mass and energy balance were investigated. The heat of reaction was measured at 200 °C for 4 h using wet faecal sludge, and the higher heating value was determined for the hydrochar. The results indicated that preheating the feed to 100 °C using heat recovered from the process would significantly reduce the energy input to the reactor by about 59 %, and decreased the heat loss from the reactor by between 50 % and 60 %. For feedstocks containing 15 – 25 % solids (for all feed rates), after the process is in operation, energy recycled from the <b>flashing</b> <b>off</b> of steam and combustion of the hydrochar and would be sufficient for preheating the feed, operating the reactor and drying the wet hydrochar {{without the need for}} any external sources of energy. Alternatively, for a feedstock containing 25 % solids for all feed rates, energy recycled from the <b>flashing</b> <b>off</b> of steam and combustion of the methane provides sufficient energy to operate the entire process with an excess energy of about 19 – 21 % which could be used for other purposes...|$|E

40|$|Amines {{are used}} in {{refineries}} and gas plants {{around the world to}} remove both H 2 S and CO 2 from feed gas. The corrosion in amine plants is not caused by the amine itself, but is caused by the hydrogen sulphide, CO 2 and by amine degradation products. Amines are compounds formed by replacing hydrogen atoms of ammonia, NH 3 by organic radicals. Problems with amine units can be corrosion or by cracking (sulphide stress cracking, hydrogen induced cracking associated with hydrogen blistering, stress-orientated hydrogen induced cracking, and alkaline stress corrosion cracking). Areas to have a close look at is where impingement erosion could occur, where there is elevated temperatures, where <b>flashing</b> <b>off</b> of CO 2 could occur, and where heat stable salts could cause scaling. Carbon steel and stainless steel are suitable for most applications, with the choice of material being determined by the susceptibility to the damage modes in each location. Careful consideration should also be given to the repair of plant (controlling weldment hardness...|$|E

50|$|Canon's {{external}} flashes with model {{numbers in}} the 400 range tend to be their mid-range external flashes. They all tend {{to have the ability}} to adjust the direction of the flash via a swivel head, which allows the photographer to bounce the <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> walls, ceilings, and other objects, diffusing the light that hits the subject and reducing the harsh shadows associated with on-camera flash. The 400 series differs from the higher end 500 series mostly by lacking a remote controller.|$|R

50|$|The Gulf linear alpha olefin {{process is}} {{commonly}} called a catalytic Ziegler process.

The reaction is conducted at high pressure and high temperature. Excess ethylene is <b>flashed</b> <b>off.</b> The tri-ethyl aluminium catalyst is washed out of the product with caustic and the linear alpha olefins are separated. The product distribution is a Schultz-Flory distribution typical of catalytic processes.|$|R
50|$|The current {{light was}} built in 1977, {{although}} the lighthouse station was established 1855. The light sits atop a 9.5 m tall concrete post and emits its light 22 m above sea level. The white, red, or green light (depending on direction) is an occulting light which <b>flashes</b> <b>off</b> once every 6 seconds at an intensity of 4,500 candela. The lighthouse is painted white and the lantern roof is painted red. The present light is located adjacent to the old lighthouse. The site is open to visitors, but the tower is closed.|$|R
5000|$|More natural looking {{single flash}} {{results can be}} {{obtained}} by raising the flash vertically to create a more natural downward angle, but keeping it centered. This is usually preferable when photographing people because it hides most of the shadows, especially the very distracting nose shadow. In this case the shadow is mostly hidden down below the nose and not noticed. The reason for not moving a single <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> axis sideways rather than vertically is that any shadows the flash creates will be unfilled, dark and potentially unflattering if poorly placed on a subject's face.|$|R
50|$|The boiler Drum was a {{pressurised}} {{high tensile}} steel chamber where the water boiled into steam. The water here was pressurised to 170 bar and heated further to 360 °C. On {{the bottom of each}} Drum were six large bore pipes known as Downcomers. These directed the water into the boiler water pipes where it was heated by the furnace. The water was then directed back into the Drum where it <b>flashed</b> <b>off</b> into saturated steam. The steam was then further heated by passing through Primary and Secondary Superheaters until it reached 565 °C. The superheated steam was then piped to the unit turbine.|$|R
50|$|Large ships usually carry {{evaporating}} {{plants to}} produce fresh water, thus reducing their reliance on shore-based supplies. Steam ships {{must be able}} to produce high-quality distillate in order to maintain boiler-water levels. Diesel-engined ships often utilise waste heat as an energy source for producing fresh water. In this system, the engine-cooling water is passed through a heat exchanger, where it is cooled by concentrated seawater (brine). Because the cooling water (which is chemically treated fresh water) is at a temperature of 70 - 80 C, it would not be possible to <b>flash</b> <b>off</b> any water vapour unless the pressure in the heat exhanger vessel was dropped.|$|R
