30|$|Simulation {{analysis}} of rider-car door collision {{in the paper}} is carried out to simulate the accidents that the rider hit the door at 40  km/h with the door on different opening angles (60 °, 70 °). The processing of the model is as follows: {{six degrees of freedom}} of hinge mounting point are constrained; the rotational degree of freedom between two parts of door hinges is released, the initial speed of adult head dummy is 40  km/h, surface-to-surface contact is set between the head dummy and the <b>interior</b> <b>trimming</b> panel. After completing the pre-processing of the finite element model, the finite element model of rider-car door collision is exported as a K file, which is submitted to LS-DYNA solver for calculation. Through the post processing software HyperGraph, the curve and the data are processed, and the result of damage value is obtained.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rigid walled car cabin model {{to predict the}} acoustic effects of vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials. The car cavity is made of a rigid walled enclosure system with one flexible wall on the front firewall position, where the <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials are applied to the inner surface of the front firewall to modify the coupling between the flexible wall and the cabin air cavity. The car cabin is acoustically excited by using a single point source positioned at {{one corner of the}} inner air cavity to imitate the airborne noise. The propagated noise is measured by using pressure microphones at different locations inside the car cabin: one near the driver&# 039;s ear position and another one near the passenger&# 039;s ear position. An acoustic FE (Finite Element) model is also developed to investigate and predict the effects of <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials on the car cabin noise level. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the experimentally acquired acoustic effects of the <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials. The predicted acoustic response results show that the simulation agrees well with the experiment data, both with and without the <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials. The noise propagating inside the car cabin is reduced by a similar ratio in both the experimental method and in the numerical analysis. The selected <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials are starting to absorb noise at frequencies above 500 Hz, but they do not reduce the low-frequency noise effectively...|$|R
