2500|$|On October 30, 2017, former Trump {{campaign}} chairman Paul Manafort {{surrendered to the}} FBI after being indicted on multiple charges. His business associate Rick Gates was also indicted and surrendered to the FBI. The pair were indicted on one count of conspiracy against the United States, one count of conspiracy to launder money, one count of being an unregistered agent of a <b>foreign</b> <b>principal,</b> one count of making false and misleading FARA statements, and one count of making false statements. Manafort was charged with four counts of failing to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts while Gates was charged with three. All charges arise from their consulting work for a pro-Russian government in Ukraine and are unrelated to the campaign. According to The New York Times, {{it is widely believed}} that the charges against Manafort are intended to pressure him into becoming a cooperating witness about Russian interference in the 2016 election.|$|E

While failing to do so in 1972, in May 1981, the U.S. Department of Justice won a court case forcing the committee to register with the IRA as its <b>foreign</b> <b>principal,</b> but the committee was allowed to include a written disclaimer against the court ruling.|$|E
40|$|There exist legal {{channels}} for informational lobbying of U. S. policymakers by <b>foreign</b> <b>principals.</b> <b>Foreign</b> governments {{and private sector}} principals frequently and intensively use this institutional channel to lobby on trade and tourism issues. The authors empirically study whether such lobbying effectively achieves its goal of trade promotion {{in the context of}} Caribbean tourism and it is the first paper to examine the potential for using foreign lobbying as a vehicle for development. They use panel data to explore and quantify the association between foreign lobbying by Caribbean principals and U. S. tourist arrivals to Caribbean destinations. A variety of sensitivity analyses support the finding of a strong association. The policy implications are obvious and potentially important for developing countries.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{demographic}} {{features of the}} articles published in South Asian orthodontic journals in the last 6 years. Materials and Methods: All the orthodontic journals published from or representing South Asian countries from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed {{for the number of}} issues published, number of articles, number of authors, country affiliation of principal author, and international collaboration in authorship. Further, article type was classified and number of citations was noted. Descriptive statistics was used to characterize the various features of the published articles. Results: A total of 825 articles were found in five orthodontic journals published from or representing South Asian region with the number authors per article ranging up to 10. International collaboration in authorship varied from 0. 98 % to 12. 75 % of articles among those journals. For all journals, principal authors of most of the articles originated from the country of publishing journal. Cross-sectional study overnumbered other types of researches. However, systematic reviews and meta-analysis which are considered as the highest form of evidence were very scant in these journals. Conclusions: International collaboration in authorship and <b>foreign</b> <b>principal</b> investigator was found minimum. Greater percentage of publications were cross-sectional studies with few randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews/meta-analysis in the last 6 years...|$|E

40|$|The Automated Export System (AES) is an {{electronic}} export information gathering and processing system developed through cooperative efforts of U. S. Customs and Border Protection, the U. S. Census Bureau, {{other federal agencies}} and the export community. The AES is used to collect export information electronically from participants approved to use the system. Q: Who can file in the AES? A: U. S. Principal Party in Interest (USPPI), the USPPI’s authorized agent, or the authorized U.

Electronic Export Information (§ 30. 1) Electronic Export Information (EEI) is the export data as filed in the Automated Export System (AES).

However, if any of the data requires amendment, the filer is responsible for making the necessary changes in the AES (§ 30. 9). The EEI has a dual use.

30|$|The final survey (including {{an option}} to {{participate}} in either English or Arabic) was created using Survey Monkey and distributed using a snowball sampling technique. A snowball technique was employed due to a concern regarding access and trust building between local humanitarian workers and a <b>foreign</b> <b>principal</b> investigator (first author) (Cohen and Arieli 2011). The two translation team members (both Palestinian humanitarian workers) were therefore used as distribution actors for survey. Stockton University Institutional Review Board approval was obtained in April 2014. Data were collected between May and November 2014. It {{should be noted that}} the data collection period encompassed a major Israeli military campaign directed at the Gaza Strip (July–August, 2014; “Operation Protective Edge”); with the relatively small number of participants indicating fieldwork in Gaza; however, it was difficult to compare pre- and post-campaign. Eighty-three (83) initial responses were collected; however, after deleting incomplete responses or those that were repeated following an incomplete first attempt, the final sample totaled 45 to 46 participants. Of the completed responses, 29 (63  %) responded to the Arabic instrument, 16 (34.7  %) to the English. Although the target participant audience was initially designed to be local (national) Palestinian workers, it is likely that some international (expatriate) workers may have replied despite recruitment procedures. With the percentage of respondents that chose to answer the survey in Arabic, however, we feel that data reflect largely Palestinian voices.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an empirical study conducted by distributing questionnaires to shipping agents working for <b>foreign</b> <b>principals</b> in Karachi, Pakistan. In Part A of the questionnaire, respondents gave a score reflecting the importance of 13 factors affecting terminal selection. Their responses indicate that service quality, loading/discharging rate and handling charges are the most important selection factors. A linear model is developed in which the dependent variable is total stay (in hours). The independent variables are vessel type, vessel size, total TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), vessel frequency and past visits of the shipping line. All the coefficients are significant. In the second section (that is, Part B of the questionnaire), respondents gave scores reflecting the quality of different attributes and how they affect the attractiveness of four specific container terminals. One-way ANOVA was used to test whether respondents have significant opinion differences. The result indicated that respondents do differ in opinions. Moreover, factor analysis of the aggregate data produced two factors with strong loading of six attributes in one factor and two attributes in the second.
