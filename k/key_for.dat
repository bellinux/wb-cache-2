5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed {{to stay on the}} <b>key</b> <b>for</b> an unlimited amount of time. In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the <b>key</b> <b>for</b> more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E

5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is <b>key</b> <b>for</b> high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

5|$|Consistent {{performances}} in the County Championship helped Somerset remain challengers for the competition until {{the last few weeks}} of the season, but the batting-friendly pitch at their home ground, the County Ground, Taunton, meant that the county finished with too many draws to claim their first Championship title. Consistency was also <b>key</b> <b>for</b> Somerset's success in one-day cricket, where they remained unbeaten in the group stage of the Friends Provident Trophy, but were eliminated in the first knock-out round, and finished runners-up by one point in the NatWest Pro40. In the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset finished as losing finalists. This meant that they qualified for the Champions League Twenty20, where they progressed into the second group stage of the competition. They failed to win any matches in that phase of the competition, resulting in their elimination.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{threw himself}} into the role, {{travelling}} {{around the country and}} inspecting local units to gain an overall idea of their efficiency. Even under favourable circumstances, however, he found that only 54% of the volunteers attended parades in 1906; at the annual camps, the proportion was as low as 45%. He pressed for greater use of active day-time tactical training rather than evening indoors drill, which he felt was <b>key</b> <b>for</b> a part-time volunteer force, and for a greater emphasis on the training and standards of officers. By the end of his second year in office, he had organised local selection boards for appointing officers, and a central promotion board for senior field officers, as well as mandatory regular fitness and efficiency tests.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{simultaneously}} generating multiple independent <b>keys</b> <b>for</b> multiple pairs of users is considered. This problem {{is motivated by}} the fact that typically in wireless networks, multiple pairs of users need to establish secret <b>keys</b> <b>for</b> secure communications between these pairs. We propose a secure routing based key distribution approach to establish <b>keys</b> <b>for</b> the terminals. This approach connects the problem at the hand to that of multi-commodity flow problem studied in graph theory. Using the Max Bi-Flow Min Cut Theorem in the graph theory and developing a matching outer-bound, we show that the proposed approach achieves the <b>key</b> capacity region <b>for</b> the case of establishing two <b>keys.</b> <b>For</b> the general case, in which one needs to establish more than two keys, the achievable sum rate of the proposed approach achieves a constant factor to a derived upper-bound.

5|$|In his {{landmark}} Flora Australiensis, English botanist George Bentham {{published the}} first <b>key</b> <b>for</b> the nine described species of Brachychiton, and relegated {{them to a}} section of Sterculia. Hence the Queensland bottle tree became Sterculia rupestris. Von Mueller maintained his recognition of Brachychiton as a separate genus. German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Sterculia in 1891, {{on the grounds that}} the name Clompanus took precedence. He republished the Queensland bottle tree as Clompanus rupestris. German botanist Karl Moritz Schumann gave it its current binomial name in 1893, which was accepted by Achille Terraciano of the Orto botanico di Palermo and subsequent authorities, and remains current.|$|E

Tabu's first credited role came {{as a teenager in}} Dev Anand's Hum Naujawan (1985), and her first major role was in the Telugu film Coolie No. 1 (1991). In 1994, she starred in two Hindi filmsthe romance Pehla Pehla Pyar and the action drama Vijaypathand received the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for the latter. After appearing in a series of poorly received films, including Prem and Saajan Ki Baahon Mein (both 1995), the year 1996 was <b>key</b> <b>for</b> Tabu.

Also that year, Tabu won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for the romance Ninne Pelladata, and featured alongside Govinda and Karisma Kapoor in the commercially successful comedy film Saajan Chale Sasural.|$|E

5|$|Merit system: The {{earliest}} {{example of}} a merit system {{dates back to the}} Qin and Han dynasties. In order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials. Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the civil service examinations, and education became the <b>key</b> <b>for</b> social mobility. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the nine-rank system was established during the Three Kingdoms period. The concept of a merit system spread from China to British India during the 17th century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of pipes {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a <b>key</b> (<b>for</b> example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E
