First, in an interview with CNN, Miller had a dispute with <b>Judy</b> <b>Woodruff,</b> Wolf Blitzer, and Jeff Greenfield when they questioned him on his speech, particularly on whether he had misinterpreted the context and full content of Kerry's votes, and the fact that Dick Cheney, as Defense Secretary, had opposed some of the same programs he attacked Kerry for voting against.|$|E

25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, <b>Judy</b> <b>Woodruff,</b> Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E
