40|$|Affinity {{chromatography}} is {{an important}} and useful tool for studying biological interactions, such as the binding of an antibody with an antigen. Monolithic supports offer many advantages over traditional packed bed supports in affinity chromatography, including their ease of preparation, low back pressures and good mass transfer properties. Monoliths {{can be broken down}} into two basic categories: organic (polymer) and inorganic (silica) monoliths. There are many varieties of polymer based monoliths; however, a large focus has been on co-polymers of glycidyl methacrylate (a functional monomer) and <b>ethylene</b> <b>dimethacrylate</b> (a cross-linking agent). The solvents of choice for making this type of monolith are typically 1 -dodecanol and cyclohexanol. The combination of monolith supports with biological ligands of interest in affinity chromatography has given rise to a technique known as affinity monolith chromatography (AMC). In order to study the conditions needed for preparing affinity monolithic supports, a combinatorial library was prepared in which the polymerization temperature and relative ratio of cyclohexanol to 1 -dodecanol was varied to determine the effects on the total protein content that could be achieved with such materials. In the first of this work, glycidyl methacrylate was used along with a cross linking agent that was either <b>ethylene</b> <b>dimethacrylate</b> or trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate. It was found that changing the ratio of these agents could be used to obtain a high protein content for monoliths containing immobilized human serum albumin (HSA). It was also found that these materials could be used for the separation of chiral substances such as (R/S) -warfarin and (D/L) -tryptophan. The second study utilized a monolith comprised of a co-polymer of glycidyl methacrylate and <b>ethylene</b> <b>dimethacrylate</b> to examine the effectiveness of this material to entrap carbon-based nanomaterials for eventual use in characterizing such materials or using them in separations based on biologically-relevant proteins or ligands.

40|$|The {{formation}} of highly crosslinked polymers is typically accomplished by polymerization of multifunctional monomers. Reactions {{of this type}} are typically accompanied by heterogeneity of the polymer structure, autoacceleration and autodeceleration of reaction kinetics, and {{formation of}} a glassy polymer. Theoretical models were developed to understand the polymer structure and the reaction kinetics of <b>ethylene</b> glycol <b>dimethacrylate</b> polymerization reactions. Kinetic gelation simulations were used to predict the polymer structure, particularly the heterogeneity during the polymerization. These simulations involved modification of previous kinetic gelation simulations by addition of monomer size, molecular mobility, and realistic initiation mechanisms. The simulations correctly predicted that heterogeneity during the polymerization would result in varying reactivity of pendant double bonds. At low conversions to the pendant double bond is highly reactive because of its high local concentration, but at high conversions shielding of the pendant bond lowers its reactivity. In order to predict the coupled reaction kinetics and volume relaxation a free volume based model for the kinetic constants and relaxation time was developed.
