6000|$|Apart {{from these}} arithmetical conceptions, {{and the deep}} charm which their {{assurance}} of expression had for the narrow and fervid minds of which England and Germany seem to have got finally rid in Anabaptists and Fifth Monarchy men, but which still haunted France, there were maxims in the Social Contract of remarkable convenience {{for the members of}} a Committee of Public Safety. [...] "How can a blind multitude," [...] the writer asks in one place, [...] "which so often does not know its own will, because it seldom knows what is good for it, execute of itself an undertaking so vast and so difficult as a system of legislation?"[206] Again, [...] "as nature gives to each man an absolute power over all his members, so the social pact gives to the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, when directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty."[207] Above all, the little chapter on a dictatorship is the very foundation of the position of the Robespierrists in the few months immediately preceding their fall. [...] "It is evidently the first intention of the people that the state should not perish," [...] and so on, with much criticism of the system of occasional dictatorships, as they were resorted to in old Rome.[208] Yet this does not in itself go much beyond the old monarchic doctrine of Prerogative, as a corrective for the slowness and want of <b>immediate</b> <b>applicability</b> of mere legal processes in cases of state emergency; and it is worth noticing again and again that in spite of the shriekings of reaction, the few atrocities of the Terror are an almost invisible speck compared with the atrocities of Christian churchmen and lawful kings, perpetrated in accordance with their notion of what constituted public safety. So far as Rousseau's intention goes, we find in his writings one of the strongest denunciations of the doctrine of public safety that {{is to be found in}} any of the writings of the century. [...] "Is the safety of a citizen," [...] he cries, [...] "less the common cause than the safety of the state? They may tell us that it is well that one should perish on behalf of all. I will admire such a sentence in the mouth of a virtuous patriot, who voluntarily and for duty's sake devotes himself to death for the salvation of his country. But if we are to understand that it is allowed to the government to sacrifice an innocent person for the safety of the multitude, I hold this maxim for one of the most execrable that tyranny has ever invented, and the most dangerous that can be admitted."[209] It may be said that the Terrorists did not sacrifice innocent life, but the plea is frivolous on the lips of men who proscribed whole classes. You cannot justly draw a capital indictment against a class. Rousseau, however, cannot fairly be said to have had a share in the responsibility for the more criminal part of the policy of 1793, any more than the founder of Christianity is responsible for the atrocities that have been committed by the more ardent worshippers of his name, and justified by stray texts caught up from the gospels. Helvétius had said, [...] "All becomes legitimate and even virtuous on behalf of the public safety." [...] Rousseau wrote in the margin, [...] "The public safety is nothing unless individuals enjoy security."[210] The author of a theory is not answerable for the applications which may be read into it by the passions of men and the exigencies of a violent crisis. Such applications show this much and no more, that the theory was constructed with an imperfect consideration of the qualities of human nature, with too narrow a view of the conditions of society, and therefore with an inadequate appreciation of the consequences which the theory might be drawn to support.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{trials of}} {{oncolytic}} virotherapy have shown low toxicity and encouraging signs of efficacy. However, it remains critically important to develop methods for systemic viral delivery if such therapies {{are to be}} clinically implemented to treat established tumors. In this respect, much effort is being focused on combining oncolytic viruses with standard treatment modalities such as inhibitors of VEGF 165 (an alternatively spliced isoform of VEGF-A) signaling, which are widely used to treat several different cancers. Here, we have demonstrated that combining VEGF 165 inhibitors with systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses leads to substantial regression and cure of established tumors in immunocompetent mice. We have shown that manipulating VEGF 165 -mediated signaling by administering VEGF 165 to mice harboring mouse melanoma cells that do not express VEGF 165 and by administering a VEGF inhibitor and then withdrawing treatment to allow VEGF levels to rebound in mice harboring mouse melanoma cells expressing VEGF 165 allows tumor-associated endothelial cells transiently to support viral replication. This approach led to direct tumor cell lysis and triggered innate immune–mediated attack on the tumor vasculature. It also resulted in long-term antitumor effects, even against tumors in which viral replication is poorly supported. Since this combinatorial approach targets the tumor endothelium, we believe these data have direct, wide-ranging, and <b>immediate</b> clinical <b>applicability</b> across {{a broad range of}} tumor types...|$|R

40|$|Design {{of novel}} {{artificial}} materials based on ferroelectric perovskites {{relies on the}} basic principles of electrostatic coupling and in-plane lattice matching. These rules state that the out-of-plane component of the electric displacement field and the in-plane components of the strain are preserved across a layered superlattice, provided that certain growth conditions are respected. Intense research is currently directed at optimizing materials functionalities based on these guidelines, often with remarkable success. Such principles, however, are of limited practical use unless one disposes of reliable data on how a given material behaves under arbitrary electrical and mechanical boundary conditions. Here we demonstrate, by focusing on the prototypical ferroelectrics PbTiO 3 and BiFeO 3 as testcases, how such information can be calculated from first principles in a systematic and efficient way. In particular, we construct a series of two-dimensional maps that describe the behavior of either compound (e. g. concerning the ferroelectric polarization and antiferrodistortive instabilities) at any conceivable choice of the in-plane lattice parameter, a, and out-of-plane electric displacement, D. In addition to being of <b>immediate</b> practical <b>applicability</b> to superlattice design, our results bring new insight into the complex interplay of competing degrees of freedom in perovskite materials, and reveal some notable instances where the behavior of these materials depart from what naively is expected.

40|$|Transplantation is {{the best}} form of {{treatment}} for end-stage kidney disease, by improving quality of life, reducing mortality and lowering healthcare costs. However, the immunosuppressive medications required have non-selective mechanisms of action, affecting both patient and graft longevity. Tolerance, the acceptance of an allograft {{in the absence of}} immunosuppression, remains a major goal in clinical transplantation research. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells (APC) capable of promoting anti-donor immunity and antigen-specific tolerance, and are a promising target for immunomodulation. Current tolerogenic techniques involve ex vivo DC manipulation which limits <b>immediate</b> clinical <b>applicability.</b> The scope of this thesis involves identification of a novel biologic agent, curcumin, to induce tolerogenic DC and the use of this immunomodulatory agent within a liposomal construct to target and modify DC function in vivo. Chapter 1 discusses the context of this thesis and contains a comprehensive literature review. Chapter 2 outlines methodology and materials utilised in this thesis. Chapter 3 demonstrates the use of curcumin for in vitro generation of tolerogenic DC that promote expansion of functional FoxP 3 + regulatory T-cells (Tregs). In vivo infusion of curcumin-treated DC was also able to induce subsequent immune hyporesponsiveness mediated by FoxP 3 + Tregs, and represents a potential avenue for transplant recipient conditioning using donor (or recipient) -derived DC. Chapter 4 demonstrates the use of liposomes to target APC in vivo. Liposomal incorporation of immunomodulatory agents facilitates targeted cellular delivery to tissue-resident APC and forms a basis for in vivo modulation of APC function. This work demonstrates that the in vitro results demonstrated in Chapter 3 can be replicated in vivo, potentially eliminating the need for ex vivo DC manipulation in a transplant setting. Chapter 5 demonstrates the utility of liposomal curcumin in ameliorating aspects of ischaemiareperfusion injury (IRI), a consequence of transplant surgery that promotes graft immunogenicity and limits graft longevity. For the first time renal tubular epithelial and antigen-presenting cell endocytosis of liposomes is demonstrated, as is salvage of renal function which is mediated by reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, and diminished oxidative stress. The results also identify thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) as a potential novel marker of tissue injury in IRI, and curcumin effectively reduces this aspect of cellular redox stress These data represent a novel and effective delivery method for this immunmodulatory agent, preventing significant renal damage in a manner that has <b>immediate</b> clinical <b>applicability.</b> Chapter 6 describes a refinement in liposomal targeting of DC, using a DC-specific liposome capable of binding to human monocyte-derived DC with high affinity via the receptor DCSIGN. The gene for marmoset DC-SIGN was cloned and the cross-reactivity of a human-DC-targeted liposome to its marmoset counterpart was investigated in vitro. Additional attempts were made to synthesize a marmoset DC-targeted liposome through basic, non-specific, chemical modification of a monoclonal antibody to DC-SIGN known to be cross-reactive with both humans and marmosets, with the aim of creating a cell-free DC-targeted negative vaccine that could be tested in non-human primates.

Design and setting: Analysis of descriptive data and data on publication outputs collected between 23 July 2012 and 10 December 2013 relating to health intervention research project grants funded between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2007. Main outcome measures: Stages of development of intervention studies (efficacy, effectiveness, replication, adaptation or dissemination of intervention); types of interventions studied; publication output per NHMRC grant; and whether interventions produced statistically {{significant changes in}} primary outcome variables. Results: Most of the identified studies tested intervention efficacy or effectiveness in clinical or community settings, with few testing the later stages of intervention development, such as replication, adaptation or dissemination. Studies focused largely on chronic disease treatment and management, and encompassed various medical and allied health disciplines. Equal numbers of studies had interventions that produced statistically significant results on primary outcomes, (27) and those that did not (27).

But this success comes at a price, as every new research paper is now being judged by its <b>immediate</b> relevance and <b>applicability</b> to current technology, while ignoring the long-term development of foundations for this important area. So, while there is a large body of practical work, the theoretical principles are still lacking: There are no agreed-upon concepts, and even the terminology is muddled; there is great confusion between specifications, policies and implementations; even when they exist, correctness properties do not distinguish between safety, liveness and performance. This lack of foundations hinders communication and interaction, both within the community of researchers investigating concurrent data structures and in its interactions with other communities, most notably those investigating programming languages and verification. Previous foundations developed for similar architectural advances include concurrency control theory [11] and consistency models for distributed shared memory [9]. This experience indicates what should be incorporated in a theory for transactional memory—and in a broader perspective, concurrent data structures. The first ingredient are specifications. These should include clear interfaces, as well as definitions of safety and liveness properties. There are several possibilities for picking these properties, differing along several dimensions, including, most importantly, the following issues...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: As a {{consequence}} of a road traffic crash, persistent pain and disability following whiplash injury are common and incur substantial personal and economic costs. Up to 50 % of people who experience a whiplash injury will never fully recover and up to 30 % will remain moderately to severely disabled by the condition. The reason as to why symptoms persist past the acute to sub-acute stage and become chronic is unclear, but likely results from complex interactions between structural injury, physical impairments, and psychological and psychosocial factors. Psychological responses related to the traumatic event itself are becoming an increasingly recognised factor in the whiplash condition. Despite this recognition, there is limited knowledge regarding the effectiveness of psychological interventions, either delivered alone or in combination with physiotherapy, in reducing the physical and pain-related psychological factors of chronic whiplash. Pilot study results have shown positive results {{for the use of}} trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy to treat psychological factors, pain and disability in individuals with chronic whiplash. The results have indicated that a combined approach could not only reduce psychological symptoms, but also pain and disability. Aims: The primary aim of this randomised, controlled trial is to investigate the effectiveness of combined trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy, delivered by a psychologist, and physiotherapy exercise to decrease pain and disability of individuals with chronic whiplash and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The trial also aims to investigate the effectiveness of the combined therapy in decreasing post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and depression. Participants and setting: A total of 108 participants with chronic whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) grade II of > 3 months and < 5 years duration and PTSD (diagnosed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) according to the DSM- 5) will be recruited for the study. Participants will be assessed via phone screening and in person at a university research laboratory. Interventions will take place in southeast Queensland, Australia and southern Denmark. Intervention: Psychological therapy will be delivered once a week over 10 weeks, with participants randomly assigned to either trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy or supportive therapy, both delivered by a clinical psychologist. Participants will then receive ten sessions of evidence-based physiotherapy exercise delivered over a 6 -week period. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is neck disability (Neck Disability Index). Secondary outcomes focus on: pain intensity; presence and severity of PTSD (CAPS V and PTSD Checklist 5); psychological distress (Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale 21); patient perceived functionality (SF- 12, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, and Patient-Specific Functional Scale); and pain-specific self-efficacy and catastrophising (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire and Pain Catastrophizing Scale). After psychotherapy (10 weeks after randomisation) and physiotherapy (16 weeks after randomisation), {{as well as at the}} 6 -month and 12 -month follow-ups, a blind assessor will measure the outcomes. Analysis: All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary and secondary outcomes that are measured will be analysed using linear mixed and logistic regression models. Any effect of site (Australia or Denmark) will be evaluated by including a site-by-treatment group-by-time interaction term in the mixed models analyses. Effect modification will only be assessed for the primary outcome of the Neck Disability Index. Discussion: This study will provide a definitive evaluation of the effects of adding trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy to physiotherapy exercise for individuals with chronic WAD and PTSD. This study is likely to influence the clinical management of whiplash injury and will have <b>immediate</b> clinical <b>applicability</b> in Australia, Denmark and the wider international community. The study will also have implications for both health and insurance policy makers in their decision-making regarding treatment options and funding...|$|R
