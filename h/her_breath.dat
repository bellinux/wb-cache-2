25|$|In {{the special}} bonus chapter, Lyra {{has a new}} dream. She was in the Town of Wish, her family was calling for her, but Lyra couldn't hear them over the sound of rushing water. Her body became light {{as if she had}} been floating. Lyra held <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> and fell deeper into that strange dream. Once again, she finds herself alone in another unrecognizable place, a small office in the Barge City, and looks for a magic map.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, the limpid {{purity of}} her tone and the {{smoothness}} of her legato line remained uniquely impressive, compensating {{to some extent}} for the weakening of <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> control. The records also display a lively singing personality {{as well as a}} surprisingly strong chest voice and a mellow timbre. Her trill remains wonderfully fluent and accurate and her diction is excellent. Overall her discs have a charm and musicality that give us a hint of why, at her peak, she commanded $5,000 a night.|$|E

5000|$|Kira Starr (Kiersey Clemons) is Jimmy Starr's {{daughter}} and Austin's ex-girlfriend. Kira temporarily {{had a case}} of repugnant breath, causing the group to be extremely wary of her throughout [...] "Ferris Wheels & Funky Breath". <b>Her</b> bad <b>breath</b> was caused by her constant eating of garlic and anchovy pizza. <b>Her</b> bad <b>breath</b> cleared away afterward.|$|R
25|$|Barotrauma of ascent {{is caused}} by {{pressure}} differences between the decreasing ambient pressure and the internal pressure of gas filled spaces of the diver's body. The two organs most susceptible to barotraumas of ascent are the ears and lungs, and both will normally equalize automatically. Problems may arise in the middle ear if the Eustachian tubes become blocked during the dive, and the lungs can be injured if the diver forcibly holds his or <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> during ascent, which can occur during an emergency free ascent. As lung overexpansion injury is potentially life-threatening, entry level diver training emphasizes developing the habits of not holding one's breath while diving on scuba, and slow continuous exhalation during simulated emergency swimming ascents. Techniques for clearing blocked Eustachian tubes during ascent are also generally taught at entry level.|$|E
25|$|The fire burns out and all {{the cats}} help get the camp set up again. Three days before the Gathering, Ashfur asks Firestar if he can go. Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Squirrelflight are worried {{that he is going}} to {{publicly}} announce their secret. Between then and the day of the Gathering, the three warn Ashfur that he will regret it if he reveals the secret. Although he is frightened, he refuses to listen to them. Right before the Gathering, the patrol of warriors going notices that both Ashfur and Squirrelflight are missing. On the way to the Gathering, they see Ashfur's body lying in the WindClan stream as if he had drowned. They take him back to camp and set him for vigil. Leafpool notices a slit in his neck, suggesting he was murdered. After the Gathering, Firestar announces that Ashfur's death was unknown and suspects a cat from ThunderClan may have killed him, and the three see Squirrelflight looking scared and holding <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> The three vow to keep the recent events involving them, Squirrelflight, and Ashfur a secret.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} an aspectual frame is the unrealized inceptive aspect ('just about to X'), {{illustrated}} here with the verb 'to tell'. 'To tell' is an indexical (directional) verb, where the index finger (a G hand) begins with a touch to the chin and then moves outward {{to point out the}} recipient of the telling. 'To be just about to tell' retains just the locus and the initial chin touch, which now becomes the final hold of the sign; all other features from the basic verb (in this case, the outward motion and pointing) are dropped and replaced by features from the frame (which are shared with the unrealized inceptive aspects of other verbs such as 'look at', 'wash the dishes', 'yell', 'flirt', etc.). These frame features are: Eye gaze toward the locus (which is no longer pointed at with the hand), an open jaw, and a hand (or hands, in the case of two-hand verbs) in front of the trunk which moves in an arc to the onset location of the basic verb (in this case, touching the chin), while the trunk rotates and the signer inhales, catching <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> during the final hold. The hand shape throughout the sign is whichever is required by the final hold, in this case a G hand.|$|E

500|$|In Lucan's Pharsalia, Erichtho is repugnant (for instance, she is {{described}} as having a [...] "dry cloud" [...] hang {{over her head and}} that <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> [...] "poisons otherwise non-lethal air"), and wicked to the point of sacrilege (e.g. [...] "She never beseeches the gods, nor does she call the divine with a suppliant hymn"). She lives on the outskirts of society and makes her home near [...] "graveyards, gibbets, and the battlefields copiously supplied by civil war"; she uses the body parts from these locations in her magic spells. Indeed, she delights in otherwise heinous and macabre acts involving corpses (for instance, [...] "when the dead are confined in a sarcophagus [...] then she eagerly rages every limb. She plunges her hand into the eyes, delights at digging out the congealed eyeballs, and gnaws the pallid nails on a desiccated hand.").|$|E
500|$|Writer Martin Aston {{notes that}} Albini [...] "stress live {{performances}} and quick takes". Wiggs has recalled that Albini's main concern was ensuring the best sound {{possible from the}} musical equipment, rather than attempting to improve the band's performances; {{as long as the}} group succeeded in playing each song all the way through, Albini considered that take good enough for the album. According to Wiggs, Albini's [...] "hands-off" [...] style of engineering greatly helped to shape the sound of the recordings. Albini's contributions included convincing the band members {{to reduce the number of}} harmonies in the songs and give more prominence to Deal's vocals; Donelly believes this improved the album, by making the performances [...] "more effective and sadder and... focused". The tempo of the songs was faster than Wiggs had envisioned; this was necessary because Deal could not keep <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> long enough to slow down each note. The Breeders recorded the Lennon–McCartney composition [...] "Happiness is a Warm Gun" [...] at the request of Ivo-Watts.|$|E
500|$|In Willow's dream {{she struggles}} {{to find her}} place in the school theater {{production}} of Death of a Salesman, while her friends and classmates are apparently fully costumed, prepared, and ready to go on stage. Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and know what is going on. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously {{at the front of the}} class, trying to read a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz whispers into Tara's ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> is sucked out of her body.|$|E

500|$|Max was genetically {{engineered}} and carried to term {{by a woman}} who was not permitted to meet her. She was created for a secret government supersoldier program called Manticore, then located in Gillette, Wyoming. As with almost all Manticore's soldiers, Max has a barcode on the nape of her neck, with her identifying number sequence (332960073452). She is an X5 model and is thus referred to as X5-452. Designed to be [...] "the perfect soldier," [...] Max is extremely strong, athletic and agile. She can see in the dark, can zoom in with her eyes to view distant objects, does not need to sleep and has a photographic memory. She also has enhanced hearing, can leap up or down from great heights with ease, can hold <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> underwater for extended periods and can dodge bullets with her super speed. Max lies, cheats and steals when she needs to and shows no remorse when doing so, though she is morally opposed to guns. Max rides a Kawasaki motorcycle and enjoys riding at high speed. When she wants to be alone she sits atop of the derelict Space Needle. Max's forms 'family' bonds with her best friend and flatmate Original Cindy, her ally Logan Cale and her fellow X5 escapees. Upon escaping from Manticore, Max chooses the last name [...] "Guevara" [...] for herself.|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times, in {{reference}} to Hannah Montana, commented, [...] "Once again, make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing." [...] Wood believed Cyrus possessed charisma, commenting that she portrayed superstar authority, but failed because she was {{unable or unwilling to}} [...] "give her fans a deeper idea of who she is and what her music means. For all its eye-popping detail, the concert offered nothing that viewers of her TV show or buyers of her records don't already know about her." [...] Dave Paulson of The Tennessean stated, [...] "Cyrus' spectacle sets her apart from nearly every other A-list act touring today. She's not a renowned vocalist by any stretch, but her show's choreography barely provides a moment for her to catch <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and she's still able to deliver." [...] Michael Hann of the United Kingdom-based Guardian was impressed by the concert, praising the setlist and deeming it enjoyable for both children and adults. He continued, [...] "Good as the best songs are, though, they take a backseat to the staging [...] The one misstep is when a trailer for her next movie is shown during a costume change. It's a tacky moment and doesn't reflect the attention to detail that makes the rest of it a laugh-out-loud delight." [...] Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine said, [...] "Cyrus knows how to deliver the goods without losing her core audience." [...] Loewenstein deemed the concert a mission accomplished because of inevitable hits and Cyrus' charisma, drive, spunk, and a merely-limited vocal range. Erik Ensrst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised the show, stating that it was [...] "a pure visual spectacle", but commented that producers forgot a place for Cyrus' personality.|$|E
500|$|... "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics; {{most of which}} were positive about Houston's 'soulful' performance and vocal maturity. Jean Rosenbluth of Los Angeles Times praised the song, saying [...] "Houston's elegant 'Exhale (Shoop Shoop)' [...] exude maturity without resorting to the relentlessly big vocals that characterize so many R records aiming for adult audiences." [...] Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Sounding like someone who has just emptied her lungs after holding <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> a long time, Houston brings a surprisingly mature, world-weary tone to the song." [...] Robert Hilburn, pop music critic of Los Angeles Times, noted Babyface's achievement in the song, saying [...] "he [...] brings Houston down to earth, trading her normal vocal exuberance for convincing warmth." [...] Larry Flick of Billboard called the song [...] "a surprisingly understated shuffle-ballad with soul and far more interesting vocal colors than all the shrieking can provide."

[...] Anthony Violenti of The Buffalo News gave the song a positive review, commenting that Houston's vocals were intoxicating. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in their review of the soundtrack, viewed the song as [...] "easy and understated". Steve Knopper of Newsday wrote that the song was [...] "irresistibly catchy" [...] and irritating at the same time. However, Patricia Smith of The Boston Globe wrote that the [...] "Shoop Shoop"s were [...] "annoying". While reviewing Houston's compilation Whitney: The Greatest Hits (2000), Christine Galera of Orlando Sentinel also expressed her dislike for the song, stating the songs from Waiting to Exhale, including [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" [...] and [...] "Why Does It Hurt So Bad," [...] were too mellow.|$|E

500|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding street prostitution was {{the foul}} language used, and while generally most {{entries in the}} lists look favourably on those women who refrained from swearing, the views expressed in the 1793 edition of Harris's List tend towards equivocation. [...] Mrs Cornish's genteel nature was, on occasion, interrupted by [...] "a volley of small shot", and Miss Johnson's proclivity towards [...] "vulgarity of expression and a coarseness of manner" [...] apparently suffered no shortage of admirers. [...] Mrs Russell, attractive to [...] "a number of clients among the youth, who are fond of beholding that mouth of the devil from whence all corruption issueth", was admired for her [...] "vulgarity more than any thing else, she being extremely expert at uncommon oaths". [...] Drinking, intrinsically linked with prostitution, was also frowned on. [...] Mrs William's entry of 1773 is full of remorse, her having returned home [...] "so intoxicated {{so as not to}} be able to stand, to the no small amusement of her neighbors", and Miss Jenny Kirbeard had, in 1788, a [...] "violent attachment to drinking". [...] Not all entries were disapproving though; Mrs Harvey would, in 1793, [...] "often toss off a sparkling bumper," [...] while remaining [...] "a lady of great sensibility... not a little clever in the performance of the act of friction." [...] More generally, most entries are flattering, although some are less than complimentary; the 1773 listing for Miss Berry denounces her as [...] "almost rotten, and <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> cadaverous". [...] Prostitutes may have paid money to appear in the lists, and in Denlinger's view such commentary may indicate a degree of annoyance on the writer's part, the women concerned perhaps having refused to pay. [...] Some listings also imply a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited [...] "great indifference" [...] while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was [...] "acting his joys". [...] Others are scorned for wearing too much makeup, and some for being [...] "lazy bedfellows". [...] A popular view that prostitutes were licentious, hot-blooded and hungry for sex was incompatible with the knowledge that most worked for money, and the lists therefore criticise women whose demands for payment appeared a little too mercenary.|$|E
