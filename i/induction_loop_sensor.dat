50|$|In some {{instances}} the stoplight traffic detector {{will not change}} the light for small vehicles such as motorcycles, scooters and particularly bicycles, because the <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> fails to detect the small vehicle. A vehicle with sufficient mass of metal such as steel interacts with the sensor's magnetic field causing the light to change at the appropriate time. Motorcycles and scooters have much less mass than cars, resulting in a failure to detect the vehicle, while bicycles {{may not even be}} constructed with metal. This situation most often occurs at the times of day when other traffic is sparse as well as when the small vehicle is coming from a direction that does not have a high volume of traffic. Most sensor traffic lights are capable of detecting these vehicles, but are not properly adjusted or calibrated initially, after road construction such as re-surfacing, or set too high in an attempt to avoid false triggers.|$|E

Without these crossings many waterfront communities and businesses would be inaccessible from land. Except for three grade crossings near New London Union Station, all have four-quadrant gates with <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>sensors,</b> which allow vehicles stopped on the tracks to be detected in time for an oncoming train to stop.|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{established}} methods to collect traffic data used for vehicle counting, speed checking and vehicle classification, such as <b>induction</b> <b>loops,</b> piezoelectric <b>sensor,</b> bending plates, etc. This paper presents a new method for traffic data collection. It uses vibration signals which are generated when vehicles pass the roadside. In order to extract useful information, {{such as the}} corresponding time when the vehicle was passing the vibration sensor, wavelet analysis was employed for data mining of the vibration signal observed from accelerometers (vibration sensors). The applications of wavelet transform and decomposition for vibration signals were reviewed to identify a suitable approach for the vibration signal data mining. The paper concluded with discussing the impact of wavelet analysis on data mining and outlining potential future research directions and applications...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{models to}} evaluate the impact of multi-modal sensor placement configurations on obtaining traffic parameters required {{for a variety of}} traffic monitoring and management applications. Existing traffic management strategies generally rely on the commonly used <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> <b>sensors,</b> which are highly accurate presence detectors, however they have a limited sensing area. Alternate sensor modalities may provide a higher information gain in comparison, especially vision based sensors. An inherent problem with using vision based sensors in traffic management is the occlusion between vehicles, which can make detection of individual vehicles difficult. Information fusion from multiple sensors provides much richer information for scene understanding, leading to a greater ability to coordinate traffic management efficiently. Thus, effective sensor placement and fusion of data can improve the efficiency of traffic management. The aim of this thesis is {{to evaluate the}} impact of multi-modal sensor placement, and as a result improve the estimation accuracy of road traffic parameters obtained from various sensor configurations. More specifically, vision based sensors are studied, and later fused with inductive loops. In order to achieve this, models are developed to simulate various traffic flows, and to ensure consistency and relevance of the simulations to real world traffic. Models for single sensor modality and multi-modal sensor fusion are developed and are also validated. These models enable evaluation of sensor placement configurations to determine effectiveness for specific traffic applications. Results of various single sensor configurations demonstrate that the impact of view occlusion on the ability to detect vehicles can be improved by considering sensor placement. Combining inductive loops and video cameras by sensor fusion was found to overcome the problem of occlusion, resulting in a decided improvement in parameter estimation for traffic management and monitoring applications. For example, the sensor fusion models developed resulted in the queue length estimation accuracy being improved by up to 20 %. Finally, by applying the models presented in this thesis to current ramp metering strategies, viable alternative sensor deployment solutions are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Current traffic {{research}} is mostly {{based on data}} from fixed-installed <b>sensors</b> like <b>induction</b> <b>loops,</b> bridge <b>sensors,</b> and cameras. Thereby, the traffic flow on main roads can partially be acquired, while data from the major part of the entire road network are not available. Today's optical sensor systems on satellites provide large-area images with 1 -m resolution and better, which can deliver complement information to traditional acquired data. In this paper, we present an approach for automatic vehicle detection from optical satellite images. Therefore, hypotheses for single vehicles are generated using adaptive boosting in combination with Haar-like features. Additionally, vehicle queues are detected using a line extraction technique since grouped vehicles are merged to either dark or bright ribbons. Utilizing robust parameter estimation, single vehicles are determined within those vehicle queues. The combination of implicit modeling and the use of a priori knowledge of typical vehicle constellation leads to an enhanced overall completeness compared to approaches which are only based on statistical classification techniques. Thus, a detection rate of over 80 % is possible with very high reliability. Furthermore, an approach for movement estimation of the detected vehicle is described, which allows the distinction of moving and stationary traffic. Thus, even an estimate for vehicles' speed is possible, which gives additional information about the traffic condition at image acquisition time...|$|R
40|$|Regarding the {{assessment}} of traffic data in ITS, there is an increasing need for answers to the following questions: (i) What exactly is "traffic data quality"?, and, related to that, (ii) There are too many ways to define and to do things, and results of different researchers are inconsistent or not comparable. How can we overcome this situation? With that background, an important aim of the ongoing DLR-project I. MoVe {{is to develop a}} consistent understanding of traffic data quality, together with a unified framework for its assessment. To this end, a probabilistic framework for traffic data quality is provided in this paper. Real-world examples from I. MoVe demonstrate its application for {{the assessment}} of data sources like <b>induction</b> <b>loops,</b> stationary bluetooth <b>sensors</b> and floating car data (FCD). A first important point is to distinguish strictly between quality indices, quality requirements, and quality itself. While the present framework develops quality indices based on established quality criteria like accuracy, completeness, validity, and coverage, the usual understanding of quality is extended to a probabilistic view. This also addresses the problem of information retrieval in the presence of vagueness and uncertainty. The provided examples are making full use of the proposed framework, and also constitute interesting results for the practitioner by themselves. Examples include {{the assessment of}} <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> count data, and assessing the temporal coverage of a stretch of road with stationary bluetooth data, or of the whole city of Berlin, Germany with FCD...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{system was}} installed in the Lawns (a hall of residence at Hull University) as a third year project by engineering students. By 1983 the system was fully operational. To cut costs, the students used Coca-Cola bottles as insulation. As a result, by 1993, the <b>loop</b> <b>induction</b> system was no longer functional. In 1994, the engineering team carried out a comprehensive survey {{of the system and}} were able to partially restore it to several of the Lawns halls, as well as fitting a new transmitter to Ferens Hall. The <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> system was abandoned in 1997 after the award of the LPAM licence.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} broadcast from a {{landing in the}} Electrical Engineering Department and carried by <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> {{in all of the}} campus residences. A year after launch the station moved the current studios in Norwood house but still retained the <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> transmitters, which were updated and expanded as new residences were built on campus. Over the years loudspeakers playing URB were added to the campus laundrettes and the students' union coffee shop. In summer 1994 renovations to the Westwood blocks severed the wires to the loops there and after that URB 963 could only be heard in Eastwood, Wessex and Norwood. On 8 February 2001 at 14:49 1449AM URB launched as a low powered AM service covering the whole campus and the remaining <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> on 963 were switched off. The addition of online and mobile streaming has also given the station a significant boost.|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{detectors}} support most {{traffic management}} applications, {{so it is}} important that a detector performs as expected. This study evaluates the performance of four <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> models and the Remote Traffic Microwave Sensor (RTMS), adding to the body of sensor performance knowledge through the use of new analytical techniques. The study collected contact closure data from all five of the detectors and concurrent video data. Each <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> was deployed following Caltrans guidelines for at least 24 hours across dual loop detectors in each lane of I- 80, north of Oakland, CA. The research examined various distributions of the individual vehicle actuations from each of the detectors. This exercise found two <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> models locked up and not provide any data to the controller although they appeared fully functional from the front panel. The median on-time varied between the RTMS and the <b>loop</b> <b>sensors,</b> as well as from one <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> model to the next, which means the occupancy measurements will also change. The video was used to manually validate each vehicle passage over extended periods, preselected at random, with the errors classified by type (e. g., non-detected vehicle) and source (e. g., due to a lane change maneuver). The RTMS exhibited problems due to occlusion and reflections, while two of the <b>loop</b> <b>sensors</b> exhibited non-negligible problems. Then, the detector data are aggregated and used to evaluate the performance of each sensor under standard operation. Next, the results of two earlier evaluations of the RTMS are presented. The reports have not been formally published and to address the omission, this section recaps the relevant portions of those two studies {{in the context of the}} results presented above. This first effort considered the aggregated data reported by the RTMS using its internal controller emulation in comparison to dual loop detectors. The RTMS occupancy and flow measures are shown to be noisier than loops, though the velocity estimates are almost as good as those from single loops. The second study considers aggregate measurements from the contact closure data, comparing the RTMS against the dual loop detectors. For reference, the work also compared one loop against another in a dual loop detector, with the spacing between loops being greater than the spacing between the reference loops and the RTMS detection zone. As is illustrated in this study, the RTMS shows lane dependent results. ...|$|R
