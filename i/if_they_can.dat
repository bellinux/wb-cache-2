5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E

5|$|Bicycles {{have been}} constructed, for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that turning the handlebars {{to the left}} causes the front wheel {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa. It is possible to ride such a bicycle, but it has been found that riders experienced with normal bicycles find it very difficult to learn, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> manage it at all.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{red panda}} include the snow leopard, mustelids, and humans. If they feel {{threatened}} or sense danger, they may try to escape by climbing a rock column or tree. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> no longer flee, they stand on their hind legs to make themselves appear larger and use the sharp claws on their front paws to defend themselves.

5|$|The {{residents}} of Alexandria put more trust in Rick's group {{to protect the}} town better. A group known as the Wolves use a zombie horde to attack Alexandria, and many lives are lost before the living regain control. While recovering, they learn of a community called the Hilltop, who offer to help trade supplies <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> end {{the threat of the}} extortionist Saviors led by a man named Negan. Although Rick's group decimate one Savior outpost, they are later caught by Negan, and forced to swear loyalty to him.|$|E

5|$|Adam Williams (James Nesbitt) {{breaks up}} with another {{in a long line}} of girlfriends and spends the evening at the pub with his friend Pete Gifford (John Thomson). Pete arrives home late, which annoys his wife Jenny (Fay Ripley), who {{calculated}} that night to be the best time for them to conceive a child. She becomes even more frustrated when she sees Pete has brought Adam back; he missed his last bus home. Rachel Bradley's (Helen Baxendale) boyfriend Simon Atkinson (Stephen Mapes) breaks up with her over dinner after taking a job in Hong Kong. Rachel angrily leaves the restaurant and telephones her friend Karen Marsden (Hermione Norris), who has just asked her husband David (Robert Bathurst) <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get a nanny to take care of their son Josh.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites live almost {{exclusively}} on mice, and have become a specialist predator of house mice, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. They take other suitably sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and even (very rarely) rabbits, but mice and other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of their diet. Their influence on mouse populations is probably significant: adults take two or three mice a day each <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a nest of well-advanced fledglings within an hour. In another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, a heavy load for such a small bird.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> not be increased.|$|E
5|$|Lisa becomes {{adept at}} {{choosing}} winners of football games, and Homer declares every Sunday during football season Daddy-Daughter Day. Lisa remains perfect in her picks for eight weeks, earning her father {{more and more}} money as the Super Bowl approaches. With his new money, Homer starts buying expensive presents for the family and treating them to fine dining. When Lisa asks Homer <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> go hiking the Sunday following the Super Bowl, he tells her that Daddy-Daughter Days are over until next football season. Lisa realizes that all Homer wanted was to exploit her prognostic abilities to help him gamble. Completely heartbroken, Lisa gives away all the toys Homer bought for her.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who {{promises}} {{to pay them}} money <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find naughty little boys {{for him to take}} to Pleasure Island. Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in smoking tobacco, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are transformed into donkeys and sold into slave labor. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape, only partially transformed.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} in a detonation level is to plant and detonate explosive devices {{on a number}} of enemy positions, which can consist of anti-aircraft guns, tanks and armored cars. Some positions must be hit twice for them to be destroyed. Players can protect their positions by defusing the explosives before they detonate. In one variation of this game mode, one side has to defend their positions for a set amount of time, with the destruction of each piece of equipment giving the enemy team more time. The defenders win <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> hold their positions long enough for the time to run out, while the attackers win when all objectives have been destroyed. In the alternate version, both teams must attack the other's objectives while defending their own. The first team to destroy all of the enemy's equipment wins.|$|E
5|$|The work {{ends with}} the {{following}} words: Fichte and the powerful men who have inherited his ideals, when they see children, think: 'Here is material that I can manipulate'... All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; just as we teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> so we should teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E

50|$|Bugbears are {{carnivores}} {{who survive}} primarily by hunting. They will eat anything <b>they</b> <b>can</b> kill, including sentient beings. Intruders {{are considered a}} valuable source of food, so bugbears rarely bother to negotiate with them. They have a fondness for glittery, shiny objects and weapons, however, so they will sometimes parley <b>if</b> <b>they</b> think <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get something exceptional. Bugbears also enjoy strong wine and ale, sometimes to excess. Rarely, they will take slaves.|$|R
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
5|$|Greg Glienna did {{not come}} up with the surname Focker; Greg's {{character}} in the original film did not have a last name. The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey {{came up with the idea}} for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers were asked if they had made up the name or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> prove that such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.|$|E

Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks {{him to come to}} her house. Later that day, he arrives completely naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town in an attempt to win Ann back, and she thinks of a different way he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he will drop the lawsuit if they agree to fill in the pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie. The next day the pit is filled in and turned into a lot, and an impressed Ann waves at Andy while the construction work is going on. The episode ends with Keef riding a motorboat, revealing his role in KaBOOM! was an elaborate prank to get the playground built, and announcing he is going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.|$|E
