40|$|In the United States, the {{president}} is elected by the Electoral College (EC) and not directly by individual voters. This can {{give rise to a}} so-called 2 ̆ 7 referendum paradox 2 ̆ 7 in which one candidate receives more popular votes than any other, but this candidate is not elected. The 2000 election is an example of this phenomenon. Can the EC be reformed so that a referendum paradox never arises? We consider varying three natural parameters. First, we consider changing the method of apportioning seats in the House of Representatives to states. Second, we consider changing the total number of seats in the House. Intuition suggests that as the number of seats approaches the number of voters, the referendum paradox should disappear. Finally, we consider varying the fixed and proportional components of each state 2 ̆ 7 s <b>EC</b> <b>vote.</b> Using data from U. S. presidential elections we show that none of these reforms can prevent a referendum paradox from occurring. We conclude that susceptibility to a referendum paradox is an inescapable feature of the system for electing presidents. An interesting corollary of our analysis is that seemingly insignificant changes to the EC can cause different candidates to be elected president...|$|E

5000|$|ASLEF's Rules stated [...] "The General Secretary {{shall be}} {{elected by the}} votes of the {{majority}} of the whole of the members of the Society". However, only 4,369 of ASLEF's 10,502 members (41.6%) had voted and Fox won only 42.6% of the votes that had been cast. The runner up was an EC member and former Organising Secretary, Harry Parfitt, with 1,536 votes. After the votes were counted on 8 December an EC member proposed a run-off election between Fox and Parfitt but the <b>EC</b> <b>voted</b> to take legal advice. On 9 December the <b>EC</b> <b>voted</b> to declare Fox elected as General Secretary and the Assistant General Secretary, Henry Shuttleworth, quickly issued a circular to all branches to that effect. Parfitt challenged the decision and issued his own circular to branches asserting the members' right to demand a run-off ballot, but none was held and Fox took office without further challenge.|$|R

50|$|Albert Ho {{announced}} in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong on 4 October 2011 {{that he would}} challenge the 2012 Chief Executive election which was elected by 1200-member Election Committee controlled by Beijing. With the pan democrats securing an estimated 205 votes, Albert Ho {{took part in a}} pan-democrat primary election on 8 January 2012 against Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood lawmaker Frederick Fung and won. Ho ran against the two pro-Beijing candidates, ex-convenor of the Executive Council Leung Chun-ying and former Chief Secretary Henry Tang. Since being widely conceived of having no chance winning the Beijing-controlled election, Ho's popularity trailed behind Leung and Tang over the election. Out of the 1,132 <b>EC</b> <b>votes,</b> Albert Ho came third with only 76. Leung Chun-ying was declared duly elected by the Returning Officer.|$|R

5000|$|On 3 April 2006, the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) {{petitioned the}} Administrative Court {{to suspend the}} results of the {{election}} and accused the Election Commission of violating voter privacy. The <b>EC</b> repositioned <b>voting</b> booths so that voters' backs were to the public, whereas in previous elections, voters faced the public, with a board one-half meter tall {{at the front of the}} booth separating the voter from the public. The EC claimed the new arrangement was designed to prevent various forms of poll fraud including the use of cameras by voters to take photographs of their ballots. After the 2005 election, cameras and cameraphones had been banned from voting stations due to fears that canvassers would demand ballot photographs in return for money. [...] However, the PAD claimed that this allowed onlookers to peek over voters' shoulders and see who they voted for.|$|R

40|$|This paper puts forth an institutionalist {{account of}} the ways in which the EC shapes {{international}} outcomes. EC decision rules can amplify or attenuate the international bargaining power of certain member states, who are thereby able to effect international outcomes which would not have resulted in the absence of the EC. Unanimity rules in the EC will tend to amplify the international bargaining power of the lowest common denominator EC member state and attenuate the bargaining power of states with median preferences. The opposite conclusions pertain under <b>EC</b> qualified majority <b>voting.</b> Either effect will only occur when member states have greater or lesser ability to shape international outcomes when working through the EC than they would have had as free agents. These expectations are probed with two paired comparisons involving EC activity in international environmental negotiations...|$|R
