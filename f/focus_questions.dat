40|$|Abstract. Two {{strategies}} for encouraging formation of dynamic relationships in Concept Maps (CMaps) are discussed and tested, namely concept quantification and a dynamic <b>focus</b> <b>question</b> of the map. Two experiments {{were conducted to}} examine the effects of these two approaches on dynamic thinking during the CMap construction task. The first experiment examined the impact of the quantification of the root concept in the map. The second experiment explored the effect of the <b>focus</b> <b>question</b> of the map. For both experiments, the content of CMaps was assessed for the number of dynamic propositions and the number of quantified concepts. The results showed that the quantification of the root concept and the dynamic <b>focus</b> <b>question</b> “how ” significantly increased dynamic thinking. In addition, the <b>focus</b> <b>question</b> affected the selection of concepts used in the maps and how those concepts were used. The studies, the theoretical background, and the implications of the findings are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} realism in {{the confidence of}} 8 - 9 -year-olds, 12 - 13 -year-olds and adults in their free recall and answers to <b>focused</b> <b>questions</b> after viewing a short videoclip. A different videoclip was shown in each experiment and the <b>focused</b> <b>questions</b> differed in difficulty. In both experiments the youngest age group, {{in contrast to the}} two other age groups, showed no overconfidence in their confidence judgements for the free recall. The free recall results also showed that the youngest group had lower completeness but similar correctness as the adults. There was a tendency, over both experiments, for the participants to show poorer realism for the <b>focused</b> <b>questions</b> than for the free recall, especially when questions with content already mentioned in the free recall were excluded from the analyses of the <b>focused</b> <b>questions</b> in Experiment 1. The study shows the importance of questionformat when evaluating the credibility of the confidence shown by 8 - 9 -year-old children in their own testimony...|$|R
5000|$|Developing student’s a {{sense of}} exploration, {{discovery}} and independent thinking In IES, {{students are required to}} collect greatly practical data in the assessment of “ Data collection’’. As a result, students will be able to classify and deploy the data and construct their own ideas after this process. [...] Generalizing feasible solutions and outcomes in a structured way When compiling the assessment of “Product’’, students should construct fruitful opinions with reasonable arguments and well-supported reflections. Therefore, students will be able to develop effective solutions and appraise the learning progress. [...] Demonstrating the use of hypotheses and <b>focus</b> <b>questions</b> in studying an issue For the assessment of “Project Proposal’’, students should hypothesize the foreseeable implications and questions they focused for the inquiry. They will be able to generate plans for writing by hypotheses and <b>focus</b> <b>questions</b> consequently.Broadening their horizons As regard to IES, it aims to explore knowledge of an issue, which affects our society and the world. Students will be able to demonstrate knowledge in the study of Liberal Art through researching different perspectives of an issue. Moreover, they would be likely to widen their horizons.Catering for student’s interest and inclination Every student should design their own topics, methodology and scope by themselves. It provides an opportunity for them to be self-reliant learners. Thus, {{they will be able to}} set plans, systemize the plans and dealing with problems. Preparing students for lifelong learning and challenges Whichever topics are used, students will be able to understand the influence of social, national and global changes and its implications. The duration of IES gives students longer consideration to analysis the inquiry which cannot be easily accessed by conventional written examination.|$|E
30|$|However, it is {{far more}} common for {{learning}} cycles to be unprepared; teachers typically expect a response to their <b>Focus</b> <b>questions</b> without preparing, and only prepare when they do not get a desired response. Furthemore, <b>Focus</b> <b>questions</b> often provide little or no clue to the desired response, but require students to interpret one from their knowledge. This is another factor in unequal participation, as only a few students typically have the confidence to risk displaying their knowledge and capacities for interpreting, where affirmation is uncertain.|$|E
