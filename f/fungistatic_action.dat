40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the chemical composition and in vitro antimicrobial potential of methanolic extract of Psidium guajava Linn (Myrtaceae). Materials and Methods: The inhibitory effect of methanolic extract of P. guajava was tested against three bacterial and two fungal strains by using the paper disc diffusion method. Results: The methanolic extract exhibited antibacterial activity against E. coli with minimum inhibitory concentration, 0. 78 μg/ml, minimum bactericidal concentration of 50 μg/ml, and appreciable antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentration of 12. 5 μg/ml. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of methanolic extract revealed the presence of antimicrobial compounds such as flavonoids, steroids, and tannins, which may contribute for the antimicrobial action of P. guajava.

30|$|The other {{objective}} of this work was to design surfaces to which CAR is covalently attached and to study their antifungal activity. Once the functionalization of gold surface with EstC-NH 2 performed and checked by PM-RAIRS measurements, the inhibition of culturability of adherent C. albicans ATCC 3153 on these surfaces reached 76 %[*]±[*] 11 % compared to the control Au-MUA. This {{decrease in the number}} of culturable cells attached to the functionalized surfaces can be explained by two processes. Either the grafting of EstC-NH 2 makes the surfaces antiadhesive thus preventing the yeasts from attaching onto the substrates, or it exerts an antifungal activity toward cells after their adhesion via a fungicidal or <b>fungistatic</b> mode of <b>action.</b> To answer this question, confocal microscopy analyses, using BacLight™ staining showed that on the surface functionalized with EstC-NH 2, the number of adherent cells was similar to the control Au-MUA but the number of red permeabilized cells, increased by more than 60 %. The mode of action of these newly-developed EstC-NH 2 functionalized surfaces appears to be rather fungicidal but not antiadhesive.|$|R

40|$|Miconazole at 10 p g ml-l {{inhibited}} {{the growth}} of exponential phase cultures of Candida albicans and released intracellular K+. Higher concentrations of rniconazole were, however, required to cause cell death: at neutral pH, complete killing occurred at 30 pg ml-l, while at pH 3. 0 or 4. 5, there was only partial killing with miconazole up to 80 p g rnl-l. Efficient killing of C. albicans by miconazole occurred both at low temperature and when cells were incubated in buffer alone. It is proposed that both the <b>fungistatic</b> and fungicidal <b>actions</b> of miconazole are due to its direct interaction with the cellular membranes of C. albicans rather than to an inhibition of biochemical reactions. Divalent cations protected C. albicans from both the fungistatic and fungicidal effects of miconazole and this was probably due to a competition between the ions and miconazole in its positively charged form for nega-tively charged binding sites. Candida albicans increased in resistance to miconazole-induced Kf release during the stationary phase of a batch culture. Development of this resistance required efficient aeration...|$|R
40|$|Cranberry juice exerts a {{significant}} in vitro antifungal effect on eight representative species of dermatophytes, whereas {{it has no}} apparent effect on Candida albicans.

The media included the following: Snyder, Snyder tellurite, Sabouraud tellurite, Littman-gentamicin, molybdate, and Mycosel (BBL).

Klebsiella pneumoniae {{was the most common}} bacterial contaminant of the other media. All six media were comparable in isolating yeasts while preventing the growth of the oral bacterial flora. The selection of a basal fungal growth medium for tellurite incorporation to inhibit bacteria but permit growth of yeasts was affected by pH.

The arbitrary selection of Snyder and Littman agars to isolate yeast from burn wound cultures demonstrated the need to include a selective medium for these specimens.

40|$|New {{medications}} and new formulations have provided {{an increase in}} the cure rates for onychomycosis. Many cases of infection, however, are still not cured. It is not always obvious which factors are most relevant to reduction of cure, and factors may vary with each patient. For these reasons, a multitherapy approach to onychomycosis may be needed to individualize treatment to each patient’s specific condition. Different presentations and severity levels of onychomycosis may respond differently to treatment modalities and require varying amounts of intervention. Nail débridement may be used to lessen the burden of infection in cases in which drug penetration may not occur adequately otherwise, such as dermatophytoma, onycholysis, or lateral infection. Ciclopirox nail lacquer has been approved for use in conjunction with regular débridement and represents the first approved multitherapy approach. Topical antifungals may be combined with oral antifungals to provide dual fronts of drug penetration.

40|$|Purpose. The {{in vitro}} {{antimicrobial}} activity of an agent {{can be expressed}} in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). MIC data obtained by various investigations can differ considerably and the results depend on many factors such as the type of evaluation, the type of inoculum, the size of the inoculum, the medium, and the incubation temperature. A correlation between in vitro antifungal susceptibility and in vivo clinical results has been established only in a few cases. Due to the lack of correlation, many factors inherent to the fungi, to the host and to the drug must be considered. Moreover, MIC values are unlikely to be obtained upon systemic application in the infection sites when testing the most important antifungal agents like griseofulvin or azoles, characterized by a <b>fungistatic</b> mode of <b>action.</b> In this study we evaluated the activity of terbinafine, a fungicidal drug, in vivo in naturally occurring feline dermatophytoses and compared it with its in vitro activity against Microsporum canis strains isolated from these cats before treatment. Materials and methods. In vivo activity, 30 mg/kg day of oral terbinafine was administered for 14 consecutive days to 11 cats showing symptomatic ringworm. The cats were checked regularly for dermatophytes by hairbrush diagnosis {{at the end of the}} treatment and 1, 2 and 3 months later. In vitro activity. The activity of terbinafine was evaluated versus M. canis strains isolated from the same cats before treatment. The MIC values were obtained with a microdilution test. Results. In spite of the fact that nd, canis showed an impressive biological variability in terms of in vitro and in vivo susceptibility to the drug, there was a correspondence between the in vitro sensitivity and the in vivo clinical response. The cats whose isolates showed the highest susceptibility to the drug were mycologically cleaned one month after the end of the therapy. The higher the resistance to the drug, the longer was the mycological recovery. Discussion. This correspondence can be referred to a precise follow up of the cats, to a correct methodology in vitro, but mostly to the fungicidal action and the pharmacokinetics of terbinafine. These factors make it possible to reach a concentration of the drug far above the minimum fungicidal concentration in the target tissues...|$|R
40|$|Aim : The present {{investigation}} evaluated the antimicrobial potential of methanolic extract of Citrus sinensis Linn. (Rutaceae) fruit peel.

Materials and Methods: The antimicrobial activity of methanolic extract of C. sinensis fruit peel was tested against three bacterial and two fungal strains. Turbidimetric or tube dilution method and paper disc diffusion method were followed. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Results: The C. sinensis fruit peel methanolic extract exhibited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli with minimum inhibitory concentration of 0. 78 μg/ ml and minimum bactericidal concentration of 6. 25 μg/ml, and appreciable antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentration of 12. 5 μg/ml. The phytochemistry of C. sinensis fruit peel methanolic extract revealed the presence of carbohydrates (reducing sugars, hexose sugars, non-reducing polysaccharides, gums, and mucilages), flavonoid glycosides, coumarin glycosides, volatile oils, organic acids, fats and fixed oils. Conclusion: Most of the organic chemical constituents reported are aromatic phenolic compounds, which are known for their wide spectra of antimicrobial activity. Therefore, the bacteriostatic and <b>fungistatic</b> <b>action</b> of the tested extract may be attributed to the presence of polyphenolic compounds.

40|$|L-arginine is {{required}} for the <b>fungistatic</b> <b>action</b> of murine macrophages in vitro. To further investigate this requirement, L-arginine metabolism by macrophages was measured under conditions where fungistasis either succeeded or failed. Macrophage fungistasis correlated with metabolism of L-arginine to citrulline, nitrite, and nitrate. The metabolic rate was dependent on extracellular L-arginine concentration, reaching a maximum of 67 nmol nitrite/h per mg protein. It accounted for one-third of arginine consumed by fungistatic macrophages. Equimolar amounts of citrulline and total nitrite plus nitrate accumulated in medium. This was consistent with the hypothesis that one of the equivalent guanidino nitrogens of L-arginine was oxidized to both nitrite and nitrate leaving L-citrulline as the amino acid reaction product. The analogue, NG-mono-methyl-L-arginine, selectively inhibited nitrogen oxidation and it was shown previously that it inhibited fungistatic capability. Resident macrophages were not fungistatic and their nitrogen oxidation was low. Once macrophages began producing nitrite/nitrate, protein synthesis was not required during the next 8 h for either fungistasis or nitrogen oxidation. Two-thirds of L-arginine consumption was due to macrophage arginase yielding L-ornithine and urea, which accumulated in medium. This activity was dissociated from macrophage fungistasis. Nitrogen oxidation metabolism by macrophages is linked to a mechanism that inhibits proliferation of fungi. This may involve synthesis of an intermediate compound(s) that has antimicrobial properties...|$|E
40|$|Six anionic {{and five}} {{nonionic}} surfactants were tested for {{their effect on}} the <b>fungistatic</b> <b>action</b> of clotrimazole against Candida albicans. All of the anionic agents that did not contain an ethylene oxide group were capable of potentiating the anti-Candida activity of clotrimazole, whereas all {{five members of the}} polyoxyethylene surfactant group, including four nonionic agents and one anionic agent, acted in an antagonistic fashion. The combination of clotrimazole and the anionic surfactant dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate was the most potent in synergy and, thus, more precise studies were made with this combination. Although appropriate combinations of the two drugs showed a potent fungicidal activity against proliferating cultures, none of these combinations tested was lethal when cell growth was restricted by nutritional deficiency. The lethal effect of the combined drugs was partly reversed when growing cultures were treated in the presence of an osmotic stabilizer. Whether cells were treated with moderate and higher concentrations of clotrimazole and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, alone or in combination, there was little change in cell wall content of total protein, carbohydrate, or lipid from that in untreated control cells. However, there was a significant decrease in the cell wall content of phospholipid when moderate concentrations of the two drugs were combined...|$|E

C. albicans or conidial suspensions of A. fumigatus are seeded into microtiter plates. Hyphal outgrowth of Aspergillus spp. was achieved by a 12 to 14 -h culture at 30 &C. Antifungal agents (amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole) were added to the cultures for 24 h. Thereafter, incubations were continued for 3 h in the presence of MTT plus 0. 1 mM menadione. Formazan formation was quantified photometrically after extraction of the formazan with acid isopropanol. Well-defined dose-response curves reflecting impairment of mitochondrial function by the antifungal agents were obtained. With C. albicans, the results correlated excellently with the MIC determinations performed according to the standard macrodilution procedure. In confirmation of a recent report, it was found that fluconazole was unable to exert its <b>fungistatic</b> <b>action</b> on a sensitive C. albicans strain in the presence of serum. The presented method can easily be integrated in the standard repertoire of a diagnostic microbiology laboratory and should prove useful as a means to assess the antifungal action of various agents on yeasts and filamentous fungi in the presence and absence of serum proteins or body fluids...|$|E

At the concentration of 1 mg/disc, all the extracts exhibited antimicrobial activity depending on the plant part and the extraction method used. The most sensitive germs were Salmonella enteridis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Candida guilliermondii with inhibition zone diameter (IZD) of 11 mm, 15 mm and 13 mm respectively. Most of extracts showed, broad activity spectrum varying from one extract to another. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of all extracts were recorded. Ten extracts displayed an excellent effect (MIC 1000 µg/ml). Leaf methanol extracts were the most efficient and Gram positive bacteria the most sensitive.

40|$|This {{in vitro}} study {{assessed}} the antimicrobial properties {{of a novel}} octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS) {{as well as of}} an innovative vaginal gel containing IASOS (SilSOS Femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag+), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag+) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag+ versus 25 mg/L Ag+). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50 - 200 mg/L Ag+), a significant 34 - 52 % drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear <b>fungistatic</b> <b>action</b> against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS.

Previous results had demonstrated that tebuconazole is able to suppress Metschnikowia bicuspidata infection at ecologically-relevant concentrations; here, we aimed to obtain an understanding of the mechanism underlying the anti-parasitic (fungicidal or <b>fungistatic)</b> <b>action</b> of tebuconazole. We exposed the Daphnia-yeast system to four nominal tebuconazole concentrations at four timings of application (according to the predicted stage of parasite development), replicated on two Daphnia genotypes, in a fully crossed experiment. An “all-or-nothing” effect was observed, with tebuconazole completely suppressing infection from 13. 5 µg l - 1 upwards, independent of the timing of tebuconazole application. A follow-up experiment confirmed that the suppression of infection occurred within a narrow range of tebuconazole concentrations (3. 65 – 13. 5 µg l - 1), although a later application of the fungicide had to be compensated for by a slight increase in concentration to elicit the same anti-parasitic effect. The mechanism behind this anti-parasitic effect seems to be the inhibition of M. bicuspidata sporulation, since tebuconazole was effective in preventing ascospore production even when applied at a later time. However, this fungicide also seemed to affect the vegetative growth of the yeast, as demonstrated by the enhanced negative effect of the parasite (increasing mortality in one of the host genotypes) at a later time of application of tebuconazole, when no signs of infection were observed. Fungicide contamination can thus affect the severity and spread of disease in natural populations, as well as the inherent co-evolutionary dynamics in host-parasite systems.

40|$|During World War II, {{the number}} of infections caused by the {{dermatophytes}} reached alarming heights in the armed forces. This fact stimulated the search for agents that could not only inhibit the fungi but also kill them. Therefore, in investigating chemotherapeutic agents, both fungistatic and fungicidal activity must be examined, and to accomplish this, standard in vitro methods must be employed that eliminate as many variables as possible. Species and strains must be examined to ascertain if the difference in susceptibility to the agent precludes {{the use of a}} single species or strain of standard resistance for the test organism. The present studies represent an attempt to devise satisfactory methods for fungistatic and fungicidal tests, using the fatty acids as the anti-fungal agent, and to study the relative susceptibilities of several species and strains of fungi to these agents. Peck and Rosenfeld 29 demonstrated the <b>fungistatic</b> <b>action</b> of various fatty acids against Trichophyton gypseum. Keeney and Brayles' 8 investigated the fungistatic and fungicidal action of sodium propionate and pointed out that this salt was fungistatic for both Trichophyton gypseum and Trichophyton purpureum, although at different concentrations, but fungicidal for Trichophyton purpureum alone. In 1941, Cowles ' had demonstrated that as the pH was lowered increased bactericidal action was exhibited by the fatty acids, and that at any fixed pH level the effective concentrations of the series varied according to Traube's rule. Kirby et al. 23 concluded that the disinfecting property of acetic acid against molds was a function of pH. To see if the observations of Cowles held true for the dermatophytes a number of experiments were undertaken. The fungistatic and fungicidal action of the series of fatty acids from formic acid to caprylic acid in the saturated series was investigated originally, pelargonic aci...|$|E
40|$|A quitosana é polímero derivado da desacetilação da quitina, a qual é encontrada em grande quantidade na carapaça de crustáceos, sendo estudada com potencial para controle de fitopatógenos, tanto por sua ação fungistática direta, quanto pela capacidade de induzir a defesa das plantas, indicando-se a presença de moléculas com características elicitoras. Nesse sentido foram desenvolvidos três experimentos no ano de 2011, na Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná – Câmpus Dois Vizinhos, com objetivos de avaliar o potencial deste polímero na indução de resistência de plântulas de Acacia mearnssii e Eucalyptus saligna ao tombamento de mudas, bem como o efeito fungistático à Rhizoctonia solani in vitro. O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi inteiramente casualizado com cinco tratamentos, correspondendo às concentrações de zero; 0, 25; 0, 5; 1 e 2 % de quitosana, com cinco repetições. O Experimento I avaliou o potencial fungistático das cinco concentrações de quitosana no meio BDA sobre R. solani in vitro. Em placas de Petri® foram adicionados o meio de cultura BDA e a quitosana nas diferentes concentrações. Após a solidificação, foi colocado um disco de 10 mm de diâmetro no centro da placa, com micélio de R. solani. As placas foram mantidas em incubadora B. O. D. durante quatro dias a 25 ºC, sendo avaliado o diâmetro do halo de crescimento do fungo, nos períodos de 48; 72 e 96 horas. O Experimento II avaliou a indução de resistência em plântulas de E. saligna em resposta ao tratamento das sementes com quitosana. As sementes de E. saligna foram semeadas em substrato contaminado com micélio de R. solani cultivado e mantidas em estufa por 28 dias. Avaliou-se, durante e após o período, a porcentagem de emergência, o índice de velocidade de emergência, o damping-off de pós-emergência, a altura, o comprimento radicular e a massa de matéria fresca das plântulas, além das variáveis bioquímicas (teor de proteínas, de compostos fenólicos e a atividade da enzima fenialanina amônia-liase (FAL)). O Experimento III foi realizado com a espécie A. mearnssii e seguiu os mesmos procedimentos metodológicos de instalação e avaliação do Experimento II, diferindo apenas no tempo de permanência na estufa (22 dias). Os resultados obtidos demontraram que a quitosana apresenta efeito fungistático sobre R. solani in vitro. Além disso, apresentou capacidade de alteração da atividade da enzima FAL do E. saligna e da A. mearnssii, entretanto, somente nesta última houve redução da incidência de tombamento. O uso de concentrações de quitosana entre 0, 6 % e 0, 9 % são as mais recomendáveis para a A. mearnssii, por reduzirem o tombamento e proporcionarem maior desenvolvimento inicial das plântulas. Chitosan is a polymer {{derived from}} deacetylation of chitin, which {{is found in}} large amounts in shells of crustaceans and several studies have demonstrated the potential of this product in the control of pathogens, by both their direct <b>fungistatic</b> <b>action,</b> {{and the ability to}} induce defense in plants, indicating the presence of molecules with characteristic elicitors. In this sense three experiments were developed in 2011, in the Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná - Campus Dois Vizinhos, with the objective to evaluate the potential of the polymer in the induction of resistance in seedlings of Acacia mearnssii and Eucalyptus saligna at “Damping-off” and the fungistatic effect on Rhizoctonia solani in vitro. The experimental design was completely randomized with five treatments, corresponding to the concentrations: zero, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1 and 2 %, with zero concentration being distilled water, in five repetitions. The first experiment evaluated the fungistatic potential of different concentrations of chitosan in PDA medium on R. solani in vitro. In Petri plates were added to the culture medium PDA with chitosan at different concentrations. After solidification, a disk with 10 mm of diameter was placed {{in the center of the}} plate with mycelium of R. solani. The plates were kept in B. O. D. incubator for four days at 25 °C, and evaluated the diameter of the halo of growth of the fungus, in periods of 48, 72 and 96 hours. The second experiment evaluated the induction of resistance in seedlings of E. saligna in response to seed treatment with chitosan. The seeds of E. saligna were sown on contaminated substrate with mycelium of R. solani and incubated in greenhouse for 21 days. Was evaluated during and after the period: the percentage of emergence, emergence rate index, the post-emergence "Damping-off", height, root length and seedling fresh weight, and biochemical parameters: protein and phenolic compounds content of tissue plants and enzyme activity phenilalanina ammonia-lyase (PAL). The third experiment was conducted with the specie A. mearnssii and followed the same methodological procedures for installation and evaluation of the second experiment, differed only in length of stay in the greenhouse, kept 17 days. The results showed that chitosan at all concentrations, inhibited the growth of the fungus R. solani in vitro, the inhibition was greater with increasing polymer concentration. Chitosan has demonstrated activity in the induction of resistance, favorably affecting silvicultural and biochemical parameters for both the E. saligna as for A. mearnssii, and the concentration that brought the best results of the seedlings was 0. 5 % chitosan in the treatment of seeds. The results demonstrated decreased that chitosan has potential fungistatic effect on R. solani in vitro. Besides, presented capacity change of the activity of the PAL enzyme from E. saligna and A. mearnssii, however, only the latter showed a reduction in the incidence of damping-off. The use of chitosan concentrations of between 0. 6 % and 0. 9 % are most appropriate to A. mearnssii by reducing the damping-off and provide greater initial seedling growth...|$|E
