50|$|The exact {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was not determined with certainty due to limited telemetry instrumentation at this early phase,but Martin-Marietta concluded that low fuel tank pressure during the start procedure allowed some of the burning fuel in thecombustion chamber to leak into the fuel system through the injector head before full propellant pressure {{was obtained from the}} turbopump. GE on the other hand argued that the culprit was a loose <b>fuel</b> <b>connection,</b> and the actual truth appeared to be somewhere in-between. Investigation concluded that tank and fuel system pressure were slightly lower than nominal, which resulted in insufficient pressure in the injector head. As a result, hot combustion gas backed up into the injector head and caused a large pressure spike. The injector rings completely burned through, followed by rupture of the combustion chamber. At T+1 second, a shock wave in the thrust section of the booster ruptured a fuel feed line, completely terminating engine thrust. GE technicians had failed to catch this design flaw during testing and a temporary fix was made by increasing tank pressure. Eventually, a further modification was made by using ethane gas to increase fuel force and prevent rough start transients. The X-405 engine did not fail again on subsequent launches and static firing tests.|$|E

40|$|A liquid-fueled vehicle can be {{designed}} with little respect for the fueling infra-structure. An electric vehicle (EV) has a more intimate <b>connection</b> with its <b>fueling</b> infrastructure and this requires a rethinking of today’s pervasive models. It {{will not be enough}} to just create an “electric gasoline pump”. We believe that design-ers must re-conceptualize the process of fueling and the ways that fueling and driving patterns fit together. Further, we must consider the comparative ad-vantages and disadvantages of liquid fuels versus electricity [...] and how those may affect fueling. Otherwise, like the old generals who strategize from their prior ex-perience and “Fight the last war”, we may build an inconvenient, overly-expensive fueling infrastructure that fails to take advantages of the radical differences in the characteristics of electricity as a fuel. For example, the EV must respect fueling rate limits (in amperes or watts) that vary with location, but are inherently much slower than liquid fuels. On the other hand, EV <b>fueling</b> <b>connections</b> can provide valuable services, unlike liquid fuels that only consume energy. This example shows that the design of electrical fueling may be very different from that of liquid fuels. More broadly, the design must consider interactions between the vehicle and the user, the power capability (in watts), total energy transferred (in watt-hours), minimization of component costs, long lifetime and safety of refueling, see Fig. 1. Together, the vehicle characteris-tics, the grid-connection or electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), the build-ing circuit, the local distribution system, and energy markets must operate well to-gether...|$|R
40|$|India is {{experiencing}} energy crisis and a widening gap between energy supply and demand. The country is, however, endowed with considerable, commercially and technically available renewable resources, from which surplus agro-biomass {{is of great}} importance and a relatively untapped resource. In the policy making process, knowledge of existing biomass use, degree of social reliance, and degree of biomass availability for energy production is unequivocal and pre-conditional. Field observations, documentation, and fill-in sheet tools were used to investigate the potential of biomass resources and the existing domestic, commercial, and industrial uses of biomass in selected Indian states. To do so, a team of field observers/supervisors visited three Indian states namely: Maharashtra (MH), Madhya Pradesh (MP), and Tamil Nadu (TN). Two districts from each state were selected to collect data {{regarding the use of}} biomass and the extent of biomass availability for energy production. In total, 471 farmers were interviewed, and approximately 75 farmers with various land holdings have been interviewed in each district. The existing uses of biomass have been documented in this survey study and the results show that the majority of biomass is used as fodder for domestic livestock followed by in-site ploughing, leaving trivial surplus quantities for other productive uses. Biomass for cooking appeared to be insignificant due to the availability and access to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders in the surveyed districts. Opportunities exist to utilize roadside-dumped biomass, in-site burnt biomass, and a share of biomass used for ploughing. The GIS-based maps show that biomass availability varies considerably across the Taluks of the surveyed districts, and is highly dependent on a number of enviromental and socio-cultural factors. Developing competitive bioenergy market and enhancing and promoting access to more LPG <b>fuel</b> <b>connections</b> seem an appropriate socio-economic and environmental approach to reduce the use of biomass for indoor cooking and increasing the share of surplus biomass for energy production...|$|R

Cells were operated at 650 and 700  °C using either hydrogen or methane/air mixture. Inside the cell/tube, at the inlet, a partial oxidation catalyst (CPOX) (0.1  g) was inserted {{in the shape of a}} honeycomb structure.

In {{the core of this}} change is an aspiration of the reduced the influence of power generation on the environment and the increased power supply efficiency, which is achieved through market conditions and free competition within generation and sales of energy. These new conditions define significant changes in the design and planning of the operation of the biomass stadions. First step in the power plant development project is pre-feasibility study. As a result of such study, a developer would choose a place of construction, type of <b>fuel,</b> the <b>connection</b> scheme to the power grid, would estimate the necessary capital expenses, the energy to be produced, production costs and profits from the energy sales. Economic analysis {{is an important part of}} the pre-feasibility study of the power plant. Usually, power plant design is evaluated in terms of the profit maximization and the following economic criteria, e. g. NPV, IRR, payback time. The introduction of the markets in power systems substantially changes the approach to economic analysis of the power plant profitability. Free market and competition implies uncertainty. Consequently, the energy prices and revenues of power producers are subject to significant fluctuations. The criteria for profit maximization for the stakeholders shall be reformulated. The uncertain and random parameters, such as the ambient temperature, thermal energy consumption, price of energy has to be taken into account. The task assumes a stochastic form. An additional input information is needed in a large volume. As a result, the problem becomes much more complicated and requires new algorithms and software tools to solve it. This paper proposes a procedure to estimate the average value of these criteria taking into account random nature of the variables and using the historic values of parameters. Besides, we use neural network based algorithm to predict processes in future from the historical data.

40|$|Two {{outstanding}} {{features of the}} flowering plant family Winteraceae are the occlusion of their stomatal pores by cutin plugs {{and the absence of}} water-conducting xylem vessels. An adaptive relationship between these two unusual features has been suggested whereby stomatal plugs restrict gas exchange to compensate for the presumed poor conductivity of their vesselless wood. This hypothesized <b>connection</b> <b>fueled</b> evolutionary arguments that the vesselless condition is ancestral in angiosperms. Here we show that in Drimys winteri, a tree common to wet forests, these stomatal occlusions pose only a small fixed resistance to water loss. In addition, they modify the humidity response of guard cells such that under high evaporative demand, leaves with plugs lose water at a faster rate than leaves from which the plugs have been experimentally removed. Instead of being adaptations for drought, we present evidence that these cuticular structures function to maintain photosynthetic activity under conditions of excess water on the leaf surface. Stomatal plugs decrease leaf wettability by preventing the formation of a continuous water film that would impede diffusion of CO 2 into the leaf. Misting of leaves had no effect on photosynthetic rate of leaves with plugs, but resulted in a marked decrease (≈ 40 %) in leaves from which the plugs had been removed. These findings do not support a functional association between stomatal plugs and hydraulic competence and provide a new perspective on debates surrounding the evolution of vessels in angiosperms...|$|R
40|$|Robotic On-Orbiting Servicing (OOS) is a {{relevant}} technology development and research topic within the space community being {{the solution to}} increase the already in orbit active platforms flexibility and usability during and over their nominal lifetime. Within the broad OOS domain, the robotic refueling capability is definitely attractive as it would allow keeping operational in orbit platforms which could still keep working fruitfully but actually switched off because of fuel depletion; refueling capabilities are also envisaged to enhance usability of small LEO launchers: tugs dedicated to LEO-GEO payload transfer, permanently located in LEO and regularly refueled to accomplish the orbit transfers, would be available, relaxing the in orbit transportation current bottleneck. The design of On-Orbit Refueling (OOF) systems is intrinsically multi-disciplinary as structural interfaces, fluidic, thermo-dynamics control, material selection, relative dynamics and procedural aspects must be simultaneously taken into account and harmonized. As far as the mechanical interfaces are dealt with, two strategies can be traded-off: the docking and the berthing philosophies, the former of which has a strong heritage from the already flying solutions on the International Space Station (ISS), the latter having the strongest reference on the ISS robotic arms. Moreover, while the former heavily affect {{the design of the}} two space vehicle to be connected, the latter, at least on the target satellite, imposes lighter configuration requirements, opening the door to a larger set of applicability and reusability. The paper critically discusses the mechanical interface strategies, highlighting the re-usability of existing technologies for OOF design and implementation and their area of applicability and presents the rationale behind the technical requirements for the berthing strategy, more flexible and exploitable in OOS than the docking strategy. The berthing functionality is accomplished by a robotic arm which supports the fluidic line too, the end effector of which ensure the <b>fuel</b> line <b>connection</b> between the chaser and the target. A feasibility study run to assess the drivers and the sensible parameters to design a service module (chaser) to accomplish OOF.

In particular, the thermodynamic analyses drove the thermal control, as well as the fuel transfer actuation strategy, and feeding lines, valves and tanks design; furthermore, by coupling the fuel transfer analysis together with the stuck (target) dynamics, drivers on the flexible robotic connection and operational constraints were obtained and are hereinafter presented...|$|R
40|$|Kerosene subsidy {{reform is}} a key policy concern in India and other {{developing}} countries. As kerosene is widely used for lighting in India, any price change will likely have considerable public welfare impacts on the large fraction of the poor {{who do not have}} access to reliable electricity supply for lighting. In this study, we assess historic kerosene use for residential lighting across population groups separated by urban/rural, expenditure, and electricity service levels using data from India. Consumption trends are used to inform a service demand model and evaluate how changes in <b>fuel</b> price, electricity <b>connection,</b> and supply reliability influence environmental, health and economic outcomes. We find that users relying on kerosene for supplemental lighting—in combination ('stacked') with electricity—accounted for 64 % of residential kerosene consumed for lighting in 2005. Tested scenarios that addressed service needs of supplemental users had the greatest welfare benefits, especially in the future. Scenarios reducing PM 2. 5 emissions from kerosene lighting can avert between 50 and 300 thousand disability adjusted life years relative to a baseline scenario in 2030. Lighting kerosene is highly price sensitive, resulting in a drop in demand of 97 % in a scenario in which current subsidies are phased out by 2030. Deadweight loss of the subsidy in 2005 is estimated at $ 200 – 950 million, with three quarters attributable to supplemental kerosene lighting. Support for cleaner lighting technologies not reliant on fossil fuel subsidies would appear to be 'no regrets' or 'co-benefits' options for India, and could be implemented in parallel with subsidy removal...|$|R

The experimental facility is composed of a Turbec T 100 micro gas turbine package modified for the <b>fuel</b> cell emulator <b>connection,</b> a set of pipes designed for by-pass, measurement or bleed reasons, and a high temperature volume designed for the stack dimension physical emulation.

40|$|The biomass pellet consumption, {{both in the}} {{industry}} and in residential appliances, has increased during the latest years and this is expected to continue. In order to handle the demand, more ash rich (> 0, 5 wt-%) raw materials have been introduced as energy wood and other forest based <b>fuels.</b> In <b>connection</b> with this, ash related problems as fouling, slagging and corrosion have occurred. However introduction of peat as a co-combustion fuel {{has turned out to}} have positive effects on these problems. Earlier research shows that introduction of peat into biomass results in reduced bed agglomeration, fouling and corrosion. Nevertheless the previous works has mainly focused on fluidized bed boilers with bed agglomeration and deposit formation in focus. Experimental work in small and residential combustion appliances is still scarce (e. g. in grate firing boilers and burner’s). In this work the influence of peat addition to biomass pellets on combustion characteristics here defined in terms of slagging characteristics, operational maintenance, gaseous- and particulate emissions in residential appliances, were determined. Six peat samples representing a broad variation in ash forming matter of Scandinavian peats were chosen in this study. They were co-pelletized with sawdust, energy wood, forest residue as well as wheat straw and combusted in a P-labeled underfed commercial pellet burner (15 kW) installed in a reference boiler. The NO and SO 2 emissions were generally higher when introducing peat. However these emissions are both fuel and combustion specific and the increment has not been further investigated to conclude its origin. The particle emissions were in all cases totally dominated by fine (< 1 μm) particles and contained high concentrations of K. When adding peat containing high amounts of Si and/or clay minerals into the wood derived fuels a clear reduction of emitted fine particles were shown. The likely mechanism is that the reactive Si and/or the clay minerals from the peat react with K vapor from the biomass forming K-silicates that will stay in the coarse ash fractions, hence capturing the K. The reduction was most obvious for the biomasses short in reactive Si as sawdust and forest residue. In fact a K reduction of up to 70 % was shown when adding a Si- or clay-rich peat to forest residue. However, when adding a peat with low ash content and high Ca content the reduction was diminished. It was further shown that addition of peat to the K and Si rich wheat straw did not generally affect the reduction of fine particle- and deposit forming K i. e. only a dilution effect of ash forming matter occurred. The slagging tendency was increased in all cases when peat was introduced hence also the operational maintenance was disturbed. However, great differences between different peat assortments existed in this aspect. High Si together with low Ca contents in the peat resulted in the most severe slagging, whereas a peat with higher Ca/Si ratio gave a significant lower slagging tendency. The sawdust was generally more affected by the peat addition than the other studied biofuels. In order to receive a considerable particle reduction in parallel with a manageable slagging tendency when using "problematic" biomass fuels in small scale burners and grate boilers, co-combustion with a carex based peat with a high ash content and relatively high Ca/Si ratio is suggested.

40|$|The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) {{program has}} both “outcome” and “process” goals because it must address both waste already accumulating {{as well as}} {{completing}} the <b>fuel</b> cycle in <b>connection</b> with advanced nuclear power plant concepts. The outcome objectives are waste geological repository capacity and cost, energy security and sustainability, proliferation resistance, fuel cycle economics, and safety. The process objectives are readiness to proceed and adaptability and robustness {{in the face of}} uncertainties. A classic decision-making approach to such a multi-attribute problem would be to weight individual quantified criteria and calculate an overall figure of merit. This is inappropriate for several reasons. First, the goals are not independent. Second, the importance of different goals varies among stakeholders. Third, the importance of different goals is likely to vary with time, especially the “energy future. ” Fourth, some key considerations are not easily or meaningfully quantifiable at present. Instead, at this point, we have developed 16 questions the AFCI program should answer and suggest an approach of determining for each whether relevant options improve meeting each of the program goals. We find that it is not always clear which option is best for a specific question and specific goal; this helps identify key issues for future work. In general, we suggest attempting to create as many win-win decisions (options that are attractive or neutral to most goals) as possible. Thus, to help clarify why the program is exploring the options it is, and to set the stage for future narrowing of options, we have developed 16 questions, as follows: · What are the AFCI program goals? · Which potential waste disposition approaches do we plan for? · What are the major separations, transmutation, and fuel options? · How do we address proliferation resistance? · Which potential energy futures do we plan for? · What potential external triggers do we plan for? · Should we separate uranium? · If we separate uranium, should we recycle it, store it or dispose of it? · Is it practical to plan to fabricate and handle “hot” fuel? · Which transuranic elements (TRU) should be separated and transmuted? · Of those TRU separated, which should be transmuted together? · Should we separate and/or transmute Cs and Sr isotopes that dominate near-term repository heating? · Should we separate and/or transmute very long-lived Tc and I isotopes? · Which separation technology? · What mix of transmutation technologies? · What fuel technology best supports the above decisions...|$|R
5000|$|The {{tendency}} of the 1.5 tonne DB 606 [...] "power system" [...] engines to catch fire became increasingly serious as the test programme progressed, {{and many of the}} He 177A-0 series of pre-production prototypes were destroyed in accidents or engine related incidents. The DB 606 engine had first been introduced on the Heinkel He 119 and later used on other aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 261 where they functioned as intended, but the extremely tight cowlings on the He 177A led to considerable problems, the most common being in-flight engine fires and engine overheating. There were several reasons for the flammability of the DB 606 engine as installed in the Greif's engine nacelle accommodations, one of which was the common [...] "central" [...] exhaust manifold, serving a total of 12 cylinders, on the two inner cylinder banks of the twinned DB 601 component engines making up a DB 606. This central exhaust system routinely became excessively hot, causing the usual accumulation of oil and grease {{in the bottom of the}} engine cowling to catch fire. When the pilot throttled back there was a tendency for the mechanical fuel injection pump on each component DB 601 engine to [...] "lag" [...] in their response in such situations, and deliver more fuel than was required by the engine, in addition to which the <b>fuel</b> injection pump <b>connections</b> often leaked. To reduce the aircraft's weight no firewall had been provided, and the aft end of each DB 606 was fitted so close to the main spar — with the rear two-thirds of the component powerplants' engine blocks being placed behind the wing's leading edge — that there was insufficient space for the fuel/oil fluid lines and electrical harnesses. The engines' exterior surfaces within the cowlings were frequently saturated with fuel and oil from leaking connections. At high altitude the oil tended to foam due to a badly designed oil pump, reducing its lubricating qualities. Insufficient lubrication resulted in the disintegration of the connecting rod bearings, resulting in the conrods sometimes bursting through either one of the component engine crankcases and puncturing the oil tanks, the contents of which would pour on to the often-overheated central exhaust pipe collector. The tightly packed nature of the [...] "power system" [...] engine installations on the He 177A, with the extreme rearwards location of the component engines in their nacelles, also led to poor maintenance access as well as very poor ventilation. As a result of these factors, in addition to a lack of routine maintenance in the field, the DB 606 powerplants frequently caught fire in flight. While theoretically sound, the effort to create an adequately powerful engine for the He 177 by mechanically coupling two pairs of lower-power engines into two heavy [...] "power system" [...] powerplant setups proved to be difficult to perfect, and led to numerous engine complications, turning out to be most numerous with the service test He 177A-0 and initial production A-1 models.|$|R
