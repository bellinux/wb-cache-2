Prior work in using three dimensional graphics to aid abstract data visualization has concentrated on increasing the quantity of data visualized, using the third dimension as a natural but symmetrical extension to the world of two <b>dimensional</b> <b>layouts.</b> Little has been done, however, to actually use it to capture the semantics of abstract data. This paper presents the notion of using the third dimension asymmetrically so that our familiarity with two <b>dimensional</b> <b>layouts</b> and our abilities to mentally group things confined to a plane are exploited, leaving the third dimension as a means to encode semantic information.

40|$|We {{describe}} a heuristic method for drawing graphs {{which uses a}} multilevel technique combined with a force directed placement algorithm. The multilevel process groups vertices to form clusters, uses the clusters to define a new graph and is repeated until the graph size falls below some threshold. The coarsest graph is then given an initial layout and the layout is successively optimised on all the graphs starting with the coarsest and ending with the original. In this way the multilevel algorithm both accelerates and gives a more global quality to the force directed placement.

40|$|We are {{investigating}} constraint directed heuristic search {{as a means}} for performing design in the field of space planning. Space planning is selecting, dimensioning, locating and shaping design units to create two <b>dimensional</b> <b>layouts</b> based on functional, topological and geometrical considerations.

Constraints are used to represent domain knowledge, to define the search space by specifying operators in means ends analysis manner, and to rate the partial candidate solutions using importances associated with each constraint Search is carried out opportunistically. The philosophy behind opportunism is that understanding the approximate topology of the search space will lead to efficient search. Uncertainty associated with constraints is derived and used to identify islands of certainty in the search space, which are used as starting points and anchors for search. The knowledge that enables us to identify opportunistic decisions are interactions between constraints and the usefulness of a constraint in different situations. The resulting uncertainty measure will be tested by observing the problem solving behavior it causes in different search spaces. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{the concept}} of "universal design", which is to design {{products}} equally usable by diverse users as much as possible, has become important. To enable designers to more certainly and efficiently design products which offer maximum usability for diverse users and are internationally marketable, a general and systematic methodology for universal design is important. As a methodology of supporting systematic idea generation for universal design, in this paper, we propose a structure-control approach matrix which should systematically cover all possible design approaches of product structure and control for user diversity. Also, in this paper, we propose a methodology of representing quantitative user diversity as intervals and conducting their calculations using interval arithmetic to evaluate, compare and optimize design ideas considering quantitative user diversity in a general and systematic manner. The proposed methodology and implemented software are applied to two simplified design problems considering quantitative user diversity: a design of a button height on a wall and a design of three <b>dimensional</b> <b>layouts</b> of cellular phone buttons.

40|$|We {{describe}} a heuristic method for drawing graphs {{which uses a}} multilevel framework combined with a force-directed placement algorithm. The multilevel technique matches and coalesces pairs of adjacent vertices to define a new graph and is repeated recursively to create a hierarchy of increasingly coarse graphs, G 0, G 1, …, GL. The coarsest graph, GL, is then given an initial layout and the layout is refined and extended to all the graphs starting with the coarsest and ending with the original. At each successive change of level, l, the initial layout for Gl is taken from its coarser and smaller child graph, Gl+ 1, and refined using force-directed placement. In this way the multilevel framework both accelerates and appears to give a more global quality to the drawing. The algorithm can compute both 2 & 3 <b>dimensional</b> <b>layouts</b> and we demonstrate it on examples {{ranging in size from}} 10 to 225, 000 vertices. It is also very fast and can compute a 2 D layout of a sparse graph in around 12 seconds for a 10, 000 vertex graph to around 5 - 7 minutes for the largest graphs.

40|$|Many {{systems in}} the modern world are readily {{represented}} as graphs; with nodes representing objects within the system, and edges the relationships between them. The effectiveness of visualisations of complex systems is often dependent on the layout of their graphs; a good layout can provide ready understanding of complexity, while a poor layout does nothing to aid comprehension and can even obscure information. We examine the use of force directed placement (FDP) as an algorithm for automatically laying out connected graphs and introduce ANGLE, a software tool for experimentation with graph layout. FDP assigns properties to nodes and edges analogous with real world objects; principally treating edges as springs and nodes as bodies that are mutually repellent. Iterating over the graph and positioning the nodes according to the notional forces upon them provides a means to arrive at a layout. Previous work has focused primarily on two <b>dimensional</b> <b>layouts</b> with various force models. We tackle the extension into three dimensions and propose a new force model that produces a more reliable quality of layout in a shorter time than earlier models.

Electrical schemas, chemical equations and mathematical expressions (MEs) are examples of such 2 D languages. In this case, the recognition problem is particularly difﬁcult due to the two <b>dimensional</b> <b>layout</b> of the language. This paper presents an online handwritten mathematical expression recognition system that handles mathematical expression recognition as a simultaneous optimization of expression segmentation, symbol recognition, and 2 D structure recognition under the restriction of a mathematical expression grammar. The originality of the approach is a global strategy allowing learning mathematical symbols and spatial relations directly from complete expressions. A new contextual modeling is proposed for combining syntactic and structural information. Those models are used to ﬁnd the most likely combination of segmentation/recognition hypotheses proposed by a 2 D segmentation scheme. Thus, models are based on structural information concerning the symbol layout.

40|$|The use of {{commodity}} hardware has {{played an important}} role in the construction of high performance computers in recent years. In particular this model of computation has become very popular in research groups and organisations due to its favourable price/performance ratio (Becker et al., 1995). Although cluster computing has been very successful for applications consisting of a large number of serial tasks characterised by a low communication cost, the approach has been less successful in the scenario where a small number of tasks with high communication costs need to be executed; such as in multigrid methods and other parallel iterative solvers (Buyya et al., 2002). The Hilbert graph introduced in this work is formed by the superposition of a Hilbert curve with an extended mesh. Nodes are placed along the middle of a segment in the Hilbert curve and the extended mesh is formed by joining nodes with the same horizontal or vertical position.

40|$|International audienceComponent and {{facility}} layout {{plays an important}} role in the design and usability of many engineering products and systems as mechanical design, {{facility layout}}, process plan, management and architecture including ship compartment layout. In real-world applications, all designer's requirements can not be formulated as simple mathematical expressions. The accessibility to components is one of these requirements which can not easily be taken into account in the layout optimization process. Firstly, this accessibility deals with the required vacant space located around the component and used to guarantee the correct mechanism of the component. This space is described, in this paper, as a virtual component with particular attributes. Moreover, the accessibility requirement means that each component has to be attainable from the container's entry. In order to consider it in the layout optimization process, designers usually use their expertise to modify the layout problem description and satisfy a priori all the accessibility specifications. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on the integration of the accessibility to components in the layout problem formulation. The accessibility is considered as a design constraint or an objective of the optimization problem. This method is applied on a two dimensional real-world problem which deals with the layout optimization of components inside a shelter.

Among all the interacting parts, three components stand out: they are pumps and turbines (turbopumps), and the thrust chamber. To obtain an understanding of the overall {{rocket propulsion}} system characteristics, one starts from analyzing the interactions among these three components. It is therefore of utmost importance to be able to satisfactorily characterize the turbopump, level by level, at all phases of a vehicle design cycle. Here at NASA Glenn Research Center, as the starting phase of a rocket engine design, specifically a Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engine design, we adopted the approach of using a high level system cycle analysis code (NESS) to obtain an initial analysis of the operational characteristics of a turbopump required in the propulsion system. A set of turbopump design codes (PumpDes and TurbDes) were then executed to obtain sizing and performance characteristics of the turbopump that were consistent with the mission requirements. A set of turbopump analyses codes (PUMPA and TURBA) were applied to obtain the full performance map for each of the turbopump components; a two <b>dimensional</b> <b>layout</b> of the turbopump based on these mean line analyses was also generated.

What bees see while navigating, {{depends on the}} appearance of the cues, the bee’s current position, orientation and movement relative to them. Here we analyse the detailed flight behaviour during the localisation of a goal surrounded by cylinders that are characterised either by a high contrast in luminance and texture or by mostly motion contrast relative to the background. By relating flight behaviour {{to the nature of the}} information available from these landmarks, we aim to identify behavioural strategies that facilitate the processing of visual information during goal localisation. We decompose flight behaviour into prototypical movements using clustering algorithms in order to reduce the behavioural complexity. The determined prototypical movements reflect the honeybee’s saccadic flight pattern that largely separates rotational from translational movements. During phases of translational movements between fast saccadic rotations, the bees can gain information about the three <b>dimensional</b> <b>layout</b> of their environment from the translational optic flow. The prototypical movements reveal the prominent role of sideways and up- or downward movements, which can help bees to gather information about objects, particularly in the frontal visual field. We find that the occurrence of specific prototypes depends on the bees’ distance from the landmarks and the feeder and that changing the texture of the landmarks evokes different prototypical movements. The adaptive use of different behavioural prototypes shapes the visual input and can facilitate information processing in the bees’ visual system during local navigation...|$|R
