40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{examination}} is to evaluate the risk of perforation during endoscopy of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Patients and methods used: 1210 diagnostic <b>gastroduodenoscopies</b> and 412 colonoscopies of hospitalized patients were performed by two experienced endoscopists for the period March 2007 - March 2012 at MHAT- Varna, MMA. The endoscopies were performed without premedication and sedation. The patients were examined for complications of the procedure {{during and after the}} endoscopy. One of the most serious complications is the perforation of the oesophagus, stomach or the large intestine. Results: We had no perforations caused by the examination during the 1210 upper endoscopies performed. We had 2 perforations (0, 48 %) from the 412 colonoscopies performed, which were treated successfully surgically. Conclusions: The perforation is a rare but serious complication of the endoscopy of gastrointestinal tract, which can be healed completely...|$|R

5000|$|The {{hereditary}} colorectal cancers (CRCs) {{associated with}} mutations in the proofreading ability of POLD1 and POLE are sometimes termed as “polymerase proofreading associated polyposis” (PPAP), (although {{at least one}} study has identified POLD1 mutations associated with non-polyposis CRC). POLD1 mutations have also been {{associated with an increased}} cancer predisposition of endometrial cancer. [...] A recent study has suggested guidelines for genetic testing for POLD1 mutations which include: 1) Occurrence of 20-100 adenomas, and 2) Family history that meets the Amsterdam II criteria for colorectal and endometrial cancers. Current clinical testing guidelines for families with mutations in POLD1/POLE include colonoscopies (every 1-2 years), <b>gastroduodenoscopies</b> (every 3 years) starting early (20-25), possibility for brain tumors and endometrial cancer screening (beginning at 40 for female carriers). Currently studies are underway to determine the exact cancer risk from specific POLD1 mutations. Current data suggest that mutations in this gene are highly penetrant. Another recent study showed that mutations affecting Polδ and Polε mutations can co-occur along with MMR mutations. This suggests panel gene testing should include MMR and Pol genes even in patients with MSI.|$|R

The mechanism of injury is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the protective effect of two drugs that give different degrees of acid inhibition against naproxen-induced gastroduodenal injury. Fifteen volunteers aged 22 - 28 years underwent pre- and post-treatment <b>gastroduodenoscopies</b> during three treatment periods (that is, six examinations), and mucosal injury was graded on a Lanza scale ranging from 0 to 4. The subjects received placebo, 150 mg rantidine twice daily, or 40 mg omeprazole in a double-blind, random-order design for 7 days. Plain naproxen, 500 mg twice daily, was given on days 3 - 7. The mean injury score for the stomach during placebo treatment was 1. 53, and ranitidine gave 44 % and omeprazole 40 % reduction compared with placebo, which did not reach statistical significance. About 70 % of the stomach injury was located in the antrum. The mean injury score during placebo for the duodenum was 1. 93, and ranitidine gave 80 % and omeprazole 90 % reduction (p = 0. 004). In conclusion, a correlation between different degrees of acid suppression and a protective effect on the gastroduodenal mucosa could not be shown. The study suggests that acid plays a major role in acute naproxen-induced injury to the duodenal mucosa, and a moderate acid reduction is adequate for protection. In the stomach acid seems to play a minor role in the mucosal injury, but physiochemical contact with naproxen in the antrum and a cyclooxygenase inhibition are of greater importance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Gastrointestinal tract {{soft tissues}} {{metastasis}} {{is a well-known}} occurrence with invasive lobular breast cancer subtypes. Gastric involvement is more common, with reports of both diffuse and localized involvements. Usually, a gastric localized involvement presents as wall thickening with an appearance {{similar to that of}} a gastrointestinal stromal tumour; rarely does a localized metastatic deposit grow aggressively to present as a large tumour causing obstructive symptoms. Our case highlights one such unusual presentation in a patient presenting with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports on a similar presentation occurring from a localized metastasis. Case presentation A 65 -year-old Caucasian woman awaiting an outpatient oral <b>gastroduodenoscopy</b> for symptoms of intermittent vomiting, epigastric pains and weight loss of six weeks’ duration presented acutely with symptoms of haematemesis and abdominal distension. An initial contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed a grossly dilated stomach with a locally advanced stenosing tumour mass at the pylorus. Our patient had a history of left mastectomy and axillary clearance followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy for an oestrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-positive, grade 2, invasive lobular breast cancer. The oral <b>gastroduodenoscopy</b> confirmed the computed tomography findings; biopsies of the pyloric mass on immunohistochemistry stains were strongly positive for pancytokeratin and gross cystic disease fluid proteins, consistent with an invasive lobular breast cancer metastasis. She received a palliative gastrojejunal bypass and her adjuvant endocrine treatment was switched over to exemestane. Conclusion Our case highlights the aggressive behaviour of a localized gastric metastasis that is unusual and unexpected. Gastrointestinal symptomatology can be non-specific and, at times, non-diagnostic on conventional mucosal biopsies. A high index of clinical suspicion in patients with a previous history of invasive lobular breast cancer can aid in an early diagnosis and treatment. A combined treatment approach with chemoendocrine therapies achieves remission and improves patient survival. </p...|$|E
