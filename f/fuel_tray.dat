40|$|The {{flexural}} and compressive {{properties of}} {{glass reinforced polyester}} (GRP) plates after exposure to fire are investigated. Large plates of the GRP composite were exposed to a kerosene <b>fuel</b> <b>tray</b> fire for times up to 10 min. The plates suffered thermally induced damage which increased with exposure time and consisted of charring, due to combustion of the polyester matrix, and delamination cracking. The residual flexural and compressive properties were measured at room temperature, and were found to decrease rapidly with increasing exposure time. It is shown that the post-fire structural properties can be approximated by modelling the burnt plate as a bi-layer material using a rule-of-mixtures formulation. It is proposed that the models {{can be used to}} estimate the structural deterioration after a fire of flat single-skin plates used in GRP ship construction. Crown © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Rope fans tend to put off more flame than torch fans. Fueling rope wick fans can be difficult at best without a <b>fueling</b> <b>tray,</b> though it is relatively common practice to pour the fuel over the fan, into the fuel dump, keeping it contained.|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of fire {{within a}} deep (high-depth-to-height ratio) enclosure with various openings {{at one end}} has been studied experimentally. Sixteen <b>fuel</b> <b>trays</b> were placed within an 8. 0 m long × 2. 0 m wide × 0. 6 m high steel enclosure. The experiments confirmed previous smaller-scale experiments, which showed that the fires in deep enclosures are strongly influenced by the ventilation and {{are not at all}} uniform throughout the depth of the enclosure. The severity of exposure of structural members is much more severe close to the ceiling near the front of the enclosure compared with the back of the enclosure. Based on the test data that can be found in this report, as well as other well-known tests, a heat release rate–time–position model is proposed for fire development in deep enclosures. The same sets of test data are also used to evaluate other model predictions. Finally, a recommendation is made to choose a model based on the shape of the enclosure (i. e. deep, wide, square, etc.) ...|$|R

Such information {{is necessary for the}} preplanning and implementation of ventilation changes during mine fire fighting and rescue operations. The fire intensity varied from 50 kW to 300 kW depending upon the <b>fuel</b> <b>tray</b> area. Airflow in the 2 m high and 2. 9 m wide coal mine entry was regulated during the course of each experiment; measured upwind from the fire as an average over the entry cross-section with an ultrasonic airflow sensor; and recorded dynamically with a mine monitoring system. The extent of smoke reversal was monitored with light obscuration monitors, ionization smoke sensors, and visual observations.

40|$|When {{a pool of}} {{flammable}} liquid is ignited, the flame spread rate can vary widely depending on the initial fuel temperature, pool geometry, ambient atmospheric conditions, and gravitational level. There is substantial decades-old debate in the scientific literature {{about the role of}} gravity in these phenomena. The objective of the research was to measure ignition and flame spread across liquid pools in both normal and microgravity with and without forced airflow, and to obtain detailed thermal and velocity field data for comparison to a predictive numerical model that is concurrently being developed. To that end, an experiment known as Spread Across Liquids 5 (SAL 5) was designed to be conducted in a low-gravity environment on a sounding rocket. Unfortunately, during the sounding rocket flight the <b>fuel</b> <b>tray</b> for the experiment failed to fill properly prior to ignition. The primary cause of the failure to fill properly is the geometry of the fuel tray; that is, the presence of the gaps on the side walls and the sharp edge around the thermocouple through-holes. The contamination resulting from the cleaning process is a strong secondary factor which would have prevented proper, timely filling had the primary cause not been present...|$|E

40|$|Results from an {{experimental}} program undertaken {{to study the}} effect of fuel quantity and location on ethanol pool fires in the open and in a small enclosure (an ISO 9705 room) are compared with simulations using the Fire Dynamics Simulator version 4. 03 (FDS 4). The <b>fuel</b> in <b>trays</b> is placed at three locations (front, back, and center) within the room enclosure as well as directly under the calorimeter hood. The measured heat release rate (HRR) is found to vary substantially when a fuel package consisting of different quantities of ethanol is placed at different locations within the room. Instead of prescribing this HRR into the FDS simulation, these experimental results are compared with HRR predictions obtained using the FDS 4 combustion model. The comparison reveals that there are significant and variable differences between the experimental results and the FDS 4 predictions in contrast to simulations where the HRR is prescribed. ...|$|R
50|$|Unlike coal or wood, the jet burners used did {{not require}} {{additional}} draught. The boiler was fired with a pressure jet burner, a small quantity of pressurised naphtha being tapped off from the boiler. A prominent tube and funnel {{on the front of}} the boiler casing (sometimes mistaken for a whistle) is the air inlet. The fuel jet mixes with the downwards air flow in this vertical tube, then the mixed air and fuel is fed to a ring-shaped burner inside the boiler casing. For starting, a hand air pump was used to pressurise the fuel tank and encourage fuel flow, together with pre-heating of the burner coil by lighting a little of the <b>fuel</b> in a <b>tray</b> below it.|$|R
40|$|In {{practical}} applications, flammable {{materials are}} often arranged in arrays of discrete objects whose combustion properties {{may be different}} {{as that of a}} homogeneous material. In this study, the influence of spacing between arrays of wooden dowels on the rate of upward flame spread through arrays has been studied. This configuration in some ways modelled physics that similar with flame spread through wildland <b>fuels</b> and cable <b>trays.</b> A single dowel was ignited at the base of an array of birch dowels with fixed spacings of 0. 75, 0. 875, 1. 0 and 1. 5 cm and allowed to spread upwards. Flame spread along the center columns, burning duration times and horizontal flame spread were plotted and compared with previous theory (Gollner et al., 2012 and Vogel and Williams, 1970). As a result of experimental results, it was shown that flame spread rates will decrease after a critical spacing is reached, most likely due to limited availability of oxygen. Experiments on horizontally-propagating flames through dowel arrays were performed to further show this effect...|$|R
40|$|A {{facility}} {{to evaluate the}} fire endurance of mine stoppings was constructed by the Bureau of Mines in the multiple entry section of the Bruceton (PA) Experimental Mine. Stoppings up to 6 by 18 ft can be tested in a manner simulating mine conditions. The stopping is subjected to a 70 -min liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>tray</b> fire with an energy output of 75, 000 Btu/min. The stopping and adjacent areas are instrumented with thermocouples and heat flux gauges. Data acquisition is by an automatic data logger capable of continuously recording over 100 channels of information. Two 8 -in-thick concrete block stoppings and a galvanized steel stopping were tested. A crack developed on the fire side surface of the block stoppings where the flames were most intense. However, the temperatures of the unexposed surfaces of the stoppings never exceeded 800 C and the surfaces were undamaged. The steel stopping retained its structural integrity during the test. The temperature of the unexposed steel surface reached 5000 C, but combustible materials located 1 ft from the surface did not ignite. A 3 / 4 -in-thick coating of construction plaster {{was applied to the}} fire side of the previously tested uncoated steel stopping. The quantity of heat energy transmitted across this coated metal stopping was reduced approximately 50 %. All stoppings prevented the passage of flame and smoke...|$|E
40|$|Usually, {{during a}} fire inside a tunnel, the average {{heat release rate}} (HRR) is {{estimated}} according {{to the type of}} vehicle. Frequently, the overall HRR is considered, however it is also necessary to know its time evolution to design real time systems, particularly ventilation, which respond to fire events or signals as fast as possible. Nowadays, there is not a well established and generally accepted procedure to know the power liberated at each instant of time inside an operational tunnel. That procedure could help in taking the correct actions to adapt the tunnel ventilation in order to diminish the effects of the fire and the smoke. This work shows a method to calculate the heat release rate using sensors that can be installed inside an operational road tunnel. Besides, the location of the fire could also be calculated accurately and quickly. To achieve the previous purposes, a stationary database that depends on HRR, its location, and the ventilation speed is calculated with CFD programs; the data are compared with temperatures measured by the sensors located inside the tunnel. The program used to generate the database is the simplified model UPMTUNNEL. The predictions of the model are compared with the results of calculations carried out using the general purpose code FLUENT, and with measurements done in a tunnel with a real fire, produced with a <b>fuel</b> <b>tray...</b>|$|E
40|$|The goal of our {{research}} on flame spread across pools of liquid fuel remains the quantitative identification of the mechanisms that control the rate and nature of flame spread when the initial temperature of the liquid pool is below the fuel's flash point temperature. As described in, four microgravity (mu-g) sounding rocket flights examined the effect of forced opposed airflow over a 2. 5 cm deep x 2 cm wide x 30 cm long pool of 1 -butanol. Among many unexpected findings, {{it was observed that}} the flame spread is much slower and steadier than in 1 g where flame spread has a pulsating character. Our numerical model, restricted to two dimensions, had predicted faster, pulsating flame spread in mu-g. In a test designed to achieve a more 2 -D experiment, our investigation of a shallow, wide pool (2 mm deep x 78 mm wide x 30 cm long) was unsuccessful in mu-g, due to an unexpectedly long time required to fill the tray. As such, the most recent Spread Across Liquids (SAL) sounding rocket experiment had two principal objectives: 1) determine if pulsating flame spread in deep fuel trays would occur under the conditions that a state-of-the-art computational combustion code and short-duration drop tower tests predict; and 2) determine if a long, rectangular, shallow <b>fuel</b> <b>tray</b> could achieve a visibly flat liquid surface across the whole tray without spillage in the mu-g time allotted. If the second objective was met, the shallow tray was to be ignited to determine the nature of flame spread in mu-g for this geometry. For {{the first time in the}} experiment series, two fuel trays - one deep (30 cm long x 2 cm wide x 25 mm deep) and one shallow (same length and width, but 2 mm deep) [...] were flown. By doing two independent experiments in a single flight, a significant cost savings was realized. In parallel, the computational objective was to modify the code to improve agreement with earlier results. This last objective was achieved by modifying the fuel mass diffusivity and adding a parameter to correct for radiative and lateral heat loss...|$|E
