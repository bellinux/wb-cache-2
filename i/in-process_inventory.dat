40|$|The subject {{dealt with}} in this thesis is the {{development}} of a procedure suitable for practical application aiming at the improved organization and planning of production processes, in particular of production logistics. The procedure developed contributes to harmonizing the company's own requirements of a steady utilization of capacity and low capital tie-up - and thus reduced volumes of <b>in-process</b> <b>inventories</b> and of products in stock - with the customers' requirements of strict adherence to due dates and short delivery periods. The focus of this approach is on the optimization of lot sizes, since these have a substantial influence on throughput times and inventories. This optimization is achieved under consideration of dynamic system performance and the system interactions, such as for instance the competition of the jobs for production equipment or capacity restrictions. The approach for lot size planning presented is based on a model representing <b>in-process</b> <b>inventories</b> and costs. On the basis of an initial solution, which comprises the lot sizes of all the products which can be manufactured, the corresponding inventories are modelled using a queueing model of the underlying manufacturing system. These inventories are taken into account together with the lot sizes, when costs are assessed by means of suitable cost functions. The optimization algorithm changes the combination of the lot sizes considered ('lotsize vector'), so as to reduce the costs depending on the new lotsize combination. For this purpose the gradient search method is used. The sequence 'assessment of inventories - assessment of costs - adjustment of the lotsize vector' is repeated until a cost minimum has been found. In order to represent system performance, modelling based on queueing theory is applied which is to be preferred to discrete, event-oriented simulation because it provides an approach for the explanation of system performance and because of its superior computing performance accompanied by a neglible loss of accuracy. Finally the procedure is illustrated by a practical example. (orig.)

We develop and test efficient dispatching {{rules for the}} weighted tardiness problem with job-specific due dates and delay penalties. Our approach builds on previous greedy heuristics which assign the priority {{on the basis of}} the expected tardiness cost per immediate processing requirements. In multi-machine applications, estimates of the remaining leadtime are needed to determine local operation due dates and to evaluate the adequacy of the job's slack. Two slightly different "look-ahead" features are identified, and the corresponding priority rules are tested in job shop experiments with a variety of load conditions.

40|$|AbstractCell Formation (CF) is an {{important}} problem in today's automated batch type production systems. It reduces material handling cost, processing time, labor requirement, <b>in-process</b> <b>inventories,</b> number of set-ups, simplifies process plan, and increases quality of product. Manufacturing equipments of automated manufacturing systems are highly multifunctional. As a result, production processes {{can be done by}} multiple process routes. Optimum cell formation can lead to more independent cells and less intercellular movement of parts. Previous research reveals that most of the researchers considered single route, unique volume of parts, non-sequential Cell Formation Problem (CFP). However, intercellular movements of parts depend on parts volume, sequence of processes, and routes. In this paper, a heuristic approach based on Euclidean Distance matrix is proposed for CF in multiple routes, process sequential and parts volume (included with batch size and number of batches) problems. Computational experiments were performed with five benchmark problem sets taken from the literature and the results demonstrate that the performances of the proposed heuristic in terms of intercellular movements of parts are either better than or competitive with the well-known existing algorithms...|$|R

5000|$|The exact {{reasons for}} {{adoption}} of JIT in Japan are unclear. Plenert offers four reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post-World War II rebuilding of industry: 1. Japan's lack of cash {{made it difficult}} for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. 2. Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. 3. The Japanese islands were (and are) lacking in natural resources with which to build products. 4. Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus the Japanese [...] "leaned out" [...] their processes. [...] "They built smaller factories ... in which the only materials housed in the factory were those on which work was currently being done. In this way, inventory levels were kept low, investment in <b>in-process</b> <b>inventories</b> was at a minimum, and the investment in purchased natural resources was quickly turned around so that additional materials were purchased."

40|$|Inventory {{reduction}} {{is one of}} the most critical areas facing DoD in this era of diminishing resources and increasing global commitments. This thesis analyzes the concept of cycle time reduction as a significant method to reduce inventory levels. The order fulfillment process of a distribution center is analyzed using simulation modeling and business process reengineering (BPR) concepts. The two simulation models were designed and evaluated by measuring the cycle time of an order flowing through the distribution center. The results indicate that the cycle time of the order fulfillment process can be reduced by 90 %, inventory levels reduced by 77 % with a labor savings of $ 60, 000. This was achieved by reengineering the order fulfillment process from a batch system to one that sends incoming orders directly to the warehouse for order selection. The implications for the DoD are critical to the goal of inventory reduction; by focusing on the reduction of cycle time, <b>in-process</b> <b>inventories</b> are also be reduced.

40|$|Setting kanban sizes {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{decisions}} that users of kanban system must address, yet researchers have largely assumed kanban sizes to be given. This paper investigates the effect of varying kanban size on the performance of just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing systems. Two types of JIT production systems, the Pull-type and the Hybrid-type are analysed using computer simulation models. The performance measures considered simultaneously are the fill rate, <b>in-process</b> <b>inventory,</b> and manufacturing lead time. Parameters such as demand rate, processing time, and kanban size are taken into consideration, thereby finding the possible solutions of the kanban size that can be employed to achieve the most favourable conditions for production. A favourable condition usually refers to the ability of the system to produce finished goods at a shortest possible lead time, which the customers are always demanding for. Both the single product and multi-products manufacturing environments are investigated. With reference to the analysis, for a single product, as the kanban size increased, the fill rate decreased, whilst with both the <b>in-process</b> <b>inventory</b> and the manufacturing lead time increased. Generally, for multi-products manufacture, it was observed that as the kanban size increased, the fill rate increased with a decrease in the manufacturing lead time. However, for multi-products the interaction between the manufacturing lead time and the fill rate is discussed in depth in this paper. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 80 - 84. Just-in-Time (JIT) {{production systems}} have initially {{appeared in the}} Japanese manufacturing environment due to the scarcity of their critical resources. The main aim in JIT production systems is to eliminate waste. To achieve this objective, setup times, lead times, <b>in-process</b> <b>inventories,</b> and defective production must all be minimized. In the design process of a JIT production system, several factors such as lot size, number of kanbans, unit load size, and buffer capacities {{must be taken into}} account. In this study, a mathematical model is developed for a single-item, single-line, multi-stage, and multi-period JIT production system. The original model is nonlinear in both objective function and constraints. To reduce the computational difficulties, the nonlinear model is then approximated by a linear model. Next, a simulation model is developed to incorporate the stochastic nature of the demand. A sensitivity analysis is performed on unit load size and on buffer capacity under different demand patterns to examine their effects on the behavior of the model. The results show that thofee unit load size values exceeding 10 percent of the maximum demand in the planning horizon have no effect on the model. Oğuz, CeydaM. S...|$|R

Flexible manufacturing system (FMS) scheduling problems become extremely complex when it comes to accommodate frequent variations in the part designs of incoming jobs. This research focuses on scheduling of variety of incoming jobs into the system efficiently and maximizing system utilization and throughput of system where machines are equipped with different tools and tool magazines but multiple machines can be assigned to single operation. Jobs have been scheduled according to shortest processing time (SPT) rule. Shortest processing time (SPT) scheduling rule is simple, fast, and generally a superior rule in terms of minimizing completion time through the system, minimizing the average number of jobs in the system, usually lower <b>in-process</b> <b>inventories</b> (less shop congestion) and downstream idle time (higher resource utilization).

This has been achieved because CMS can overcome the problems due to frequent setups, high <b>in-process</b> <b>inventories,</b> long throughput times and complex planning and coordination commonly associated with a batch-type manufacturing operation. The underlying concept of CMS is the grouping of parts into part families and the machines that process these parts into machine cells in order to achieve manufacturing efficiencies. Creating machine cells which can perform all operations of a part without requiring the part to visit one or more cells other than its own is hard to achieve, if not impossible. Hence, in the design of CMS, one tries to minimize the material handling costs incurred due to the movements of parts to other cells. Duplication of "bottleneck" machines that process parts assigned to other cells into the appropriate cells and subcontracting of "bottleneck" parts that require one or more operation on machines assigned to another cell are two important methods utilized to form disaggregated manufacturing cells in order to minimize the material handling costs. A mathematical model and a solution algorithm is developed to simultaneously deal with the issues of duplicating bottleneck machines and subcontracting bottleneck parts. Because there is a cost associated with the process of duplication and subcontracting, the benefits attained are analyzed for different budgetary constraints encountered by a firm. The algorithm was tested on three different problem structures for a range of budgetary restrictions. The results obtained show that the algorithm could be used by the industry to solve problems encountered in the design of CMS...|$|R

Moreover, multiple metallurgical intermediates make up part of the <b>in-process</b> <b>inventory,</b> which also influence the monthly recovery calculation. Errors propagate from the measurements of volumes, assays, moisture fractions and bulk densities in the various material types through multiple steps up {{to the point where the}} final recovery is calculated. These errors contribute non-linearly to the variance in the final recovery estimate. This paper develops the mathematical formulation for variance propagation in toll smelting operations, including the effect of <b>in-process</b> <b>inventory,</b> assuming measurement biases have been eliminated beforehand. Operational data from a Southern African copper smelter is used for a case study. The method of propagation of variance showed that uncertainties in stockpile assays were the main contributors to variance in the recovery estimate. Variance in the volume and bulk density uncertainties contributed a secondary, yet significant, proportion to the overall recovery variance. It was determined, for the given case study, that the recovery variance depended on the calculation method used and that variance propagation via the two-product formula was smaller than recovery variances calculated via the standard recovery formula. However, the probability that the two product formula will give inaccurate (versus imprecise) results is significantly more due to the practical difficulty of equiprobable sampling of tailings streams from smelter plants (which includes materials such as slags and flue dust).
