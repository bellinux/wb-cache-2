5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E
25|$|At {{the press}} conference, Jenny tells {{everyone}} that her boyfriend is Ryan and that Alexis is Jason's fiancee, then walks off with Ryan. As the end-credits roll, Jason is {{on stage in}} Winnipeg, unhappily dedicating a song to his wife, Alexis, who <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> his side.|$|E
25|$|Frankel <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> stud at Banstead Manor Stud at Cheveley in Suffolk, {{where he}} was born. He covered his first mares on Valentine's Day, February 2013. His 2013 stud fee was set at £125,000. In his first season as a {{stallion}} he covered 133 mares, including 2011 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Danedream, three times Nassau Stakes winner Midday, and 2011 Kentucky Broodmare of the year Oatsee. Of those, 126 were scanned as in foal for a fertility rate of 95 percent. On 16 June 2014, Frankel's first foal {{to be sent to}} auction was sold for £1.15 million.|$|E

60|$|Then {{they got}} into the hired brougham which <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> the door.|$|R
60|$|I looked up. The guard <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> {{the open}} door. My {{companion}} had vanished.|$|R
6000|$|Reader, I {{would gladly}} make a confidant of {{yourself}} in this matter, {{and tell you}} all about this charming little woman, {{if it were not for}} the fact that she <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> my elbow at this very minute, causing me to make blots, and telling me not to write nonsense! ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was not a}} {{pleasant}} prospect, {{and yet it was}} a reprieve. One is thankful for small mercies when a hairy savage with a blood-stained knife <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> one's elbow. He dragged me from the room and I was thrust down the stairs and back into my cell. The door was locked and I was left to my reflections.|$|E
6000|$|Hastings made {{a sign of}} {{reluctant}} assent. [...] "I don't {{quite know}} how I can do it personally, {{in view of the}} figure wheat <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at,</b> and I don't think much of any security that Gregory could offer me. Still, there is, perhaps, a way in which it could be arranged, and it's one that, considering everything, is more or less admissible. I think I'll wait here for Agatha." ...|$|E

6000|$|In the {{meantime}} a traveller, a Rajput, Birbal by name, hoping to obtain employment, {{came from the}} southern quarter to the palace of the chief.

6000|$|... "Surgeon Schmidt, {{you will}} please at once mount Mr. Drummond's horse, which <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> the door. Ride {{out through the}} north gate. When you have gone {{about half a mile}} you will see a man with a lantern. He will lead you to the house of Count Eulenfurst, who has been grievously wounded by some marauders. Surgeon Morfen will follow you, as soon as he has bandaged Mr. Drummond's wounds. There may be more wounded there who may need your care.|$|E
6000|$|For {{our white}} and our {{excellent}} nights--for the nights of swift running, [...] Fair ranging, far-seeing, good hunting, sure cunning!

For the cry of our mates when the sambhur has wheeled and <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> bay! [...] For the risk and the riot of night! [...] For the sleep at the lair-mouth by day! [...] It is met, {{and we go to}} the fight. [...] Bay! O bay! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I {{came here}} just now to say I wish {{to present you}} with a horse and saddle. The horse <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> the gate now, I believe; but, if you are only waiting for a horse to leave us I shall have to regret making you this present. Do not be in a hurry; you have yet many years to live in which to {{accomplish}} all you wish to do, and let us have the pleasure of your company a few days longer. Doña Mercedes and her daughter desire {{nothing better than to}} keep you with them." ...|$|E
60|$|And George meanwhile? Little {{knowing how}} Fate {{has changed in}} a flash an ally into an {{opponent}} he <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> {{the edge of the}} shrubbery near the castle gate. The night is very beautiful; the barked spots {{on his hands and knees}} are hurting much less now; and he is full of long, sweet thoughts. He has just discovered the extraordinary resemblance, which had not struck him as he was climbing up the knotted sheet, between his own position and that of the hero of Tennyson's Maud, a poem to which he has always been particularly addicted--and never more so than during the days since he learned the name of the only possible girl. When he has not been playing golf, Tennyson's Maud has been his constant companion.|$|E
6000|$|The {{scene is}} a well-lighted, and large, oak-panelled hall, with [...] {{an air of}} being lived in, and a broad, oak {{staircase}}. The [...] dining-room, drawing-room, billiard-room, all open into it; and [...] under the staircase a door leads to the servants' quarters. In [...] a huge fireplace a log fire is burning. There are tiger-skins [...] on the floor, horns on the walls; and a writing-table against [...] the wall opposite the fireplace. FREDA STUDDENHAM, a pretty, [...] pale girl with dark eyes, in the black dress of a lady's-maid, [...] <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> {{the foot of the}} staircase with a bunch of white [...] roses in one hand, and a bunch of yellow roses in the other. A [...] door closes above, and SIR WILLIAM CHESHIRE, in evening dress, [...] comes downstairs. He is perhaps fifty-eight, of strong build, [...] rather bull-necked, with grey eyes, and a well-coloured face, [...] whose choleric autocracy is veiled by a thin urbanity. He [...] speaks before he reaches the bottom.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} no one looking out after her. Ralph <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> the counter, buying nails.|$|R
60|$|He {{had reached}} the gate. A large, prosperous-looking motor <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> {{the side of the}} road.|$|R

6000|$|In the Oeil-de-Boeuf, and her Majesty's private Apartments, {{an eloquent}} Controller, with his [...] "Madame, {{if it is}} but difficult," [...] had been persuasive: but, alas, the cause is now carried elsewhither. Behold him, one of these sad days, in Monsieur's Bureau; to which all the other Bureaus have sent deputies. He <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> bay: alone; exposed to an incessant fire of questions, interpellations, objurgations, from those 'hundred and thirty-seven' pieces of logic-ordnance,--what we may well call bouches a feu, fire-mouths literally! Never, {{according}} to Besenval, or hardly ever, had such display of intellect, dexterity, coolness, suasive eloquence, been made by man. To the raging play of so many fire-mouths he opposes nothing angrier than light-beams, self-possession and fatherly smiles. With the imperturbablest bland clearness, he, for five hours long, keeps answering the incessant volley of fiery captious questions, reproachful interpellations; in words prompt as lightning, quiet as light. Nay, the cross-fire too: such side questions and incidental interpellations as, {{in the heat of}} the main-battle, he (having only one tongue) could not get answered; these also he takes up at the first slake; answers even these. (Besenval, iii. 196.) Could blandest suasive eloquence have saved France, she were saved.|$|E
60|$|If, then, {{you feel}} that you know the town well enough to be {{admitted}} into the inner life and movement of it, walk down this June afternoon half way down the Main Street--or, if you like, half way up from the wharf--to where Mr. Smith <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> the door of his hostelry. You will feel as you draw near that it is no ordinary man that you approach. It is not alone the huge bulk of Mr. Smith (two hundred and eighty pounds as tested on Netley's scales). It is not merely his costume, though the chequered waistcoat of dark blue with a flowered pattern forms, with his shepherd's plaid trousers, his grey spats and patent-leather boots, a colour scheme of no mean order. Nor is it merely Mr. Smith's finely mottled face. The face, no doubt, is a notable one,--solemn, inexpressible, unreadable, the face of the heaven-born hotel keeper. It is more than that. It is the strange dominating personality of the man that somehow holds you captive. I know nothing in history to compare with the position of Mr. Smith among those who drink over his bar, except, though in a lesser degree, the relation of the Emperor Napoleon to the Imperial Guard.|$|E
