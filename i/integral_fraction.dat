40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop a}} method to verify the dose {{delivery}} {{in relation to the}} individual control points of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) using an ionization chamber. In addition to more effective problem solving during patient-specific quality assurance (QA), the aim is to eventually map out the limitations in the treatment chain and enable a targeted improvement of the treatment technique in an efficient way. METHODS: Pretreatment verification was carried out for 255 treatment plans that included a broad range of treatment indications in two departments using the equipment of different vendors. In-house developed software was used to enable calculation of the dose delivery for the individual beamlets in the treatment planning system (TPS), for data acquisition, and for analysis of the data. The observed deviations were related to various delivery and measurement parameters such as gantry angle, field size, and the position of the detector with respect to the field edge to distinguish between error sources. RESULTS: The average deviation of the <b>integral</b> <b>fraction</b> dose during pretreatment verification of the planning target volume dose was - 2. 1 % +/- 2. 2 % (1 SD), - 1. 7 % +/- 1. 7 % (1 SD), and 0. 0 % +/- 1. 3 % (1 SD) for IMRT at the Radboud University Medical Center (RUMC), VMAT (RUMC), and VMAT at the Wellington Blood and Cancer Centre, respectively. Verification of the dose to organs at risk gave very similar results but was generally subject to a larger measurement uncertainty due to the position of the detector at a high dose gradient. The observed deviations could be related to limitations of the TPS beam models, attenuation of the treatment couch, as well as measurement errors. The apparent systematic error of about - 2 % in the average deviation of the <b>integral</b> <b>fraction</b> dose in the RUMC results could be explained by the limitations of the TPS beam model in the calculation of the beam penumbra. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that time-resolved dosimetry using an ionization chamber is feasible and can be largely automated which limits the required additional time compared to integrated dose measurements. It provides a unique QA method which enables identification and quantification of the contribution of various error sources during IMRT and VMAT delivery...|$|E

Comprehensive identification of the membrane proteins is of importance for a better understanding of the diverse functions of its unique membrane structures. Up to date, approximately 900 known or predicted membrane proteins, consisting 24. 5 % of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 proteome, have been indentified by large-scale proteomic studies. Results To resolve more membrane proteins on 2 -D gels for mass spectrometry identification, we separated integral proteins from membrane associated proteins and collected them as the integral and peripheral fractions, respectively. In total, 95 proteins in the peripheral fraction and 29 proteins in the <b>integral</b> <b>fraction</b> were identified, including the 5 unique proteins that were not identified by any previous studies. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the identified proteins can be functionally classified into 14 distinct groups according to the cellular functions annotated by Cyanobase, including the two largest groups hypothetical and unknown, and photosynthesis and respiration. Homology analysis indicates that the identified membrane proteins are more conserved than the rest of the proteome. Conclusion The proteins identified in this study combined with other published proteomic data provide the most comprehensive Synechocystis proteome catalog, which will serve as a useful reference for further detailed studies to address protein functions through both traditional gene-by-gene and systems biology approaches. </p...|$|E

Four major IOMPs with molecular masses of 76, 50, 39, and 29 kDa were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These IOMPs {{were found to}} be essentially free of endotoxin in the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. The 76 -kDa protein exhibited a more intensely stained electrophoresis band when isolated from iron-restricted cultures, and a new band at 105 kDa was present in the whole-membrane fraction but not in the <b>integral</b> <b>fraction,</b> indicating that the 105 -kDa iron-repressibile protein is a peripheral membrane protein. The 76 -, 50 -, and 39 -kDa proteins were shown to be surface exposed, since antibodies to these IOMPs could be absorbed out of convalescent-phase sera by whole cells. Percentages of phagocytosis by porcine PMN of A. pleuropneumoniae opsonized with convalescent-phase sera, convalescent-phase sera absorbed with IOMPs, or convalescent-phase sera absorbed with whole cells were 46. 75, 21. 81, and 7. 96 %, respectively.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} which Doppler-derived flow index best predicts new distal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) stenosis in patients with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft. BackgroundThe LIMA flow measurement has been proposed to assess graft function, but it may be misleading in case of new distal LAD stenosis and/or competitive flow from native LAD. Distal LAD coronary flow reserve (CFR: hyperemic/baseline peak flow velocity ratio) may be more appropriate. MethodsThe LIMA and distal LAD flow was measured by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography in 96 patients undergoing diagnostic/therapeutic coronary angiography, 7 ± 4 years after cardiac bypass surgery. The LIMA flow indexes (systolic-to-diastolic peak velocity ratio [SDPVr] > 1, diastolic time velocity <b>integral</b> <b>fraction</b> [DTVIf] 1 = 61 %, DTVIf < 0. 5 = 69 %, and CFR < 2 = 72 %). The LIMA flow indexes were abnormal in 17 of 19 patients with competitive graft flow, but only 5 had graft restriction, and none had significant LAD stenosis. In a multivariate model of new distal LAD stenosis prediction, competitive flow from native LAD reduced the predictive role of LIMA but not of LAD CFR. ConclusionsIn patients without competitive flow from native LAD, LAD CFR is more accurate for the detection of LAD stenosis than LIMA CFR. In patients with competitive graft flow, abnormal LIMA flow patterns and blunted LIMA CFR do not reflect downstream LAD flow as LAD CFR does...|$|E

The thylakoid membrane proteins were separated into peripheral and <b>integral</b> <b>fractions</b> and resolved into 2 -D gels with different pH ranges. The protein spots in the 2 -D gels were subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting analysis, and totally 390 out of 558 analyzed spots were identified as protein products of 128 individual genes, of which 38 gene encode hypothetical proteins with unknown function. To study the function of some hypothetical proteins, we inactivated a set of genes, and 10 knockout mutants were obtained. The growth analysis for the mutant cells revealed that only one mutant (H 1) which has a deletion in the ORF slr 0110, showed conditional growth phenotype. Detailed analysis indicated that the H 1 mutant is sensitive to both glucose and light, which is caused by the over-reduction of the PQ pool in the thylakoid membrane. The ID and the structural and functional information of the identified proteins as well as the 2 -D reference maps were included in a web-based relational database for thylakoid membrane proteins. The database was constructed with MySQL, and the application programs were developed with SQL, PERL, JAVASCRIPT and HTML.

The review follows the chronological development of this new and emerging field: from the ideas {{that led to the}} original theoretical prediction of the novel ground states, to their dramatic experimental discovery, to the currently pursued directions and open questions. 1 Historical background Until recently, the quantum Hall effect research effort has been focused on the case of very high magnetic fields where electrons occupy only the lowest and perhaps, also the first excited Landau levels (LL). Investigation of the weak magnetic field regime where higher LLs are populated, was not considered a pressing matter because no particularly interesting quantum features could be discerned in the magnetotransport data. The experimental situation has changed around 1992, when extremely high purity two-dimensional (2 D) electron systems became available.

This indicated that the quantum Hall effect could persist up to very large LL indices, such as N ∼ 100, and called for the theoretical treatment of the high LL problem.

In {{a comparison of}} patients after successful cardioversion from chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF) and normal controls, we sought to determine whether Doppler-derived atrial strain rate (A-sr) {{could be used to}} measure global left atrial function and whether A-sr was reduced in patients with CAF. Methods: A-sr was measured from the basal septal, lateral, inferior and anterior atrial walls from the apical four-chamber and two-chamber views in 37 patients with CAF who had been cardioverted to sinus rhythm and followed up for 6 months, and in a cohort of 37 healthy people. Conventional measures of atrial function included peak transmitral A-wave velocity, A-wave velocity time <b>integral,</b> atrial <b>fraction</b> and the left atrial ejection fraction. Doppler tissue imaging was used to estimate atrial contraction velocity (A 2 ̆ 7 velocity). In addition to amplitude parameters, the time to peak A-sr was measured from aortic valve closure. Results: Immediately after cardioversion, A-sr in the CAF cohort (baseline) was significantly lower than in controls (mean (SD) - 0. 53 (0. 31) v - 1. 6 (0. 75) s(- 1); p < 0. 001); the A-sr correlated with A 2 ̆ 7 velocity (r = 0. 63; p < 0. 001) in patients.

To quantify the extent and limit of the rate constant swelling high-molecular compound at different process conditions (type of solvent, temperature, pH) determine the degree of swelling at specified intervals and construct the kinetic curve swelling. The acidity of the medium affects mainly on swelling polyampholytes, which are the proteins that make up most of the swell components flakes green buckwheat. Depending on the pH of the protein macromolecule adopt different conformations. The minimum degree of swelling of the protein corresponds to its isoelectric point at which stipulates equality of positive and negative charges in the macromolecule and it rolled into a ball or globule, which hinders the penetration of solvent molecules into the matrix of high-molecular compound. Comparison of the rate constant swelling possible to determine the maximum rate of swelling. In this paper we measured the specific heat <b>integral</b> swelling swelling <b>fraction</b> flakes green buckwheat and calculated mass of water adsorbed macromolecular substances on the hydration step, set its share in the total mass of liquid absorbed...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{myocardial}} ischemia {{is known}} to cause impairment of both left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. To further investigate these changes {{as well as their}} relation to common clinical variables (electrocardiographic [ECG] changes and chest pain), 32 patients were evaluated with Doppler echocardiography during coronary angioplasty. Doppler indexes of left ventricular diastolic function included the ratios of peak early to late and peak early to mean diastolic velocities as well as the ratios of early to late and first third to total velocity <b>integral</b> (one-third filling <b>fraction).</b> All diastolic indexes showed significant impairment by 15 seconds after coronary occlusion (ratio peak early to late filling velocity: 1. 11 versus 0. 96, p < 0. 01; ratio peak early to mean filling velocity: 1. 9 versus 1. 7, p < 0. 01; ratio early to late velocity integral: 1. 58 versus 1. 25, p < 0. 01; one-third filling fraction: 41. 2 versus 37. 7, p < 0. 01). Left ventricular systolic function was evaluated during coronary occlusion both qualitatively, as assessed by the appearance of a new wall motion abnormality on two-dimensional echocardiography (mean 28. 8 seconds), and quantitatively by measurement of systolic percent area change on the two-dimensional short-axis view as well as the Doppler echocardiographic stroke integral index. Systolic indexes did not show significant change until 30 seconds after balloon inflation (percent area change: 42. 8 versus 29. 2, p < 0. 01; stroke integral index: 11. 04 versus 9. 36, p < 0. 01). ECGs were performed at 15 second intervals. New ST segment elevation of 1 mm occurred in 26 of the 32 patients studied, whereas only half of the study patients developed typical anginal chest pain during coronary artery occlusion. In general, the ECG changes preceded the development of chest pain as well as left ventricular systolic dysfunction except in patients with significant collateral circulation. Diastolic left ventricular dysfunction was the earliest change seen after coronary occlusion regardless of the presence of collateral circulation. Systolic and diastolic abnormalities were noted to return to baseline by 15 seconds after balloon deflation. This study confirms that the response to acute transient myocardial ischemia involves both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. In addition, these data suggest that the ischemic response is heralded by left ventricular diastolic impairment followed by ECG changes, systolic impairment and angina, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{relation}} between Doppler-derived indices of left ventricular diastolic and systolic function early after myocardial infarction. Fifty-three patients (31 males, 22 females) recovering from acute myocardial infarction underwent predischarge Doppler echocardiographic examination. Patients with age > 70 years, previous myocardial infarction, more than mild mitral and aortic regurgitation, mitral and aortic stenosis were excluded. Twenty-two healthy subjects (13 males; 9 females) free of coronary risk factors were selected as the control group. Both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Pulsed Doppler was used to evaluate mitral inflow and left ventricular outflow velocity patterns. The following indices were measured: peak velocity of early (E) and late (A) flows, ratio of E/A peak velocities, ratio of early to late time velocity <b>integrals,</b> atrial filling <b>fraction</b> (time velocity <b>integral</b> A / time velocity integral of flow during total diastole) and deceleration time of E wave for mitral inflow; peak and time-velocity integral for left ventricular outflow. Stroke volume and cardiac output were obtained by pulsed Doppler using the left ventricular outflow method. The two groups were comparable for age, with blood pressure (p < 0. 05) and heart rate (p < 0. 01) reduced in myocardial infarction patients. Both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were significantly higher (both p < 0. 0001) and ejection fraction (p < 0. 0001) lower after myocardial infarction. Also stroke volume and cardiac output (both p < 0. 0001) were reduced in myocardial infarction patients. No significant difference in Doppler indices of diastolic function was observed between the two groups, except for shortened deceleration time (p < 0. 0001) in myocardial infarction patients. Multilinear regression analyses were performed separately into the two groups to identify determinants of left ventricular systolic function. After adjusting for age, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, atrial filling fraction was an independent predictor of stroke volume, with a direct relation (beta coefficient = 0. 53, p < 0. 001), in myocardial infarction patients but not in health subjects. In conclusion, our study confirms the pseudonormalization of diastolic pattern after myocardial infarction. The direct relation between atrial filling fraction and stroke volume indicates the importance of atrial contribution to maintain an adequate systolic performance in patients with myocardial infarction...|$|R
