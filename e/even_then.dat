5|$|Pulmonary oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{an entirely}} avoidable event while diving. The limited duration and naturally intermittent nature of most diving makes this a relatively rare (and <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> reversible) complication for divers. Established guidelines enable divers to calculate when they {{are at risk of}} pulmonary toxicity.|$|E
5|$|All of the Irish kingdoms {{had their}} own kings but were {{nominally}} subject to the High King. The High King was drawn {{from the ranks of}} the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept didn't become a political reality until the Viking Age and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.|$|E
5|$|Although Charles Holden had {{gradually}} reduced his workload, he {{was still}} continuing {{to go into the}} office three days per week during the early 1950s. He did not formally retire until 1958, but <b>even</b> <b>then</b> he visited occasionally. Margaret Holden died in 1954 after a protracted illness which had left her nearly blind since the mid-1940s. In the last decade of his life, Holden was himself physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E
5|$|Common {{and often}} basic {{ingredients}} in many modern European cuisines like potatoes, kidney beans, cacao, vanilla, tomatoes, chili peppers and maize {{were not available}} to Europeans until after 1492, after European contact with the Americas, and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> it often took considerable time, sometimes several centuries, for the new foodstuffs {{to be accepted by}} society at large.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} Sunday Masses {{held in the}} church. The first one is at 6:15pm on Saturday <b>evening,</b> <b>then</b> 9:30am and 11:00am on Sunday morning and at 5:15pm on Sunday evening.|$|R

5|$|In 1891, {{there were}} 12,197 convicts {{who had been}} {{exported}} from British India. Some of the convicts who were freed were engaged in agriculture, {{and those who were}} forced to do service were given monetary compensation of US$25 per month. However, <b>even</b> <b>then</b> escape from the penal colony was impossible and any escapee who tried was killed.|$|E
5|$|Netball is {{most popular}} in Commonwealth countries, {{and the most}} popular women's spectator sport in Australia and Tanzania and the effort to {{increase}} media attention and participation for women's sport often goes to Olympic sports with low participation rates, low rates of interest and few facilities. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> historically, coverage of women's team sports in the Olympics has been limited. Instead, according to Jones, the media focus on female athletes in non-team competitions and on team sports played equally by both genders.|$|E
5|$|Previous space {{missions}} to comets, such as Giotto and Stardust, were fly-by missions. These missions {{were able to}} photograph and examine only the surfaces of cometary nuclei, and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> from considerable distances. The Deep Impact mission {{was the first to}} eject material from a comet's surface, and the mission garnered large publicity from the media, international scientists, and amateur astronomers.|$|E

5|$|The Notitia lists a {{large number}} of units with barbarian names. This was {{probably}} the result of the transformation of irregular allied units serving under their own native officers (known as socii, or foederati) into regular formations. During the Principate, regular units with barbarian names are not attested until the 3rd century and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> rarely e.g. the ala I Sarmatarum attested in 3rd-century Britain, doubtless an offshoot of the Sarmatian horsemen posted there in 175.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{principal}} councils of the sovereign. The other three are the courts of law, the Commune Concilium (Common Council, or Parliament) and the Magnum Concilium (Great Council, or the assembly of all the Peers of the Realm). All are still in existence, or at least have never been formally abolished, but the Magnum Concilium has not been summoned since 1640 and was considered defunct <b>even</b> <b>then.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first metal cannon was the pot-de-fer. Loaded with an arrow-like bolt {{that was}} {{probably}} wrapped in leather to allow greater thrusting power, it was set off through a touch hole with a heated wire. This weapon, and others similar, were used by both the French and English, during the Hundred Years' War, when cannon saw their first real use on the European battlefield. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> cannon were still a relatively rare weapon.|$|E
60|$|They {{visited the}} Capitol and the White House, and {{numerous}} other buildings, and almost before they were aware it was <b>evening.</b> <b>Then</b> Mrs. Morr insisted upon it that her son retire early, knowing what a hard journey was before him.|$|R

6000|$|... 'You can't say any <b>evening,</b> <b>then,</b> Mr. Berkeley?' {{she said}} once more, {{as she held}} out her hand to him to say 'Good-night' a little later: 'not any evening at all, or part of an evening? You might really reconsider your engagements.' ...|$|R
5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). <b>Even</b> <b>then</b> the position was {{complicated by the fact}} that Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) felt obliged to seek assistance from Strasbourg and Basel, which brought him into contact with the more radical ideas associated with Zwingli.|$|E
5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E
5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought {{it had something to}} do with naval guns.|$|E
60|$|The captain lit another pipe {{after they}} had gone, and for some time sat smoking and {{thinking}} over {{the events of the}} <b>evening.</b> <b>Then</b> Mr. Tasker’s second infringement of discipline occurred to him, and, stretching out his hand, he rang the bell.|$|R
60|$|When he {{returned}} to the factory the conditions of work were better. He had Wednesday afternoon off to go to the Art School--Miss Jordan's provision--returning in the <b>evening.</b> <b>Then</b> the factory closed at six instead of eight on Thursday and Friday evenings.|$|R
60|$|We ate in the kitchen, {{where the}} olive and laurel wood {{burned in the}} open fireplace. It was always soup in the <b>evening.</b> <b>Then</b> we played games or cards, all playing; or there was singing, with the accordion, and {{sometimes}} a rough mountain peasant with a guitar.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{economic}} activity, permanent {{settlement of the}} peninsula did not intensify until the 1860s and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> it remained sporadic until 1917. The population of Kola in 1880, for example, was only around 500inhabitants living in 80households, compared to 1,900inhabitants in 300households living there in 1582. Transportation facilities were virtually non-existent and the communication {{with the rest of}} Russia irregular. 1887 saw an influx of Izhma Komi and Nenets people who were migrating to the peninsula to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands and brought their large deer herds with them, resulting in increased competition for the grazing lands, a conflict between the Komi and the Sami, and in marginalization of the local Sami population. By the end of the 19th century, the Sami population had mostly been forced north, with ethnic Russians settling in the south of the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. <b>Even</b> <b>then</b> the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
