In order to determine the coordination skills of the study participants, Throwing a Ball at the Target Test, Dart Test from the field tests and Double Hand Eye Coordination Test and the Flamingo Balance Test from amongst the laboratory protocols was applied. In conclusion there was a correlation between the double hand eye <b>coordination</b> <b>test</b> and the dart test (r= 0, 245; p= 0, 43). As a result it was decided that the dart test was adequate in measurement of the coordination skills and taking them into account its usability in the field, it was decided that it could be used in place of the expensive laboratory tests...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Athletes who get {{injured in}} sports {{often have a}} torn {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL). In a torn ACL, mechanoreceptors are affected. They {{play a role in}} proprioception. Proprioception and coordination are greatly reduced in a knee with a torn ACL. Doctors need to decide whether conservative or operative treatment will take place. During the rehabilitation, the medical team wants to measure the proprioception and coordination to see progress or improvement. At this time there are a few methods to measure proprioception and coordination. The proprioception table measures the threshold to detect passive motion (TDPM). Hop tests are used to measure the functional performance of the knee. Because the TDPM does not measure the functional capacity and hop tests are doable very late in rehabilitation, after three to four months, {{we need to have a}} better method to measure proprioception. The Mr. Cube is an apparatus which is a revalidation tool to train proprioception and coordination. The Mr. Cube program has the ability to make proprioception and coordination measurements. In this study, we examined the validity and reliability of the Mr. Cube to measure proprioception and coordination in the knee of healthy persons. Material and methods: Fourteen women and eight men were included. They did the proprioception <b>test</b> and <b>coordination</b> <b>test</b> of the Mr. Cube. After six to ten days, the persons did the <b>coordination</b> <b>test</b> again, to look for the test-retest reliability of the Mr. Cube. The second measurements of the proprioception test are done the same day. To examine the test-retest reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is used. To examine validity, we compared the measurements of the Mr. Cube proprioception <b>test</b> and the <b>coordination</b> <b>test</b> with the measurements of the proprioception table, the hop tests and two questionnaires. Spearman’s correlation coefficient is used to examine the validity. Results: We found an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 76 for the concentric movement and 0. 69 for the eccentric movement of the <b>coordination</b> <b>test.</b> The proprioception test had an ICC of 0. 12. We found weak correlations between the proprioception test and the TDPM. The hop tests correlated also weak with the Mr. Cube <b>coordination</b> <b>tests,</b> however, between the proprioception test and single and triple hop, we found strong correlations (correlation coefficient of 0. 50 and 0. 48) Conclusion: The proprioception test of the MR. Cube is not a reliable in this study. There is a learning effect in proprioception test. The persons performed significantly better the second time. The <b>coordination</b> <b>test</b> is a reliable test. The construct validity of the MR. Cube proprioception test could not have been proved in this study. The comparison between the TDPM, hop tests and the proprioception <b>test</b> and <b>coordination</b> <b>test</b> show all methods measure different constructs. ...|$|R
25|$|Based on {{the fact}} that writing {{sentences}} and reading them are coordinated using and, one can conclude that they are constituents. The validity of the <b>coordination</b> <b>test</b> is challenged by additional data, however.

Most grammars do not view sequences such as He enjoys to the exclusion of the VP writing sentences as a constituent. Thus while the <b>coordination</b> <b>test</b> is widely employed as a diagnostic for constituent structure, it is faced with major difficulties and is therefore perhaps the least reliable of all the tests mentioned.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} anthropometric, physical, coordinative and ice-skating specific characteristics that discriminate young elite ice skaters from non-elite skaters and their non-skating peers. 32 skaters aged 9 - 12 years old (11 elites and 21 non-elites) voluntarily participated in the study. They were submitted to 5 anthropometric, 7 physical, 3 coordination and 5 ice-skating specific tests. Reference values of a representative healthy non-skating sample were taken from the Flemish Sports Compass dataset. Figure skaters appeared to be predominantly average mature (93. 8 %), were lighter and leaner than the reference sample, and demonstrated better physical characteristics and motor coordination. There was no difference between the elite and non-elite group regarding maturity status and anthropometric or physical parameters.

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} {{of the level of}} motor development is one of the primary goals of teaching physical education. Gaining diversified movement experience and developing coordination is of particular importance at early school age. This is why modern approaches to teaching physical education give emphasis to the application of elements of sports games from the earliest age. Handball is a sports game which can be applied from the earliest school age because it abounds with a variety of movement tasks and includes natural forms of movement (running, jumping, throwing, etc.). Therefore, there is a great need for specific motor tests in handball. Specific motor tests are of great value, especially if observed in comparison to general motor skills results: handball requires a specific level of physical aptitude at the same timeinfluencing its further development and sustainability with its versatile contents. The specific <b>coordination</b> <b>test</b> "ball slalom" is broadly applicable and important in the overview of individual skills and can contribute to early guidance and selection in handball. That is why we tested general motor skills on a sample of 60 female students in the IV primary school grade.

The aim was to check the possibilities of including a school of handball in the regular physical education curriculum...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the normal {{development}} and clinical significance of bilateral motor coordination in schoolchildren were considered through {{a review of}} previous research. Bilateral motor coordination contains mirrorwise and non-mirrorwise movements between {{the left and right}} extremities. As a result of a comparative examination of 3 countries’ research of the normal development of bilateral diadochokinesis（rapid pronation and supination of forehands）, three concordant findings were revealed:（ 1 ）The speed of execution of bilateral diadochokinesis significantly increased with age. （ 2 ）The degree of difficulty of execution of nonmirrorwise movement was higher than that of mirrorwise movement. （ 3 ）Significant gender differences were not present in non-mirrorwise movement. Bilateral motor <b>coordination</b> <b>tests</b> including bilateral diadochokinesis were so far applied to explain the underlying neurological mechanisms of dyslexia or stuttering {{on the basis of the}} developmental interhemispheric disconnection（DID） hypothesis or the interhemispheric interference model（IIM）. In the execution of bilateral motor coordination, the cooperation of supplemental motor areas（SMA） on both hemispheres and corpus callosum（CC） wiring them together was assumed to be significant. However, other areas have also been shown to be concerned with the execution of bilateral motor coordination. Therefore, in the future, in addition to the basic research to have more precise age-specific normal values of individual bilateral motor <b>coordination</b> <b>tests,</b> neuro-imaging research making the neural mechanisms of the tests more definite and the accumulation of clinical findings in the tests of the children with neuropsychological problems are required...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundBoccia is a paralympic sport {{played by}} athletes with severe {{neurological}} impairments affecting all four limbs. Impaired manual dexterity (MD) and intralimb coordination (ILC) may limit individuals’ {{ability to perform}} certain activities such as grasping, releasing, or manipulating objects, which are essential tasks for daily life or to participate in para sports such as boccia. However, there are currently no specific instruments available to assess hand–arm coordination in boccia players with severe cerebral palsy (CP). PurposeTo design new sport-specific <b>coordination</b> <b>tests</b> to assess impaired MD and ILC in boccia players; afterward, quantify to what extent their coordination is impaired compared to a control group (CG) without neurological impairments. MethodsSeventy-three recreational boccia players with severe CP (BC 1 : age[*]=[*] 34. 01 [*]±[*] 16. 43 [*]years; BC 2 : age[*]=[*] 33. 97 [*]±[*] 14. 29 [*]years), and 19 healthy adults (age[*]=[*] 27. 89 [*]±[*] 7. 08 [*]years) completed the test battery. The Box and Block test (BBT) and Box and Ball test (BBLT) {{were used to assess}} MD and four tapping tests to assess upper ILC. ResultsBoth MD tests were able to discriminate between sport classes. Boccia players obtained better scores in the BBLT in comparison to the BBT, showing that the BBLT had more appropriate testing features. On the other hand, only one of the ILC tests was able to discriminate between sport classes, displaying the highest practical significance (d[*]=[*]− 1. 12). Participants with CP scored significantly worse in all the <b>coordination</b> <b>tests</b> compared to the CG.

This work aimed to assess whether: 1) a relevant proportion of cirrhotic patients show neurological deficits not detected by PHES; 2) cirrhotic patients with mild neurological deficits are a homogeneous population or may be classified in sub-groups according to specific deficits. Cirrhotic patients "without" (n = 56) or "with" MHE (n = 41) according to PHES and controls (n = 52) performed psychometric tests assessing attention, concentration, mental processing speed, working memory and bimanual and visuomotor coordination. Heterogeneity of neurological alterations was analysed using Hierarchical Clustering Analysis. PHES classified as "with" MHE 42 % of patients. Around 40 % of patients "without" MHE according to PHES fail two psychometric tests. Oral SDMT, d 2, bimanual and visuo-motor <b>coordination</b> <b>tests</b> are failed by 54, 51, 51 and 43 % of patients, respectively. The earliest neurological alterations are different for different patients. Hierarchical clustering analysis shows that patients "without" MHE according to PHES may be classified in clusters according to the tests failed. In some patients coordination impairment appear before cognitive impairment while in others concentration and attention deficits appear before. PHES is not sensitive enough to detect early neurological alterations in a relevant proportion of cirrhotic patients. Oral SDMT, d 2 and bimanual and visuo-motor <b>coordination</b> <b>tests</b> are more sensitive. The earliest neurological alterations are different in different cirrhotic patients.
