Electrochemistry like Photochemical reactions {{can be considered}} as a 'reagent-less' reactions. In an electrochemical reaction the reaction is facilitated by the number of electrons that are able to activate molecules causing the desired reaction. Continuous electrochemistry apparatus reduces the distance between the electrodes used to allow better control of the number of electrons transferred to the reaction media enabling better control and selectivity. Recent developments in electrochemical <b>flow-systems</b> enabled the combination of reaction-oriented electrochemical flow systems with species-focused spectroscopy which alows complete analysis of reactions involving multiple electron transfer steps, as well as unstable intermediates.

40|$|Nicaragua {{is being}} {{substantially}} affected by climate change, whose impact {{is to be}} seen in marked seasonal variations of climatic and hydrometric parameters. Rainfall has declined sharply over the last decade within a strip of land that runs parallel to the Pacific Ocean and extends from the extreme northwest of Lake Nicaragua (also known as Cocibolca) to the Departments of Madriz and Nueva Segovia and beyond the border with Honduras. Droughts and water shortages have changed the way of life of local inhabitants along the strip, which includes the Malacatoya sub-basin. Shallow aquifers and surface water levels have been notably reduced. This has increased the need to seek new water sources in the sub-basin from a <b>flow-systems</b> viewpoint, applying hydro-geological, geophysical and hydro-geochemical techniques to create a conceptual model of how the systems operate. This article describes the application of 10 Continuous Vertical Electrical Soundings (CVES) and nine Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES), accompanied by a geological evaluation. Taken together, these techniques permit the identification and characterization – in terms of space and depth – of the aquifer formations present in three sub-areas of the sub-basin. Geophysical results indicate that the thickest aquifers were to be encountered in the Río Malacatoya and Las Banderas quaternary units (unconfined aquifers).

This work considers using such models to guide hydrogeologic data collection for improving model predictions, by identifying model parameters {{that are most}} important to the predictions. Identification of these important parameters can help guide collection of field data about parameter values and associated <b>flow-system</b> features {{that can lead to}} improved predictions. Methods for identifying parameters important to predictions include prediction scaled sensitivities (PSS), which account for uncertainty on individual parameters as well as prediction sensitivity to parameters, and a new ''value of improved information'' (VOII) method, which includes the effects of parameter correlation in addition to individual parameter uncertainty and prediction sensitivity. The PSS and VOII methods are demonstrated using a model of the Death Valley regional ground-water flow system. The predictions of interest are advective-transport paths originating at sites of past underground nuclear testing. Results show that for two paths evaluated, the most important parameters include a subset of five or six of the 23 defined model parameters. Some of the parameters identified as most important are associated with <b>flow-system</b> attributes that do not lie in the immediate vicinity of the paths.

New applications of aseptic packaging would be offered for food products which still are mostly heated in containers, {{such as food}} containing particles, e. g. soups, dessert or baby food. Therefore, the count reductions of bacterial spores in solid materials were investigated. Comparing the count reductions in the liquid and in the solid phase a distinct shifting to higher D-values in the solid phase was observed. These kinetic data of the count reduction of spores in solid food offered the possibility of calculating the necessary heating parameters for particulate food in continous <b>flow-systems.</b> Using the kinetic data {{for the destruction of}} 5 orders of magnitude in the case of Cl. sporogenes PA 3679 spores in the centre of the particles and the kinetic data of destruction of thiamine the heating time of meat particles was calculated i n dependence of the particle diameter: If a liquid phase of low viscosity is assumed or heat transfer is improved, e. g. in a scraped heat exchanger, preservation of high food quality up to diameters of 20 mm to 30 mm is possible.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of a multi-source funded project (French Water Agencies, French Councils, BRGM), karst groundwater resources of the Plateau de Sault (middle-eastern Pyrenees, Southern France) are being evaluated. These karst aquifers are little exploited but they are considered as a future potential groundwater resource to supply the area which is frequently exposed to summer droughts,and which will experience increasing periods of water scarcity in the coming decades. Indeed,a future deficit for drinking water is estimated around 15 000 m 3 per days in the surrounding region of the plateau. The first part of the project focused on a synthesis of all the existing geological, geomorphological and hydrogeological data, especially those that concern the two most significant karst <b>flow-systems</b> in this area: Fontestorbes and Font-Maure. This synthesis highlighted some lack of information, leading toadditional field investigations (geophysics, hydrological monitoring, physicochemical campaigns, etc.). At this point, it was necessary {{to find a way to}} bring together all the previous and new information through a conceptual model of flow within the karst aquifer of the Plateau de Sault. The KARSYS approach has thus beenselected and applied to provide a first explicit hydrogeological model of the main karst systems. Geomorphological forms and speleogenesis evidences are considered for establishing the inception and the speleogenetic models. These two models are then combined into a hydrogeological 3 D model in order to provide clues on the probable conduits location. This hydrogeological 3 D model of the Plateau de Sault will serve a decision-making support in order to improve groundwater management. It will also be used to identify where and which additional data should be collected to enhance our understanding of karst flows. Based on this model, future strategies concerning the exploitation and the protection of the aquifer resources may be tested and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Particle-laden {{turbulent}} shear flows are {{ubiquitous in}} environmental and industrial <b>flow-systems,</b> and their analysis is thus of prime importance. In this work, we study {{the motion of}} a dilute suspension of particles in a non-stationary homogeneous turbulent shear flow (HTSF), subject to varying levels of imposed mean-shear, gravity, and inertia. We use direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the fluid velocity field (coupled with Lagrangian particle tracking), to assess the influence of flow-anisotropy and gravity on {{the motion of the}} particles. We first discuss numerical challenges encountered while performing DNS of HTSF at higher Reynolds numbers. The presence of sharp velocity gradients in the HTSF flow field is found to cause premature loss of resolution at the small scales, leading to shortened simulation-times. To counter this, the existing pseudo-spectral DNS setup is augmented with a Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme, enabling numerically-stable HTSF simulations at higher Reynolds numbers. We then consider the motion of individual particles as they interact with the anisotropic topology of the turbulence. In contrast to isotropic turbulence, particles are found to collect within vortex layers, regions where strong vorticity and strain are coupled with low streamline curvature. Shear-induced anisotropy in the turbulence also leads to reduced gravitational settling speeds for intermediate-inertia particles, though stronger gravity overcomes this effect. Particle velocity variances are found to be highly anisotropic at stronger shear, while gravity now tends to diminish this effect by limiting the interaction-time between particles and turbulence. Shear and gravity acting together cause particle acceleration variances to exceed those of the underlying fluid, corroborating findings from past turbulent boundary layer experiments. Analytical expressions are derived for the mean velocities and accelerations of the particles, and are in agreement with the DNS results. Finally, we analyze the relative velocities and clustering characteristics of particle pairs, and find that stronger shear and gravity suppress path-history effects for particles with stronger inertia. Shear-induced anisotropy in pair-statistics is affected by both inertia and gravity, with stronger gravity seen to oppose the action of shear. Changes in the relative-velocity anisotropy are correlated to the trends shown by single-particle velocity variances. Particle collision rates increase with stronger shear, and are found to scale in proportion to the underlying turbulence timescales. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R

The topog-raphy of the water table, which is strongly related to the topography of the land surface, is {{a major factor in the}} hierarchical nesting of gravity-driven groundwater flow, resulting in flow systems of different orders of magnitude in lateral extent and depth of penetration. The concept of flow systems is extremely useful in the analysis of spatial and temporal scales and their mutual relationships.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the key principles necessary for an understanding of Speleogenesis, including selected speleogenetic models. The most popular of these models at the moment is the four-state model, which attributes the depth of a karst system principally to the depth and spatial distribution of the geological-tectonic bedding planes. According to this model, thick or steeply inclining planes lead to deep phreatic loops, while shallower and more interconnected planes lead to horizontal karst systems more heavily influenced by the water table. The key to understanding the initial karstification is the particular dissolution kinetics of limestone dissolution. While the dissolution of limestone by limestone-aggressive water leads to a first order dissolution kinetic, this changes to a higher order dissolution kinetic as full saturation is approached. Because of this phenomenon, full saturation and loss of aggressiveness do not occur, and the widening of initial fissures is possible even without the constant addition of fresh carbon dioxide to the system. In numerical models these processes can be simulated with significant simplifications and using various key parameters. The paper summarizes the current development status of these models. The main part of the paper presents the synthesis of the results of numerical modeling and the author's own hydro-geological/speleological research. The author has developed speleogenetic models for complex karst systems in the Steinernes Meer (Austria), the Sierra el Abra and Sierra Juarez (both in Mexico) and the Rheinische Schiefergebirge (Germany). The paper discusses the key hydro-speleological parameters and the influence of regional groundwater <b>flow-systems</b> during the initial karstification and the resulting template for the future development of the karst system. Guidelines {{for the duration of the}} initial karstification can be derived from the numerical models. These correspond with the geological/speleological findings. Especially in a very early phase of the initial karstification lasting over a million years, the almost saturated water leads to an ongoing widening of the initial fissures. The groundwater flow obeys the laws of groundwater flow in a porous and homogeneous medium (Hubbert 1940). As a result, deep phreatic flow paths form even at a very early stage of speleogenesis. These then have a developmental headstart during the breakthrough phase so that karst systems develop with deep phreatic tubes. The actual distribution of the bedding planes, which the four-state model considers decisive, plays only a minor role...|$|R
40|$|Protecting of {{drinking}} water resources {{is one of the}} principal technical and scientific tasks of our days. The aquifers of the Great Hungarian Plain are one of the largest freshwater bases in Europe. The Pleistocene and Upper Pannonian layers of the Great Hungarian Plain are reservoirs of huge amount of fresh water and 80 per cent of wells are drilled on these aquifers. In {{the first half of the}} last century most of the wells were effluent ones. The extended abstraction of large quantities of water resulted in remarkable declines of the potentiometric surface (hydraulic head) in aquifers and produced drawdowns of regional scale. Since the 1990 ¬s, the water extraction has been decreased in Hungary by 40 - 45 per cent. Subsequently, the hydraulic heads began to rise in the vicinity of water works, but at larger distances (8 - 10 km) they kept on sinking. This phenomenon is a clear manifestation of hydraulic continuity of large stratified sediment basins. In the first half of the 20 th century the focus of attention was the aquifer, a geologic unit that can yield economic quantities of water. Active groundwater development has led to the recognition over the past quarter of a century that aquifers are vulnerable to overdraft leading to declining productivity and that aquifer exploitation may cause adverse consequences such as land subsidence and deterioration of wetlands. Experience shows that aquifers are components of larger hydrogeological units and that the notion of “protection of aquifers” has broader implications in space and in time. Because of the open nature of the hydrologic system, protection of aquifers must involve planning on a basin-wide scale. This requires that water management must be aided by long-term monitoring of the hydrogeologic system for water quantity as well as quality. The concept of multi-aquifer systems has been developed in which aquifers can receive water through subjacent and superjacent aquitards. The problem was mathematically analyzed first by Dutch hydrologists and engineers, and later by Jacob and Hantush. The first important Russian contribution on this subject came from Mjatiev, who analyzed the interaction of pervious strata separated by semiconfining beds. Hubbert (1940) published “The Theory of Ground-Water Motion”, a paper that still remains definitive. He examined the physical meaning of the fluid potential, derived a tangent law for the refraction of flow lines, and established the foundations for the study of regional groundwater systems. In the 1960 ’s attention has again turned to the regional scale, with the groundwater basin as the unit of hydrological study. Tóth (1962, 1963) obtained solutions by analytically modeling flow patterns in a two-dimensional homogeneous basin for two different water-table configurations. In this approach the topography of the water table, which is strongly related to the topography of the land surface, is considered as a major factor in the hierarchical nesting of gravity-driven groundwater flow patterns. This results in <b>flow-systems</b> of different orders of magnitude in lateral extent and depth of penetration.

40|$|Bioprocess {{monitoring}} and control is a complex task that needs rapid and reliable methods which are adaptable to continuous analysis. Process monitoring during fermentation is widely applicable {{in the field of}} pharmaceutical, food and beverages and wastewater treatment. The ability to monitor has direct relevance in improving performance, quality, productivity, and yield of the process. In fact, the complexity of the bioprocesses requires almost real time insight into the dynamic process for efficient and effective control. Recently, much attention has been focused on improving process monitoring tools, especially since the launch of the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003. PAT was introduced as a concept in GMP-based bioproduction in order to improve process knowledge via continuous monitoring without a compromised product quality. In this context, many tools based on advanced sensing techniques, novel biosensors and model based software sensors are being pursued to provide advanced insight into bioprocesses. Efforts are being pursued to integrate different approaches for enhanced real time view of the bioprocess. To achieve this objective, modular systems are necessary to improve the robustness of biosensors and integrate them with other complementary techniques. This thesis work focuses on the development and automation of biosensors for process {{monitoring and}} control, employing <b>flow-systems.</b> Automation of biosensors in flow configurations like FIA, SIA or multi-commutation have been studied and interfaced with bioprocesses, choosing model analytes based on various biorecognition elements like enzymes, antibodies and microbial cells. Design and automation of biosensors adapting to online continuous {{monitoring and control}} of the fermentation of low molecular weight compounds like glucose, lactate, acetonitrile and higher molecular weight substances like proteins have been reported based on electrochemical and optical detections. In this work, a general and versatile automation system is described having high stability for continuous monitoring of bioprocesses. A system for flow based immunoassay useful for monitoring of protein production in a bioprocess is described. The design of such sensing systems, and their successful integration with bioprocesses provide an important step in adapting such systems for process monitoring and industrial production. An important issue is the stability of the biorecognition element. This has specificially been studied for enzymes and a method for improving the stability by a protein-based stabilizing agent is reported. In addition, a study aiming at improving the thermal stability of enzyme-based biosensors using the model glucose oxidase is described. Biosensors are becoming increasingly attractive for environment monitoring and food safety and quality. Integration of a microbial biosensor for monitoring and control of a degradation process of the organic pollutant acetonitrile is discussed. In fact, environmental applications certainly need rapid and sensitive detection techniques and here a novel immunosensor based on IgY antibody for detection of methyl parathion using chemiluminescence is reported. The sensitivity obtained in this application was close to 10 ppt of the target pesticide methyl parathion. Furthermore, an automated analyzer for precise control and stable analysis of methyl parathion is described.

From the analysis two parameters were developed from which the speed response time of the turbopump, the flow response time, and the maximum dynamic line loss could be evaluated. These parameters were functions of turbopump moment of inertia, design performance of the turbine, and <b>flow-system</b> geometry.

Scale up of the synthesis of these architectures was achieved by programming a multiple-pump reactor system to vary reaction conditions sequentially, and thus explore a larger parameter space in a shorter time than conventionally possible. Also, the potential for using the array as a discovery tool is demonstrated. Successful conditions for product isolation were identified easily from the array of reactions, and a direct route to `scale up' was then immediately available simply by continuous application of these flow conditions.

40|$|We {{examined}} a natural, CO 2 -charged subsurface system located near two fault zones in East-Central Utah that {{is analogous to}} engineered sequestration sites. Geologic information and geochemical and isotopic data from water and gas samples were used to develop a conceptual model of the flow system. This <b>flow-system</b> description indicates that CO 2 from a depth 3 ̆e 800 m migrates upward through a system of shallower, stacked aquifers. The geologic structure in the area serves to focus the CO 2 -rich waters {{at the location of}} a faulted, anticlinal trap. The faults in the area impede horizontal flow but allow vertical leakage through thick, low-permeability formations. An important implication from this CO 2 -sequestration analog is that leakages occur along discrete flow paths in the subsurface; thus, in sequestration scenarios, detailed understanding of discrete flow paths will be necessary. Another implication is that groundwater can transport a significant amount of CO 2, and thus, sampling groundwater chemistries from wells may be a better way to identify leakages than using monitoring techniques at the surface. Finally, even though mineralization occurs during CO 2 leakage to the surface, self-sealing has not occurred at this natural analog and may not occur at engineered sequestration sites...|$|E
40|$|The present effort {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} cumulative damage of an initially smooth surface on the statistical characteristics of wall turbulence. Singular value decomposition was employed to decompose a highly-irregular surface topography replicated from a turbine blade damaged by spallation into topographical modes embodying successively smaller roughness length scales. These modes were then used to develop multiple reduced-order models of the original roughness that, at least in spirit, successively captured {{the evolution of the}} surface roughness from initial smaller-scale defects that would likely form just after deployment to the eventual cumulative formation of larger-scale roughness features. Particle-image velocimetry measurements of flow at a friction Reynolds number around 1825 over various topographical models were gathered in turbulent channel flow. The cumulative impact of these reduced-order models on wall turbulence was then assessed by comparing mean velocities, Reynolds normal stresses, and Reynolds shear stresses. It was observed that the turbulence statistics of the flow increase in magnitude as larger-scale features are introduced into the surface, leading up to the full, original surface. In addition, even weak surface damage that a practical flow surface might endure within the first fraction of its deployment lifetime can significantly enhance turbulence and therefore progressively degrade system performance. Thus, proper modeling of <b>flow-system</b> performance must account for the dynamic nature of flow surfaces, particularly those exposed to severe operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Many {{groundwater}} systems {{consist of}} multi-scale aquifer units. The exchange processes and rates between these aquifer units are complex. In order to manage such complex systems, a subdivision into different catchments, sub-catchments or groundwater bodies as manageable units is required. The sustainable management {{of water resources}} requires a comprehensive view of water-quality and water-quantity aspects not only for water supply issues, but generally also for flood protection and riverine ecosystem functions. Such transformations require an improved understanding of recharge and exchange processes between different aquifer units as well as aquifer-surface water interaction-processes at different spatiotemporal scales. The main objective {{of this study is to}} illustrate concepts by defining the geometry and scales of different aquifer units within a sedimentary basin. The Laufen Basin in the Jura Mountains represents a sub-catchment of the River Birs (Switzerland). Its structure is characterized by a pronounced local relief and a series of aquifer units which are typical for many complex groundwater systems in front of mountain chains such as the alpine foreland and the Jura Mountains of Central Europe. A combination of different concepts is required to understand multi-scale flow systems and to describe the various hydrogeological processes. Three concepts are proposed for the Laufen Basin, including: (1) a regional <b>flow-system</b> analysis, based on the concept of hierarchical groundwater flow systems; (2) the river-corridor concept for understanding aquifer-surface water interaction processes; and (3) the calculation of the dynamic vulnerability index and the aquifer base gradient approach for karst flow and fractured flow systems.

SAMs form spontaneously on gold by adsorption of thiols, sulfides or disulfides. After immobilization of the biorecognition element a long chain hydrocarbon thiol {{was used to}} block any uncovered spots on the surface. The electrode was mounted in a <b>flow-system</b> and served as working electrode in a potentiostatically controlled system. Between measurements the working electrode was held at a rest potential of 0 mv vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. To measure the capacitance at the sensing layer/electrolyte interface a potentiostatic step of 50 mV was applied and the resulting current response was recorded. By assuming that the current response followed that for a model consisting of a resistor and a capacitor in series the capacitance could be calculated by a linear least-squares fitting.

The research uses an array of geological information including geophysical logs (n= 12), hydrocarbon exploration data (n= 11), and drillers' logs (n= 589) from a 5000 km 2 area to characterise the aquifer heterogeneity {{as a basis for}} alternative representations of hydrogeological structure in groundwater flow modelling. Groundwater samples from southern Bangladesh were analysed for 14 C in order to determine groundwater age (n= 23) and for hydrochemical (n= 75) and isotopic (n= 50) characterisation. A new hypothesis `SiHA (Silt-clay layers influence Hierarchical groundwater flow systems and Arsenic progression in aquifer) ' is presented which integrates sedimentological heterogeneities, groundwater flow, and geochemical processes to explain the distribution and geological evolution of groundwater As in the aquifer. The hypothesis explains the spatio-vertical variability of groundwater As concentration by 'groundwater flow systems and differential flushing' in the aquifer. Groundwater flow models based on eight different yet plausible aquifer representations provide adequate simulations of hydraulic head, but contrasting implications for well catchments and travel times. The better representations are judged by comparing model outcomes of travel time with groundwater age determination using 14 C. Comparisons demonstrate the importance of incorporating hydrostratigraphy and spatial heterogeneity in order to optimise model representations, and implications for the security of As-free deep groundwater in the BAS. ...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{interest}} in early hydrogeological studies was the aquifer unit, {{as it is}} the physical media that stores and permits groundwater transfers from the recharge zone to the discharge zone, making groundwater available to boreholes for water extraction. Approach: Recently, the aquifer concept has been complemented by the groundwater flow system theory, where groundwater may be defined by local, intermediate and regional flow systems. This implies that groundwater may travel from one aquifer unit to another aquifer unit (or more) located above or below the former. Water in a local flow system takes months or several years to travel from the recharge to the discharge zone. These flows usually transfer the best natural quality water, so a reduction in precipitation would lessen recharge and diminish stored water, making them more vulnerable to contamination and variability in climatic conditions. Thus, {{there is a need to}} define local flows and to enhance actions to protect them from contamination and inefficient extraction. Results: In contrast to local flows, intermediate and regional flows travel from a region, or country, into another, with their recharge processes usually taking place in a zone located far away from the discharge zone (natural or by boreholes). There is a need of groundwater flow systems evaluation by means of an integrated wide system-view analysis of partial evidence represented by surface (soil and vegetation covers) as well as hydraulic, isotopic and chemical groundwater characterization in the related geological media where the depth of actual basement rock is paramount as well as discharge areas. The flow system definition may assist in extraction management strategies to control related issues as subsidence, obtained the water quality change, desiccation of springs and water bodies, soil erosion, flooding response, contamination processes in recharge areas, among others; many of which could be efficiently managed leaning on groundwater functioning. There is increasing evidence that climate becoming more variable and key driver of ecosystem health. Even with climate stability, most developing countries will confront serious water problems by the mid- 21 st century due to an insufficient knowledge of the functioning of their groundwater sources representing &# 8776; 99 % of available water. Conclusion: Many such problems may be adequately controlled when local flows are defined, since changes in climatic condition are more prone to affect local flows rather than intermediate and regional flows. The value of the flow systems arises from the fact that a wide system view analysis allows adequate crossed examination among relevant data from where water management proposals might more adequately represent field conditions. Examples of successful application of the groundwater flow systems in Mexico and Argentina will be presented including: induced fluoride control, subsidence response, desiccation of springs, flooding water origin definition, basement position in <b>flow-system</b> control, inter-basin flow...|$|E
40|$|Late Pleistocene and Holocene sediments were {{analyzed}} on sediment cores from different sedimentation realms within {{the western part}} of the Sea of Marmara (Turkey). All cores were investigated with sedimentological, geochemical and micropaleontological methods. The results from these investigations revealed informations about the sedimentation processes and mechanisms. Extensive geochemical analysis and the determination of the carbonate- and organic carbon-content made it possible to draw conclusions on the variations during the deposition of the sediments through time (paleoproductivity, dissolved oxygen content in the deeper water column, input of sediments). Statistical analysis on the geochemical data made it possible to differ between primary (terrigenous-, biogenous-, and authigenous-signals) and secondary signals (diagenesis). Furthermore, climatic changes after the last glacial maximum (from 17000 a &# 65533; 10000 a) are responsible for variations in the grain size distribution (coarsening) and mineralogical and geochemical anomalies. The composition of benthic foraminiferas revealed the level of oxygenation in the deep Marmara Sea from 13000 a to present. Comparisons of Marmara Sea sediments with sediments from the Black Sea make it clear that both sedimentary basins show distinct coherences. C 14 -age-determinations and a specific stratigraphic unit (the Santorini Y- 2 ash layer) defined the time-periods for the different sedimentary processes. On the basis of theses analysis, a palaeoceanographic model was developed, which is presented in chapter 5. An overview on the results and the comparison to former palaeoceanographic models of the Sea of Marmara are given in Table 9. The deepest sedimentary unit represents sediments which were deposited during the influence of the last glacial period (Weichsel-Stage). These units are characterized by dark, black layers enriched in monosulfides, which were deposited in a lacustrine and oxygen-depleted environment. During this period, the Sea of Marmara was cut of from the Mediterranean and the Black Sea due to the global sea-level low-stand. During the processes of early diagenesis in this sulphate- and oxygen-depleted environment, the Monosulfides were metabolized to Pyrite mainly in layers characterized by higher permeability. As-Anomalies within these layers might be related to the circulation of low-thermal solutions. For the first time, the modelling of a geochemical reaction made it possible to define a process, which is responsible for the precipitation of calcite in the water column. Analysis on the isotopic carbonate composition revealed, that the precipitation can be related to the mixing of warm marine Mediterranean-water with colder and anoxic lacustrine water of the Sea of Marmara. During a period of high bioproductivity in surface waters of the Sea of Marmara, a sapropelic layer was deposited between 11500 a BP and 7800 a BP. Ascending nutrient-rich deep-sea water masses and the synchronous strong fluvial input of sediments, induced by strong precipitations in a humid climatic period, are responsible for the process of sapropel formation within the Sea of Marmara. Today`s two-layer <b>flow-system</b> at the Dardanelles and the Bosporus was developed 7000 a BP. A surface-stream with lower salinity is moving westwards, whereas the deeper high-salinity layer is moving eastwards from the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea...|$|E
40|$|Die Probenvorbereitung in der chemischen Analytik ist heute oft noch mit einem großen Zeitaufwand verbunden. Sie stellt durch die meist manuelle Durchführung eine Fehlerquelle u. a. durch Kontamination und Probenverlust dar. Für die Analyse ionischer Verbindungen ist der Einsatz der Ionenchromatographie aufgrund ihrer vielfältigen Möglichkeiten zur Trennung und Detektion weit verbreitet. Prinzipiell erweist sich eine Probenvorbereitung für die Ionenchromatographie dann als notwendig, wenn die Säule und damit die Trennung und Detektion der Analytionen durch die Probenzusammensetzung negativ beeinflusst wird. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, mit membrangestützten Separationsmethoden die Möglichkeiten der in-line Probenvorbereitung für die Ionenchromatographie (IC) zur Bestimmung ausgewählter Analytionen zu untersuchen und Experimente zur Optimierung der Separationsverfahren durchzuführen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde die Gasdiffusion (GD), die Dialyse und die Mikrodialyse als Membranseparationsverfahren im Fließsystem verwendet. Für Sulfit, Nitrit und die simultane Bestimmung von kurzkettigen Aminen und Ammonium erfolgte die Entwicklung von leicht automatisierbaren in-line Probenvorbereitungsmethoden für die IC unter Nutzung der GD. Hierzu wurden Untersuchungen hinsichtlich des Aufbaus des Fließsystems und der beeinflussenden Parameter im Fließsystem, wie Konfiguration der Gasdiffusionszelle und Fließratenverhältnisse, durchgeführt. Es gelang für die aufgeführten Analyten die Bedingungen im Fließsystem so zu gestalten, dass in der Zeit, die für die Aufnahme eines Chromatogramms notwendig war, für die nächste Probe die in-line Probenvorbereitung erfolgte, und so eine relativ hohe Analysenfrequenz gewährleistet wurde. Störende Matrixkomponenten konnten in Realprobenmessungen durch die GD effektiv abgetrennt werden. Für die Analytionen Phosphat, Sulfat, Nitrat und Chlorid erfolgten experimentelle Untersuchungen mit der Mikrodialyse (MD) aus stagnierenden Probe-,bzw. Standardlösungen mittels einer, von der Akzeptorlösung durchflossenen Hohlfasermembran. Dabei wurden die den Separationsprozess beeinflussenden Parameter im Fließsystem und die gegenseitige chemische Beeinflussung der zu dialysierenden Substanzen auf die Dialyserate untersucht. So konnte ein geeignetes System der Mikrodialyse zur Untersuchung von Realproben entwickelt und genutzt werden. Vergleichende Messungen der Analyten in Realproben mit der Dialyse im Fließsystem ergaben: Für die durchgeführten Untersuchungen von Oberflächenwasser erwiesen sich beide Methoden als geeignet. Beide Systeme konnten ohne Störungen genutzt werden und weisen einen einfachen Aufbau und eine leichte Handhabbarkeit auf. Die MD zeichnet sich auf Grund der höheren Dialyseraten, gegeben durch eine größere Membranaustauschfläche gegenüber einem kleinen Akzeptorvolumen, mit einer höheren Empfindlichkeit aus. Die Messergebnisse beider Methoden waren mit der durchgeführten konventionellen Probenvorbereitung vergleichbar. Grundsätzliche Vorteile der entwickelten membrangestützten in-line Probenvorbereitungsmethoden für die IC gegenüber konventioneller Probenvorbereitung sind u. a. : Eine geringe Kontaminationsgefahr durch geschlossene Fließsysteme. Die Reduzierung der Fehlermöglichkeiten durch die Automatisierung. Eine höchst selektive Separation der Analyten von der Probe mittels der GD. Integration von verschiedenen Probenvorbereitungsschritten neben der Membranseparation, wie Verdünnung, bzw. Anreicherung der Analyten. Geringer Verbrauch an Probe und Reagenzien, geringe Kosten und eine automatisierbare Kalibrierung im Fließsystem. The sample {{preparation}} in chemical analysis {{is a very}} time consuming procedure. It is usually carried out manually, which might lead to systematic error in accuracy such as sample contamination and even the loss of sample. Ion chromatography is a commonly used method {{for the analysis of}} ionic compounds since there is a wide variable of separation techniques and detectors. In principle, {{sample preparation}} is necessary if the column is negatively influenced by the sample composition. Without proper preparation the separation and detection of ionic compounds could be adversely effected. The aim of this work was the development of a membrane based separation method, allowing for the sample preparation of certain ions such as sulphite, nitrite and ammonium, that would work in-line with chromatograph. Gas diffusion (GD), dialysis and microdialysis were investigated with respect to their suitability as a membrane separation method within a flow system. GD was used as an in-line sample preparation method, which can be easily automated, for the analysis of sulphite and nitrite ions as well as the simultaneous determination of short chain amines and ammonium. Therefore, systematic investigations were carried out regarding the set-up of the <b>flow-system</b> and parameters which influence the flow system, such as the configuration of the GD cell and ratios of flow rates. It was possible to optimise this method for the above mentioned ions. This allowed for simultaneous sample preparation and analysis by preparing inline a new sample while the chromatogram of the previous sample is recording. This leads to relatively high analysis efficiency. Matrix compounds, which might interfere with the measurement were effectively eliminated during samples measurements. Microdialysis was used for the preparation of samples, which contained phosphate, sulphate, nitrate and chloride as analytes. Therefore the sample or standard solution was kept static while the acceptor solution was pumped through hollow fiber membrane. Parameters which influence the separation process within the flow system, as well as the dependence of the dialysis rate on the chemical interaction of the substances, shall be dialysated were investigated. It was possible to develop and use a suitable microdialysis system for characterisation of samples. The comparison measurements of the analytes in samples when using dialysis in flow systems determined that both methods are suitable for the analysis of fresh water samples. They possessed a simple and effective set-up can be easily operated and could be used without any disturbance. However microdialysis is the more sensitive method due to higher dialysisrates, which are achieved because of the high membrane surface and the relatively low volume of the acceptor solution. The results of measurements of either method are identical to results obtained using conventional sample preparation methods. In comparison to conventional methods, the advantages of these newly developed membrane base in-line sample preparation methods for the IC are: · The reduced risk of contamination due the use of a closed flow system · Reduction of human errors due the automatization of the process · A very selective separation of analytes from the sample by GD · Integration of various steps of the sample preparation, such as membrane separation, dilution and analyt enrichment. · Low consumption of sample and reagents · Low costs · Automated calibration within flow syste...|$|E
