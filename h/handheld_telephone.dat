40|$|Context. A {{relative}} paucity of data {{exist on the}} possible health effects of using cellular telephones. Objective. To test the hypothesis that using <b>handheld</b> cellular <b>telephones</b> {{is related to the}} risk of primary brain cancer. Design and Setting. Case-control study conducted in 5 US academic medical centers between 1994 and 1998 using a structured questionnaire. Patients. A total of 469 men and women aged 18 to 80 years with primary brain cancer and 422 matched controls without brain cancer. Main Outcome Measure. Risk of brain cancer compared by use of <b>handheld</b> cellular <b>telephones,</b> in hours per month and years of use. Results. The median monthly hours of use were 2. 5 for cases and 2. 2 for controls. Compared with patients who never used <b>handheld</b> cellular <b>telephones,</b> the multivariate odds ratio (OR) associated with regular past or current use was 0. 85 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 6 - 1. 2). The OR for infrequent users (10. 1 h/mo) was 0. 7 (95 % CI, 0. 3 - 1. 4). The mean duration of use was 2. 8 years for cases and 2. 7 years for controls; no association with brain cancer was observed according to duration of use (P=. 54). In cases, cerebral tumors occurred more frequently {{on the same side of}} the head where cellular telephones had been used (26 vs 15 cases; P=. 06), but in the cases with temporal lobe cancer a greater proportion of tumors occurred in the contralateral than ipsilateral side (9 vs 5 cases; P=. 33). The OR was less than 1. 0 for all histologic categories of brain cancer except for uncommon neuroepitheliomatous cancers (OR, 2. 1; 95 % CI, 0. 9 - 4. 7). Conclusions. Our data suggest that use of <b>handheld</b> cellular <b>telephones</b> is not associated with risk of brain cancer, but further studies are needed to account for longer induction periods, especially for slow-growing tumors wit...|$|R

40|$|VTI was {{commissioned}} by the Swedish Government to compile relevant research on mobile phone and other communication device usage whilst driving. Thus, a sub-set of those activities that can distract a driver in traffic are treated in the compilation. A review of several hundred publications reveals that the topic is very complex. Even though {{a large number of}} controlled studies show that using a mobile telephone while driving has a negative impact on driving performance, this was not reflected by a strong increase in crash rates in real traffic. Both the conversation itself and manipulating a telephone have negative effects on driving performance. When writing a SMS or using a telephone in a similar manner the driver takes the eyes off the road, often several times consecutively, and at times for longer periods of time. This results in decreased control of the vehicle and an increased risk that the driver misses crucial events in traffic. During a telephone conversation the driver does tend to look at the road, but nevertheless also conversation research has found prolonged reaction times and missed traffic events. Many drivers think that it is safer to use a hands-free set than a <b>handheld</b> <b>telephone,</b> but this has not been confirmed by the available research. Most EU countries have hands-free requirements, however, many drivers do not comply with the legislation. Bans on handheld mobile phones and on texting when driving do not appear {{to reduce the number of}} crashes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} telephoning while driving were studied in three {{different}} traffic conditions, i. e. in light traffic on a quiet motorway, in heavy traffic on a four-lane ring-road, and in city traffic. Twelve subjects, unfamiliar with mobile telephones, drove an instrumented vehicle for one hour each day during three weeks and while {{in each of the}} three traffic conditions, had to operate the mobile telephone for a short while. To ensure a fixed “heavy traffic load” in the second condition, the subjects were instructed to follow another instrumented vehicle (at a safe distance). The results showed a significant effect of telephoning while driving as opposed to normal driving (i. e., not involving telephone conversation), on the effort subjectively measured by an effort scale and objectively measured by heartrate indices and on some of the measured parameters of driving performance. One half of the subjects had to operate the telephone manually, the other half performed the telephone task with a handsfree mobile telephone set. The subjects who operated the handsfree telephone showed better control over the test vehicle than the subjects who operated the <b>handheld</b> <b>telephone,</b> as measured by the steering wheel movements. Also, a clear improvement over time in the course of the 15 test days was found for some of the measurements.

40|$|Three major {{applications}} of speech enhancement have been studied: noise reduction for mobile telephone handsfree accessories, noise reduction for <b>handheld</b> mobile <b>telephones,</b> and short delay noise reduction for frame-less telephone systems.

The disturbances are a problem since the brain will not get the extra visual and other background information when interpreting the speech. The basis for all the methods presented in this thesis is a novel spectral subtraction algorithm, a speech enhancement method. The novel method improves the conventional spectral subtraction method by introducing causal properties and reducing fluctuations of the gain filter used in spectral subtraction. Further, one extra microphone is included to improve the estimate of the background noise. Frame-less communication systems are also considered.

40|$|Multimedia {{applications}} {{are expected to}} form {{a large part of}} the workload on a growing number of systems, including future <b>handheld</b> computers, wireless <b>telephones,</b> laptop computers, and desktop systems. General-purpose processors (vs. specialized DSP processors or ASICs) are expected to be increasingly employed for such workloads. Our previous work analyzed the variability in the execution time of several multimedia applications at the frame granularity on general-purpose architectures. Two broad sets of implications motivated such an analysis. First, several articles have conjectured that current complex general-purpose architectural features such as out-of-order issue, branch prediction, and caches induce significant unpredictability in execution time, making them undesirable for multimedia applications. Typical multimedia applications periodically process a set of data, commonly called a frame, and each frame must be completed in a certain amount of time. This real-time nature makes it important to be able to predict the execution time for multimedia applications. If execution time is unpredictable, then it is difficult to know how much processing power to schedule to guarantee a desired frame rate, or, conversely, what frame rate is sustainable with a given amount of processing power. We used frame-granularity execution time variability to quantify predictability and found that while execution time varies from frame to frame for many multimedia applications, the variability is mostly caused by the application algorithm and the media input. Aggressive architectural features induce little additional variability (and unpredictability) in execution time, in contrast to conventional wisdom. The second motivation of our work involved the use of adaptive architectures for multimedia applications. Researchers have recently begun to propose adaptive architectures that can dynamically reduce power and/or energy. our results implied that it is possible to dynamically predict the behavior of future frames on a variety of architectures and clock frequencies. This led to an algorithm for selecting the best architecture for the next frame in an adaptive system that optimizes performance and energy. In this paper, we extend our previous work in two ways: We extend the workload to include multimedia applications which do not have a clearly defined intuitive notion of a frame. Specifically we have identified speech recognition and speech synthesis as two good examples of such applications. In our previous work, we simulated each application running alone on the processor. However, in a realistic situation, more than one multimedia application will be running at the same time with the OS context switching between them (e. g. a video-conference which requires both audio and video codecs running simultaneously). This might lead to different variability results because the cache and the branch prediction buffers are modified by another application in between adjacent frames of an application. In this work, we model a multi-programming environment and use that to study the variability in execution time when more than one application is running...|$|R

This work focuses on the implementation of adaptive multi-standard multi-mode wireless communication systems that are implemented on dynamically reconfigurable hardware. The coarse-grained reconfigurable MONTIUM architecture is used to illustrate the mapping of wireless communication standards. Based on the mapping of different wireless communication algorithms, modifications of the MONTIUM architecture have been proposed. Baseband processing and channel decoding of different wireless communication systems have been investigated. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) wireless communication techniques have been mapped on dynamically reconfigurable System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture that contains several MONTIUM Tile Processors (TPs). We showed that a single heterogeneous reconfigurable SoC platform can support various standards with a performance similar to an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) implementation. The digital baseband processing of a HiperLAN/ 2 receiver and an Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) receiver were mapped on MONTIUM TPs. Furthermore, the Viterbi and Turbo decoder algorithms were mapped on the same reconfigurable hardware. All implementations of the baseband processing and channel decoding algorithms that are mapped on the MONTIUM TP have been verified against floating-point reference models. Performance simulations on the implemented algorithms show hardly any difference in accuracy between the floating-point reference models and the MONTIUM-based implementations. As expected, an ASIC implementation of the algorithms is more energy efficient than an implementation in reconfigurable hardware. However, the ASIC implementation is fixed and the functionality of the ASIC cannot be changed. The power consumption and the configuration size of the MONTIUM TP depends on the implemented Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms. The normalized dynamic power consumption of the MONTIUM-based Rake receiver in 0. 13 μm CMOS technology is estimated at 0. 470 mW/MHz. For the Viterbi decoder, the normalized dynamic power consumption is estimated at 0. 309 mW/MHz on the same MONTIUM architecture. The configuration sizes of the different DSP algorithms implemented on theMONTIUM TP are typically about 1 kB of configuration data. The MONTIUM TP can typically be configured as Rake or HiperLAN/ 2 receiver in less than 5 μs. In 7 μs the MONTIUM TP is configured as Viterbi or Turbo decoder. The characteristics of the algorithms can be semi-instantly changed through partial reconfiguration of the MONTIUM TP in the order of nanoseconds. The small configuration sizes of the MONTIUM-based algorithms enable new opportunities for implementing real-adaptive applications. The standards level of adaptivity allows the terminal to adapt the communication standard that is used to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and the wireless channel conditions at a certain location. The algorithm-selection level of adaptivity allows the terminal to select the algorithms that satisfy the QoS requirements in the given communication environment in the most efficient manner. The algorithm-parameter level of adaptivity allows the terminal to change the parameters of a specific algorithm. Exploiting the different kinds of adaptivity results in energy efficient wireless communication receivers that are capable of adapting the radio to the required QoS in different wireless communication environments. The flexibility, performance and low configuration overhead of the coarse-grained reconfigurable MONTIUM architecture enables the implementation of real-adaptive wireless communication receivers, which can switch their functionality instantly...|$|R
