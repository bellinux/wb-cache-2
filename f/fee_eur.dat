40|$|Since 2002, {{adults have}} been able to choose oral health care {{services}} in the public sector or in the private sector in Finland. Though various subsidies for care exist in both sectors, the Public Dental Service (PDS) is a cheaper option for the patient but, on the other hand, there are no waiting lists for private care. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess middle-aged adults' use of dental services, willingness to pay (WTP) and ability to pay (ATP) for unexpected, urgent dental treatment. Postal questionnaires on use of dental services were sent to a random sample of 1500 47 - 59 [*]year old adults living in three large municipalities in the Helsinki region. The initial response rate was 65. 8 %. Two hypothetical scenarios were presented: "What would be the highest price you would be prepared to pay to have a lost filling replaced immediately, or, at the latest, the day after losing the filling?" and " How much could you pay for unexpected dental expenses at two weeks notice, if you suddenly needed more comprehensive treatment?" Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse factors related to WTP and ATP. Most respondents (89. 6 %) had visited a dentist recently and a majority (76. 1 %) had used private services. For immediate replacement of a lost filling, almost all respondents (93. 2 %) were willing to pay the lower price charged in the PDS and 46. 2 % were willing to pay the private fee. High income and no subjective need for dental treatment were positively associated with the probability of paying a higher price. Most respondents (93. 0 %) were able to pay a low <b>fee,</b> <b>EUR</b> 50 and almost half (41. 6 %) at least EUR 300 for unexpected treatment at short notice. High income and male sex were associated with high ATP. There was a strong and statistically significant relationship between income and WTP and ATP for urgent dental care, indicating that access to publicly provided services improved equity for persons with low income...|$|E

Though various subsidies for care exist in both sectors, the Public Dental Service (PDS) is a cheaper option for the patient but, on the other hand, there are no waiting lists for private care.

50|$|Muravyov’s {{disagreements}} with SibCem Chairman Oleg Sharykin over a EUR 476 million transaction to buy Intelcementi’s Turkish assets were given {{as the main}} reason for resigning as SibCem President and exiting the company as a shareholder. Muravyov was behind the deal all along, claiming that it would help the holding company not only to bolster its positions on the Russian market, but also to facilitate its access to international markets. In May 2008, before Muravyov’s resignation, a binding agreement was signed, with SibCem transferring to the seller (a French subsidiary of Italcementi) a commitment <b>fee</b> of <b>EUR</b> 50 million. However, the deal was not closed, and the agreement was terminated by November 2008. SibCem’s continuing core shareholder - Sibconcord LLC - took the matter to courts in early 2009, claiming that the aborted deal had not been duly approved by the board or shareholders, and should therefore be considered null and void. The court found for the plaintiff, triggering the holding company’s attempts to recover the commitment fee, which was still ongoing as of year-end 2012, and is still in litigation.|$|R
