50|$|The XT {{had eight}} slots. Two {{were behind the}} floppy drive and shorter than PC's slots. The other six fit into the same space as the PC's five slots. Most PC cards would not fit into the two short slots, and some would not fit into the six standard-length, but narrower, slots, {{particularly}} cards with double boards on them. The floppy and hard <b>drive</b> <b>adapters,</b> the serial port card, and nearly always a display adapter board occupied slots. The basic specification was soon upgraded to have 256 KB of RAM as standard. Expansion slots {{could be used for}} I/O devices or for memory expansion. Available Video cards were initially the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) (the same two cards that were available for the type 5150 PC), with Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) and Professional Graphics Controller (PGC) becoming available in 1984.|$|R

50|$|The PCMCIA {{specification}} {{can be seen}} as a superset of ATA. The {{standard for}} PCMCIA hard disk interfaces, which included PCMCIA flash drives, allows for the mutual configuration of the port and the drive in an ATA mode. As a de facto extension, most PCMCIA flash drives additionally allow for a simple ATA mode that is enabled by pulling a single pin low, so that PCMCIA hardware and firmware are unnecessary to use them as an ATA drive connected to an ATA port. PCMCIA flash <b>drive</b> to ATA <b>adapters</b> are thus simple and inexpensive, but are not guaranteed to work with any and every standard PCMCIA flash <b>drive.</b> Further, such <b>adapters</b> cannot be used as generic PCMCIA ports, as the PCMCIA interface is much more complex than ATA.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a further study on Dai and Zhang’s (2008) supply networks, which are Cost Saver, <b>Adapter,</b> and Multiple <b>Driven.</b> This concept is centred on hub or focal firm {{which is the}} core of the supply networks, built on Miles and Snow’s (2003) strategic typology. In Cost Saver supply network, the hub firm is ‘Defender’; for Adapter supply network it is ‘Prospector’, while in Multiple Driven supply network it is ‘Analyser’. This study explores the interrelationship between the hub and supplier’s configuration and its effect on organisational performance. A comprehensive literature review is carried out with reference to supply chain (SC), supply network (SN) and supply network management (SNM). It stretches to describing Dai and Zhang’s (2008) novel supply networks, its association with Miles and Snow’s theory, the supply network configuration concept, and further expatiates on the need for appropriate supplier configuration for improved performances within the supply networks. The key performance indicators (KPI) adopted for this work, the variables considered in the simulation modelling were evaluated. Usable data were collected from a sample of 630 suppliers, and 15 hub firms. This is accompanied by Hypotheses testing, Case study and Simulation experiments to fulfil the aims and objectives of this research. From the findings of this study, it is confirmed that organisations can be grouped as either the Defender, Prospector, Analyser or Reactor type according to the Miles and Snow typology. The investigation identified that for Multiple <b>Driven,</b> <b>Adapter</b> and Cost Saver supply networks, performances are most improved with an increase in the existence of suppliers of the same typology with the hub organisation within the supply network...|$|R

50|$|In the Disk II, the full-height drive {{mechanism}} shipped inside a beige painted metal case {{and connected to}} the controller card via a 20-pin ribbon cable; the controller card was plugged {{into one of the}} bus slots on the Apple's mainboard. The connector is very easy to misalign on the controller card, which will short out a certain IC in the drive; if later connected correctly, a drive damaged this way will delete any disk inserted into it as soon as it starts spinning, even write-protected disks such as those used to distribute commercial software. This problem resulted in numerous customer complaints and repairs, which led to Apple printing warning messages in their user's manuals to explain how to properly install the connector. They used different connectors that could not be misaligned in later <b>drives.</b> DB-19 <b>adapters</b> for the original Disk II were eventually available for use with Apple's later connector standard.|$|R

When a car with an <b>Adapter</b> <b>drives</b> over a Pad, the two pieces are brought into close proximity, 70 - 130 mm, then current from the electrical grid flows through the coils in the Power Pad to create magnetic fields and these fields induce current flow in the Vehicle Adapter's coils to charge the battery.|$|R

It had a total of six SATA ports - four were connected to the system's drive bays, and two were not connected. The extra SATA ports could be put into service through the use of after-market extender cables to connect internal optical drives, or to provide eSATA ports with the use of an eSATA bulkhead connector. However, the two extra SATA ports were unsupported and disabled under Boot Camp.A built-to-order Mac Pro could be configured with up to 8 TB of storage (4 × 2 TB disks) or 2 TB (4 × 512 GB SSD).|$|R
50|$|The {{device is}} {{connected}} to the Famicom deck by plugging a special cartridge known as the RAM Adapter into the system's cartridge port, and attaching that cartridge's cable to the disk <b>drive.</b> The RAM <b>adapter</b> contains 32 kilobytes (KB) of RAM for temporary program storage, 8 KB of RAM for tile and sprite data storage, and an ASIC known as the 2C33. The ASIC acts as a disk controller for the floppy drive, and also includes additional sound hardware featuring a single-cycle wavetable-lookup synthesizer. Finally, embedded in the 2C33 is an 8KB BIOS ROM. The Disk Cards used are double-sided, with a total capacity of 112 KB per disk. Many games span both sides of a disk, requiring the user to switch sides at some point during gameplay. A few games use two full disks, totaling four sides. The Disk System is capable of running on six C-cell batteries or the supplied AC adapter. Batteries usually last five months with daily game play. The inclusion of a battery option is due to the likelihood of a standard set of AC plugs already being occupied by a Famicom and a television.|$|R
40|$|APPLICATION NOTE Quasi−square wave {{resonant}} converters {{also known}} as Quasi−Resonant (QR) converter are widely used in the adaptor market. They allow designing flyback Switched−Mode Power Supply (SMPS) with reduced Electro−Magnetic Interference (EMI) signature and improved efficiency. However, as the switching frequency of QR converter increases as the load decreases, the frequency must be limited. In traditional QR converter, the frequency is limited by a frequency clamp. But, when the switching frequency of the system reaches the frequency clamp limit, valley jumping occurs: the controller hesitates between two valleys resulting in an unstable operation and noise in the transformer at medium and light output loads. In order to overcome this problem, the NCP 1380 and the NCP 1379 feature a “valley lockout ” circuit: the switching frequency is decreased step by step by changing valley as the load decreases. Once the controller selects a valley, it stays locked in this valley until the output power changes significantly. This technique extends the QR operation of the system towards lighter loads without degrading the efficiency. This application note focuses {{on the design of}} an <b>adapter</b> <b>driven</b> by the NCP 1380. The equations developed are further used to design a 60 W adapter.

There is no doubt, a modern instrument must fit the network environment or simply will not be procured. Yet, funding constraints temper wholesale changes to net-centric technologies. The last analog stronghold in our data center is the oscillograph. Over 50 Gould TA 6000 Oscillographs reside at White Sands Missile Range. These are digital implementations of analog recorders, hence require analog signaling. Digital telemetry data (most common format) must be converted to analog to drive an oscillograph that converts analog back to digital to plot the data. The oscillograph’s interface board may be “hacked” by removing the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) gaining {{direct access to the}} digital signal path. This idea was worth attempting as the prospect of replacing that many recorders with the newer network driven oscillographs is costly hence remote. This paper’s topic is the conversion of the hardware and a discussion on software issues. Though not pretty, it does preserve the large recorder investment for the time being. Issues with analog signaling, such as noise, drift and ground loops are gone.
