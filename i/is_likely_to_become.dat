With rising sea levels, the work required to maintain the sea defences <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> more expensive, and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created. Other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options.|$|E
5|$|The estuary stingray's diminished {{population}} and susceptibility to multiple threats {{have led the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Vulnerable. Demographic modelling has shown that it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> Endangered without intervention. Several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are located within its range, but at present they lack adequate protection from fishing. As this ray remains locally abundant in Hervey Bay and parts of Moreton Bay, these areas may become important centers for preserving the species. The Queensland government has listed the estuary stingray on the Back on Track species prioritisation framework, to facilitate the development of conservation measures.|$|E

25|$|A further {{limitation}} of the gramophone record is that fidelity steadily declines as playback progresses; there is more vinyl per second available for fine reproduction of high frequencies at the large-diameter beginning of the groove than exist at the smaller-diameters {{close to the end}} of the side. At the start of a groove on an LP there are 510mm of vinyl per second traveling past the stylus while the ending of the groove gives 200–210mm of vinyl per second — less than half the linear resolution.

25|$|In 1908, Latvian {{linguists}} Kārlis Mīlenbahs and Jānis Endzelīns elaborated {{the modern}} Latvian alphabet, which slowly replaced the old orthography used before. Another {{feature of the}} language, in common with its sister language Lithuanian, that was developed at that time is that proper names from other countries and languages are altered phonetically to fit the phonological system of Latvian. Even if the original language also uses the Latin alphabet, this process takes place. Moreover, the names are modified {{in order to ensure}} that they have noun declension endings, declining like all other nouns. For example, a place such as Lecropt (a Scottish parish) <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> Lekropta; the Scottish village of Tillicoultry becomes Tilikutrija. This is a good example of linguistic purism in this language.|$|E
25|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to {{quantify}} the relationship between tax revenue and tax rates (for example, in the United States by the Congressional Budget Office). While the interaction between tax rates and tax revenue is generally accepted, the precise nature of this interaction is debated. In practice, the shape of a hypothetical Laffer curve for a given economy can only be estimated. The relationship between tax rate and tax revenue is likely to vary from one economy to another and depends on the elasticity of supply for labor, as well as various other factors. Even in the same economy, the characteristics of the curve could vary over time. Complexities such as progressive taxes and possible differences in the incentive to work for different income groups complicate the task of estimation. The structure of the curve may also be changed by policy decisions. For example, if tax loopholes and tax shelters are made more readily available by legislation, the point at which revenue begins to decrease with increased taxation <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> lower.|$|E

Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV News remarked, [...] "if we may be so bold, it is definitely on par with other impeccable Christmas originals—namely Carey's [...] "All I Want For Christmas Is You"."

40|$|The {{history of}} {{research}} on visually-induced illusory self motion, or vection, has demonstrated that in many instances observers have experienced disturbances {{similar to those of}} motion sickness.
