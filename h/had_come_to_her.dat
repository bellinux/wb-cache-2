At one point, she said she {{recognized}} Anna Anderson as Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, a claim she would later recant. Maria had two pet dogs, whom she called Youssou and Pov after Felix Yussupov.|$|E

25|$|Joshua {{secretly}} dispatched two spies from Shittim, instructing them to {{view the}} land and Jericho, {{and they went to}} the house of a harlot named Rahab. That night, the king of Jericho received word that Israelite men had come to search out the land, and the king sent a demand to Rahab to deliver the men who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> house. But Rahab hid the men among stalks of flax on her roof, saying that when it was dark the men had left, and she did not know where they went. The king's men left the city in pursuit of the spies {{on the road to the}} Jordan River, and the people of the city shut the city gate after them.|$|E

60|$|St. Genis would <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> by then: {{she would}} be happy to see him safe and well, and perhaps--in the midst of her joy--she would think of the friend who so gladly offered up his life for her.|$|R
500|$|Gaiman began {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} the Kirby Sandman series in issue No. 11 (December 1989), including the changes implemented by Roy Thomas. Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher had treated the character, who resembled a superhero, as the [...] "true" [...] Sandman. The Thomas and Gaiman stories revealed that the character's existence was a sham created by two nightmares who had escaped to a pocket of the Dreaming. Brute and Glob would later attempt this again on Sanderson Hawkins, sidekick to Wesley Dodds, the Golden Age Sandman. Gaiman gave Jed Walker a surname and made him related to several new characters. The Thomas Sandman was Hector Hall, who married the already-pregnant Fury in the Dreaming in Infinity, Inc. No. 51. It was explained that Dr. Garrett Sanford, the 1970s Simon and Kirby version of the Sandman, had gone insane from the loneliness of the Dream Dimension and taken his own life. Brute and Glob put the spirit of Hector Hall, which had been cast {{out of his own}} body into Sanford's body, and it eventually began to resemble Hall's. Fury, in her civilian guise as Lyta Hall was the only superhero recurring character in the series. Even at that, her powers <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> via the Fury Tisiphone, and the Furies, under the euphemism, [...] "the Kindly Ones", a translation of [...] "Eumenides", a name they earned during the events of Aeschylus's Oresteia trilogy, are major characters in the series.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|But then again, it is Edna, in the end, who {{realizes that}} there are {{boundaries}}, even between friends. She understands {{that there are}} some boundaries that should not be pushed, some things that “we may not do [...] [...] [...] not ask, for fear of looking in a mirror.” And it is also through her reflection that the play resolves. Edna has looked into that mirror {{at the end of the}} play and has decided that if the tables were turned, if Agnes and Tobias <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> she would not have allowed them to stay at her house.|$|E

2500|$|Captain {{started the}} battle towards {{the rear of}} the British line. Instead of {{continuing}} to follow the line, Nelson disobeyed orders and wore ship, and made for the Spanish van, which consisted of the 112-gun San Josef, the 80-gun San Nicolas and the 130-gun Santísima Trinidad. Captain engaged all three, assisted by [...] which <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> aid. After an hour of exchanging broadsides which left both Captain and Culloden heavily damaged, Nelson found himself alongside the San Nicolas which he boarded and forced her surrender. [...] San Josef attempted to come to the San Nicolas’s aid, but became entangled with her compatriot and was left immobile. Nelson led his party from the deck of the San Nicolas onto the San Josef and captured her as well.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the battle}} of Cape St Vincent, on 14 February 1797, Captain was {{to the rear of}} the British line. Instead of {{continuing}} to follow the line, Nelson disobeyed orders from the commander in chief, Sir John Jervis and wore ship, breaking from the line and heading to engage the Spanish van, which consisted of the 112-gun , the 80-gun [...] and the 130-gun Santísima Trinidad. Captain engaged all three, assisted by [...] which <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> aid. After an hour of exchanging broadsides, Captain found herself alongside the San Nicolas. Nelson led a boarding party across and forced her surrender. San Josef attempted to come to the San Nicolas’s aid, but became entangled with her compatriot and was left immobile.

After the battle, the Spanish sought refuge in Cadiz where they were subsequently blockaded by the British.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1997, Graner's {{wife and}} mother of their two {{children}} filed for divorce and sought a protection order, saying Graner had threatened to kill her. A six-month order was granted, unopposed by Graner. Shortly after the first one expired, Staci Dean was granted a second protection order, saying Graner <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> house, thrown her against some furniture, thrown her on the bed, grabbed her arm and hit {{her face with her}} arm. Three years later, Dean called police after Graner came to her house and attacked her. Dean said Graner had [...] "yanked me out of bed by my hair, dragging me and all the covers into the hall and tried to throw me down the steps." [...] Afterwards, Graner called a friend of Dean's and allegedly said, [...] "I have nothing if she's not my wife, she's dead." [...] Graner admitted the attack and a third order of protection was granted.|$|E

60|$|Still, it {{was strange}} that they should <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> while yet so young; more than strange; it was impressive, interesting, pathetic.

2500|$|Lopez's first {{greatest}} hits album, Dance Again... the Hits, {{was released on}} July 24, 2012 in the United States. It was released by Epic Records, as Lopez owed them one final album to end her contract, despite previously announcing that she had fulfilled her contract with the label. Lopez, who {{was going through a}} divorce with Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the album's sole single, [...] "Dance Again", <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at the [...] "perfect moment". [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "Goin' In", a single from the soundtrack of the dance film Step Up Revolution, both {{reached the top of the}} Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs, giving Lopez her twelfth and thirteenth number one on that chart, respectively. nuvoTV announced in September its premier partnership with Lopez, that will see her work on the creative side of the network, managing marketing and program production with her production company, Nuyorican Productions, as well as periodically appearing in network programming.|$|E
2500|$|They {{took the}} three {{children}} {{to the home of}} William Starck, a neighbor, for immediate care. Starck's daughter, Anna Starck Benjamin, who was 4½ years old at the time, remembered [...] "the sound of Hazel's outstretched arms as they brushed against the furniture as they brought her into the house, and took her into my parents' bedroom. The crackling sound as that of frozen laundry brought in off the clothes line in winter. Then I remember the crying, so much crying." [...] They worked over Hazel for hours, trying to revive her, but without success. Hazel's mother, Blanche, was brought to the Starck house after the searchers found the children and sat in a chair, rocking back and forth, while they tended to {{the three children}}. Throughout the night when the children were missing, she had been kept company by neighbors. At one point, she drifted off to sleep, and said later that her daughter <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in a dream. In the dream, Hazel said, [...] "I was cold, Mama, but I'm not anymore." ...|$|E
