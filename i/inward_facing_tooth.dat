40|$|Major {{facilitator}} superfamily (MFS) peptide transporters (typically {{referred to}} as PepT, POT or PTR transporters) mediate the uptake of di- and tripeptides, and so play an important dietary role in many organisms. In recent years, {{a better understanding of}} the molecular basis for this process has emerged, which is in large part due to a steep increase in structural information. Yet, the conformational transitions underlying the transport mechanism are still not fully understood, and additional data is therefore needed. Here we report in detail the detergent screening, crystallization, experimental MIRAS phasing, and refinement of the peptide transporter PepTSt from Streptococcus thermophilus. The space group is P 3121, and the protein is crystallized in a monomeric <b>inward</b> <b>facing</b> form. The binding site is likely to be somewhat occluded, as the lobe encompassing transmembrane helices 10 and 11 is markedly bent towards the central pore of the protein, but the extent of this potential occlusion could not be determined due to disorder at the apex of the lobe. Based on structural comparisons with the seven previously determined P 212121 and C 2221 structures of <b>inward</b> <b>facing</b> PepTSt, the structural flexibility as well as the conformational changes mediating transition between the inward open and <b>inward</b> <b>facing</b> occluded states are discussed. In conclusion, this report improves our understanding of the structure and conformational cycle of PepTSt, and can furthermore serve as a case study, which may aid in supporting future structure determinations of additional MFS transporters or other integral membrane proteins...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{distribution}} of faults and fault characteristics along the East Pacific Rise (EPR) crest between 9 ° 25 ′N and 9 ° 58 ′N were studied using high-resolution side-scan sonar data and near-bottom bathymetric profiles. The resulting analysis shows important {{variations in the}} density of deformational features and tectonic strain estimates at young seafloor relative to older, sediment-covered seafloor of the same spreading age. We estimate that the expression of tectonic deformation and associated strain on “old” seafloor is ∼ 5 times greater than that on “young” seafloor, owing to the frequent fault burial by recent lava flows. Thus the unseen, volcanically overprinted tectonic deformation may contribute from 30 % to 100 % of the ∼ 300 m of subsidence required to fully build up the extrusive pile (Layer 2 A). Many longer lava flows (greater than ∼ 1 km) dam against <b>inward</b> <b>facing</b> fault scarps. This limits their length at distances of 1 – 2 km, which are coincident with where the extrusive layer acquires its full thickness. More than 2 % of plate separation at the EPR is accommodated by brittle deformation, which consists mainly of <b>inward</b> <b>facing</b> faults (∼ 70 %). Faulting at the EPR crest occurs within the narrow, ∼ 4 km wide upper crust that behaves as a brittle lid overlying the axial magma chamber. Deformation at greater distances off axis (up to 40 km) is accommodated by flexure of the lithosphere due to thermal subsidence, resulting in ∼ 50 % <b>inward</b> <b>facing</b> faults accommodating ∼ 50 % of the strain. On the basis of observed burial of faults by lava flows and damming of flows by fault scarps, {{we find that the}} development of Layer 2 A is strongly controlled by low-relief growth faults that form at the ridge crest and its upper flanks. In turn, those faults have a profound impact on how lava flows are distributed along and across the ridge crest...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{possible}} mechanism {{responsible for}} the formation of jets observed near young stellar objects is thought to involve conically converging flows which are generated when the stellar wind encounters an <b>inward</b> <b>facing</b> shock at an oblique angle. While this mechanism of inertial collimation has been verified by simulations, it is not accessible to direct observations due to the small scales on which it operates. Until recently, laboratory experiments have only been able to reproduce {{the second part of the}} mechanism by directly creating a converging conical flow to produce a jet. In this contribution we present a conceptual numerical study proposing an new configuration to create jets that are able to reproduce both stages of the mechanism, including the <b>inward</b> <b>facing</b> reverse shock, from simple initial conditions. By selectively heating a small region inside a target, irradiated by a high-intensity laser pulse, a jet can be created inside the plasma behind the rear target surface. We present three dimensional simulations of the formation of the jet. We find jets with aspect ratios of over 15 and Mach numbers between 2. 5 and 4. 3. The influence of simulation parameters is investigated and the applicability of the jets to their astrophysical counterparts is discussed...|$|R

However, a strength calculation solution, in which bending stresses, contact stresses, and bulk temperatures are included, combined with gear design standards for face gear drives, is still not constructed due to complex <b>face</b> gear <b>teeth.</b> Thus, in this study, an equivalent <b>face</b> gear <b>tooth</b> is proposed by assessment of geometric characteristics of <b>face</b> gear <b>teeth</b> and tooth contact analysis, and a strength calculation solution of face gear drives, {{which is based on}} ISO 6336 standard associated with the proposed equivalent <b>face</b> gear <b>teeth,</b> is constructed. The fidelity of the proposed strength calculation solution of face gear drives is verified by comparing its results with the benchmark of results by finite element methods.
