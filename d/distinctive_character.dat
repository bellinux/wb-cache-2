25|$|Long {{discussed}} {{but so far}} unresolved is {{the question}} of how many artists participated in producing the Gigantomachy. Just as disputed {{is the extent to which}} the character of individual artists can be identified in this work of art.

In view of its consistency down to the level of details, the plan must have been worked out to its smallest elements; nothing had been left to chance. Already in the arrangement of the fighting groups it can be noted that each group is unique and, for example, that the hairstyle and the footwear of the goddesses always differ. Each of the pairs of fighters is individually arranged. Thus, the figures in themselves reveal their <b>distinctive</b> <b>character</b> rather than this being the result of the artists’ personal styles.|$|E
