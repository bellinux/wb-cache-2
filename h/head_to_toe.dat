5|$|On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death {{reached the}} King and Anne, who were overjoyed. The {{following}} day, Henry and Anne wore yellow, {{the symbol of}} joy and celebration in England, from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>toe,</b> and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities. In Spain, the home country of Catherine of Aragon, yellow was the colour of mourning, in addition to black. For this reason, the wearing of yellow by Henry and Anne {{may have been a}} symbol of mourning. With Mary's mother dead, Anne attempted to make peace with her. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that her heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but of cancer of the heart, something which was not understood at the time.|$|E
5|$|The guest cast {{required}} {{a variety of}} levels of make-up to portray their alien characters. Combs' make-up took around {{three and a half}} hours each day, as did the Tellarite prosthetics. The Andorian female cast members took around four and a half hour each day to get into make-up and costume, but on the first day Brink required further make-up time as that day's shoot required her to appear in-character in her underwear. This meant that after the normal make-up schedule, she was sprayed blue from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>toe.</b> At the end of that day's filming, the shower facilities at the studio's executive gym was used to remove the paint. Meanwhile, the Romulan make-up took three hours to apply, with all the relevant scenes completed in a single day.|$|E

25|$|After graduating, both Orton and Halliwell {{went into}} {{regional}} repertory work: Orton spent {{four months in}} Ipswich as an assistant stage manager; Halliwell in Llandudno, Wales. Both returned to London and began to write together. They collaborated {{on a number of}} unpublished novels (often imitating Ronald Firbank) with no success at gaining publication. The rejection of their great hope, The Last Days of Sodom, in 1957 led them to solo works. Orton wrote his last novel, The Vision of Gombold Proval (posthumously published as <b>Head</b> <b>to</b> <b>Toe),</b> in 1959. He would later draw on these manuscripts for ideas; many show glimpses of his stage-play style.|$|E

Although time trials (races between individuals competing against the clock) had started as a revolt against the NCU's ban – the races were held at dawn on courses kept secret from the public with riders dressed from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>toe</b> in black to complete the secrecy – there were no races on open roads between riders starting together.|$|E

25|$|Chinese-Filipino families, casually called chinoys, {{practice}} {{a number of}} rituals whenever a loved one passes away. Most of these practices are derived from Chinese tradition and Buddhism with a slight incorporation of other religions. Traditional Chinese practices involve the burning of paper versions of material goods such as houses, cars, helicopters, yachts, and money, so that the deceased {{will be able to}} enjoy such in the afterlife. Loved ones are not also allowed to cut their locks for forty days and are encouraged to wear white from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>toe.</b> The Buddhism aspect that is combined with these customs would be the burning of the incense and the offering of fruits as a sign of respect to the dead.

25|$|In 2006, {{two major}} {{productions}} were staged {{within a few}} weeks of one another. The first opened on 29 May at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by Lucy Bailey and starring Douglas Hodge as Titus, Geraldine Alexander as Tamora, Shaun Parkes as Aaron and Laura Rees as Lavinia. Bailey focused on a realistic presentation throughout the production; for example, after her mutilation, Lavinia is covered from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>toe</b> in blood, with her stumps crudely bandaged, and raw flesh visible beneath. So graphic was Bailey's use of realism that at several productions, audience members fainted upon Lavinia's appearance. The production was also controversial insofar as the Globe had a roof installed {{for the first time in}} its history. The decision was taken by designer William Dudley, who took as his inspiration a feature of the Colosseum known as a velarium – a cooling system which consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the centre. Dudley made it as a PVC awning which was intended to darken the auditorium.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the technique and to evaluate the results of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging in an asymptomatic population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between March 2009 and December 2011, 118 consecutive subjects undergoing thorough medical check-up were prospectively included in the study. MRI was performed with a 205 -cm moving table, parallel imaging and automatic image composing software. RESULTS: In 83 subjects (70 %), 103 benign lesions were detected. Two malignant (adrenal and renal carcinoma) lesions and one precancerous (pancreatic mucinous carcinoma) lesion were detected. The most common lesions were renal cysts, liver hemangiomas, liver cysts, thyroid nodules, and uterine leiomyomas. CONCLUSIONS: WB-MRI is able to cover area from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>toes</b> in one diagnostic work-up, and besides the anatomic regions evaluated by conventional radiological modalities, i. e. brain parenchyma, bones and extremities, can be evaluated in one examination...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{proposed}} that an internal representation of body vertical has {{a prominent role in}} spatial orientation. This investigation investigated the ability of human subjects to accurately locate their longitudinal body axis (an imaginary straight body midline running from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>toes)</b> while free-floating in microgravity. Subjects were tested in-flight, as well as on ground in normal gravity in both the upright and supine orientations to provide baseline measurements. The subjects wore a goggle device and were in total darkness. They used knobs to rotate two luminous lines until they were parallel to the subjective direction of their longitudinal body axis, in the roll (right/left) and the pitch (forward/backward) planes. Results showed that the error between the perceived and the objective direction of the longitudinal body axis was significantly larger in microgravity than in normal gravity. This error in this egocentric frame of reference is presumably due to the absence of somatosensory cues when free-floating. Mechanical pressure on the chest using an airbag reduced the error in perception of the longitudinal body axis in microgravity, thus improving spatial orientation...|$|R
