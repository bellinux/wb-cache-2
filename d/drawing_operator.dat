40|$|International audienceIn {{automotive}} manufacturing, {{quality inspection}} of spot welding demands excessive manual operations. Operators {{refer to a}} printed drawing of the testing body, with the inspection points marked on this <b>drawing.</b> <b>Operators</b> have to locate the matching spot on the drawing and the body manually to perform the inspection. Further more, different subsets of spots are inspected on different car bodies with a pre-determined sequence. This paper describes a system that projects visual data onto arbitrary surfaces for providing just-in-time information to a user in-situ within a physical work-cell. This system aims to reduce the inefficiencies and potential mistakes in manual inspection process. This paper discusses how spatial augmented reality and head-mount displays may be combined to display global information visible by all operators as well as personalized information to individuals. Further investigations on applying spatial augmented reality for spot welding inspections are explored, including four types of digital information projected onto the surfaces of car body parts under structured work environments: 1) Location of spot welds; 2) Inspection methods; 3) Operation Description Sheet (ODS) information; 4) Visualization of weld locating methods. Three visualization methods are used to attract operators’ attention to locate the position of spot welds efficiently. This paper also proposes a method to project augmentations on objects moving along an assembly line. The proposed system allows operators becoming more effective and efficient in performing proper inspections, by providing them the required information at the required time without the need to refer to paper-based manuals or computer terminals...|$|R

40|$|Category {{theory is}} a very general formalism, {{but there is a}} certain special way that {{physicists}} use categories which turns out to have close analogues in topology, logic and computation. A category has objects and morphisms, which represent things and ways to go between things. In physics, the objects are often physical systems, and the morphisms are processes turning a state of one physical system into a state of another system — perhaps the same one. In quantum physics we often formalize this by taking Hilbert spaces as objects, and linear operators as morphisms. Sometime a bit before 1949, Feynman [46] realized that it is useful to <b>draw</b> linear <b>operators</b> in quantum field theory as diagrams: This lets us reason with them pictorially. We can warp a picture without changing the operator it stands for: all that matters is the topology, not the geometry.

This analogy is now being intensively exploited in string theory, loop quantum gravity, and especially topological quantum field theory.
