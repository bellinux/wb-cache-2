5|$|Starting in Otley, {{the race}} headed east towards Harewood, {{where the women}} would tackle the first {{categorised}} climb of the day – the 1.2km Côte de Harwood averaging 5% in gradient. The race would continue east, heading through East Keswick taking on the second classified climb of the day – the Côte de East Rigton. The second climb was slightly shorter, at 0.8km, but boasted a steeper average gradient of 8.2%. The race now <b>headed</b> <b>south,</b> to the intermediate sprint point in Scholes. After the sprint point, the route would take the riders south east, to Sherburn-in-Elmet, then south to Knottingley. After passing through Pontefract the route <b>headed</b> <b>south</b> through Wentbridge, South Elmsall and Hooton Pagnell. After skirting round the westerly side of Doncaster the riders would go through the second intermediate sprint point at Warmsworth and would almost immediately tackle the final and shortest classified climb of the day, the 0.5km 6.5% Côte de Conisbrough Castle. The final stages of the race saw the route pass through Tickhill and Bawtry before heading north to finish line in Doncaster.|$|E
5|$|The Persian fleet was duly {{assembled}} {{in the spring of}} 499 BC, and sailed to Ionia. Artaphernes put his (and Darius's) cousin Megabates in charge of the expedition, and dispatched him to Miletus with the Persian army. They were joined there by Aristagoras and the Milesian forces, and then embarked and set sail. In order to avoid warning the Naxians, the fleet initially sailed north, towards the Hellespont, but when they arrived at Chios they doubled back and <b>headed</b> <b>south</b> for Naxos.|$|E

5|$|While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander {{immediately}} <b>headed</b> <b>south.</b> While {{the other}} cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed {{the city and}} divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace. Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent.|$|E
5|$|Accounts vary, but historians {{estimate}} that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise. Shortly afterward, Barnette <b>headed</b> <b>south</b> with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E

5|$|As {{tensions}} rose {{between the}} colonists and Britain {{in the early}} 1770s, Philipse remained loyal to the crown. He was arrested in August 1776 and held in Connecticut until a parole grant {{at the end of}} the year allowed him to return home as long as he did nothing to support the British war effort. He broke that promise the next spring: he attempted, perhaps at the behest of his wife, to inform the British that a passing column of Continental Army troops was <b>headed</b> <b>south</b> to attack a British camp at Morrisania, now in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards he fled to British-occupied New York; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill.|$|E
5|$|Following these events, Macrinus {{traveled}} to Apamea {{to ensure the}} loyalty of Legio II Parthica before setting off to march against Emesa. According to Dio, Macrinus appointed his son Diadumenian {{to the position of}} Imperator, and promised the soldiers 20,000 Sesterces each, with 4,000 of these to be paid on the spot. Dio further comments that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian. At the dinner, Macrinus was supposedly presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who had been killed by his soldiers. In response, Macrinus left Apamea <b>headed</b> <b>south.</b>|$|E

5|$|In July 1780, 5,000 veteran French troops {{led by the}} comte de Rochambeau {{arrived at}} Newport, Rhode Island {{to aid in the}} war. French naval forces then landed, led by Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse. At first Washington hoped to bring the allied fight to New York and to end the war there, but Rochambeau advised de Grasse that Cornwallis in Virginia was the better target. Admiral de Grasse {{followed}} this advice and arrived off the Virginia coast. Washington immediately saw the advantage created, made a feinting move with his force towards Clinton in New York, and then <b>headed</b> <b>south</b> to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Corning, NY44, and later NY414, {{originally}} entered from the north on Baker Street and met NY17 at Pulteney Street. The two routes then overlapped along Pulteney Street to Centerway, where they crossed the Chemung River via Centerway and Pine Street. At Market Street, NY17 and NY44 turned east and remained concurrent to Conhocton Street, where NY44 <b>headed</b> <b>south</b> to Caton while NY17 continued east on Market to the hamlet of Gibson. When the overlap through Corning was eliminated in 1949, NY414 was truncated to {{the western end of}} the overlap at the intersection of Baker and Pulteney Streets.|$|E

The 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, who were the furthest away at LZW, crossed the Caen canal and River Orne bridges. These had been captured twenty-one hours earlier by their own 'D' Company who were now headed towards Herouvillette and Escoville. By midnight, the 6th Airborne Division was the only Allied formation to have seized all of its D-Day objectives.|$|E

5|$|Near its {{junction}} {{with the}} River Arun, the river loops {{to the south}} in a large meander. A cut ran {{from the start of}} the meander to join the Arun above the original junction, with a lock towards the downstream end. The meander fed Hardham Corn Mill. A lock bypassed the mill and the millstream, to enable boats to reach the Hardham Tunnel cut, which <b>headed</b> <b>south</b> from a junction above the mill. The Tunnel Branch was destroyed by the construction of a water treatment works, and the modern weir near the mouth is much closer to the junction than the lock was.|$|E
5|$|Rejected by {{his former}} comrades and hunted by the Allies, Himmler {{attempted}} {{to go into}} hiding. He had not made extensive preparations for this, but he had equipped himself with a forged paybook {{under the name of}} Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger. With a small band of companions, he <b>headed</b> <b>south</b> on 11 May to Friedrichskoog, without a final destination in mind. They continued on to Neuhaus, where the group split up. On 21 May, Himmler and two aides were stopped and detained at a checkpoint set up by former Soviet POWs. Over the following two days, he was moved around to several camps and was brought to the British 31st Civilian Interrogation Camp near Lüneburg, on 23 May.|$|E
5|$|The main {{cell in the}} {{thunderstorm}} system {{appeared from}} Bureau of Meteorology radar analysis to split into two separate and distinct cells.

The southern cell struck Brisbane just after 1:00pm, with intense lightning activity and hailstones the size of marbles falling. The storm caused a lengthy delay during the First Test of the series between Australia and the West Indies, when hail forced play to be stopped at the Brisbane Cricket Ground around 1:15pm.|$|E
