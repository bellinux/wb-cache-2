40|$|Accurate {{vector control}} of a linear {{induction}} motor (LIM) drive is a complicated subject because of the <b>end</b> <b>effect</b> phenomenon especially in the field-weakening region. This paper concentrates on a novel field-weakening speed control strategy for LIM drive in which the <b>end</b> <b>effect</b> is taken into account. Considering the <b>end</b> <b>effect,</b> new voltage and current limits have been calculated using the Duncan's model. Accordingly, control strategies such as constant force region, partial field-weakening region, and full field-weakening region have been analytically calculated {{for the first time}} in this work. In order to improve the control characteristics of the LIM drive, Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) has been also implemented. Simulation results manifest the satisfactory resultants of the proposed FLC based LIM in the field-weakening region including fast response, no overshoot, negligible steady-state error, and adaptability to load changes. In addition, a new constant force pattern is introduced in this paper by which the reductions of the LIM thrust due to the <b>end</b> <b>effect</b> will be compensated and thus, the current and voltage amplitudes in steady state will remarkably decrease...|$|R

Based on this, the adaptive waveform matching extension method is proposed.|$|R
