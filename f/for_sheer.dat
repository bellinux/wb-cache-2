25|$|Stamp {{collecting}} {{is generally}} accepted {{as one of}} the areas that make up the wider subject of philately, which is the study of stamps. A philatelist may, but does not have to, collect stamps. It is not uncommon for the term philatelist to be used to mean a stamp collector. Many casual stamp collectors accumulate stamps <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> enjoyment and relaxation without worrying about the tiny details. The creation of a large or comprehensive collection, however, generally requires some philatelic knowledge and will usually contain areas of philatelic studies.|$|E

25|$|Ships from Red Bay alone sent 6,000–9,000 {{barrels of}} oil to Europe every year during the peak of exploitation, while a further 8,000 or 9,000 barrels was {{produced}} in St. Modeste, Chateau Bay, and other harbors. Each ship averaged 1,000 barrels a season, a cargo that rivaled the Spanish galleons bringing back treasure from the Caribbean <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> monetary value. So, on average, a minimum of 15,000 {{barrels of oil}} would have been produced each year, which would have involved a catch of at least 300 whales, or twenty per ship.|$|E
25|$|The World Cup was {{at risk of}} {{not being}} held <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> lack of {{interest}} from the international community, until Brazil presented a bid at the 1946 FIFA Congress, offering to host the event on condition that the tournament take place in 1950 (it was originally planned {{to take place in}} 1949). Brazil and Germany had been the leading bidders to host the cancelled 1942 World Cup; since both the 1934 and 1938 tournaments had been held in Europe, football historians generally agree that the 1942 event would most likely have been awarded to a South American host country. Brazil's new bid was very similar to the mooted 1942 bid and was quickly accepted.|$|E
25|$|Stelas. These are large, {{elongated}} stone slabs usually {{covered with}} carvings and inscriptions, and {{often accompanied by}} round altars. Typical of the Classical period, most of them depict the rulers of the cities they were located in, often disguised as gods. Although the rulers' faces, particularly during the later Classic Period, are naturalistic in style, they usually do not show individual traits; but there are notable exceptions to this rule (e.g., Piedras Negras, stela 35). The most famous stelas are from Copan and nearby Quirigua. These are outstanding for their intricateness of detail, those of Quirigua also <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> height (stela E measuring over 7 metres above ground level and 3 below). Both the Copan and Tonina stelas approach sculptures in the round. From Palenque, otherwise a true Maya capital of the arts, no significant stelae have been preserved.|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{observed}} that Hornung's stories and novels are well-structured. George Orwell wrote that Hornung was [...] "a very conscientious and on his level a very able writer. Anyone who cares <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> efficiency must admire his work". Watson states that Hornung's [...] "writing has pace. The stories, however ridiculous, carry the readers along briskly". According to Cox, [...] "Hornung's work showed steady maturation" [...] during his career, a point that Doyle also agreed with, although Edwards disagrees, and thinks The Crime Doctor {{to be one of}} Hornung's weaker books.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert praised 2012, {{giving it}} [...] stars out of 4 {{and saying that}} it [...] "delivers what it promises, and since no sentient being will buy a ticket expecting {{anything}} else, it will be, for its audiences, {{one of the most}} satisfactory films of the year". Ebert and Claudia Puig of USA Today called the film the [...] "mother of all disaster movies". But Peter Travers of Rolling Stone compared it to : [...] "Beware 2012, which works the dubious miracle of almost matching Transformers 2 <b>for</b> <b>sheer,</b> cynical, mind-numbing, time-wasting, money-draining, soul-sucking stupidity." ...|$|E

Their remix of the song has an extended intro lasting 90 seconds with the rappers singing [...] "dirty" [...] bars. Reviewers were critical of Rhymes' contribution to the remix, with Spins Marc Hogan calling it [...] "conventionally porny", and Hayden Manders of Refinery29 suggesting it [...] "take the tease of the original's writing {{and turn it into}} sleaze." [...] Banks' effort was contrastingly hailed for [...] "delivering the ratatat wordplay that brought her to acclaim while wisely avoiding trying to beat either of the track's other artists <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> bawdiness" [...] by Hogan and [...] "working perfectly with the deep, subdued beat of Beyoncé's original" [...] by Carolyn Menyes from the website Music Times.|$|E

500|$|The Keep, the Well Tower and the Kitchen Tower {{incorporate}} {{a series of}} apartments, of which the main sequence, the Castellan's Rooms, lies within the Keep. The Hall, the Drawing Room, Lord Bute's Bedroom and Lady Bute's Bedroom form a suite of rooms that exemplify the High Victorian Gothic style of 19th century Britain. Unlike {{the exterior of the}} castle, which deliberately imitated the architecture of the 13th century, the interior was purely High Victorian in style. On Burges's decoration of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, Handley-Read wrote: [...] "I have yet to see any High Victorian interiors from the hand, very largely, of one designer, to equal either in homogeneity or completeness, in quality of execution or originality of conception the best of the interiors of the Welsh castles. <b>For</b> <b>sheer</b> power of intoxication, Burges stand unrivalled." ...|$|E
500|$|By then, {{like many}} [...] "Germanophile" [...] Conservatives, Bogdan-Pitești {{had come to}} support the Romanian Kingdom's {{alliance}} with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. This view was popularized by means of his literary club, {{and support for the}} Central Powers was also voiced by Arghezi at Seara. In September 1914, a German consortium purchased the paper (together with Cantacuzino's other gazette, Minerva), and Bogdan-Pitești was kept on as a simple columnist. Throughout the interval, Bogdan-Pitești was himself an outspoken Germanophile. His circle, which was already hostile to the National Liberal cabinet of Ion I. C. Brătianu, welcomed the diverse groups who were alarmed by Romania's probable entry into the war: the pro-German Conservatives, the supporters of proletarian internationalism, and the committed pacifists. The artistic clientele was also represented in the Germanophile group at large, but, Cernat's writes, did so <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> dependency rather than actual convictions.|$|E
500|$|Author Robert Rodriguez writes that, {{although}} the brevity of each selection allowed little opportunity for progression beyond a basic motif, [...] "sonically, the range explored {{even within the}} Western cues was astonishing". He adds: [...] "The Indian cuts too were quite varied stylistically, showing open-minded listeners {{that there was more}} to the country's music than twanging sitars and thumping tablas." [...] Simon Leng considers Wonderwall Music to be [...] "a companion in spirit" [...] to Bill Evans' Conversations with Myself (1963), due to the doubling of the lead instrument in some of the Indian pieces; he comments on the significance of Harrison recording in India in January 1968: [...] "There were now three Beatles who held firm artistic visions. The group was unraveling in earnest." [...] Leng praises [...] "Dream Scene" [...] in particular, describing it as a [...] "musical acid trip" [...] that [...] "rivals anything on Sgt. Pepper <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> freak-out effect".|$|E

On February24, 1923, commission secretary Hans Caemmerer showed the completed models to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary Margaret O'Reilly, who was pleased with them. [...] O'Reilly suggested that if Beach was certain there would be no further changes, that he send photographs of the models to the commission's offices, to be forwarded with its endorsement to the Bureau of the Mint in Washington. [...] This was done, and the designs were approved by both Mint Director Frank Edgar Scobey and Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon on March8. [...] Moore was enthusiastic about the designs, writing to Davison on March21 that [...] "I feel great exultation over the way the model... has turned out...

500|$|According to Maz Hallima of Flavour Magazine, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] {{has a very}} [...] "teenager-ish vibe" [...] which {{according}} to her works well, however she is aware why Rihanna kept it as a bonus track of the album. Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the song [...] "can't be beat <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> likability". He further noted that Rihanna is stepping back from her [...] "hypersexual persona to sing a more earnest, good-natured tune". Michael Jepson of The Fourth State concluded that [...] "Do Ya Thang", together with [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] and [...] "Roc Me Out", are the top candidates from Talk That Talk that can be labeled as the album's [...] "highlights". According to Jepson, all three songs are [...] "blatantly raunchy" [...] and feel like a follow up to Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "S" [...] (Loud, 2011). Shaun Kitchener of EntertainmentWise concluded that Rihanna [...] "takes a breather for 'Do Ya Thang', and we get a rare glimpse of Sweet Loving Rihanna instead." ...|$|E

[...] Dave Golder from SFX thought that although the series was [...] "shaping up to be like no other before it, as the show moves even further away from its traditional series of sequential standalone stories format and more towards Lost style storytelling", that the episode [...] "is no mere exercise in delayed gratification. You want fun? You want creepy? You want action? You've got it– all not-so-neatly tied up with a neat bow tie." [...] Golder went on to state that [...] "once again we're treated to some outstanding direction, glorious performances, near flawless FX and gorgeous locations ... "Day Of The Moon" [...] is huge fun, effortlessly entertaining, beguilingly bat's-arse [...] and blessed with a cliffhanger so jawdroppingly unexpected it's bound to keep viewers hooked". He gave the episode a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E

500|$|ACEs Steve Cooke {{also found}} the {{controls}} convenient, and he praised the game's atmosphere. He wrote that, [...] "in graphics and sound terms ... Monkey Island, along with King's Quest V, is currently {{at the head of}} the pack." [...] However, he disliked the designers' running joke of placing [...] "TM" [...] after character and place names, which he thought detracted from the atmosphere. He singled out the game's writing, characters and plot structure as its best elements. Amiga Powers Mark Ramshaw wrote, [...] "With The Secret of Monkey Island, the mouse-controlled, graphic-adventure comes of age." [...] He lauded its comedic elements, which he believed were the highlight of the game. The reviewer also praised the control scheme, noting that it allows the player to [...] "more or less forget about the specifics of what [...] physically doing ... and lose [...] in the adventure instead." [...] He noted that the game's plot and visual and aural presentation fit together to create a thick atmosphere, and finished, [...] "Forget all those other milestone adventures (Zork, The Hobbit, [...] et al) — <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> enjoyment and general all-round perfection, The Secret of Monkey Island creams 'em all in style."

500|$|Philip Day of The Sunday Times noted [...] "How wincingly well Mr Fleming writes", {{while the}} {{reviewer}} for The Times, thought that [...] "his is an ingenious affair, full of recondite knowledge and horrific spills and thrills – of slightly sadistic excitements also – though without the simple and bold design of its predecessor". Elizabeth L Sturch, writing in The Times Literary Supplement, observed that Fleming was [...] "without doubt {{the most interesting}} recent recruit among thriller-writers" [...] and that Live and Let Die [...] "fully maintains the promise of... Casino Royale." [...] Tempering her praise of the book, Sturch thought that [...] "Mr Fleming works often {{on the edge of}} flippancy, rather in the spirit of a highbrow", although overall she felt that the novel [...] "contains passages which <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> excitement have not been surpassed by any modern writer of this kind". The reviewer for The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "the book is continually exciting, whether it takes us into the heart of Harlem or describes an underwater swim in shark-infested waters; and it is more entertaining because Mr Fleming does not take it all too seriously himself". [...] George Malcolm Thompson, writing in The Evening Standard, believed Live and Let Die to be [...] "tense; ice-cold, sophisticated; Peter Cheyney for the carriage trade".|$|E
500|$|Mileena is {{commonly}} perceived {{as one of}} the best characters of Mortal Kombat II in gameplay terms. She was ranked as the game's best overall fighter by Sega Visions for her high speed and reach as well as her teleport kick that can uniquely dodge the opponent's projectiles. Super Play too called her [...] "the best MKII character" [...] as she is [...] "fast, with a good range of attacks, and the potential for the most awesome combo in the game." [...] EGM noted about how this [...] "deadly woman...can hold her own against any man in the game" [...] as her players can use her [...] "lightning speed" [...] and the sai blasts to overcome other players, while C+VG evaluated all of Mortal Kombat II characters as [...] "well-balanced" [...] and [...] "potentially excellent", but still the teleport kick of the [...] "very fast" [...] Mileena was singled out by them as [...] "the best surprising move in the game." [...] According to CU Amiga, Mileena was [...] "third only to Jax and Liu Kang <b>for</b> <b>sheer</b> brilliance," [...] being a [...] "somewhat misleading character" [...] whose moves need to be [...] "learnt the right way to put them all together to be devastating." [...] Hyper verdicted that in the hands of the skilled players, all three [...] "Mileena, Jax and Liu Kang are almost unstoppable." [...] In GamePro test, the [...] "queen of the hill" [...] Mileena was effective against all characters, and especially versus Jax (who shared tier 1 with her in their ranking), Reptile and Shang Tsung. GamePro testers opined that [...] "although Jax is the better overall characters against Tiers 2-4, Mileena's massive advantage over him makes her number one. Neither suffers disadvantages against anyone else. With her rapid sai-throwing ability, teleport attacks, and deadly combos, this beautiful assassin lands atop our rankings." [...] In Amiga Format test matches, both Mileena and Kitana were always [...] "so much faster" [...] that [...] "poor Jax...ended getting his head kicked in every time." ...|$|E
