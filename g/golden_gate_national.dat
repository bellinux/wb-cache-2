25|$|P. i. missionensis is federally {{endangered}} {{and found}} {{in only a}} few locations. Its habitat is restricted to the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically six areas, the Twin Peaks area in San Francisco County, Fort Baker, a former military installation managed by the National Park Service (NPS), in Marin County, the San Bruno Mountain area in San Mateo County, the Marin Headlands, in <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>National</b> Recreation Area (another NPS entity), Laurelwood Park and Sugarloaf Open Space in the city of San Mateo, and Skyline Ridge, also in San Mateo County. San Bruno Mountain hosts the largest population of Mission blues, a butterfly commonly found around elevations of 700feet. The coastal scrubland and grassland the Mission blue requires is found only in and around the Golden Gate of San Francisco. The butterfly depends solely on three species of perennial lupine for its reproduction, the varied lupine, silver lupine, and the summer lupine. The Mission blue requires the lupine to lay their eggs and nourish the larvae. Without these species, the it cannot reproduce and thus cannot survive. Thus, the Mission blue's habitat parallels that of the lupine species.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} different scenic zones in <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> Highlands <b>National</b> Park. A literature study of the different physical aspects that could assist in the identification of different scenic zones in the park was undertaken. From this, it was possible to identify four major scenic zones namely the zone below the Clarens sandstone formation, the Clarens sandstone formation itself, the area above the Clarens sandstone and the mountain crests. This study further placed a monetary value on the different scenic zones as identified by using different elements from the Travel-cost approach, the Hedonic Price Model and the Contingent model. This study indicates that the scenic beauty of <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> Highlands <b>National</b> Park is worth in the order of not less than R 1, 6 million monthly. An assessment was made of different existing visual objects within the park and it was measure against the monetary value of the specific scenic zone in which they are situated. The public's opinion was also obtained by means of a questionnaire and further personal interviews. A questionnaire was circulated during the period December 1999 to January 2000 to obtain the public's views. Although the valuing of a scenic view are still regarded as a grey area, this study provides further proof that scenic beauty does indeed have a monetary value and that certain objects are visually misplaced in <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> Highlands <b>National</b> Park. The public also indicated that some objects are actually viewed by them as a visual intrusion. Master...|$|R
