40|$|Cosmetic and {{personal}} care products including toothpaste, shampoo, creams, makeup, among others, are usually formulated with petroleum-based surfactants, although {{in the last years}} the consume trend for green products is inducing the replacement of surface-active agents in these formulations by natural surfactants, so-called biosurfactants. In addition to their surfactant capacity, many biosurfactants can act as good emulsifiers, which is an extra advantage in the preparation of green cosmetic products. In this work, a biosurfactant obtained from Lactobacillus paracasei was used as a stabilizing agent in oil-in-water emulsions containing essential oils and natural antioxidant extract. In the presence of biosurfactant, maximum percentages of emulsion volumes (EV =  100 %) were observed, with droplets sizes about 199  nm. These results were comparable with the ones obtained using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a synthetic well known surfactant with high emulsify capacity. Moreover, the biosurfactant and emulsions cytotoxicity was evaluated using a mouse fibroblast cell line. Solutions containing 5  g/L of biosurfactant presented cell proliferation values of 97 %, whereas 0. 5  g/L of SDS showed a strong inhibitory effect. Overall, the results herein gathered are very promising towards the development of new green cosmetic formulations.

40|$|Observations of {{streamwise}} and crossflow instabilities on swept circular cylinders over a {{range of}} inclinations are presented. By considering sweep angles through the full range between the two extremes studied in the literature, we relate the streamwise vorticity of the unswept case (Kestin & Wood, J. Fluid Mech. 44) to the more aggressive crossflow instability at high sweep angles (Poll, J. Fluid Mech. 150). Measurements made on the unswept cylinder confirm earlier predictions in the literature, providing a firm basis for referencing the new measurements of vortical behaviour on cylinders with general sweep angle. The study has implications for turbine blading. Financial support is acknowledged from the National Research Council of Canada and the University of Leicester.

40|$|The {{choice of}} the theme of {{integration}} of Albanian immigrants was born during my <b>Erasmus</b> <b>internship</b> held in Corinth, Greece, between September and December 2016. In this country the Albanian immigrant population represented in the ' 90 s {{the first group of}} immigrants and, in December 2014, the 30 % of the total immigrant regular population. Most of Albanian arrived in Greece as irregular migrants in term of status and because of this were forced to find employment in the informal sector. Through the collection of documentation and qualitative interviews during the internship I was able to address how informal work can be a vehicle of integration. The integration in this underground sector is determined by the creation of networks, by learning the host country's language and culture, as well as by obtaining of a minimum wage to fulfill the minimum needs. The combination of these factors likely counteracts the integration policies that in Greece are often weak or outdated. Through the integration and the relationship with each others, stereotypes will fade away and the acceptance of the others will be more favorable...|$|E
40|$|The KHBO Aerospace Engineering Department {{offers many}} types of {{aerospace}} related trainings ranging from a professional bachelor in aerospace technology (flight technicians) or a professional bachelor in ATPL (pilots) to a Master in aerospace engineering. A cooperation exists between the aerospace department of Catholic University of Leuven (KULeuven) allowing their students to work on KHBO assignments. This paper reports on the work that has been performed {{in the context of}} a 2 -year research program concerning the development of a new UAS platform at the Aerospace Engineering Department of the KHBO in Belgium. It is developed together with both educational, research and industrial partners. The UAS platform is aimed at performing scientific missions along the Belgian coast line above the North Sea. The main performance requirement of the 65 kg UAS is a range of 160 km with a payload of 5 kg. A propulsion system of two electrical brushless DC motors has been selected in order to minimize the environmental impact during operation by avoiding gas emissions and reducing noise emissions. Designing an entire UAS platform from scratch in two years is a short term and much parallel research was performed both by lecturers, researchers as well as students. Students from all levels both within KHBO and KULeuven were employed to develop many aspects required for the UAS. The first step was to set the main requirements, both essential and optional. Afterwards, a decision had to be made on the UAS configuration. An initial three configurations were selected for which a conceptual design in CATIA was made together with an aerodynamic analysis by Master students during lab sessions. A lifting canard configuration was found to be most energy efficient and was selected for further development. During the detailed design phase the design of the aircraft was refined, the systems developed and the legislation investigated. The main design of the aircraft was mainly done by the project leader based on input of calculations, lecturers, specialists and evaluated student data. Several research and development aspects were assigned to students according to their field: the catapult design, the design and manufacturing of a motor test stand, the integration of the UAS into civil airspace, the electrical and thermal analysis, the aerodynamic CFD analysis, the landing gear design, the electrical system design and manufacturing, … Different types of supervision were used depending on the workload, student availability and task difficulty. So were normal lessons used, professional bachelor/master theses, internal/external <b>internships,</b> <b>Erasmus</b> projects and integrated practicums. Parallel to the main UAS platform development project, multiple UAS related projects were performed. Two professional bachelor students calculated, designed and built a 12 kg UAS used by the federal police for fire detection. As a Master thesis, two Master students first reverse engineered, then doubled the payload of an existing UAS. status: accepte...|$|R

During the 1950 s and 1970 s the osprey (Pandion haliaetus) experienced a dramatic population crash and remains of conservation concern in several parts of the world. We isolated 37 microsatellite loci and assessed these in ospreys sampled in the UK and Norway (using mouth swabs/feathers). From 26 loci variable in four ospreys, we selected 13, combined these into two multiplex-PCR sets and included a sex-typing marker. Additional markers confirmed sexes. In 17 ospreys, feather-sampled in central Norway, we found 3 - 10 alleles per locus. The 13 loci are autosomal (heterozygotes were present in both sexes) and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 94. The combined probability of identity for the 13 loci was 8. 0  ×  10 (- 12). These microsatellite loci will be useful for genetic monitoring, parentage analysis and population genetic studies of the osprey.

40|$|In Valencia Region (Spain), {{some wild}} and {{cultivated}} sages {{are used for}} medicinal purposes. Among them, Salvia officinalis subsp. lavandulifolia (SL) is widely employed and known for production of Spanish sage oil and herbal products. Nevertheless, it shares the market with S. blancoana subsp. mariolensis (SB) and, to a lesser extent, with their hybrid S. x hegelmaieri (SH). The knowledge on these two species is far low and confusion between them is possible. The aim of the present paper {{is to improve the}} ethnopharmacological, morphological and chemical knowledge of these sages, and to contribute to setting up quality specifications for improving identification and distinction from other Salvia species, such as, S. officinalis subsp. officinalis, S. x auriculata and S. microphylla var. microphylla. Samples were collected in Valencia Region and surrounding mountain areas during the ethnopharmacological field work. Twenty-nine medicinal uses were reported for SL, 13 of them being also recorded for SB. Of particular interest is a homemade liquor, used as digestive and known as “salvieta,” which is mainly prepared with SB. The macro- and microscopic characters are insufficient for identification of cut, crushed or powdered material. The study of the essential oil and a HPTLC (High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography) fingerprint of their extracts could help to distinguish SB from the other sages. The essential oil from dried aerial parts of SB (content: 1. 8 – 4. 5 %) was characterized by GC-FID (Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector) and GC-MS (Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry) showing a composition close to that currently accepted for Spanish sage essential oil in the European Pharmacopoeia, ISO (International Standard Organization) and UNE (Una Norma Española) standards, with 1, 8 -cineole (13. 7 – 45. 7 %) and camphor (12. 1 – 28. 6 %) as major constituents. HPTLC methods, based on the analysis of hydroalcoholic and dichloromethane extracts, allowed to distinguish SB from other Salvia taxa currently found in Valencia region, except from its hybrid SH. This interdisciplinary study, that combines popular knowledge with botany and chemistry, allows to identify the raw herbal material from SB and to distinguish it from other Salvia species, ensuring a proper commercialization as herbal teas or for the preparation of spirits.
