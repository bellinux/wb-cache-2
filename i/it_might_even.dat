25|$|Still, {{long-term}} solitude {{is often}} seen as undesirable, causing loneliness or reclusion resulting from inability to establish relationships. Furthermore, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> lead to clinical depression. However, for some people, solitude is not depressing. Still others (e.g. monks) regard long-term solitude {{as a means of}} spiritual enlightenment. Indeed, marooned people have been left in solitude for years without any report of psychological symptoms afterwards.|$|E

Noten participated with a street vending machine that sold red rings {{with a wide variety}} of designs for only €2.50. The rings were intended to be bought for the neighbourhood prostitutes by their clients. Noten called the project Be nice to a girl, buy her a ring and hoped it would improve the mutual respect between prostitutes and clients, and that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> introduce a more romantic atmosphere in the red light district. Afterwards he offered the red rings, cased and numbered in a limited edition of 250 pieces, as true art objects for €310.00 each.|$|E

500|$|As [...] "the {{republicans}} themselves recognized, {{the party}} {{did not have}} size, organization and popular support enough to overthrow the monarchy." [...] Republicanism [...] "did not manage, at any moment of its development, to spur the national soul. It never had the stature to provoke a strong enthusiasm or enlist all forces that were divorcing from the throne." [...] Even with radical propaganda and little interference from the authorities, the Republican Party in existence {{from the beginning of}} the 1870s was a small one. It praised republics such as the United States, France and Argentina, while conveniently ignoring progressive monarchies such as the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries. In 1889, its members were [...] "spokesmen in public squares and writers of periodicals. They were far from having the power to develop a propaganda that could shake the foundations of the throne." [...] In the [...] "political process of the second empire , the republican party had such a dull and secondary role that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> have been forgotten; it was unable to influence rationales advocating the regime's dissolution." [...] It was the crisis between the military and the Government, [...] "of very diverse origin and evolution" [...] from the republicanism, which was to prove the main factor in the fall of the monarchy.|$|E
500|$|Hybrid Theory {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters {{commented that the}} band was a [...] "far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late", and claimed that [...] "they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds." [...] Q magazine gave Hybrid Theory {{four out of five}} stars. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote that “the men don't know what the angry boys understand”, and gave the album a [...] "two-star honorable mention rating", citing [...] "Papercut" [...] and [...] "Points of Authority" [...] as highlights of the album. Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone gave the album {{two and a half stars}} and commented that Hybrid Theory had [...] "as much potency as albums by Limp Bizkit or Korn" [...] and called it an album that [...] "reflects the frustration of life". Considering that the album came out in the year 2000, and that it earned a Diamond certification, it may have exerted a similar rock influence on the up and coming Millennial generation that Nirvana's Nevermind (1991) did for Generation X. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> be possible to say, because of the popularity of this album, that Linkin Park could be thought of as the [...] "flagship" [...] rock band for the Millennials. This generation tends to gravitate more towards rap and pop music; and having these elements mixed into Linkin Park's style might have played a role in the album's success.|$|E
500|$|After {{a series}} of co-starring film roles, Lopez {{received}} her big break came in 1996, when she was cast to play the title role in Selena, a biopic of the late American singer-songwriter Selena. In the film, Selena's real voice {{is used for the}} musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip syncing. When asked in an interview if Selena inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: [...] "I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like..." [...] After filming Selena, Lopez was [...] "really feeling [...] Latin roots" [...] and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled [...] "Vivir Sin Ti", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6. During production of the album, Lopez was {{aware of the fact that}} she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: [...] "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> damage her career." ...|$|E

Strict rules governed the {{division}} of the prizes captured at sea. First came Algiers as the state representative of Allah; next came the port authorities, the custom brokers, and those who kept the sanctuaries; then came that portion due the ship owners, and the captain and crew.

2500|$|Another {{reason for}} the trend back to open kitchens (and a {{foundation}} of the [...] "kitchen object" [...] philosophy) is changes in how food is prepared. Whereas prior to the 1950s most cooking started out with raw ingredients and a meal had to be prepared from scratch, the advent of frozen meals and pre-prepared convenience food changed the cooking habits of many people, who consequently used the kitchen less and less. For others, who followed the [...] "cooking as a social act" [...] trend, the open kitchen had the advantage {{that they could be}} with their guests while cooking, and for the [...] "creative cooks" [...] <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> become a stage for their cooking performance.|$|E
2500|$|Ancient sources {{describe}} Callimachus's poem Ibis [...] {{which does}} not survive [...] as a polemic {{and some of them}} identified Apollonius as the target. These references conjure up images of a sensational literary feud between the two figures. Such a feud is consistent with what we know of Callimachus's taste for scholarly controversy and <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> explain why Apollonius departed for Rhodes. Thus there arises [...] "a romantic vision of scholarly warfare in which Apollonius was finally driven out of Alexandria by a triumphant Callimachus". However, both of the Lives of Apollonius stress the friendship between the poets, the second Life even saying they were buried together; moreover Callimachus's poem Ibis is known to have been deliberately obscure and some modern scholars believe the target was never meant to be identified. There is still not a consensus about the feud, but most scholars of Hellenistic literature now believe it has been enormously sensationalised, if it happened at all.|$|E

2500|$|In 1802, {{while serving}} as President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson wrote to artist Charles Willson Peale that his concept of the new {{university}} would be [...] "on the most extensive and liberal scale that our circumstances would call for and our faculties meet," [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> attract talented students from [...] "other states to come, and drink of the cup of knowledge". Virginia was already home to the College of William and Mary, but Jefferson lost all confidence in his alma mater, partly because of its religious nature – it required all its students to recite a catechism – and its stifling of the sciences. Jefferson had flourished under William and Mary professors William Small and George Wythe decades earlier, but the college was {{in a period of}} great decline and his concern became so dire by 1800 that he expressed to British chemist Joseph Priestley, [...] "we have in that State, a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it." [...] These words would ring true some seventy years later when William and Mary fell bankrupt after the Civil War and the Williamsburg college was shuttered completely in 1881, later being revived only in a limited capacity as a small college for teachers until the twentieth century.|$|E
2500|$|Lopez's debut single, [...] "If You Had My Love", was {{released}} in May 1999, {{as she began to}} ready her first album. Lopez became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with a debut single since Britney Spears did so with her single [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] four months prior. During production of her debut album, On the 6, Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract on the basis of her looks and an already established name in the entertainment industry, and she wanted to prove she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: [...] "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> damage her career." [...] "Waiting for Tonight", the third single from On the 6, is widely considered to be Lopez's best song. Lopez's musical success came as a surprise to critics; its launch made the [...] "popular actor even more popular". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by [...] "this woman who seemed to have so many different talents". By the end of 1999, Lopez successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star. She joined a select few in achieving this feat, becoming the first since Vanessa Williams (1992) and Martika (1989).|$|E
