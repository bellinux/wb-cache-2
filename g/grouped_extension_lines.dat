40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} iterated <b>group</b> <b>extensions,</b> which, roughly speaking, is what one obtains by forming a <b>group</b> <b>extension</b> of a <b>group</b> <b>extension.</b> We interpret iterated extensions in terms of group cohomology, {{in the same way}} as Eilenberg-MacLane did for usual <b>group</b> <b>extensions.</b> From the E_ 2 -spectral sequence of a <b>group</b> <b>extension,</b> there is a 6 -term long exact sequence in which various cohomology groups of degree 1 or 2 appear. We give an explicit identification of each cohomology group and each morphism appearing in this long exact sequence in terms of iterated extensions and associated notions. These identifications enable us to uncover natural relations between (iterated) <b>extensions,</b> their automorphism <b>groups,</b> and their outer actions. Comment: 41 pages, LaTe...|$|R

40|$|Objective – To {{document}} {{the reliability of}} the newly marketed veterinary non-invasive oscillometric blood pressure monitor: the PetTrust Handheld Blood Pressure Monitor. Study design – A prospective clinical study. Animals – Twenty-three client-owned dogs, anaesthetized for a variety of procedures. Methods – Invasive and non-invasive blood pressure measurement in the dorsal pedal artery. All measurements have been executed with and without the <b>extension</b> <b>line</b> of the PetTrust cuff. Various anesthetic protocols were used. Statistical analysis is performed by Bland-Altman difference plots. Results – The PetTrust monitor is validated according to the ACVIM recommendations, for both SAP, DAP and MAP, with and without the use of the <b>extension</b> <b>line.</b> The PetTrust monitor overestimated SAP and underestimated DAP without the <b>extension</b> <b>line.</b> When using the <b>extension</b> <b>line,</b> both SAP and DAP were overestimated.

40|$|AbstractThe {{relation}} between cross-sectional algebras of homogeneous Banach-∗-algebraic bundles {{in the sense}} of Fell [5] and generalized L 1 -algebras, as defined in slightly different ways by Leptin [7], Busby and Smith [2], and others, has been studied by Busby in [3]. We give an extension of his result, using a different method for obtaining topological <b>group</b> <b>extensions.</b> Instead of first constructing the abstract <b>group</b> <b>extension</b> from the given factor system and then topologizing it, we work in a natural topological setting and define a topological group which {{turns out to be the}} <b>group</b> <b>extension</b> belonging to the given factor system. As a consequence we obtain (without separability assumptions) that for any measurable factor system of a locally compact group with values in some other locally compact group the corresponding abstract <b>group</b> <b>extension</b> can be topologized to give a topological (and hence locally compact) <b>group</b> <b>extension...</b>|$|R
