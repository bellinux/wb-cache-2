5|$|Ratanakiri's tourist {{industry}} has rapidly expanded in recent years: {{visits to the}} province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's tourism <b>development</b> <b>strategy</b> focuses on encouraging ecotourism. Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few initiatives have sought to address these issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{plantation}} {{development in}} Sabah, Malaysia, originates with the British North Borneo Chartered Company’s (BNBCC’s) rule. Although the cash crop may change, Sabah will continue prospering from its large-scale plantations. Therefore, clarifying its early <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> is significant. Despite preceding studies, {{in the early}} years of <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> by BNBCC are still unclear, especially from the shareholders’ viewpoint. BNBCC was regulated by the Royal Charter. However, few know that it was also regulated by the Deed of Settlement of 1882, and its subsequent amendments. According to this Deed of Settlement, the decision maker for <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> was the Court of Directors. Shareholders could elect, reelect and remove directors and could propose <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> at general meetings. Shareholders had the greatest influence on the Court of Directors from the depression of the 1890 s to 1910. At general meetings, for instance, shareholders proposed improvement of infrastructure -telegraph and railway systems; they suggested the cultivation of rubber as a new cash crop. This presentation aims to identify (1) the <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> from 1882 to 1910 and (2) the reason why the <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> changed so dramatically during the 1890 s’ depression. The main sources for this presentation are published books, preceding research papers, and BNBCC documents held in the archives of the Government of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu. In brief, this presentation shows why the Court of Directors and shareholders chose active <b>development</b> <b>strategies</b> rather than the sale of BNBCC during the 1890 s’ depression...|$|R

5|$|Madagascar {{belongs to}} the group of least {{developed}} countries, according to the United Nations. Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. The majority of the population adheres to traditional beliefs, Christianity, or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's <b>development</b> <b>strategy.</b> Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. , the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low {{for the majority of the}} Malagasy population.|$|E
5|$|After {{coming to}} power, Rajoelina's HAT pursued action against Ravalomanana and his {{business}} interests. On 2 June 2009, Ravalomanana was fined 70 million US dollars (42 million British pounds) and sentenced to four {{years in prison for}} alleged abuse of office which, according to HAT Justice Minister Christine Razanamahasoa, included the December 2008 purchase of a second presidential jet ("Air Force II") worth $60 million. Rajoelina sold the controversial jet in 2012 and pursued legal action against Ravalomanana's company Tiko to reclaim 35 million US dollars in back taxes. Additionally, on 28 August 2010, the HAT sentenced Ravalomanana in absentia to hard labor for life and issued an arrest warrant {{for his role in the}} protests and ensuing deaths. Rajoelina likewise sought to distinguish himself from his predecessor in policy choices. One of Rajoelina's first measures as president was to cancel Ravalomanana's unpopular deal with Daewoo Logistics. He also rejected Ravalomanana's medium term <b>development</b> <b>strategy,</b> termed the Madagascar Action Plan, and abandoned education reforms initiated by his predecessor that adopted Malagasy and English as languages of instruction, instead returning to the traditional use of French.|$|E
