5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the civil}} {{conflict}} came a small lull in fighting between the expanding Ottomans and Byzantines. In 1361 Didymoteichon fell to the Turks. Orhan's successor, Murad I was more concerned with his Anatolian positions.

5|$|Since <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You is {{the debut}} studio album by Australian {{electronic}} music group the Avalanches, released on 27 November 2000. It was issued on Modular Recordings and {{produced by the}} Avalanches' members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann (under the pseudonym Bobbydazzler). The album uses sampling extensively, containing an estimated 3,500 samples from various genres of music. The album was created in two separate near-identical studios by Chater and Seltmann, exchanging audio mixes of records they sampled.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You is {{the debut}} studio album by the Avalanches. They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used the}} working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After sampling and arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand on whatever they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E
5|$|To promote Since <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You the Avalanches {{organised}} {{their first}} Australian head-lining tour in October 2000 planning {{to head to}} all the capital cities. All dates on the tour were sold out. In their Brisbane show, Seltmann broke his leg in an on-stage collision with bass guitarist and singer, Tony Di Blasi. In January–February 2001, the Avalanches toured with the Big Day Out festival in Australia, visiting four capital cities. While on tour in Europe, Seltmann broke his other leg, thereafter {{the rest of the}} tour's shows were DJ sets. The British dance music magazine Muzik awarded the Avalanches as best live act.|$|E

Dabiša, a relative (possibly illegitimate half-brother) exiled by Tvrtko I {{for his part in}} the 1366 rebellion and reconciled with him in 1390, was elected king instead. Ostoja, the next king, may have been Tvrtko I's illegitimate son (or more likely another illegitimate half-brother).|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, <b>I</b> <b>left</b> Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E
5|$|Wildflower is {{the second}} studio album {{recorded}} by Australian electronic music group the Avalanches. It was first released for streaming on Apple Music on 1 July 2016, and saw a full release a week later on 8 July. It was issued through Modular Recordings, Astralwerks, XL Recordings, and EMI. Production of the album was led by Robbie Chater with assistance from Tony Di Blasi and lasted nearly 16 years, commencing shortly {{after the release of}} their debut album, Since <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You, in November 2000 and not concluding until March 2016. The album features multiple guest collaborators providing vocals and live instrumentation across its 21 tracks. Wildflower also features extensive sampling, especially from 1960s psychedelic music, and relates to the era through themes of counterculture and anti-establishment. Chater described the album's structure as a road trip from a hyperrealistic urban environment to somewhere remote and far away while on LSD.|$|E
