Moreover, we derive general relations between the unlevered and the levered beta <b>factor.</b> <b>For</b> the <b>tax</b> shield valuation and the APV approach, we also show that the two simplified financing policies currently proposed by the valuation literature, the Modigliani/Miller and the Miles/Ezzell case {{can be regarded as}} polar cases of the discontinuous financing policy.

40|$|The paper aims {{to provide}} a {{panoramic}} view of the dynamics of tax evasion in Romania, reflected in terms of fiscal inspection activities. The author used the official data published by the institutions with attributions on the line of identification and fighting against tax evasion (National Agency of Fiscal Administration and Financial Guard) with the view to reflect the real situation concerning the number of inspections, quantify and sanction <b>tax</b> evasion <b>for</b> 2003 - 2008 periods. Although the number of fiscal inspections and the number of tax payers who have violated the rules of fiscal discipline decreased compared with 2003, the frequency of tax evasion remained. At the same time, based on the data referring to the level and dynamics of the tax dodger phenomenon appreciations have been made regarding the fiscal discipline of the Romanian tax payer and to the attitude of the qualified institutions in discovering and sanctioning the fraudulent tax evasion. In this respect, the author observed that the level of willingness of tax legislation in relation to the Romanian tax payer has not changed considerably. The level of identified tax evasion reported to real GDP increased slightly. This situation can be interpreted as a success of institutions in charge of identification and fighting of tax evasion, a result of the increase of fiscal inspection number and detection probability, but also a result of GDP growth at a rate lower than the identified tax evasion. The author has also tried to find a causality relation between the option <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> evasion and corruption. The author found that a corrupt environment facilitates the decision to evade depending on detection probability, penalty system and bribery level as discouraging <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> evasion. The level of identified tax evasion is smaller than the real level of entire tax evasion, an important part being impossible to determine because of corruption. tax evasion, fiscal fraud, fiscal inspections, fiscal discipline,voluntary fiscal compliance, underground economy, corruption...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze religiosity as a factor that {{potentially}} affects tax compliance when the law is not properly execute. This paper focuses on tax morale and tax compliance and intends to outline alternative theories and empirical findings. It is relevant to analyze tax morale and tax compliance. It has been noted that compliance cannot be explained entirely by the level of enforcement [2]. Indonesia set the levels of audit and penalty so low that most individuals would evade taxes if they were rational because it is unlikely that cheaters will be caught and penalized. Thus, researchers have started to analyze a variety of factors other than detection and punishment. Tax morale might be an important influencing <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> compliance and is therefore central to this new research focus. Researchers analyze religiosity as a potential factor that affects tax morale, which we define as the intrinsic motivation to pay taxes. Religiosity has been analyzed using different measurements, such as temples attendance, religious education, being an active member of a temple or a religious organization, perceived religiosity, religious guidance and trust in the temples, controlling for the specific religion of a person to check also whether some religions are more tax compliant than others. In our analysis we use the surveys from workers individually in Bandung. Furthermore, we investigate whether trustworthiness, such as lying (“claiming government benefits to which someone is not entitled”), cheating (“avoiding a fare on public transport”) and buying a stolen product (“buying something you knew was stolen”) also explain tax morale. The empirical findings indicate that religiosity has a significant positive effect on tax morale, even if other determinants, such as corruption, trustworthiness, demographic and economic <b>factors</b> are controlled <b>for...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} low tax compliance in Indonesia, focusing {{on the role of}} public officials as taxpayers. Through the analysis of literature and policy documents, we identified four main factors affecting tax compliance: modernized tax administration system (MTAS), tax sanctions, tax services, and tax morale. Subsequently, we focused on the role of public officials. In the scope of Indonesia’s laws and social system, public officials are viewed as representatives of government and as role models (“father-figures”) and change agents. We found that to date no research has been done on tax compliance by public officials specifically. In the first step, we conducted a survey study among 400 respondents working in the public sectors (as government and state enterprise employees). We found that public officials perceive their tax compliance as good, even though they behave far from perfect. The perception of public officials on MTAS and tax services was sufficient, but on tax sanctions and tax morale was bad. In terms of correlations, we found rather low (but significant) correlations with <b>tax</b> compliance <b>for</b> MTAS, <b>tax</b> services, and tax morale, but no significant <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> sanctions. We found similar results when we looked specifically at government and state enterprise employees. In its second (follow-up) step, the empirical research focused on two variables: tax sanctions and tax morale. It consisted of an on-line survey, in-depth face-to-face interviews, and a simulation game. We found that this model worked quite well, in terms of the model as a measurement model. However, as a structural (explanatory) model the captured effect was rather low, and further improvements and extensions are needed. The follow-up research also showed that rewards are potentially more effective in increasing tax compliance than punishment. We recommend the proper use of tax revenues, providing regular and transparent information, and the strong commitment of government in their implementations. For further research, we suggest exploring potential additional underlying <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> compliance, clarifying differences in tax compliance between government employees, state enterprise employees and private wolkers, and investigating potential difference between the use of rewards and punishment in raising tax compliance...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 324 - 333. The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to analyse the definitional rules of fiscal jurisdiction {{as well as the}} tax consequences resulting from the application of these rules, as implemented in the national tax law of the chosen jurisdictions. In essence, there are two main rules, which give content to the chosen theory of fiscal jurisdiction, mainly source and residence. It is trite that globalisation of the world's economies poses certain problems <b>for</b> international <b>tax</b> policy. Companies and individuals are becoming more mobile and therefore are able to exploit tax differences between states. In consideration of the natural concern of governments that they should get an acceptable share of the profits generated by international businesses, this research study analyses the bases through which a country could claim the right to tax. The plasticity of these two key concepts (source and residence) may well subvert a country's ultimate tax objective because of the potential for exploitation of ambiguity in the search for effective avoidance. The residence tax system and its implications have been analysed mainly from the South African perspective, and where necessary, the analysis has sought reference in other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and the United States. The source principle of taxation and its effects have also been studied from the South African context, with a comparative approach from Hong Kong. It has been found that the countries considered in this research have, in various ways, adopted different combinations of subjective <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> liability in their domestic tax laws. At the same time, the relentless search of additional tax revenue, has led countries to implement in their tax laws, stringent anti-avoidance measures designed to prevent the deferral of <b>tax,</b> <b>for</b> instance on foreign source income. Factors such as the increasing complexity of modem business and the greater sophistication of tax planning techniques have contributed to this state of affairs. Thus, this dissertation highlights that competition between governments, in the face of international economic integrity, may lead countries to adopt tax rules, which though they follow the usual international standards, are nevertheless very complex in application and administration. This can maintain the problem of international double taxation and lead to excessive or unpredictable compliance burdens. It is shown how countries in the exercise of their fiscal jurisdiction can move towards harmonisation of rules and common interpretation of the tax base in the application of their national tax legislation...|$|R

Further, in our model the seasonal component of the series of taxes is treated endogenously.

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of taxation {{as a major}} public finance to developed and developing countries is non-debatable. The issue of smuggling activities related to the indirect taxation had caused a great lost to the government not only in term of monetary aspect, but also non-monetary aspects such as quotas, embargo and product quality. However, the study of a tax evasion and smuggling activities in the indirect taxation have received less attention among the researchers and legislators. Hence, the current study aims to examine factors affecting the tax evasion on excise duties for importation of vehicles that {{can be associated with}} smuggling activities in Malaysia. The study has indentified several potential determinants related to tax evasion on imported vehicles, such as the tax rate, penalty structure, the car's brand and size of the business of car importers. To achieve the objectives, this study used sample data from vehicles smuggling cases investigated by the tax authorities in Malaysia. The hypotheses were tested using both univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The statistical results provided evidence on the significant values of evaded excise duties, whereby the excise duties and penalty rates are the contributing <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> the <b>tax</b> evasion in vehicles smuggling activities. Hence, this study contributes towards the body of literature in the discussed area and also provides strategic information to the policymakers in reviewing the tax policy related to excise duties on imported vehicles in the future...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the increasing devolution of transportation planning and fiscal responsibilities to local governments, voter-approved ballot initiatives are becoming {{an important source of}} much-needed revenue for transit and road transportation projects. There is a need for policy makers to identify the influential factors of voter approval of such initiatives and to predict the probability of success of an intended initiative. To address this research need, the present study utilized econometric and statistical tools using disaggregate data gleaned from voter revealed and stated preference surveys in California. The study determined that public preferences for transportation investments and funding alternatives, with respect to local option sales taxes, are influenced by factors such as voter socio-economic characteristics, perceptions of local government planning and funding capabilities, preferences for specific transportation investment types, and perceptions of existing traffic and road conditions. The marginal effects of public perceptions of traffic congestion were found to be lower than the corresponding values <b>for</b> other <b>factors,</b> particularly accountability <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> revenue expenditure and likely voters’ political affiliation, race, and their awareness of the availability and adequacy of public funds.
