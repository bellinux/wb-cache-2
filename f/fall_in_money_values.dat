40|$|Specifying {{the labour}} theory {{of value in}} a way that distinguishes both {{productive}} from unproductive labour, and production workers from supervisory workers, this paper considers distributive shares in the US economy between 1964 and 2001. Trends in productive and unproductive labour are explored in full-time equivalents, hours and money. After 1979, there was a large shift of <b>money</b> <b>value</b> (not matched by a shift in either hours or employment) from the wages paid to productive labour to those paid to supervisory labour. Since the wage share <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>value</b> added of non-supervisory labour in unproductive sectors was approximately constant, the 1980 s and 1990 s also saw the profits share squeezed by the rising wage share of supervisory workers. Some implications of this are explored in the construction of a class rather than a factor approach to distributive shares. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
50|$|Wealth may be {{measured}} in nominal or real <b>values,</b> that is <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>value</b> as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes. The assets include those that are tangible (land and capital) and financial (money, bonds, etc.). Measurable wealth typically excludes intangible or nonmarketable assets such as human capital and social capital. In economics, 'wealth' corresponds to the accounting term 'net worth'. But analysis may adapt typical accounting conventions for economic purposes in social accounting (such as in national accounts). An example of the latter is generational accounting of social security systems to include the present value projected future outlays considered to be liabilities. Macroeconomic questions include whether the issuance of government bonds affects investment and consumption through the wealth effect.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{suppose a}} country's GDP in 1990 was $100 million and its GDP in 2000 was $300 million. Suppose also that {{inflation}} had halved {{the value of}} its currency over that period. To meaningfully compare its GDP in 2000 to its GDP in 1990, we could multiply the GDP in 2000 by one-half, to make it relative to 1990 as a base year. The result would be that the GDP in 2000 equals $300 million × one-half = $150 million, in 1990 monetary terms. We would see that the country's GDP had realistically increased 50 percent over that period, not 200 percent, as it might appear from the raw GDP data. The GDP adjusted for changes <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>value</b> <b>in</b> this way is called the real, or constant, GDP.|$|R

If equity and foreign exchange markets are introduced in structuralist theories of asset markets in developing countries, the key result that a <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> supply raises {{the rate of inflation}} now holds only under special conditions on partial derivatives. But there is a tendency for interest rates to rise and for fluctuations in asset prices. Fuller integration of asset markets moderates these fluctuations. Outcomes are stable in spite of the generalized complementarity distinguishing equity markets from loan markets. Expectations play a major role. Implications for policy are to link domestic interest rates to foreign, remove artificial barriers to market integration, and stimulate demand as well as supply. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple macroeconomic model <b>in</b> which a <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> wages has contractionary effects on output and employment. As {{it is well}} known this argument in itself is not novel: the contractionary effect of a rise in the mark-up is a standard result in Kaleckian models of imperfect competition.

This result depends on an original specification of the production side and the associated implications for pricing.

50|$|In modern credit-based economies, {{deflation}} may {{be caused}} by the central bank initiating higher interest rates (i.e., to 'control' inflation), thereby possibly popping an asset bubble. In a credit-based economy, a slow-down or <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> lending leads to less <b>money</b> <b>in</b> circulation, with a further sharp <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> supply as confidence reduces and velocity weakens, with a consequent sharp fall-off in demand for employment or goods. The <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> demand causes a <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> prices as a supply glut develops. This becomes a deflationary spiral when prices fall below the costs of financing production, or repaying debt levels incurred at the prior price level. Businesses, unable to make enough profit no matter how low they set prices, are then liquidated. Banks get assets which have <b>fallen</b> dramatically <b>in</b> value since their mortgage loan was made, and if they sell those assets, they further glut supply, which only exacerbates the situation. To slow or halt the deflationary spiral, banks will often withhold collecting on non-performing loans (as in Japan, and most recently America and Spain). This is often no more than a stop-gap measure, because they must then restrict credit, since they do not have money to lend, which further reduces demand, and so on.|$|R
60|$|If {{the fact}} be, that by {{allowing}} to foreigners a participation in our machinery, we {{enable them to}} produce any of our leading articles of export, at a lower money price than we can sell those articles, {{it is certain that}} unless we possess as great an advantage in the production of the machinery itself as we have in the production of other articles by means of machinery, the permitting of its exportation would alter to our disadvantage the division of the benefit of trade. Our exports being diminished, we should have to pay a balance <b>in</b> <b>money.</b> This would raise, in foreign countries, the price of everything which we import from thence: while our incomes, being reduced <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>value,</b> would render us less able to buy those articles even if they had not risen. The equilibrium of exports and imports would only be restored, when either some of the latter became so dear that we could produce them cheaper at home, or some articles not previously exported became exportable from the <b>fall</b> of prices. <b>In</b> the one case, we lose the benefit of importation altogether, and are obliged to produce at home, at a greater cost.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the two way link between wages and labour productivity. In one way {{increase}} in productivity facilitates increase in wage, on the other way increase in wage induces increase in productivity. Wehave taken the help of ‘Theory of marginal productivity distribution’ to support the hypothesis i. e. productivity determines wages. Simultaneously, the classical view and Keynesian view indicate that wages determine productivity. Though the classical approach gives stress on wage cut policy to improve productivity but Keynesapproach is different and that gives emphasis on {{that there is an}} inverse relationship between money wages and real wages. When money wages are reduced real wages rise. This is because a <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> wages will lead to a more than proportionate <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> prices.

Supporters of the Accord, however, pointed to the significant improvements in the social security system that occurred under the ALP governments, including the introduction of rental assistance for social security recipients, extensions in child-care funding, the creation of useful labour market schemes such as NewStart and Jobs, Education and Training, the introduction of Medicare, the indexation of family allowance payments, and the introduction of the Family Income Supplement for low-income working families.

30|$|We {{distinguish}} the supply network of material inputs, both intermediate goods and resources, from the value network, {{which consists of}} payments <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>values,</b> by measuring flows in both units. When considering all the flows in the economy, the two networks have the same nodes and the same structure of arcs joining the nodes: when starting from the resources, the flows represent quantities directed toward the consumer; in the other direction, each arc is quantified as a money payment instead. However, we are interested not in the network as a whole but in sub-networks that are specific to the question being addressed. Government officials, or others with property rights to particular resources in one region, may want to understand in which sectoral products those resources are embodied and in which regions the production and ultimate consumption take place. Alternatively, final users or other decision makers in a region may wish to know in whose hands consumers’ money outlays for particular final goods end up. Answers to these questions correspond to different sub-networks, and these sub-networks {{are the focus of}} this paper. We call attention in particular to rents earned on embodied scarce resources and the considerations that determine their magnitudes and destinations.|$|R
