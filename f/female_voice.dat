5|$|Although Ravel {{wrote for}} mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and {{mezzo-soprano}} voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a <b>female</b> <b>voice,</b> {{and he seems}} to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.|$|E
5|$|Both WWV and WWVH {{announce}} the Coordinated Universal Time each minute, and make other recorded announcements {{of general interest}} on an hourly schedule, including the GPS satellite constellation status and severe oceanic weather warnings.

5|$|This {{version of}} the song replaces the word 'nights' with 'lights', in the line 'There were nights of endless pleasure'. The ending of the single version is different, {{concluding}} with an additional 'We forgive and forget and it's all coming back to me now'. The album version, following those recorded by Pandora's Box and Celine Dion, ends with the <b>female</b> <b>voice</b> whispering 'And if we...', followed by four piano notes.|$|E
5|$|Paul Taylor’s {{review in}} The Independent hails American Idiot as “the Hair of its generation”. Yet, {{as noted by}} Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even lighter than the main men are”. Although intended to empower the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the <b>female</b> <b>voice</b> from this discourse. This disempowering of the female {{is evident in the}} fact that the female leads are denied identity, let alone agency. Just one of the three is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E
5|$|Both the soprano part, {{which covers}} two octaves and {{requires}} a high C, and the solo trumpet part, which at times trades melodic lines with the soprano {{on an equal}} basis, are extremely virtuosic. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr assumes that Bach had an unusually gifted singer, adding that a <b>female</b> <b>voice</b> was unlikely in conservative Leipzig. According to Joshua Rifkin Christoph Nichelmann is a possible candidate because Bach being aware of his capabilities accepted him willingly to the Thomasschule and Nichelmann matriculated into the school {{three weeks before the}} first performance. The trumpet part was probably written for Gottfried Reiche, Bach's principal trumpeter at the time. The scoring is unique in Bach's cantatas, but was frequently used by Italian composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti. Bach's son Friedemann Bach arranged the work by adding a second trumpet and timpani.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Madonna {{was trying}} to {{establish}} her career in the music industry. She was the drummer of a band called Breakfast Club, which was headed by the Gilroy brothers, Dan and Ed. After their lead female vocalist left, Madonna was given {{the role of the}} lead female singer. However, she wanted to be the only <b>female</b> <b>voice</b> of the band, and opposed against the introduction of another female vocalist, Angie Smith. This led to a dispute between Dan and her, which resulted in Madonna leaving the band. She then formed a new band called Madonna and The Sky, but that also faced a major problem within a few weeks when its principal drummer Mike Shenoy, who had a full-time job and a fiancé, decided to leave the band.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the Society of Leopold excavates {{the site}} of Vyšehrad Castle; they recover Christof's body {{and take it to}} London, where he is awoken by a <b>female</b> <b>voice.</b> He learns that the events at Vyšehrad and the {{resulting}} human uprising divided the vampires into two sects: the Camarilla who seek to hide from humanity and the Sabbat who seek to regain dominion over it. The Society's excavation also enables Vukodlak's followers to recover Vyšehrad. After escaping, Christof meets Pink, who agrees to help him. They learn that the Setite clan has been shipping Vyšehrad contraband to New York City and infiltrate a Setite brothel to gain information. They kill the Setite leader Lucretia and recruit Lily, an enslaved prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team {{decided to}} give all {{characters}} in the game voices as Iizuka believed that full dialogue helps add depth to both the story and gameplay. With Nights already designed as an androgynous character, the team wanted to leave impressions regarding gender up to the player, despite Nights having a <b>female</b> <b>voice</b> in the game. The team designed the Nights franchise to have a distinctly British style, in contrast to Sonic the Hedgehog, {{which was designed to}} be more American. Thus, Bellbridge—the game's main setting—closely resembles London, and all of the game's characters have English accents. The development team consisted of 26 members of Sonic Team in the United States, while all sound work and CGI was developed in Japan.|$|E
