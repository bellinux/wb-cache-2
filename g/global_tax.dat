25|$|In 1989, Edgar L. Feige {{proposed}} a synthesis and {{extension of the}} ideas of Keynes and Tobin by proposing a flat rate tax on all transactions. The total volume of all transactions undertaken in an economy represents the broadest possible tax base and therefore requires the lowest flat tax rate to raise any requisite amount of revenue. Since financial transactions in stocks, bonds, international currency transactions and derivatives comprise most of the automated payment transaction (APT) tax base, it is in essence the broadest of financial transaction taxes. Initially {{proposed a}}s a revenue neutral replacement for the entire Federal tax system of the United States, it could alternatively {{be considered as a}} <b>global</b> <b>tax</b> whose revenues could be used by national governments to reduce existing income, corporate and VAT tax rates as well as reducing existing sovereign debt burdens. If adopted by all of the developed nations, it would have the advantage of eliminating all incentives for substitution between financial assets and between financial centers since all transactions would universally be taxed at the identical flat tax rate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Tobin tax has {{experienced}} a chaotic existence. Ignored {{for a long time}} by economists, it became very popular {{at the end of the}} 1990 ?s, because of the spreading of financial crises and its global solidarity relevance. Nowadays the Tobin tax proposition seems to be quite forgotten. At the time <b>global</b> <b>taxes</b> are increasingly discussed, this article questions the Tobin tax relevance, on one hand in the monetary and financial system regulation debate and on the other hand in the <b>global</b> <b>taxes</b> debate.

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims to {{investigate}} the possible crowding-out of regular development aid by <b>global</b> <b>taxes.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper models cross-country interactions in aid giving using a simple Cournot-Nash framework. Findings – The paper argues that <b>global</b> <b>taxes</b> could {{lead to an increase}} in aid-cum-tax revenue if such taxes produce a globally net positive income effect. Whether this condition can be satisfied is very much an open empirical issue. An alternative to <b>global</b> <b>taxes</b> is cooperative aid-giving among donors, which this paper shows will always result in more global aid. Originality/value – The paper highlights the need for a shift of policy focus from designing <b>global</b> <b>taxes</b> to designing viable mechanisms for effective aid coordination, for which multilateral institutions could play a crucial role.
