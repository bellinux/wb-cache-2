Four IGS (International Global Service) stations {{were selected to}} perform precise point positioning (PPP) for the three different days.

The chosen days are within the solar maximum and the solar minimum periods which are the 294 th day of year 2001 (DOY 294, 2001, solar maximum), 82 th day of year 2014 (DOY 82, 2014, solar maximum) and the first day of year 2009 (DOY 1, 2009, solar minimum). Vertical Total Electron Content (TECV) was determined for the chosen IGS stations in these days. Approximately 5 TEC unit (TECU) changes for DOY 1, 2009 and 50 - 60 TECU changes for DOY 82, 2014 and DOY 294, 2001 were observed. 24 hours rinex observation files with 30 seconds sampling interval for each station and each day were processed with and without correcting the second-order ionosphere effect by GIPSY 6. 3. The second-order effect is obtained from {{the difference between the two}} processes. The differences of XYZ Cartesian coordinates were transformed to topocentric coordinates (north, east, up) in order to analyze the second-order effect on the positioning more conveniently. The results show that the north component is affected significantly larger than the east and up components from the second-order <b>ionospheric</b> <b>effect</b> for each processed day. Maximum values of the north component between the two processes were observed in ANKR station (1. 47 mm) for DOY 294, 2001.

The results of the difference between the two processes show that the impact of the second-order correction on positioning has a southward tendency for each station.

40|$|Abstract—The Medium-Earth-Orbit SAR (MEOSAR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{potential}} next-generation spaceborne SARs for its excellent performances. However, the MEOSAR may not be able to produce data useful for science applications due to <b>ionospheric</b> <b>effects.</b> So it is very necessary to study <b>ionospheric</b> <b>effects</b> for the development of MEOSAR. In this paper, we present <b>ionospheric</b> <b>effects</b> on azimuth imaging for MEOSAR. First, we established an analysis model for <b>ionospheric</b> <b>effects</b> on azimuth imaging of MEOSAR based on the system characteristics of MEOSAR and the temporal-variability of ionosphere.

According to the results of our analysis, we conclude that both the quadratic phase error and the cubic phase error neglected for Low-Earth-Orbit SAR (LEOSAR) will deteriorate the azimuth imaging for MEOSAR. Furthermore, <b>ionospheric</b> <b>effects</b> will become more and more serious with the increase of SAR altitude and the improvement of azimuth resolution designed. 1...|$|E

30|$|The {{development}} of the GPS kinematic technique has enabled real-time accurate positioning of a mobile platform to be performed. For such accurate GPS kinematic positioning, however, {{it is necessary to}} determine the integer number of carrier phase cycles, which is called “integer ambiguities”. Over short baselines, the double-difference (DD) technique can be applied to cancel out most of the correlated errors. Another option—and a common practice—is simply to disregard their effects. However, in the case of long-baseline kinematic positioning, the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>effect</b> become increasingly more decorrelated, and it may affect the ambiguity resolution process, or even make it impossible to compute (Vollath et al., 2000; Wielgosz et al., 2005). Therefore, reducing the differential <b>ionospheric</b> <b>effect</b> {{is one of the most}} important steps towards improving ambiguity resolution and to achieve accurate medium- and long-range kinematic positioning (Odijk, 2000; Vollath et al., 2000; Kashani et al., 2005; Wielgosz et al., 2005). In recent years, many approaches have been developed to enable high-accuracy GPS kinematic positioning over longer distances (Wübbena et al., 1996; Han, 1997; Raquet, 1998; Wanninger, 1999; Lachapelle et al., 2000; Odijk et al., 2000; Hernandez-Pajares et al., 2000; Cannon et al., 2001; Rizos, 2002; Hu et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2004; Wielgosz et al., 2004, 2005). All of these investigations involve the use of multi-reference stations. However, a network of GPS reference stations is not always available and its implementation is costly. In addition, in certain cases (e.g., marine long-baseline applications), interpolated corrections are not reliable because the rover receiver is usually outside the network coverage area. A new approach based on a single-reference-station mode has been published by Kim and Langley (2007) that nullifies the effect of the differential ionosphere in an ambiguity search process; this method provides a number of interesting results.|$|R
