40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, we {{experimentally}} investigated the roll stability recovery {{performance of a}} vehicle at various tilting angles. The vehicle was ultimately targeted to contain a velocity-field measurement system in underwater conditions, which should confirm stationary buoyancy during measurement. We employed two small <b>gear-rack</b> ax mountings on a weighted mass as the actuating system inside the bluff-body. Speed and movement were feedback controlled by the activating electronic motor system. The feedback algorithm used tilting action signals from an inclinometer sensor installed in the central region of the vessel shell. As a result, the bluff-body vessel effectively recovered self-stabilizing positions against the tilting action...|$|E
40|$|A new {{mechanism}} interconverting linear and {{rotary motion}} was investigated for energy transfers among its components. It employed a <b>gear-rack</b> set, a Hooke coupling and {{a specially designed}} bladder-valve system that regulated the motion. The purpose was to estimate individual component mechanical efficiencies as they existed in the prototype so that future reengineering of the mechanism could be properly targeted. Theoretical modelling of the mechanism was first done to obtain equations for efficiencies of the key components. Two-stage experimentation followed when running a solar tracker. The first stage produced data for inputting into the model to determine the efficiencies’ theoretical variation with the Hooke coupling shaft angle. The second one verified results of the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software solutions of the model. It {{was found that the}} energy transfer to focus on was that between the Hooke coupling and the output shaft because its efficiency was below 4 % </p...|$|E
40|$|Wear in {{engineering}} contacts, which occurs as an unavoidable phenomenon {{linked to the}} relative motion between the interacting bodies, may originate significant changes in contact features such as {{size and shape of}} the nominal contact area, contact pressure distribution and real contact area (RCA). While in some cases such alterations have little (or no) practical effects, there are situations in which the deviation of contact parameters from the original design is a primary source of malfunctioning and unexpected early failures; thus, the analysis of contact modifications may represent an indirect yet effective method for estimating wear effects. On the basis of these considerations, this study proposes the application of an ultrasonic-based technique to investigate the way wear alters contact conditions on three couples of relevant engineering interest (wheel-rail, tire-ground and <b>gear-rack</b> systems). Basically this method analyzes the reflection of high-frequency ultrasonic waves from the stressed interface, a parameter that is known to be related to contact conditions. The size and shape of the nominal contact area are obtained practically in real time by graphically processing the reflection data while further post-processing pro- cedures allow the assessment of contact pressure distribution. A series of experiments was performed on artificially altered surfaces (to simulate both random and controlled wear patterns) by scanning the contact interface with 10 and 15 MHz frequency focussed transducers and the results, mainly expressed in terms of ‘contact maps’ allow us to state that the ultrasonic method may represent a very effective tool in investigating wear-induced modifications of contact conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Gears {{perform their}} main task, namely load transmission, {{by means of}} very small contact areas {{originated}} by tooth interaction and thus, the analysis of phenomena occurring at the interface between mating teeth represents a critical issue in ensuring the optimal functioning of such devices. Nevertheless, while literature proposes {{a huge amount of}} numerical tooth contact analyses (TCA), a lack of experimental validation of such approaches is to be noted, since it is extremely difficult to inspect a contact interface which is, by its own nature, closed towards the outside world. One of the most promising techniques employed in investigating contact in metallic interfaces is based on the use of high frequency ultrasonic waves; their reflection from the interface (which is known to be related to contact conditions) can be graphically processed to build maps from which it is possible to assess geometrical features of the nominal contact area and, after a suitable calibration procedure, contact pressure distribution. This study proposes the application of the ultrasonic method to investigate the contact of a tooth belonging to a spur gear with a plane, thus reproducing the case of a <b>gear-rack</b> system. Experimental tests were carried out under different conditions, including regular contacts, misalignments and excessive waviness of the teeth; in all cases analyzed, this technique exhibited interesting capabilities in faithfully reproducing the contact features, thus allowing us to state that it may represent a useful tool in arriving at a deeper insight into contact problems in gears and, above all, in effectively validating numerical TCA and wear models...|$|E
