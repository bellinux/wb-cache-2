50|$|If the {{carbonyl}} is at {{the very}} beginning of the chain (carbon 1), the monosaccharide is said to be an aldose, otherwise it is a ketose. These names can be combined with the chain length prefix, as in aldohexose or <b>ketopentose.</b> Most ketoses found in nature have the carbonyl in position 2; when that is not the case, one uses a numeric prefix to indicate the carbonyl's position. Thus for example, aldohexose means H(C=O)(CHOH)5H, <b>ketopentose</b> means H(CHOH)(C=O)(CHOH)3H, and 3-ketopentose means H(CHOH)2(C=O)(CHOH)2H.|$|E
50|$|Xylulose is a <b>ketopentose,</b> a {{monosaccharide}} containing five carbon atoms, {{and including}} a ketone functional group. It has the chemical formula 5105. In nature, {{it occurs in}} both the L- and D-enantiomers.|$|E
5000|$|Ribulose is a <b>ketopentose</b> [...] - [...] a {{monosaccharide}} containing five carbon atoms, {{and including}} a ketone functional group. It has chemical formula 5105. Two enantiomers are possible, D-ribulose (D-erythro-pentulose) and L-ribulose (L-erythro-pentulose). D-Ribulose is the diastereomer of D-xylulose.|$|E
50|$|A pentose is a {{monosaccharide}} {{with five}} carbon atoms. Pentoses are organized into two groups. Aldopentoses have an aldehyde functional group at position 1. <b>Ketopentoses</b> have a ketone functional group in position 2 or 3.|$|R
5000|$|Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) is {{an organic}} {{substance}} that {{is involved in}} photosynthesis. It is a colourless anion, a double phosphate ester of the <b>ketopentose</b> (ketone-containing sugar with five carbon atoms) called ribulose. Salts of RuBP can be isolated, but its crucial biological function happens in solution. [...] To simplify the presentation, the image in the above table depicts the acid form of this anion.|$|E
40|$|Certain {{strains of}} Lactobacillus casei can grow {{at the expense}} of one or more pentitols. These {{microorganisms}} possess a pentitol phosphate pathway that appears to be analogous to the hexitol phosphate pathway found in many facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Pentitol is transported into the cell by a phospho enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system that converts it to pentitol phosphate, whereupon a specific dehydrogenase oxidizes the intermediate product to <b>ketopentose</b> phosphate. The <b>ketopentose</b> phosphate is subsequently converted to xylulose- 5 -P and enters one of the pathways of central metabolism...|$|E
40|$|D-Xylulose and L-xylulose were {{produced}} biologically by the oxidation of a corresponding pentitol. A Klebsiella pneumoniae mutant was constructed for the oxidation of D-arabitol to D-xylulose. This mutant constitutively synthesized the D-arabitol permease system and D-arabitol dehydrogenase {{but was unable}} to produce the D-xylulokinase of the D-arabitol pathway or the D-xylose isomerase and D-xylulokinase of the D-xylose pathway. An Erwinia uredovora mutant which constitutively synthesized a novel xylitol- 4 -dehydrogenase but could not synthesize L-xylulokinase was used for the oxidation of xylitol to L-xylulose. Washed cell suspensions of either mutant incubated with 0. 5 % pentitol would oxidize 60 to 65 % of the pentitol to the corresponding <b>ketopentose</b> in 18 h and excrete the <b>ketopentose</b> into the medium. Ketopentoses were rapidly purified from the remaining pentitol by hydroxyl affinity chromatography...|$|E
30|$|Substrates {{were chosen}} {{in order to}} cover {{molecules}} from 2 to 6 carbon atoms (C 2 – C 6) on the one hand, and aldehydes and ketones on the other hand: the dialdehyde glyoxal (C 2), the keto-aldehyde methylglyoxal (C 3), the trioses DHA and L-glyceraldehyde, the aldotetroses D-erythrose and D-threose, the aldopentoses L-arabinose and D-xylose, the <b>ketopentose</b> D-xylulose, and the aldohexose D-glucose.|$|E

Bacteriol. 89 : 954 – 959. 1965. —The polyol metabolism of intact {{cells and}} extracts of the wood-rotting mushroom Schizophyllum commune was investigated during the developmental cycle. Exogenous polyols stimulated the cellular respiration of germlings, but were without effect on that of ungerminated basidiospores. Requisite enzymes of polyol metabolism were demonstrated in extracts of spores and of subsequent stages of development. Oxidation of mannitol and sorbitol {{appeared to be}} coupled to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) reduction and was favored in alkaline medium. Ketohexose formation was shown during mannitol oxidation, and the NAD-dependent oxidation of xylitol yielded <b>ketopentose.</b> Xylitol oxidation with {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADP) as hydrogen acceptor led to pentose formation. Oxidation of reduced NAD was enhanced by fructose but not by sorbose. Reduction of aldohexose and pentose was dependent upon reduced NADP, and pentose reductase was maximal at pH 6. 8. The specific activity of mannitol dehydrogenase was highest in extracts of vegetative mycelium. Growth in either glucose or xylose media had no significant effect on enzymes of polyol metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Extracts of Mycobacterium smegmatis, {{which was}} adapted to growth in {{synthetic}} medium containing D-arabinose as sole carbon source, catalyzed the NADPH-mediated reduction of D-arabinose to D-arabitol. When arabinose-adapted bacteria {{were transferred to}} glycerol medium, resumption of growth {{was accompanied by a}} sharp drop in the specific activity of this enzyme. Moreover, extracts of cells grown in D-arabinose medium contained large amounts of an NAD+-linked pentitol dehydrogenase, as compared to bacteria multiplying in glycerol medium. The specific activity of mycobacterial extracts was ten-fold higher for D-arabitol than for its L-isomer, and eight-fold higher than for xylitol (it was more than forty-fold lower in the case of glycerol-grown cells). The product of the pentitol dehydrogenase reaction was identified as D-xylulose by three different procedures. On the basis of these data, it is suggested that utilization of exogenous D-arabinose in mycobacteria involves two dehydrogenases that catalyze the reactions D-arabinose NADPH [...] D-arabitol NAD+ [...] D-xylulose, by virtue of which an aldopentose is converted into a <b>ketopentose.</b> The alditol: NADP oxidoreductase was isolated from homogenates of D-arabinose-adapted mycobacteria, and purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The enzymatic activity was restricted to a single band which, under denaturing conditions, comigrated with albumin (approximately 46 kDa). It was insensitive to 2 -mercaptoethanol, EDTA and NaF, and was inactivated at 70 degrees C...|$|E

Physical and {{immunological}} {{properties of}} pentitol dehydrogenases and pentulokinases. J. Bacteriol. 89 : 129 – 135. 1965. —Four pentulokinases and three pentitol dehydrogenases were purified from Aerobacter aerogenes PRL-R 3, and {{the properties of}} the enzymes within each family were compared. d-Ribulokinase was purified from cells grown on ribitol, d-arabitol, and xylitol, and from a mutant constitutive for ribitol dehydrogenase; d-xylulokinase, from cells grown on d-xylose and xylitol; l-ribulokinase, from cells grown on l-arabinose; and l-xylulokinase, after growth on l-xylose. Similarly, ribitol dehydrogenase was purified after growth on ribitol, d-arabinose, and xylitol, and from the ribitol dehydrogenase-constitutive mutant. d-Arabitol dehydrogenase was obtained after growth on d-arabitol or d-xylose, and xylitol dehydrogenase was obtained after growth on xylitol. Except for l-xylulokinase, which also had a different S 20 value, the pentulokinases had identical pH optima, Km for the <b>ketopentose,</b> and sedimentation constants, and fractionated identically by a number of procedures. These kinases could be distinguished only by their substrate and immunological specificity. Ribitol dehydrogenase and d-arabitol dehydrogenase could be distinguished by several properties, but the properties of xylitol dehydrogenase were always similar to ribitol dehydrogenase. In all cases, individual kinases or dehydrogenases produced by different inducers had identical properties. These data constitute evidence against multiple forms of the same enzyme being produced by different inducers and against the dehydrogenase family containing essentially identical proteins differing only at the active site. For the kinases, three of the four appear to differ only at the active site...|$|E
