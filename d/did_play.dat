5|$|The {{experience}} reinforced Drake's {{decision to}} retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he <b>did</b> <b>play</b> around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Nash was {{appointed}} captain-coach of Casterton, in western Victoria, once again at a wage of £12 per week. He took Casterton {{to a grand}} final that season, losing by a point.

5|$|Rotherham United, {{who play}} in League One, <b>did</b> <b>play</b> their home {{games in the}} city between 2008 and 2012, having moved to play at Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium in 2008 {{following}} a dispute with their previous landlord at their traditional home ground of Millmoor, Rotherham. However, in July 2012, the club moved to the new 12,000 seat New York Stadium in Rotherham. There are also facilities for golf, climbing and bowling, {{as well as a}} newly inaugurated national ice-skating arena (IceSheffield).|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders' {{management}} proposed {{playing a}} 2005 regular season match in Melbourne when Jade Stadium was unavailable. Although {{five of the}} seven unions within the Crusaders region supported having the regular season game in Melbourne, the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) vetoed the proposal. In 2006, the Crusaders <b>did</b> <b>play</b> a pre-season match in Melbourne against the Western Force at Olympic Park Stadium. They did the same in the 2008 preseason as well, also against the Force.|$|E
5|$|A {{resurgence}} of both economy and rugby union {{followed in the}} 1930s and, in 1931, Wales won their first championship for nine years. That year, {{for the first time}} since the First World War, Wales retained the same side for two consecutive Tests when they faced England and Scotland. Then, in 1933, captained by Watcyn Thomas, Wales defeated England at Twickenham. In 1935, Wales beat the touring All Blacks by 13–12, with Haydn Tanner making his first appearance. Although the Five Nations Championship was suspended during the Second World War Wales <b>did</b> <b>play</b> a Red Cross charity match against England at Cardiff in 1940, which Wales lost 18–9.|$|E

5|$|After {{playing in}} the first two Tests against Pakistan during October, Buttler was dropped for the third Test, {{replaced}} as wicket-keeper by Jonny Bairstow, and was not selected for any of the Test matches during England's tour of South Africa, although he <b>did</b> <b>play</b> again in the one-day fixtures during the tour. Buttler again played for England in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 and was a regular fixture in the limited-overs squad throughout the year. He scored an unbeaten 90 runs against Pakistan as part of an England record score of 444/3, the fastest half-century by an Englishman.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{commitments}} {{during the}} war, {{the fourth of}} the brothers, Harold Lindsay Harvey was unable to pursue a cricket career. He played mainly Second XI cricket at Fitzroy, but <b>did</b> <b>play</b> in the First XI during the war. A fitter and turner, Harold Harvey enlisted on 19 April 1945 and was discharged on 20 January 1947 with the rank of sergeant. He served with the Second Australian Imperial Force in Bougainville in New Guinea and played 15 First XI matches for Fitzroy from 1942-43 to 1949-50, as a wicketkeeper-batsman, scoring 237 runs {{at an average of}} 14.81.|$|E
5|$|HMS Bridgewater (L01) was {{the lead}} ship of her class of sloops built for the Royal Navy in the 1920s. Completed in 1929, the ship was {{initially}} assigned to the China Station and {{was transferred to the}} Africa Station in 1935. During the Second World War, Bridgewater spent most of her time on convoy escort duties off the West African coast although she <b>did</b> <b>play</b> a minor role in the Battle of Dakar in 1940. She was replaced in that role {{before the end of the}} war by more modern ships and was relegated to training duties in the UK. The ship was reduced to reserve shortly after the end of the war and was sold for scrap in 1947.|$|E

5|$|In 1930 {{he played}} three Five Nations' matches, missing the England game, {{and did not}} score any tries. He <b>did</b> <b>play</b> all four matches in 1931, and scored his only tries of the Championship in the game against England. This was the fourth time he scored two tries in a match against England. In January 1932 Smith played for Scotland against South Africa, which was won 6–3 by South Africa. By 1932 France had been ejected from the Championship due to {{allegations}} of professionalism, and the four Home Nations returned to only playing one another for the International Championship. Smith played all three matches in 1932, but scored only once, against England.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{his first}} full season in the majors, Youkilis became a regular first baseman (with 127 games at first). Until that time, he was {{primarily}} a third baseman, though he <b>did</b> <b>play</b> nine games at first base with the Red Sox in 2005, and 56 games at first base in his minor league career. Also in 2006 {{he played in the}} outfield {{for the first time in}} his professional career, 18 games in left field. Despite his inexperience in the outfield, Youkilis did not commit an error while in the outfield; he did, however, commit eight errors while playing the infield.|$|E
5|$|Injuries {{would again}} limit Sakic's playing {{time in the}} 1997–98 season. While playing in his first Olympics with Team Canada, Sakic hurt his knee {{and was forced to}} miss 18 games with the Avalanche. In the 64 games he <b>did</b> <b>play</b> in, he still scored 63 points, enough to earn him his seventh All-Star appearance. He finally rebounded from his injury {{problems}} in the 1998–99 season, finishing fifth in the league in scoring with 41 goals and 96 points in only 73 games. He led the Avalanche all the way to within one game of the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Dallas Stars. After the season ended, Sakic was ranked number 94 on The Hockey News list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.|$|E

5|$|McEwan {{wanted to}} write a novel dealing with the social turmoil of the 1970s, and Sweet Tooth is to a large extent based on his own life. The story explores the {{relationship}} between artistic integrity and government propaganda, and addresses competing approaches to literature; the boundary between reality and fiction is tested throughout. The novel is dedicated to McEwan's late friend Christopher Hitchens. He is not referred to directly in the book, but he <b>did</b> <b>play</b> a part as the host of a real-life literary event fictionalised in the book, involving McEwan and Martin Amis, who does appear in the story. Critical reception was mixed; some reviewers found the novel moving and poignant, while others saw it as weaker than much of McEwan's previous work.|$|E
5|$|Riegels <b>did</b> <b>play,</b> and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's {{appearances}} at Leeds were at first sporadic, although he <b>did</b> <b>play</b> in a UEFA Champions League match against Barcelona, which finished 1–1. He was Leeds' number two goalkeeper behind Nigel Martyn, making five league appearances in his debut season and {{none in the}} following season. He made 16 appearances in the 2000–01 season, following Martyn sustaining an injury, but did not play a league match in the following season. Terry Venables dropped Martyn after he requested a break from pre-season training after the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Robinson became Leeds' number one goalkeeper as a result, with Robinson playing in all 38 matches of the 2002–03 season. Martyn left for Everton {{at the start of}} the following season, with young goalkeepers Danny Milosevic and Scott Carson taking over as backups for Robinson.|$|E

The 3D version was released on Blu-ray instead, but it <b>did</b> <b>play</b> a limited engagement at the El Capitan Theatre from September to October 2013. On September 20, 2013, The Little Mermaid began playing in select theaters where audiences could bring iPads and use an app called Second Screen Live. The film was also screened out of competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Historically this {{is nothing}} new, as the tense {{relations}} between Armenia and Azerbaijan because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have been mirrored in chess over the years, resulting {{in the absence of}} players from one of the two countries at tournaments hosted in the other country and even relocation of chess events. For example, the candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship 2012 was ultimately moved (completely) from Baku to Kazan, with consideration given that one underlying reason was because Armenia's Levon Aronian was inhospitable toward playing in Azerbaijan. More recently, Azerbaijan chose not to play in the 2015 World Team Chess Championship in Tsaghkadzor, and Azerbaijani players did not participate in the European Individual Chess Championship 2014 in Yerevan. Nevertheless, Armenian players, including Levon Aronian, <b>did</b> <b>play</b> at the 2015 Chess World Cup in Baku, giving some hope the team would appear at the Olympiad.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, he {{was signed}} by the Peanut Eaters of the Pennsylvania State Association, and played in 36games before being sold to the Detroit Wolverines of the NL, along with Ed Beatin for $1,000 on July27. Soon, the deal was put on hold by the NL, as the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association(AA) also claimed they had a deal in place for these players. On September6, an {{arbitration}} board for the NL and AA leagues convened to render their findings. They found that Detroit's contract with the players was dated on July20, which superseded Cincinnati's contract that was signed on July27, and awarded Detroit the players. Detroit then sold their contracts with the players to the London Tecumsehs of the International Association. Though he did not play for London in 1887, he <b>did</b> <b>play</b> in two games for the New York Metropolitans of the AA, going hitless in eight at bats.|$|E
