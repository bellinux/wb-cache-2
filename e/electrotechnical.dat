5|$|The CGS {{absolute}} unit {{of electric}} current, the abampere, had been {{defined in terms}} of the force between two parallel current-carrying wires in 1881. In the 1940s, the International <b>Electrotechnical</b> Commission adopted an MKS variant of this definition for the ampere, which was adopted in 1948 by the CGPM.|$|E
5|$|The International <b>Electrotechnical</b> Commission {{defines a}} similar set of nominal impedances, {{but also has}} a coarser {{classification}} of low (less than 600Ω), medium (600Ω to 10kΩ) and high (more than 10kΩ) impedances.|$|E
5|$|In 1881 first International Electrical Congress {{adopted the}} BAAS {{recommendations}} on electrical units, {{followed by a}} series of congresses in which further units of measure were defined and the International <b>Electrotechnical</b> Commission (IEC) was set up with the specific task of overseeing electrical units of measure. This was followed by the International Congress of Radiology (ISR) who, at their inaugural meeting in 1926, initiated the definition of radiological-related units of measure.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, now already {{sixty years}} old, {{he got the}} chance to put his preachings on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch {{government}} appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Romania, a country in the throes of political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch <b>electrotechnical</b> firm Philips.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, {{many of the}} world's largest {{mobile phone}} {{manufacturers}} signed an EC-sponsored Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), agreeing to make most data-enabled mobile phones marketed in the European Union compatible with a common External Power Supply (common EPS). The EU's common EPS specification (EN 62684:2010) references the USB Battery Charging Specification and {{is similar to the}} GSMA/OMTP and Chinese charging solutions. In January 2011, the International <b>Electrotechnical</b> Commission (IEC) released its version of the (EU's) common EPS standard as IEC 62684:2011.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of his two-year vocational training, Chikatilo chose {{to relocate to}} the Urals city of Nizhny Tagil to work upon a long-term construction project. While working in this city, he also undertook correspondence courses in engineering with the Moscow <b>Electrotechnical</b> Institute of Communication. He worked in the Urals for two years until he was drafted into the Soviet Army in 1957.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, the International <b>Electrotechnical</b> Commission {{published}} IEC 60906-1, a specification for a {{plug and}} socket that look similar, but are not identical, to the Swiss {{plug and socket}}. This standard was intended to one day become common for all of Europe and other regions with 230 V mains, but the effort to adopt it as a European Union standard was put on hold in the mid-1990s.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the human}} ear {{does not have}} a flat {{spectral}} response, sound pressures are often frequency weighted so that the measured level matches perceived levels more closely. The International <b>Electrotechnical</b> Commission (IEC) has defined several weighting schemes. A-weighting attempts to match the response of the human ear to noise and A-weighted sound pressure levels are labeled dBA. C-weighting is used to measure peak levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} the Bratislava Region {{accounts}} for about a quarter(EUR 20 billion) of the Slovak GDP. Bratislava {{has one of the}} highest GDP per capita at PPP of among whole E.U. €51,200(~$70,000). It is marked by a strong tertiary sector, while the primary sector has a share of only around 1% and the secondary sector around 20%. Important branches include chemical, automobile, machine, <b>electrotechnical</b> and food industries.|$|E
25|$|The International <b>Electrotechnical</b> Commission publishes {{standard}} 60269 for low-voltage power fuses. The {{standard is}} in four volumes, which describe general requirements, fuses for industrial and commercial applications, fuses for residential applications, and fuses to protect semiconductor devices. The IEC standard unifies several national standards, thereby improving the interchangeability of fuses in international trade. All fuses of different technologies tested to meet IEC standards will have similar time-current characteristics, which simplifies design and maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Electrical power {{transmission}} networks are protected {{and controlled by}} high-voltage breakers. The definition of high voltage varies but in {{power transmission}} work is usually thought to be 72.5kV or higher, {{according to a recent}} definition by the International <b>Electrotechnical</b> Commission (IEC). High-voltage breakers are nearly always solenoid-operated, with current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. In substations the protective relay scheme can be complex, protecting equipment and buses from various types of overload or ground/earth fault.|$|E
25|$|Mircea Iorga {{was married}} into the aristocratic Știrbey family, {{and then to}} Mihaela Bohățiel, a Transylvanian noblewoman who was reputedly a {{descendant}} of the Lemeni clan and of the medieval magnate Johannes Benkner. He was for a while attracted into PND politics, and also wrote poetry. An engineer by trade, he was headmaster of the Bucharest <b>Electrotechnical</b> College in the late 1930s. Another son, Ștefan N. Iorga, was a writer active with the Cuget Clar movement, and later a noted physician.|$|E

25|$|De facto {{standards}} became formalised as official {{national and}} international standards. Old installations with obsolete sockets exist. The International <b>Electrotechnical</b> Commission in 1934 established technical committee TC 23 for electrical fittings. Only two meetings were held before {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. In Europe, since 1951 the International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment (CEE) has published a standard (CEE 7 Specification for Plugs and Socket-Outlets for Domestic and Similar Purposes) describing the plugs and sockets used. In 1953 the CEE published Technical Report 83 (later 60083), which was a listing of plugs and sockets then in use. In North America the National Electrical Manufacturers' Association (NEMA) publishes standards for plugs and sockets.|$|E
25|$|Although textile trading has {{declined}} in significance, the industrial {{relationship between the}} regions, especially in the manufacturing sector, is a major one. As of 2008 trade {{between the two nations}} accounted for US$ 1 billion. Ukraine is a notable exporter to Belgium of precious metals and minerals, oil products and chemicals whilst Belgium is a major supplier to Ukraine of machines, industrial and <b>electrotechnical</b> equipment, chemicals, rubber, and also certain metals. The nations are also connected in the beer industry, with the Belgian brewing company Interbrew having a share of 34.3% in the Ukrainian beer market, thanks to its cooperation with the Ukrainian brewers of Chernigiv, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. General Belgian investments in the economy of Ukraine had grown rapidly and as of July 2008, some US$ 44 million was put in the Ukrainian economy by Belgian investors, with 31.5% into wholesale trade, 16% into transport and communications, 15% into the food-processing industry (15%) and 13% into mechanical engineering respectively. A number of Ukrainian companies are primarily financed by Belgian investment.|$|E
