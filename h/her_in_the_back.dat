5|$|Captivated by Hedren's Nordic looks, Hitchcock becomes {{infatuated}} with her. While filming The Birds, he makes physical advances to <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a limousine but she rebuffs him and escapes {{through the back}} door. In retaliation for her rejection, Hitchcock exposes Hedren to terrifying encounters with birds. A mechanical bird breaks the apparently shatterproof glass of a telephone booth during filming, scratching Hedren's face with splintering glass. After arriving on set to shoot a scene where Hedren's character (Melanie Daniels) is trapped in an attic with aggressive birds, she discovers that Hitchcock has ordered the mechanical birds to be replaced with live ones. He demands the scene be repeated until he is satisfied that Hedren's reaction looks authentic. This takes a protracted several days of filming, leaving Hedren traumatised.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Big Boo and Doggett's {{friendship}} continues to develop. Seeing that Doggett bears strong {{feelings of guilt}} relating to the six abortions that she has had, Big Boo makes reference to the book Freakonomics, which suggests that crime rates in the 1990s fell because of Roe v. Wade. Following Lorna Morello (played by Yael Stone) being relieved of her duty of driving the prison van, the role is given to Doggett. She comes into contact {{with one of the}} new correctional officers called Charlie Coates (played by James McMenamin). Coates is initially friendly towards Doggett. Despite relationships between prison staff and prisoners being forbidden, Coates kisses Doggett, against her will, after feeding some ducks. Following another outing, Coates gets in trouble with his boss Joe Caputo (played by Nick Sandow) for being late for count and is placed on probation. Doggett apologises for having caused him trouble, and he rapes <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the prison van.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of her head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, Liz {{is allowed}} to go free. The film ends with <b>her</b> sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of an ambulance, smiling at the doctor, which turns into a {{somewhat}} sinister look.|$|R
25|$|During {{the same}} evening, Marietta DiGirolamo, 31, was walking along Divisadero Street {{when she was}} shoved into a doorway by a man and shot twice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chest. The shots spun her around and struck <b>her</b> once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> killing <b>her.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{surviving}} {{victim was}} Vicki Webb, 35, {{who was shot}} on January 15, 1994 in Houston at the Alternatives gift shop. She briefly talked to the shooter before he shot <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the head. The bullet did not penetrate into Webb's head due to a large vertebra being hit. The shooter attempted to shoot her again, but his gun misfired, and left presuming Webb to be dead.|$|E
25|$|During her salsa in the semifinals, Jenkins' partner Mark Ballas accidentally kicked <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> {{leading to}} a spasm that made Jenkins mess up her final moves, but she {{advanced}} to the finals nonetheless, along with Donald Driver and William Levy. Jenkins bounced back in the finale, getting perfect score 30 out of 30 for all three of her dances, and eventually finished as a runner-up to Driver. Her performances average was 27.9, the third highest ever in the show's history at the time.|$|E
25|$|On 17 March 1920, {{at the age}} of 23, {{while she}} was walking on a street with her mother, a delinquent youth struck <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with an iron bar for no {{apparent}} reason. As a result of that injury, she was confined to bed for three months. Although she seemed to have recovered, and was able to move around for over a decade thereafter, the complications from that incident eventually confined her to bed for 28 years, from April 1934 to the end of her life.|$|E
50|$|In an {{alternate}} ending, after Andy eats Claude's heart, Serafine has {{a vision of}} <b>her</b> stepfather <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of an ambulance, explaining how he found a cure before his death.

5000|$|Archer {{donated the}} {{royalties}} from her second single [...] "In Your Care" [...] to Childline. The song was about child abuse. In 1993 Archer won a BRIT Award for the Best British Breakthrough Act. However, later she joked that she kept <b>her</b> award <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>her</b> kitchen cupboard, {{and claimed that}} she used it for cracking nuts and tenderising steak.|$|R
25|$|Bryant {{moved back}} to the buses where Janet Quin lay injured from the earlier shot. Bryant shot <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> then left; she later died from her wounds. Bryant then went onto one of the coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her. At an {{adjacent}} coach, Gordon Francis saw what happened and moved down the aisle to try to shut the door of the coach he was on. He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.|$|E
25|$|In her youth, Valtorta {{travelled}} around Italy {{due to her}} father's military career. Her father eventually {{settled in}} Viareggio. In 1920, aged 23, while {{walking on a street}} with her mother, a delinquent youth struck <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with an iron bar for no apparent reason. In 1934 the injury eventually confined her to bed for the remaining 28 years of her life. Her spiritual life was influenced by reading the autobiography of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux and, in 1925, at the age of 28, before becoming bedridden, she offered herself to God as a victim soul.|$|E
25|$|The café {{was very}} small, with the tables very close together, and was {{particularly}} busy that day, with many people {{waiting for the}} next ferry. The following events happened extremely quickly. Bryant took aim from his hip and pointed his rifle at Moh Yee (William) Ng and Sou Leng Chung, who were visiting from Malaysia, who were at a table beside Bryant. He shot them at close range, killing both instantly. Bryant then fired a shot at Mick Sargent, grazing his scalp and knocking him to the floor. He fired a fourth shot that killed Sargent's girlfriend, 21-year-old Kate Elizabeth Scott, by hitting <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the head.|$|E
5000|$|Shirley Bellinger is {{the first}} and only woman to be incarcerated at Oswald. She was sentenced to die for murdering her {{daughter}}; she drove her car into a lake with <b>her</b> daughter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat, then swam out as the car sank, leaving her daughter to drown. She swears it was an accident, but that it nevertheless [...] "had to happen".|$|R

Kilala tells them she knows where they can find a princess and leads them to a Princess Contest where her best friend, Erica, had just won. Certain that Erika was the Princess they were looking for, she goes to find her only to watch as strange men in long coats kidnap her and throw <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat of a car. Kilala goes after her but is almost injured by the mysterious men before Rei comes and saves her.|$|E
25|$|A day later, on Saturday, August 25, Rolling {{broke into}} the {{apartment}} where 18-year-old Christa Hoyt lived by prying open a sliding glass door with a KA-BAR knife and a screwdriver, {{but she was not}} home. He waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m. she entered the apartment and Rolling surprised her from behind, placing her in a choke-hold. After she had been subdued, he taped her mouth shut, bound her wrists together and led her into the bedroom, where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her face-down and stabbed <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> rupturing her heart. He then decapitated the body and posed her head on a shelf facing the corpse, adding to the shock of whoever discovered her.|$|E
25|$|Aggression among captive {{killer whales}} is common. In August 1989, a {{dominant}} female killer whale, Kandu V, attempted to rake a newcomer whale, Corky II, {{with her mouth}} during a live show, and smashed her head into a wall. Kandu V broke her jaw, which severed an artery, and then bled to death. In November 2006, a dominant female killer whale, Kasatka, repeatedly dragged experienced trainer Ken Peters {{to the bottom of}} the stadium pool during a show after hearing her calf crying for <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> pools. In February 2010, an experienced female trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, Dawn Brancheau, was killed by killer whale Tilikum shortly after a show in Shamu Stadium. Tilikum had been associated with the deaths of two people previously. In May 2012, Occupational Safety and Health Administration administrative law judge Ken Welsch cited SeaWorld for two violations in the death of Dawn Brancheau and fined the company a total of US$12,000. Trainers were banned from making close contact with the killer whales. In April 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied an appeal by SeaWorld.|$|E
5000|$|A vast crowd {{collected}} to see her, but {{the sailor}} {{hurried to the}} house of <b>her</b> sister, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> lane...

But the melody had come from Mirah's dear voice.|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{following}} Willow's {{reconciliation with}} Tara, Warren (Adam Busch), {{one of the}} Trio, shoots Buffy; a stray shot kills Tara {{right in front of}} Willow. In an explosion of rage and grief, Willow soaks up all the dark magic she can, which turns her hair and eyes black. In the final episodes of the season Willow becomes exceedingly strong, surviving unharmed when Warren hits <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with an axe. She hunts Warren, tortures him by slowly pushing a bullet into his body, then kills him by magically flaying him. Unsatisfied, she attempts to kill the other two members of the Trio but is unsuccessful due to her weakening power. She solves this problem by killing her 'dealer' from earlier in the season and draining him of his magic. When she is confronted by Buffy they begin to fight, only to be stopped by Giles who has borrowed magic from a coven of wiccans. Willow successfully drains him of this borrowed magic, fulfilling his plan and causing her to feel all the pain of everyone in the world. She tries to ease the pain by destroying the world, finally to be stopped by Xander.|$|E

500|$|Lhermitte's last {{victim was}} her eldest daughter, Yasmin. The mother called over Yasmin {{and told her}} she had a {{surprise}} for her, just like she had done with Myriam. Lhermitte attacked Yasmin from behind as she entered the office, but Yasmin was able to dodge the knife by diving to the ground. After a struggle in which Yasmin suffered multiple stab wounds, Lhermitte stabbed <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and slashed her throat. With her children dead, Lhermitte then attempted to kill herself by falling on her knife. When she realized that the wound would not be fatal, she wrote [...] "call the police" [...] in red marker on her door and called emergency services to the house. Investigators found the four children tucked in their beds, some with stuffed toys in their arms.|$|E

500|$|Selena Quintanilla-Pérez (April 16, 1971 – March 31, 1995) was an American {{singer who}} {{achieved}} international fame {{as a member}} of Selena y Los Dinos and for her subsequent solo career in both Spanish and English [...] Her father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla Jr., appointed Yolanda Saldívar president of Selena's fan club in 1991 after Saldívar had repeatedly asked permission to start one. In January 1994, Saldívar was promoted to manager of the singer's boutiques. Selena's employees, fashion designer, and cousin began complaining about Saldívar's management style. In January 1995, Quintanilla, Jr. began receiving telephone calls and letters from angry fans who had sent membership payments and had received nothing in return. He began investigating their complaints and found evidence that Saldívar had embezzled $60,000 from the fan club and the boutiques using forged checks. After the Quintanilla family confronted her, Saldívar bought a gun, lured Selena to a motel room, and shot <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> Although doctors tried to revive Selena, she was pronounced dead from loss of blood and cardiac arrest.|$|E
500|$|On 13 May 1983, two peat {{workers at}} Lindow Moss, Andy Mould and Stephen Dooley, noticed an unusual object—about {{the size of}} a football—on the {{elevator}} taking peat to the shredding machine. They removed the object for closer inspection, joking that it was a dinosaur egg. Once the peat had been removed, their discovery {{turned out to be a}} decomposing, incomplete human head with one eye and some hair intact. Forensics identified the skull as belonging to a European woman, probably aged 30–50. Police initially thought the skull was that of Malika Reyn-Bardt, who had disappeared in 1960 and was the subject of an ongoing investigation. While in prison on another charge, her husband, Peter Reyn-Bardt, had boasted that he had killed his wife and buried <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> garden of their bungalow, which was on the edge of the area of mossland where peat was being dug. The garden was examined but no body was recovered there. When Reyn-Bardt was confronted with the discovery of the skull from Lindow Moss, he confessed to the murder of his wife. It was later radiocarbon dated, revealing it to be nearly 2,000years old. [...] "Lindow Woman", as it became known, dated from around 210AD. This emerged shortly before Reyn-Bardt went to trial, but he was convicted on the evidence of his confession.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E
