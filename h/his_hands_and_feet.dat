5|$|Judy Taylor, {{author of}} several books about Potter and her works, observes that Potter had {{difficulty}} drawing the human form, and, {{as a result of her}} limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b> Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict his face was eliminated by presenting him in the middle or far distance and from the rear.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's victory to 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan that had <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> removed surgically {{due to a}} bacterial infection. Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia. Wade {{has been known for}} visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid placing himself in the media spotlight.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} corporeal, {{depicted as a}} real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. <b>His</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above {{the level of the}} cross.|$|E

50|$|On {{the morning}} of 11 April 1986 Keenan was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad. After {{spending}} two months in isolation, he was moved to a cell shared with the British journalist John McCarthy. He was kept blindfolded throughout most of his ordeal, and was chained by <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> when he {{was taken out of}} solitary.|$|R
5|$|Makeup artist Baker {{provided}} the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> were fitted with liquid substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Stela 8 is a well-preserved {{monument}} on {{the south}} side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat'ul Chatel wears jaguar claws on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet,</b> together with other attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God. In one hand the king holds the head of the god K'awiil. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands. Schele and Mathews propose that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation legends of the K'iche' people.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. <b>His</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E
5000|$|During his {{professional}} boxing career {{he was known}} for <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> speed, <b>and</b> the ability to switch effortlessly from the orthodox stance to the southpaw stance. Many opponents were confused by this style, and some boxing experts contend that Crawley {{might have been the}} best [...] "switch hitter" [...] of his time along with middleweight champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler.|$|R
50|$|During the {{intermission}} of {{the final}} round of the poker game, Sam is attacked by a hitman in the restroom. The injured Sam entrusts Koyan to take his place for the final bet. He tells her to bet his entire stake, and since Taro would not have a sufficient stake, he also bets <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> to even it out. Koyan requests this at the gambling table and Taro agrees to it, but Koyan has to bet her hand as well to make the bet fair. During the game, Koyan's hand shows the ten of hearts, the jack of hearts, the king of hearts and the ace of hearts, while Taro's hand shows two queens and two jacks. In the end, Koyan wins with a straight flush. Taro had to keep his promise, but did not want to cut off <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot,</b> so he shot and killed his father and other audience members before being shot dead by both the Americans and Japanese.|$|R
50|$|Nerio was {{reported}} missing on Tuesday 31 January 2012 and finally his {{body was found in}} Sonsonate the day after, near six other people's bodies. <b>His</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> were reportedly tied and he appeared to be strangled to death. Police announced he was presumably murdered by gang members. He was buried next to his brother Livio Efrén Nerio, who was murdered in 2006.|$|R
5|$|While {{working at}} the {{hardware}} store, Gardiner first played organised sports {{as a member of}} the store's baseball team. Gardiner quickly started playing ice hockey, with the same passion as the children who were born in Canada. As he didn't learn to skate until he was eight-years-old, he couldn't skate very fast and was forced to play as the goaltender. He had tried to play as a forward and defenceman, but was too slow for either position. Playing on Winnipeg's frozen ponds, Gardiner employed an acrobatic style, instead of the nearly-universal stand-up style played in that era, to avoid having <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> frostbitten. He joined the Victorias, a team in the Winnipeg City League, at the age of 13. He recorded a shutout in his first game, but the team was shut out in their following game, so Gardiner was cut. By the age of 14, Gardiner made the intermediate team of the Selkirk Fishermen.|$|E

50|$|Koyan {{then goes}} to see Sam at the {{hospital}} where she overhears a conversation between Sam and the hitman that pretended to kill him. It was revealed that the attack in the bathroom was staged by Sam himself {{in order to have}} Taro agree to bet <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> expect to have the Kungs kill each other, achieving his ultimate goal of seeking vengeance for Crab. Sam also says he does not intend to let Koyan know about this secret and instead, he would conceal it forever. After hearing this, Koyan removes her engagement ring, leaves it on the floor outside Sam's room, and brokenheartedly leaves.|$|R
50|$|Manuel Octavio Bermúdez {{was born}} in Trujillo, Valle del Cauca, Colombia in 1961 and was {{orphaned}} after birth. He was adopted by an abusive mother who threw him off a balcony, breaking <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot.</b> This gave him a permanent limp. He was given to another family {{in the city of}} Palmira. His new parents were alcoholics and his father was described as abusive. Bermudez later had several kids of his own.|$|R

Except for this first immersion, he would do each on holy ground in the Parwah cell. They spread a linen sheet between him and the people. If the High Priest was either old or delicate, they warmed the water for him. He undressed, immersed himself, came up, and dried off. They brought him the golden garments; he put them on and washed <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
