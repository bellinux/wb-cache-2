5|$|With Burgers due {{to stand}} for {{re-election}} the following year, Kruger became a popular alternative candidate, but he resolved to stand by the President after Burgers privately assured {{him that he would}} do his utmost to defend the South African Republic's independence. The towns of the Transvaal were becoming increasingly British in character as immigration and trade gathered apace, and the idea of annexation was gaining support both locally and in the British government. In late 1876 Lord Carnarvon, Colonial Secretary under Benjamin Disraeli, gave Sir Theophilus Shepstone of Natal a special commission to confer with the South African Republic's government and, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> fit, annex the country.|$|E
25|$|J.P. {{embraced the}} {{philosophy}} put forth in Jan Yoor’s book, “The Gypsies.” That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined {{his adult life}} and was far more revolutionary than most people could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire to live life fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would {{go out at night}} with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along the next morning to offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E
25|$|Barrington {{was chosen}} to manage the {{forthcoming}} tour of Pakistan in the first season of the WSC, both sides losing players as a result. Phil Edmonds and Paul Downton were taken on the tour, Downton on Barrington's advice after playing only a few county games and he gave Edmonds was long practise sessions in the nets to improve his spin bowling. The team arrived {{in the wake of}} General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's military coup displacing Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the country {{was in a state of}} high tension and disorder. In the First Test 40,000 Bhutto supporters rioted at the ground and the teams took refuge in their dressing rooms as the army restored order. The TCCB gave Barrington permission to cancel the tour <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> fit and realising this the players urged him to let them go home for Christmas. In the Second Test England collapsed in the first innings to the leg-spinner Abdul Qadir (6/44), but Barrington bowled his own leg-spin at Brearley and Boycott for an hour before the second innings and their 185 opening stand saved the game. The Third Test was surrounded by controversy as Pakistan wanted brought in their WSC players Zaheer Abbas, Mushtaq Mohammad and Imran Khan to win a series victory in the last Test. This would have given them an edge over an England team without its WSC veterans. Several England players led by the vice-captain Geoff Boycott, Bob Willis and Derek Randall refused to play Pakistan with their Packer players and Barrington and Brearley tried to negotiate between the players, the TCCB and the Pakistani cricket authorities. Matters were made worst by Mike Brearley breaking his arm and returning to England, leaving the uncompromising Boycott as captain and Willis as vice-captain. Fortunately, the Pakistani players could only play by breaking their WSC contracts, which they refused to do, and the Test was drawn. Barrington was out of his depth in these political matters, even though Willis later admitted that his determination for the Test to be played regardless was the right course.|$|E

500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Lt. Col. Towers, the group derived more from Rabelais than the {{inscription}} over the door. He believes that they used caves as a Dionysian oracular temple, based upon Dashwood’s reading of the relevant chapters of Rabelais. [...] Sir Nathaniel Wraxall in his Historical Memoires (1815) accused the Monks of performing Satanic rituals, but these claims have been dismissed as hearsay. Gerald Gardner and others such as Mike Howard say the Monks worshipped [...] "the Goddess". Daniel Willens argued that the group likely practiced Freemasonry, but also suggests Dashwood may have held secret Roman Catholic sacraments. He asks if Wilkes would have recognized a genuine Catholic Mass, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it himself {{and even if the}} underground version followed its public model precisely.|$|E
500|$|Kelly drank a lot; saxophonist Jimmy Heath {{described}} him as [...] "an alcoholic" [...] who [...] "could control his drinking" [...] and not let his playing be affected by it. Kelly was known [...] "for being a very warm, generous human being". Bassist Bill Crow reported that Kelly was [...] "full of fun": [...] "He was often the center of backstage laughing sessions as we told stories on each other. Wynton had a removable upper front denture. While on stage, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> some of us standing in the wings listening, he would turn around so the audience couldn't see, give us a stern look, and drop his upper plate forward onto his lower lip, creating a grotesquely comical effect. Sometimes he heightened it by sticking his tongue out at us over his upper teeth." ...|$|E
500|$|As per Priyadas' account, Tulsidas {{followed}} {{the instruction of}} Hanumana and started living in an Ashram at Ramghat in Chitrakuta. One day Tulsidas went to perform the Parikrama (circumambulation) of the Kamadgiri mountain. He saw two princes, one dark and the other fair, dressed in green robes pass by mounted on horsebacks. Tulsidas was enraptured at the sight, however he could not recognise them and took his eyes off them. Later Hanuman asked Tulsidas <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Rama and his brother Lakshmana on horses. Tulsidas was disappointed and repentful. Hanuman assured Tulsidas {{that he would have}} the sight of Rama once again the next morning. Tulsidas recalls this incident in a song of the Gitavali and laments how [...] "his eyes turned his own enemies" [...] by staying fixed to the ground and how everything happened in a trice.|$|E

500|$|Flacourt's 1658 {{description}} of the tretretretre or tratratratra was the first mention of the now extinct giant lemurs in Western culture, but it is unclear <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it. The creature Flacourt described has traditionally been interpreted as a species of Megaladapis. However, the size may have been exaggerated, and the [...] "round head and a human face" [...] would not match Megaladapis, which had an enlarged snout and eyes that did not face entirely forward. Megaladapis had the least forward-facing eyes of all primates. [...] The facial description, and the mention of a short tail, solitary habits, and other traits better match the most recent interpretation — Palaeopropithecus. [...] Likewise, Malagasy tales recorded by the 19th-century folklorist Gabriel Ferrand describing a large animal with a flat human-like face that was unable to negotiate smooth rock outcrops best match Palaeopropithecus, which would also have had difficulty on flat smooth surfaces.|$|E
500|$|Several {{biographies of}} Hans-Joachim Marseille {{have written about}} his disdain for {{authority}} and for the National Socialist movement in general. Some biographers describe him as [...] "openly anti-Nazi." [...] When Marseille first met Hitler in 1942 he did not form a positive impression. After returning to Africa, Eduard Neumman recalled, [...] "After his first visit with Hitler, Marseille returned {{and said that he}} thought 'the Führer was a rather odd sort'." [...] On the visit, Marseille also said some unflattering things about Hitler and the Nazi Party. Several senior officers, which included Adolf Galland and Nicolaus von Below, overheard his remarks during one of the award ceremonies. Von Below asked Marseille if he would join the Nazi Party and within earshot of others, Marseille responded, [...] "that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a party worth joining, he would consider it, but there would have to plenty of attractive women in it." [...] The remarks visibly upset Hitler who was left [...] "puzzled" [...] by his behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Conein {{knew that}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the {{execution}} wounds, {{he would not}} be able to deny that Diem and Nhu had been assassinated. Conein refused to see the proof, realising that having such knowledge would compromise his cover and his safety. He returned to the embassy and submitted his report to Washington. The CIA in Saigon later secured a set of photos of the brothers that left no doubt that they had been executed. The photos were taken at about 10:00, 2 November, showing the dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of an APC. They were dressed in the robes of Roman Catholic priests with their hands tied behind their backs. Their faces were bloodied and bruised and they had been repeatedly stabbed. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide. The pictures were distributed around the world, having been sold to media outlets in Saigon. The caption below a picture published in Time read [...] "'Suicide' with no hands." ...|$|E

500|$|Pete Michels, {{director}} of the episode, had read {{a story in the}} newspaper about people with famous names. He came up with a way of how Homer's life could be affected <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> someone on TV with his name. While creating the Homer Simpson television character, the production staff was deciding if the character should be [...] "cool" [...] throughout the episode, or if he should be an idiot from the beginning. The staff decided to use both methods and have him become an idiot after being seen as cool in the first episode of the new program. The hat Homer wears while walking through the mall is a parody of one owned by Woody Allen. [...] Ron Hauge, a The Simpsons show producer, suggested the name Max Power to a friend who wanted to change his name. His friend, however, did not take it. The episode would also inspire Tom Martin's cousin to name his son Max Power. One scene from the episode features Ned Flanders commenting that cartoons are easily able to change voice actors; to enhance the joke for his one line of dialogue, Flanders is voiced by recurring cast member Karl Wiedergott instead of his regular voice actor Harry Shearer.|$|E
500|$|On 30 January 1933, Hitler was {{appointed}} Reich Chancellor, his {{first step in}} gaining dictatorial control of Germany. Hess was named Deputy Führer of the NSDAP on 21 April and {{was appointed}} to the cabinet, with the post of Reich Minister without Portfolio, on 1 December. [...] With offices in the Brown House in Munich and another in Berlin, Hess was responsible for several departments, including foreign affairs, finance, health, education and law. All legislation passed through his office for approval, except that concerning the army, the police and foreign policy, and he wrote and co-signed many of Hitler's decrees. An organiser of the annual Nuremberg Rallies, he usually gave the opening speech and introduced Hitler. Hess also spoke over the radio and at rallies around the country, so frequently that the speeches were collected into book form in 1938. Hess acted as Hitler's delegate in negotiations with industrialists and members of the wealthier classes. As Hess had been born abroad, Hitler had him oversee the NSDAP groups such as the NSDAP/AO that were in charge of party members living in other countries. Hitler instructed Hess to review all court decisions that related to persons deemed enemies of the Party. He was authorised to increase the sentences of anyone he felt got off too lightly in these cases, and was also empowered to take [...] "merciless action" [...] <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> fit to do so. This often entailed sending the person to a concentration camp or simply ordering the person killed. Hess was given the rank of Obergruppenführer in the Schutzstaffel (SS) in 1934, the second-highest SS rank.|$|E
2500|$|Back at the school, {{parents of}} {{harnessed}} kids {{come over and}} ask Tom <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> anything.

Porter tells Tom that a doctor has a theory on how to remove the harnesses and that he wants to test it on Ben. Porter then tells him to bring Ben back safely. Tom meets up with Matt who heard that when a harness is removed, the kids die. Tom reassures his son that Ben will be fine.|$|E

When Payton learned that [...] "King Tiger" [...] was being held in the same facility, he told the authorities not to put them together, swearing he would kill Tijerina <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him. Prison officials promptly locked them in the same cell. But when the two talked peacefully for more than four hours, Payton {{was transferred}} out of the cell.|$|E

2500|$|The {{identity}} of the Jewish witness is in doubt. As far as is known, there were two, Israel Schwartz and Joseph Lawende. Schwartz saw the third victim Elizabeth Stride being attacked {{at the place where}} fifteen minutes later her body was found, but he ran off when the attacker called out [...] "Lipski", an antisemitic taunt of the time. Israel Lipski was a Jewish murderer who had been hanged in 1887 and some Gentiles had taken to insulting Jews by shouting his name at them. The implication, perhaps erroneous, is that Stride's attacker was an antisemitic Gentile and therefore not Kosminski. Lawende saw a man and woman together near Mitre Square, Aldgate, a few minutes before the fourth victim Catharine Eddowes was found there but told Swanson that he was doubtful he would recognise the man <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him again.|$|E
50|$|Oscar Villalobos, {{a former}} {{corporate}} lawyer {{who now works}} as a flunkie for a local news crew, was also shocked by what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> in the durriken’s small black eyes.

He needs to know if the durriken really did look deep into his past and dredge up emotions that were best left untouched.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--I'm sorry!" [...] she said. The faint starlight {{shone on}} her face, in her eyes, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>saw</b> beauty and soul <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them then.

2500|$|Laurie's parents, {{who were}} of Scottish descent, {{attended}} St. Columba's Presbyterian Church of England (now United Reformed Church) in Oxford. He notes that [...] "belief in God didn't play {{a large role}} in my home, but a certain attitude to life and the living of it did". He followed this by stating, [...] "Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure was something that... I was going to say it had to be earned but even the earning of it didn't really work. It was something to this day, I mean, I carry that with me. I find pleasure a difficult thing; I don't know what you do with it, I don't know where to put it." [...] He later stated, [...] "I don't believe in God, but I have this idea that if there were a God, or destiny of some kind looking down on us, that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> you taking anything for granted he'd take it away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Instead of {{pursuing}} a fleeing enemy, as his orders had directed, A.P. Hill had attacked an entrenched Union position, losing about 2,000 of his 13,200 {{men in the}} failed attempt. Combined with his attacks at Mechanicsville the previous day, the Light Division had lost {{over a quarter of}} its men. General McClellan was encouraged by the telegrams Porter sent back to his headquarters a few miles to the rear. He replied, [...] "If the enemy are retiring and you are a chasseur, pitch in." [...] He also told Franklin to cross the river over the Duane bridge and attack the enemy's flank <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a chance, but he was dismayed to hear that the VI Corps commander had destroyed the bridge for fear of a possible enemy attack. At the same time, Brig. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner of the II Corps reported enemy activity in his front. McClellan's optimism was dashed and he ordered that his headquarters equipment be packed up in preparation for the retreat. On the Confederate side, General Lee had been an active participant in the failed assault, rallying his troops too close to the front for their comfort. As Longstreet arrived to the southwest of A.P. Hill, he saw the difficulty of attacking over such terrain and delayed until Stonewall Jackson could attack on Hill's left.|$|E
2500|$|Although Michaels {{expressed}} happiness at Hart's 2006 induction {{into the}} Hall of Fame, the Hart–Michaels relationship remained laced with antagonism. Michaels criticized Hart's behavior and conduct during {{his days in}} WWF in his 2005 autobiography, comparing the Screwjob to a [...] "mafia hit," [...] and Hart has stated in his 2007 autobiography that he would [...] "never forgive" [...] Michaels. In interviews prior to the induction ceremony, Hart asserted that he would walk out from the ceremony <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Michaels anywhere on the WrestleMania 22 weekend. Michaels {{decided to leave the}} Hall of Fame ceremony early to avoid a possible scene. Hart did not appear at the WrestleMania show in a mini-ceremony with the other inductees, explaining {{in an interview that he}} had never intended to attend or appear at the show. Hart would later return to WWE television on the June 11, 2007 edition of Raw, where he appeared in a taped promo spot mocking Mr. McMahon's [...] "appreciation night." [...] While he was able to reconcile to a degree with McMahon, Hart had never reconciled with Michaels. In a November 17, 2008 radio interview, Hart mocked Michaels' version of the incident, saying, [...] "Shawn's this Christian today; and in his book, he wrote that Vince took a dive and that I never even hit him and I thought, 'This guy is such a liar'. I wonder what kind of Christian he is." [...] Asked if he had seen or spoken to Michaels since 1997, Hart said, [...] "No. And I hope I never do... for his sake." ...|$|E
