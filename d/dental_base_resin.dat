40|$|Introduction: Bond Strengths among denture <b>base</b> <b>resins</b> {{and various}} types of reline {{materials}} are not always satisfactorily high. Therefore efforts {{have been made to}} use materials similar to <b>resin</b> <b>base</b> dentures and bonding agents to increase infirmity. This study compares bond strength and deflection of a hard chair side reline material with two denture <b>base</b> <b>resins.</b> Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 54 resin specimens with the size of 65 × 10 × 2. 5 mm were prepared. These specimens included intact heat cure (M), cold cure (F), acrylic resin specimens bonded with the same resins (M-M, F-F) and specimens bonded to a hard chair side reline material (M-G, F-G). All specimens were stored in sodium hypochlorite 8 hours a day for 3 months and were then thermocycled (2000 cycles, 5 to 55 °C). The transverse bond strengths (FMax) and deflections (DFMax) were evaluated with three point loading test. The results were analyzed with two-way ANOVA followed by Games Howell & Gabriel’s and Kolmogrov-smirnor test (α = 0. 05). Results: F Max for different types of resins and reline materials showed significant differences (p value < 0. 05). Although DFMax differences between reline materials and their interactions with different types of resins were significantly different (p value < 0. 05), no significant difference among the types of resins could be found (p value = 0. 263). Comparing the reline materials with denture <b>base</b> <b>resins,</b> cold cure resin was shown to have statistically different FMax and DFMax (p value < 0. 05). Heat cure resins showed statistical differences on FMax between intact resins when relined with the same resins and relined with hard reline (p value < 0. 05). Conclusion: Bond strength of the cold cure denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> group (F) to the same resin was higher than hard reline, but bond strength of hard reline material with heat cure denture base was similar to the bond strength of the same reline, and in this group, maximum deflection in bonded resin with the same resins were showed.

40|$|Objective:To {{investigate}} {{mechanical properties}} {{of polymethyl methacrylate}} (PMMA) of different mixing ratios. Methods:At 25 °C, self-curing denture acrylic and liquid <b>dental</b> <b>base</b> acrylic <b>resin</b> are mixed at massvolume ratios of 1. 5 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 1. 25, 1 : 1. 5, 1 : 1. 75, 1 : 2 (g:ml) respectively, and stirred uniformly with a stirring speed of 60 revolutions per minute. A mould of 13 mm diameter and 100 mm length {{is filled with the}} mixture, and after it solidifies it is polished. The size of the model is accurate to 0. 01 mm. A compression test, tensile test and three-point bending test are conducted. Results:The difference of compressive strength between groups with mixing ratios of 1. 5 : 1 and 1 : 1 was not significant (p= 0. 326). However, the value of compressive strength of each of the first two groups was remarkably higher than that of the latter four groups (p 0. 05), but the value of each groups was significantly higher than in the latter three groups (p< 0. 01). Deflection increased with the decrease of mixing ratio. For the first five groups, the value of elastic modulus decreased with the decrease of mixing ratio, which indicated that the rigidity of the test sample decreased accordingly (p< 0. 01). Conclusion:It can be concluded that PMMAs made from different mixing ratios of powdery polymer and liquid monomer has different mechanical properties. Therefore, during the preparation of PMMA, the massvolume ratio of the reactants must be taken into precise consideration in order for the result to have optimum performance suitable for making bone substitutes and other applications in orthopaedic surgery. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE An inhomogeneous {{irradiance}} distribution from a light-curing unit (LCU) can locally cause inhomogeneous curing with locally inadequately cured and/or over-cured areas causing e. g. monomer elution or internal shrinkage stresses, {{and thus}} reduce {{the lifetime of}} <b>dental</b> <b>resin</b> <b>based</b> composite (RBC) restorations. The aim {{of the study is}} to determine both the irradiance distribution of two light curing units (LCUs) and its influence on the local mechanical properties of a RBC. METHODS Specimens of Arabesk TOP OA 2 were irradiated for 5, 20, and 80 s using a Bluephase(®) 20 i LCU in the Low mode (666 mW/cm(2)), in the Turbo mode (2222 mW/cm(2)) and a Celalux(®) 2 (1264 mW/cm(2)). The degree of conversion (DC) was determined with an ATR-FTIR. The Knoop micro-hardness (average of five specimens) was measured on the specimen surface after 24 h of dark and dry storage at room temperature. RESULTS The irradiance distribution affected the hardness distribution {{across the surface of the}} specimens. The hardness distribution corresponded well to the inhomogeneous irradiance distributions of the LCU. The highest reaction rates occurred after approximately 2 s light exposure. A DC of 40...|$|R

40|$|Globally, several {{shortcomings}} of <b>dental</b> <b>resin</b> <b>based</b> composites (RBCs) remain. This {{may be related}} to problems associated with incomplete conversion (40 - 70 %), polymerisation shrinkage (1 - 4 % by volume) and the stress generated at the tooth/restoration interface. Additionally, the increased number of technique sensitive incremental steps required to fill relatively large cavities is due to inefficient light transmission at depths greater than 2 mm. The current investigation demonstrates the applicability of the exposure reciprocity law in photoactive dental materials in order to try and improve these shortcomings. The development techniques that will allow dynamic monitoring of optical and physical change will aid material development with the goal of improving cure depths. The current investigation has demonstrated the use of several analytical techniques (FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-Vis Spectroscopy and low coherence interferometry) and shown the complexity of optical phenomena within RBCs, which are affected by material composition as well as cavity dimensions. Whilst research continues to develop a novel RBC with reduced shrinkage and improved depths of cure, there is currently no commercially available solution to such problems. Consequently {{a better understanding of the}} setting reaction, optical properties and physical properties will aid material development.

The repair of resin composite may hold clinical advantages. Currently, there is no available information regarding the repair potential of silorane resin composite with either silorane or methacrylate <b>based</b> <b>resin</b> composite. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the repaired microtensile bond strength of aged silorane resin composite using different surface treatments and either silorane or methacrylate <b>based</b> <b>resin</b> composite. Methods: One hundred and eight silorane resin composite blocks (Filtek LS) were fabricated and aged by thermocycling between 8 oC and 48 oC (5000 cycles). A control (solid resin composite) and four surface treatment groups (no treatment, acid treatment, aluminum oxide sandblasting and diamond bur abrasion) were tested. Each treatment group was randomly divided in half and repaired with either silorane resin composite (LS adhesive) or methacrylate <b>based</b> <b>resin</b> composite (Filtek Z 250 /Single Bond Plus). Specimens were 12 blocks and 108 beams per group. After 24 hours in 37 oC distilled water, microtensile bond strength testing was performed using a non-trimming technique. Fracture surfaces were examined using an optical microscopy (20 X) to determine failure mode. Data was analyzed using Weibull-distribution survival analysis. Results: Aluminum oxide sandblasting followed by silorane or methacrylate <b>based</b> <b>resin</b> composite and acid treatment with methacrylate <b>based</b> <b>resin</b> composite provided insignificant differences from the control (p> 0. 05). All other groups were significantly lower than the control. Failure was primarily adhesive in all groups. Conclusion: Aluminum oxide sandblasting produced comparable microtensile bond strength compared to the cohesive strength of silorane resin composite. After aluminum oxide sandblasting, aged silorane resin composite can be repaired with either silorane resin composite with LS system adhesive or methacrylate <b>based</b> <b>resin</b> composite with methacrylate based dentin adhesive...|$|R

PurposeThe {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the bonding characteristics of Triad VLP direct hard reline resin to heat-polymerized denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> subjected to long-term water immersion. Material and methodsNinety circular disks, 15 mm in diameter and 3 mm thick, of denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> were polymerized from a gypsum mold. Sixty specimens were subjected to water immersion and 30 were stored at ambient room temperature for 4 months. Thirty water-immersed specimens were dried with gauze (group 1), while the other 30 water-immersed specimens were dried with a hair dryer (group 2). The dry specimens (n= 30) represented the control group (group 3). All specimens were air abraded and painted with bonding agent before packing Triad VLP direct hard-reline resin. Specimens in each group were subjected to thermal cycling for 50, 000 cycles between 4 °C and 60 °C water baths with 1 -min dwell time at each temperature. The bond strength at which the bond failed under stress was recorded using a universal testing machine. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc comparison were applied to find significant differences between groups (α= 0. 05). ResultsSignificant differences in mean shear bond strength among the specimens existed because of variable water content in the denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> (P< 0. 05). Group 3 (dry) was higher than group 2 (desiccated), and the lowest was group 1 (saturated). ConclusionThe shear bond strength of Triad VLP direct hard reline <b>resin</b> to denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> depended on the water content in the denture <b>base</b> <b>resin.</b> The dry denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> demonstrated superior bond strength compared with the desiccated and water-saturated denture <b>base</b> <b>resins...</b>|$|R

Color, surface roughness, and hardness were measured for each sample before and after immersion procedure. Statistical Analysis: One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc honestly significant difference test were used to evaluate color, surface roughness, and hardness data before and after immersion in denture cleanser (α = 0. 05). Results: All denture <b>base</b> <b>resins</b> tested exhibited a change in color, surface roughness, and hardness to some degree in both denture cleansers. Polyamides resin immersed in sodium perborate showed a maximum change in color after immersion for 180 days. Conventional heat cure resin immersed in sodium hypochlorite showed a maximum change in surface roughness and conventional heat cure immersed in sodium perborate showed a maximum change in hardness.

For statistical analysis, two-way ANOVA and Tukey-HSD tests were performed. Results Addition of 0. 8 % and 1. 6 % AgNPs in microwave-polymerized resin significantly decreased the transverse strength and elastic modulus. In terms of impact strength, the addition of AgNPs has no effect on both resin groups.

In an attempt to quantifying the creep behaviour in polyester resin and cement grout, laboratory-testing procedures were developed. It wasdecided that two separate tests would provide the data needed to fulfil the scope and objectives.

Transverse strength of joints made and repaired with the VLC acrylic resin system gave favorable pre-repair strength and lower post-repair strength. Significant {{differences were found between}} the flexural properties of the denture <b>base</b> <b>resins</b> used before and after repair. Plain and fiber reinforced PMMA acrylic resin joints repaired with the VLC reline material, showed a reduction of transverse strength ranging from 48. 2 %- 56. 4 % of the original values. However, only 26. 1 % loss of strength was found for VLC denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> joints repaired with VLC reline material. This difference in strength reduction could be attributed to the poor adhesive bonding between the VLC reline material and the PMMA <b>resin</b> <b>base.</b> King Saud Universit...|$|R

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Triad visible light-polymerized (VLP) reline resin has the {{potential}} to repair denture <b>bases</b> from other <b>resin</b> systems with the elimination of flasking/deflasking procedures. PURPOSE: This study measured the tensile and shear bond strengths of Triad VLP, PMMA, and glass-fiber-reinforced PMMA (GF-PMMA) acrylic resins before and after repair with Triad VLP reline material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six specimens were fabricated from Triad VLP, PMMA, and GF-PMMA denture <b>base</b> <b>resins.</b> Both Triad VLP reline material and autopolymerizing acrylic resins were used to repair identical laboratory fabricated resin joints. Twenty-eight rectangular specimens (in 4 different groups of 7 each) were prepared to study the shear bond strength of Triad reline material used to repair different denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> joints. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P<. 0001) were found between the tensile strengths of specimens repaired with the Triad VLP reline resin used as a repair agent and those repaired with the autopolymerizing resin. The tensile strength of the Triad VLP denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> was found to be higher than that of both the PMMA and GF-PMMA acrylic resins. CONCLUSION: The low tensile and shear bond strengths found after the repair of PMMA and GF-PMMA acrylic resins with Triad VLP reline material were attributed to a lack of cohesion/adhesion between the Triad VLP reline material and the interfaces of the treated sites. The use of Triad VLP reline material to repair Triad VLP denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> produced the highest strengths. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Two {{series of}} low-melt {{viscosity}} imide resins (2 - 15 poise at 260 - 280 C) were formulated from either asymmetric oxydiphthalic anhydride (a-ODPA) or asymmetric biphenyl dianhydride (a- BPDA) with 4 -phenylethynyl endcap (PEPA), along with 3, 4 '-oxydianiline, 3, 4 - methylenedianiline, 3, 3 -methylenedianiline or 3, 3 -diaminobenzophenone, using a solvent-free melt process. These low-melt viscosity imide resins were fabricated into polyimide/T 650 - 35 carbon fabric composites by resin transfer molding (RTM). Composites from a-ODPA <b>based</b> <b>resins</b> display better open-hole compression strength and short beam shear strength from room temperature to 288 C {{than that of}} the corresponding a-BPDA <b>based</b> <b>resins.</b> However, due to the lower Tg s of a-ODPA <b>based</b> <b>resins</b> (265 - 330 C), their corresponding composites do not possess 315 C use capability while the a-BPDA based composites do.

40|$|Objectives. The {{development}} {{of different types}} of materials with application in dentistry is an area of intense growth and research, due to its importance in oral health. Among the different materials there are the acrylic <b>based</b> <b>resins</b> that have been extensively used either in restorations or in dentures. The objective of this manuscript was to review the acrylic <b>based</b> <b>resins</b> biodegradation phenomena. Specific attention was given to the causes and consequences of materials degradation under the oral environment. Data and sources. Information from scientific full papers, reviews or abstracts published from 1963 to datewere included in the review. Published materialwas searched in dental literature using general and specialist databases, like the PubMED database. Study selection. Published studies regarding the description of biodegradation mechanisms, in vitro and in vivo release experiments and cell based studies conducted on acrylic <b>based</b> <b>resins</b> or their components were evaluated. Studies related to the effect of biodegradation on the physical and mechanical properties of the materials were also analyzed. Conclusions. Different factors such as saliva characteristics, chewing or thermal and chemical dietary changes may be responsible for the biodegradation of acrylic <b>based</b> <b>resins.</b> Release of potential toxic compounds from the material and change on their physical and mechanical properties are the major consequences of biodegradation. Increasing concern arises from potential toxic effects of biodegradation products under clinical application thus justifying an intensive research in this area...|$|R

40|$|Limited {{freshwater}} {{resources and}} expected increases in water demand are causing electric utilities to explore more non-traditional water sources, such as produced water from CO 2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR), coal-bed methane recovery, and mining operations. Electric utilities, including coal-fired power plants, are {{the second largest}} users of freshwater in the United States. Produced water from EOR is variable in composition; it is dominated by high total dissolved solids composed mainly of sodium and chloride ions, {{on the order of}} 100, 000 mg/L, and also high sulfate concentrations (up to 900 mg/L). Dissolved sulfate can cause stress corrosion cracking in steam turbine blades at concentrations as low as 8 mg/L. A certain level of treatment must be done before reuse in power plants is a viable option. This study focuses on sulfate removal from synthetic produced water and produced water from EOR and mining operations in the Illinois Basin using anion exchange resins. Equilibrium batch studies were conducted to compare commercially available strong base and weak <b>base</b> anion exchange <b>resins</b> of different type. Our results indicate that for optimal sulfate removal in high chloride solutions, (i.) weak <b>base</b> <b>resins</b> perform better than strong <b>base</b> <b>resins,</b> (ii.) resins with an epoxy polyamine matrix perform better than those with a divinylbenzene matrix, and (iii.) resins with secondary/tertiary amines perform better than those with pyridine functionality, and even better than those with quaternary ammonium. Reasons for better performance among resins include more closely spaced anion exchange sites and less steric hindrance. Sorption isotherms showed that weak <b>base</b> <b>resins,</b> pretreated with hydrochloric acid, significantly outperformed strong <b>base</b> <b>resins,</b> which had negligible sulfate removal at typical resin loadings. Resin titration curves coupled with experimental data were used to identify optimal pretreatment conditions for the weak <b>base</b> <b>resins</b> studied. Our results suggest that sulfate removal significantly decreases above 10, 000 mg/L chloride, and that more moles of sulfate can be removed at high chloride concentrations when the chloride:sulfate ratio is lower. Sulfate removal was challenging for produced water from EOR and mining operations, with 576 and 918 mg/L sulfate, and 87, 364 and 13, 009 mg/L chloride, respectively. Measured sulfate removals were 8 and 70 %, respectively. For practical use, weak <b>base</b> <b>resins</b> were able to be regenerated and their large retardation values allow for reasonable reactor dimensions...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: This {{study was}} {{formulated}} {{to evaluate and}} estimate the influence of various denture <b>base</b> <b>resin</b> surface pre-treatments (chemical and mechanical and combinations) upon tensile bond strength between a poly vinyl acetate-based denture liner and a denture <b>base</b> <b>resin.</b> Materials and Methods: A universal testing machine was used for determining the bond strength of the liner to surface pre-treated acrylic resin blocks. The data was analyzed by {{one-way analysis of variance}} and the t-test (α =. 05). Results: This study infers that denture base surface pre-treatment can improve the adhesive tensile bond strength between the liner and denture base specimens. The results of this study infer that chemical, mechanical, and mechano-chemical pre-treatments will have different effects on the bond strength of the acrylic soft resilient liner to the denture base. Conclusion: Among the various methods of pre-treatment of denture <b>base</b> <b>resins,</b> it was inferred that the mechano-chemical pre-treatment method with air-borne particle abrasion followed by monomer application exhibited superior bond strength than other methods with the resilient liner. Hence, this method could be effectively used to improve bond strength between liner and denture base and thus could minimize delamination of liner from the denture base during function...|$|R
