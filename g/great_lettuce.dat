50|$|Lactuca virosa is a {{plant in}} the Lactuca (lettuce) genus, {{ingested}} often for its mild analgesic and sedative effects which {{are similar to those}} of ibuprofen. It is related to common lettuce (L. sativa), and is often called wild lettuce, bitter lettuce, laitue vireuse, opium lettuce, poisonous lettuce, tall lettuce, <b>great</b> <b>lettuce</b> or rakutu-karyumu-so.|$|E
50|$|Lactuca saligna is {{an annual}} herb growing from a taproot to heights between one half and one meter (20-40 inches), and {{occasionally}} taller. It is much slenderer than <b>great</b> <b>lettuce</b> Lactuca virosa and prickly lettuce Lactuca serriola. The spindly, mainly erect stem has bristles on its lower portion. The leaves are {{very long and}} narrow, up to 15 cm (6 inches) long but rarely than one centimeter (0.4 inches) wide, usually with no lobes and no teeth. The top part of the stem is occupied by a narrow inflorescence. The branches may be pressed against the main stem, that is, or they may branch outward. The flower head is up to about 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) wide when open, with rectangular pale yellow ray florets with toothed tips. There are no disc florets. The fruit is a spiny-ribbed dark brown achene (or cypsela) almost a centimeter (0.4 inches) long with a long white pappus.|$|E
50|$|Palencia {{also offers}} a <b>great</b> {{assortment}} of <b>lettuces,</b> leeks, wild mushrooms, peppers, asparagus, endives and beans. Some legumes, like white beans and lentils are particularly good and cooked in hot dishes with chorizo.|$|R
40|$|It was {{proposed}} {{to evaluate the}} hydroponic lettuce production, variety "Vera", on inclined benches with channels of 100 mm, and Nutrient Film Technique, as answer to carbon dioxide application and evaporative cooling. There were five cycles of cultivation from March, 20 th to April, 17 th (C 1); from May, 25 th to June, 29 th (C 2); from July, 13 th to August, 20 th (C 3); from August, 27 th to October, 10 th (C 4); from December, 12 th to January, 10 th (C 5). In three greenhouses were tested the following systems: (A 1) without evaporative cooling air CO 2 aerial injection, (A 2) with CO 2 aerial injection and without evaporative cooling and (A 3) with CO 2 aerial injection and pad-fan evaporative cooling system. The fresh and dry mass of leaves in grams, number of leaves and leaf area in square millimeter were evaluated. The completely randomized statistical analysis was used. The cycle C 1 were used 48 replications, for cycles C 2, C 3 and C 5 were used 64 replications and C 5 were used 24 replications. The results showed that greenhouse with evaporative cooling system and CO 2 allow better development and <b>greater</b> <b>lettuce</b> yield. It was possible {{to conclude that the}} aerial injection of CO 2, in the absence of evaporative cooling system, did not lead increasing the lettuce productivity to most cycles.

40|$|Lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa L. var. Ithaca) were transplanted on {{different}} beige and black paper mulches {{and on a}} coextruded white/black polyethylene mulch in organic soil in 1997 and 1998. Non-weeded and weeded control plots were also used. Plant mortality in 1997 for plants grown on bare soil was 10 to 15 % {{greater than that of}} mulched plants. Head weight was found to be 3. 6 times (1997) and 12 times (1998) <b>greater</b> for <b>lettuce</b> grown on mulch compared with a weeded control. The transmission, reflection and absorption of light of the white/black polyethylene mulch and black paper mulch remained stable {{over the course of the}} experiment while those of the other papers changed over time. Paper mulch decomposition occurred during the experiment. Although, black paper mulch was the only mulch that gave complete control of weed growth, weed populations present under the beige papers were too small in terms of the size and number of weeds to cause lettuce yield reduction...|$|R
30|$|Date-palm waste {{properties}} {{seem to be}} enhancer {{factors for}} their use as growing medium especially when blended with other substrates. This fact was in accordance with Ghehsareh et al. (2011) and Soltani and Naderi (2016) who found that physiochemical properties of growing media affected the seedling growth. Results of Flynn et al. (1995) on lettuce plants demonstrated that the <b>greatest</b> <b>lettuce</b> biomass yields were from broiler litter composted with peanut hulls mixed with Promix (commercial substrate with {{a high proportion of}} peat moss) at a ratio of 3 : 1 compost: promix and they supposed that it may have been affected by pH of the materials. The results obtained by Ceglie et al. (2015) revealed that green waste compost (GC) and palm fibre trunk (PF) waste-derived substrates were suitable for their use in peat (SP) substitution. Using a mixture design, authors have reported that a substrate formulation with 20 % GC, 39 % PF and 31 % SP offers the best lettuce, tomato and melon plantlets growth in nursery stage. This formulation includes a high amount of palm fibre waste which confirms our results about date-palm wastes effectiveness in peat substitution. This effectiveness was reported by different authors, such as Ghehsareh (2013), in a study using different mixtures of date-palm wastes and rice hull. He observed that the highest cucumber yield in greenhouse culture and plant height was related to palm waste. To evaluate the possibility of replacing Coco peat as cultivation substrate with date-palm wastes (with different particular size), a study was conducted by Rostami et al. (2014), which indicates that the highest growth and yield of strawberry production belonged to date-palm culture media with 0 – 5  mm particular size. Rahbarian and Sardoei (2014) evaluated the substrate effect on the herb Padanus Spp. Some growth indices were greatest on 50 % peat palm[*]+[*] 25 % sand[*]+[*] 25 % perlite and 100 % peat palm substrates, respectively. They reported that palm peat substrates perform as well as peat moss for most plant growth which proves that palm peat can serve as an alternative media for peat.|$|R
40|$|Silverleaf {{whitefly}} (SLW), Bemisia argentifolii, Bellows and Perring, preferred cantaloupe to cotton, {{broccoli and}} lettuce in field and greenhouse studies. In {{the absence of}} cantaloupe, SLW preferred cotton to broccoli and lettuce. In the field, more eggs and fewer nymphs were found on broccoli than on cotton. Differences in the relative abundance of vascular bundles per unit of leaf area between the four plant species may partly account for differences in oviposition site selection. Vascular bundle volume/unit of leaf tissue volume was 50 % greater in cantaloupe than in cotton and broccoli, which in turn were significantly <b>greater</b> than in <b>lettuce.</b> Most SLW on cotton leaves are found on underside leaf surfaces. Distances from top and underside leaf surfaces to the nearest vascular bundles in cotton leaves were 131 and 60 tun, respectively, in the present studies...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the {{empirical}} results of marketing margins and price transmission of some agricultural products in trade fairs {{in the state of}} Alagoas, Brazil. Two agricultural products were used in this study: the curly lettuce and cassava (mandioca). These were sought to differentiate the marketing in various trade fairs in different regions, dividing these into the capital (Maceió and Rio Largo) and interior (Pão de Açúcar and União dos Palmares). The model shows that with the price transmission of the two products tested there is greater difficulty in passing on the producer price for retailers in the capital over the interior. Probably, this indicates that the shorter marketing channel within any influence on this result, for then there is the largest producer of direct participation in the process of formation of the final product price. Moreover, the <b>greater</b> perishability of <b>lettuce</b> influences the results significantly. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In pot experiments, {{in spring}} 2006 and 2007, a {{comparison}} was {{made between the}} chelated and the mineral forms of copper on the yielding of lettuce and {{on the content of}} Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe in lettuce leaves. Plants were grown in peat substrate supplemented with Cu doses of 5, 25, 50 and 75 mgdm- 3. A <b>greater</b> mass of <b>lettuce</b> heads was obtained af-ter the application of the mineral form of copper. In the range of doses: 5 – 50 mg Cudm- 3, the mean yields of lettuce did not differ. In the second year of studies, the application of copper chelates in the dose of 75 mgdm- 3 caused a high reduction of yield. The mean copper content in lettuce, after the application of the chelated Cu form, was twice higher than after the use of the mineral Cu form. Iron content in lettuce after the application of copper chelates was higher than after the use of copper sulphate, while the contents of zinc and manganese were smaller.

5000|$|Additionally, other {{research}} also observed Crotalaria juncea’s potential in {{being used as}} an organic compost. Researchers in Brazil looked into the best composition of organic compost using various combinations of Crotalaria juncea and Napier grass. [...] The objective was to find the mixture between Crotalaria juncea and Napier grass that would yield the highest vegetable seedling production. More specifically, the vegetable seedling production of lettuce, beetroot, and tomatoes was measured by observing the shoot height, fresh mass production in shoots and dry matter, and leaf number. [...] The various compounds that were observed include, 100% Crotalaria juncea, 66% Crotalaria juncea with 33% Napier, 33% Crotalaria juncea with 66% Napier, 100% of Napier, 33% Crotalaria juncea with 66% Napier where 5% of the mass is cattle manure, Crotalaria juncea 33% with 66% Napier which includes 100 liters of 5% dilute Agrobio (biofertilizer), and finally, 100% Napier which also includes 100 liters of 5% dilute Abrobio. [...] The compost with 66% Crotalaria juncea and 33% Napier grass was superior to other combinations since this particular combination yielded the <b>greatest</b> production of <b>lettuce,</b> beet, and tomato seedlings.|$|R
60|$|Three {{plants of}} <b>Lettuce</b> (<b>Great</b> London Cos var.) grew close {{together}} in my garden; one {{was covered by}} a net, and produced self-fertilised seeds, {{the other two were}} allowed to be naturally crossed by insects; but the season (1867) was unfavourable, and I did not obtain many seeds. Only one crossed and one self-fertilised plant were raised in Pot 1, and their measurements are given in Table 5/66. The flowers on this one self-fertilised plant were again self-fertilised under a net, not with pollen from the same floret, but from other florets on the same head. The flowers on the two crossed plants were left to be crossed by insects, but the process was aided by some pollen being occasionally transported by me from plant to plant. These two lots of seeds, after germinating on sand, were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of Pots 2 and 3, which were at first kept in the greenhouse and then turned out of doors. The plants were measured when in full flower. Table 5/66, therefore, includes plants belonging to two generations. When the seedlings of the two lots were only 5 or 6 inches in height they were equal. In Pot 3 one of the self-fertilised plants died before flowering, as has occurred in so many other cases.|$|R
40|$|Plant {{growth in}} a {{controlled}} ecological life support system may entail the build-up over extended time periods of phytotoxic concentrations of volatile organic compounds produced by the plants themselves. Ethylene is a prominent gaseous emission of plants, and {{is the focus of}} this report. The objective was to determine the rate of ethylene release by spring wheat, white potato, and lettuce during early, middle, and late growth stages, and during both the light and dark segments of the diurnal cycle. Plants grown hydroponically using the nutrient film technique were covered with plexiglass containers for 4 to 6 h. At intervals after enclosure, gas samples were withdrawn with a syringe and analyzed for ethylene with a gas chromatograph. Lettuce produced 10 to 100 times more ethylene than wheat or potato, with production rates ranging from 141 to 158 ng g-dry/wt/h. Wheat produced from 1. 7 to 14. 3 ng g-dry/wt/h, with senescent wheat producing the least amount and flowering wheat the most. Potatoes produced the least amount of ethylene, with values never exceeding 5 ng g-dry/wt/h. Lettuce and potatoes each produced ethylene at similar rates whether in dark period or light period. Ethylene sequestering of 33 to 43 percent by the plexiglass enclosures indicated that these production estimates may be low by one-third to one-half. These results suggest that concern for ethylene build-up in a contained atmosphere should be <b>greatest</b> when growing <b>lettuce,</b> and less when growing wheat or potato...|$|R
40|$|Jiroft area, with {{upwards of}} 1250 ha of {{greenhouses}} and 250000 ton of yield, {{is one of}} the most important areas for production and supply of greenhouse products in Iran. Lettuce {{is one of the}} salad vegetable crops that is planted in vast areas in open space and greenhouse conditions. In this study, <b>Great</b> Lakes 118 <b>lettuce</b> variety was planted in a split-plot experiment with factorial design, eight treatments and three frequencies. The studied treatments were planting condition at two levels of greenhouse and open space, planting dates in Oct. 7 and Oct. 22, and 3 and 4 cultivation frequencies in greenhouse and 1 and 2 frequencies in open space. Lettuce plantings were pre-planted in nursery and were transferred after four-leaf process (20 - 25 days). Planting rows were provided with 6 m length, 70 cm width and 30 cm distance from each other. Shrubs were planted in greenhouse and open space with 8 - 10 cm distance from the border, 2 rows and 25 cm distance in every plot. Measured factors were: plot yield, total yield per unit area, average head weight and the amount of nitrate accumulation in leaves. On the base of results, total yield of product in greenhouse and open space was 167. 9 t/ha and 41. 22 t/ha, respectively. Economic analysis showed that the investment in treatment Oct. 22 with four frequencies under greenhouse condition was superior to others and the gross profit of lettuce production in greenhouse condition was more than some other crops...|$|R

In addition to the test food or MnCl 2, each meal consisted of vegetable oil (5 g), salt (NaCl, 0. 15 g) and crackers (10 g), which provided 0. 55 nmol Mn. There were no differences in percentage of Mn absorption or biological half-life of MMn for any of the intrinsically/extrinsically labeled food pairs. Absorption of MMn from MnCI 2 (8. 90 %) was <b>greater</b> than from <b>lettuce</b> (5. 20 %), spinach (3. 81 %), wheat (2. 16 %) or sunflower seeds (1. 71 %), but the biological half-life did not vary with the source of Mn.

40|$|Lettuce is a cool-seasoned vegetable, {{which is}} very fragile and should {{therefore}} be handled with <b>great</b> care. Processed <b>lettuce</b> (loose leaves and shredded lettuce), is more prone to handling damage than intact lettuce crisp heads. Lettuce produces very little ethylene (less than 0, 1 ul/kg- 1 /h- 1), but is extremely sensitive to damage from ethylene. In lettuce, ethylene induces a postharvest physiological disorder known as russet spotting. Due to its climacteric nature, lettuce is very sensitive to ethylene. Ethylene sets in motion a programmed {{series of events that}} accelerates senescence in lettuce. Besides causing russet spotting, ethylene also stimulates cell membrane and cell wall damage. In wounded (lightly processed) tissue ethylene production increases, resulting in increased russet spotting and accelerated senescence. Reactive oxygen species are likely role-players involved in membrane damage. Hydrogen peroxide is the primary mediator in membrane degradation; hydrogen peroxide levels remained constantly high during storage. Plant free radical scavengers, such as ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase protect membranes from damage by free oxygen radicals. The activities of ascorbate peroxidase and catalase was determined during storage and was found not to increase during senescence. Applying different postharvest treatments such as controlled atmospheric storage, 1 -MCP, and short heat-shocks to iceberg lettuce significantly suppressed the negative effects of ethylene. These treatments were effective in suppressing russet spotting and senescence as indicated by reduction in moisture loss and ion leakage. Treatment with electro-activated water, did not affect ethylene sensitivity, but did limit moisture loss by lowering the rate of transpiration by increasing stomatal resistance, thus contributing to the retention of crispness and improved longevity.

40|$|The plant {{pathogen}} Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can cause serious losses on lettuce crops worldwide {{and as for}} most other susceptible crops, control relies on the application of fungicides, which target airborne ascospores. However, the efficacy of this approach depends on accurate timing of these sprays, which could be improved by {{an understanding of the}} environmental conditions that are conducive to infection. A mathematical model for S. sclerotiorum infection and disease development on lettuce is presented here for the first time, based on quantifying the effects of temperature, relative humidity (RH) and ascospore density in multiple controlled environment experiments. It was observed that disease can develop on lettuce plants inoculated with dry ascospores in the absence of apparent leaf wetness (required for spore germination). To explain this, the model conceptualises an infection court area containing microsites (in leaf axils and close to the stem base) where conditions are conducive to infection, the size of which is modified by ambient RH. The model indicated that minimum, maximum and optimum temperatures for ascospore germination were 0. 0, 29. 9 and 21. 7 °C respectively and that maximum rates of disease development occurred at spore densities > 87 spores cm- 2. Disease development was much more rapid at 80 - 100 % RH at 20 °C, compared to 50 - 70 % RH and resulted in a <b>greater</b> proportion of <b>lettuce</b> plants infected. Disease development was also more rapid at 15 - 27 °C compared to 5 - 10 °C (85 % RH). The model was validated by a further series of independent controlled environment experiments where both RH and temperature were varied and generally simulated the pattern of disease development well. The implications of the results in terms of Sclerotinia disease forecasting are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} rust (Puccinia lagenophorae) on {{competition}} between groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.) and lettuce were investigated. In small tubs in a glasshouse environment, rust infection reduced the dry weight yield of groundsel both in monocultures and mixtures with lettuce at total densities from 35 to c. 1100 plants m- 2. While rust {{did not affect}} the relative mixture response of groundsel it resulted in a significant decrease in the relative mixture response of lettuce. Indeed, the yield-density relationship of lettuce in mixture with rusted groundsel was not significantly different from that of lettuce in monoculture. At 1120 groundsel plants m- 2, lettuce yield in mixture with uninoculated groundsel was inhibited by c. 50 % when the ratio of lettuce: groundsel (L:G) was 1 : 3. By contrast, in mixture with rusted groundsel, lettuce yield per tub was not changed by varying L:G, eight lettuce with 24 groundsel yielding no less than 32 in monoculture. Although the severity of rust did not appear to differ, infection inhibited groundsel yield and modified competitive interactions only when L:G was low. In a field experiment the fresh weight yield of lettuce was significantly inhibited by interference from uninoculated groundsel at all sowing densities from 250 to 65 000 seed m- 2. Conversely, lettuce yield was not significantly reduced by rust-infected groundsel until weed density exceeded c. 4000 m- 2. Even at <b>greater</b> sowing densities, <b>lettuce</b> yield in plots with rusted groundsel was two to three limes greater than in plots with uninoculated groundsel. Inoculation with rust reduced the impact of groundsel upon lettuce yield without causing any significant increase in groundsel mortality. The effects of rust were consistent in both glasshouse and field and were attributed to the decreased competitive ability of infected groundsel plants, especially at high density. The implications of the results for the use of rusts in biocontrol are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out into the {{allelopathic}} potential of the invasive alien annual Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera Royle) using a series of bioassays, including ones developed or adapted for this study. They were evaluated for their suitability to detect {{three of the four}} main modes of allelochemical release, namely leaching, exudation and decomposition. Assays which involved the measurement of lettuce radicles and hypocotyls gave reliable results and allowed a range of different Impatiens material, both living and dead, to be assessed and ranked according to the allelopathic effects demonstrated. Attempts were made to isolate resource competition from allelopathy using separately grown but connected donor and receiver plants and a density dependent design where single I. glandulifera plants were grown in pots with variable numbers of receiver plants. Results proved inconclusive. Initial experiments showed that the allelopathic potential of I. glandulifera varied according to the organ from which the material was derived. Pods, leaves and stems produced the <b>greatest</b> inhibition of <b>lettuce</b> seedlings. Effects on germination were not significant at most of the concentrations tested. Live roots of I. glandulifera plants produced pronounced orange staining of the agar into which they were placed and showed clear evidence of distance dependent inhibition of lettuce radicles. Effects were limited to growth rather than germination of the test plants. Germinating I. glandulifera seeds caused a significant inhibition of lettuce radicle elongation when the two species were grown together in an agar medium. The inhibitory effects increased significantly with increasing exposure time. Increasing I. glandulifera seedling number also produced significant reductions in lettuce radicle length. Dormant seeds, by contrast, stimulated growth. Dead seeds did not produce significant changes to the growth of the test plants. When rhizosphere soil was gathered from pot grown I. glandulifera plants, the results were mixed. Initial samples inhibited growth, whereas those collected from dying plants over a period of weeks stimulated growth. Further experimentation is required before the indications of allelopathic interactions demonstrated here {{can be applied to the}} behaviour of wild populations of I. glandulifera.

No experimento em laboratório, dezoito amostras indeformadas de solo foram acopladas em permeâmetro de carga constante e receberam lâmina de irrigação referente a cinco ciclos de cultivo de alface, 0, 58, 1, 16, 1, 74, 2, 32 e 2, 9 L de água para cada ciclo. As amostras foram divididas em cinco grupos que receberam água de reúso e um grupo controle, que recebeu água destilada. Amostras de solo foram coletadas para determinar a granulometria, condutividade hidráulica saturada (ksat), porcentagem de sódio trocável (PST) e fertilidade do solo. Amostras da água de reúso e água destilada lixiviadas foram coletadas para determinar a condutividade elétrica, razão de adsorção de sódio (RAS), turbidez, pH, sódio, potássio, magnésio, fósforo, cálcio e nitrato. Em casa de vegetação, dois ciclos de alface "Elisa" foram cultivados com dois tratamentos (água de reúso e de abastecimento) com quatro repetições. Após a colheita, amostras de solo foram coletadas para determinar a granulometria, densidade, ksat, fertilidade do solo, coliformes totais, Escherichia coli e heterotróficos. Nas alfaces colhidas foram determinados os coliformes totais, Escherichia coli e análise química do tecido vegetal. Em laboratório, houve aumento da PST e teor de fósforo e sódio no solo após aplicação das lâminas de irrigação. Não houve diferença significativa nas propriedades físicas do solo, turbidez e RAS. Na casa de vegetação, não houve diferença significativa entre os tratamentos na absorção de nutrientes pelas alfaces cultivadas, porém, a massa das alfaces irrigadas com água de reúso foi 100 % maior que a das alfaces irrigadas com água de abastecimento no segundo ciclo. Não foi detectada presença de Escherichia coli nas alfaces cultivadas, mas houve concentração de coliformes totais, o que representa risco de contaminação ao consumidor. A irrigação com água de reúso aumentou o teor de nutrientes no solo e a RAS indicou risco de salinização. A água de reúso não causou alterações nas propriedades físicas do solo.

The soil samples were distributed in five groups that received treated wastewater and one control group that received distilled water. Soil samples were collected to analyze the granulometry, saturated hydraulic conductivity (ksat), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and soil fertility. Treated wastewater and distilled water leached samples were collected to analyze the electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), turbidity, pH, sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium and nitrate. In a greenhouse, two cycles of Elisa lettuce were cultivated with two treatments (treated wastewater and supply water) with four repetitions. After the harvest of the lettuce, soil samples were collected to analyze granulometry, density, ksat, and soil fertility, total coliforms, Escherichia coli and heterotrophic. The harvested lettuces were analyzed for total coliforms, Escherichia coli and chemical analysis of plant tissue. In laboratory, there was an increase of ESP and the concentration of phosphorus and sodium on soil after the application of the water sheet.
