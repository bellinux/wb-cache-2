Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a <b>genetic</b> <b>control</b> method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E

While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under <b>genetic</b> <b>control,</b> some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{genotype}} x environment interactions impede breeding {{progress for}} yield. Identifying <b>genetic</b> <b>controls</b> associated with yield response is confounded by poor genetic correlations across testing environments. Part {{of this problem}} is related to our inability {{to account for the}} interplay of <b>genetic</b> <b>controls,</b> physiological traits, and environmental conditions throughout the crop cycle. Here we outline several approaches based on modelling to bridge this predictability gap. First, crop models incorporating physiological understanding of traits were used to scale-up known effects of ‘simple’ traits from organ to crop level. Breaking down yield into simpler traits allows identification of more stable <b>genetic</b> <b>controls.</b> Modelling can help estimate the impact of those <b>genetic</b> <b>controls</b> and the associated genotype x environment interactions on yield. Second, models were used to quantify abiotic-stress timing and intensity that crops experience during their life cycle. Such environment characterisation helps to interpret genotype x environment interactions in multi-environment trials. Third, biophysical and plant breeding models were combined to explore efficiencies in breeding programs. Simulations were conducted to examine rates of genetic gain associated with different strategies (e. g. which cross to perform, multi-environment testing). Case studies will be presented to illustrate these different approaches and their value for crop improvement...|$|R

5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the <b>genetic</b> <b>control</b> of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E

25|$|Hemozoin {{formation}} {{is an excellent}} drug target, since {{it is a process}} that is essential to the survival of the malaria parasite and absent from the human host. The drug target hematin is host-derived and largely outside the <b>genetic</b> <b>control</b> of the parasite, which makes the development of drug resistance more difficult. Many clinically used drugs are thought to act by inhibiting the formation of hemozoin in the food vacuole.

25|$|In general, {{hematocrit}} is {{the number}} of red blood cells (RBC) in circulation and is highly variable among fish species. Active fish, like the blue marlin, tend to have higher hematocrits, whereas less active fish, such as the starry flounder exhibit lower hematocrits. Hematocrit may be increased in response to both short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) hypoxia exposure and results in an increase in the total amount of oxygen the blood can carry, also known as the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Acute changes in hematocrit are the result of circulating stress hormones (see - catecholamines) activating receptors on the spleen that cause the release of RBCs into circulation. During chronic hypoxia exposure, the mechanism used to increase hematocrit is independent of the spleen and results from hormonal stimulation of the kidney by erythropoetin (EPO). Increasing hematocrit in response to erythropoietin is observed after approximately one week and is therefore likely under <b>genetic</b> <b>control</b> of hypoxia inducible factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF).|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of transferring silica {{absorbed by the}} diatom to the cell wall is unknown, though research is still being undertaken. Much of the sequencing of diatom genes comes from {{the search for the}} {{mechanism of}} silica uptake and deposition in nano-scale patterns in the frustule. The most success in this area has come from two species, Thalassiosira pseudonana, which has become the model species, as the whole genome was sequenced and methods for <b>genetic</b> <b>control</b> were established, and Cylindrotheca fusiformis, in which the important silica deposition proteins silaffins were first discovered. Silaffins, sets of polycationic peptides, were found in C. fusiformis cell walls and can generate intricate silica structures. These structures demonstrated pores of sizes characteristic to diatom patterns1. When T. pseudonana underwent genome analysis it was found that it encoded a urea cycle, including a higher number of polyamines than most genomes, as well as three distinct silica transport genes. In a phylogenetic study on silica transport genes from 8 diverse groups of diatoms, silica transport was found to generally group with species. This study also found structural differences between the silica transporters of pennate (bilateral symmetry) and centric (radial symmetry) diatoms. The sequences compared in this study were used to create a diverse background in order to identify residues that differentiate function in the silica deposition process. Additionally, the same study found that a number of the regions were conserved within species, likely the base structure of silica transport.|$|E

McGue et al. discuss the use of twins discordant for exposure, which is a variant of the cotwin control method.

Davey Smith discusses a method called Mendelian randomization that uses DNA to draw causal inferences without the need for experimental intervention.

Keller's thesis was that McClintock was long ignored or met with derision because she was a woman working in the sciences. For example, when McClintock presented her findings that the genetics of maize did not conform to Mendelian distributions, geneticist Sewall Wright expressed the belief that she did not understand the underlying mathematics of her work, a belief he had expressed towards other women at the time. In addition, geneticist Lotte Auerbach recounted that Joshua Lederberg returned from a visit to McClintock's lab with the remark: 'By God, that woman is either crazy or a genius.'

2500|$|These silica {{transport}} proteins {{are unique}} to diatoms, with no homologs found in other species, such as sponges or rice. The divergence of these silica transport genes is also indicative {{of the structure of}} the protein evolving from two repeated units composed of five membrane bound segments, which indicates either gene duplication or dimerization. The silica deposition that takes place from the membrane bound vesicle in diatoms has been hypothesized to be a result of the activity of silaffins and long chain polyamines. [...] This Silica Deposition Vesicle (SDV) has been characterized as an acidic compartment fused with Golgi-derived vesicles. These two protein structures have been shown to create sheets of patterned silica in-vivo with irregular pores on the scale of diatom frustules. One hypothesis as to how these proteins work to create complex structure is that residues are conserved within the SDV’s, which is unfortunately difficult to identify or observe due to the limited number of diverse sequences available. Though the exact mechanism of the highly uniform deposition of silica is as yet unknown, the Thalassiosira pseudonana genes linked to silaffins are being looked to as targets for <b>genetic</b> <b>control</b> of nanoscale silica deposition.|$|E

Although two genetic loci {{have been shown to}} be linked to histocompatibility regions of the mouse genome (12, 14, 15), little is known concerning the genetic mechanisms responsible for the control of immunity.

In fact, responses of mice to synthetic polypeptides based on mulfichain polyalanine and responses of guinea pigs to poly-L-lysine have been achieved by the injection of responder lymphoid cells into irradiated nonresponder animals (1, 14).

40|$|Hematopoiesis is {{a dynamic}} process where {{initiation}} and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells, {{as well as their}} differentiation into erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid lineages, are tightly regulated by a network of transcription factors. Understanding the <b>genetic</b> <b>controls</b> of hematopoiesis is crucial as perturbations in hematopoiesis lead to diseases such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, or cancers, including leukemias and lymphomas. Animal models, particularly conventional and conditional knockout mice, have played major roles in our understanding of the <b>genetic</b> <b>controls</b> of hematopoiesis. However, knockout mice for most of the hematopoietic transcription factors are embryonic lethal, thus precluding the analysis of their roles during the transition from embryonic to adult hematopoiesis. Zebrafish are an ideal model organism to determine the function of a gene during embryonic-to-adult transition of hematopoiesis since bloodless zebrafish embryos can develop normally into early larval stage by obtaining oxygen through diffusion.
