40|$|The Liver {{performs}} {{several important}} {{tasks that are}} essential for survival. However, liver cancer, the third {{most common type of}} cancer, affects these functions significantly. Different treatment options are available, but a surgical resection, if possible, offers the best prognosis for the patient. Thus, the decision, whether a surgical resection is feasible, is important and must be taken with care in a pre-interventional planning stage. Modern volumetric imaging techniques such as CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are utilized to decide which treatment is best for the patient and to plan the intervention. However, the amount of anatomical details visible in the acquired volumes is steadily increasing. This comes along with an increasing amount of data per patient. Manual examination is time consuming and prone to errors. As a matter of fact, several software systems were proposed to support the surgeon during the planning phase. The extraction of blood vessels {{plays an important role in}} these applications. The segmentation of vessels is a challenging problem that has to deal with acquisition-dependent problems such as noise, contrast, spatial resolution, and artifacts. Furthermore, blood vessel specific characteristics like high variability of size and curvature result in additional difficulties for segmentation algorithms. The liver, in particular, exhibits another challenge to vessel segmentation algorithms. Its supply and <b>drain</b> <b>vessel</b> systems are densely distributed within the liver, and because of partial volume effects and motion artifacts, they seem to be connected at some points. The focus of the present thesis is the robust extraction of hepatic veins in multiphase CT volumes. Therefore, an image processing pipeline is presented that covers vessel enhancement, vessel segmentation, graph creation and tree reconstruction. The pipeline was used to develop an application for interventional planning. It allows for the simulation of intraoperative hepatic vein clamping for (sub-) segment oriented liver resections and the execution of risk analysis to judge surgical risk during an atypical resection. Furthermore, results of the present thesis were also successfully used in an application for intraoperative navigation to extract liver vessels in 3 D ultrasound data and matching of anatomical vessel trees and graphs of the liver for registration of 3 D volumes...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral {{arteriovenous}} malformations (AVMs) are {{a type of}} vascular anomaly {{consisting of}} large intertwined vascular growth (the nidus) that are prone to serious hemorrhaging and can result in patient death if left untreated. Intervention through surgical clipping of feeding and <b>draining</b> <b>vessels</b> to the nidus is a common treatment. However, identification of which vessels to clip is challenging even to experienced surgeons aided by conventional image guidance systems. In this work, we describe our methods for processing static preoperative angiographic images in order to effectively visualize the feeding and <b>draining</b> <b>vessels</b> of an AVM nidus. Maps from level-set front propagation processing of the vessel images are used to label the vessels by colour. Furthermore, images are decluttered using the topological distances between vessels. In order to aid the surgeon in the vessel clipping decision-making process during surgery, the results are displayed to the surgeon using augmented virtuality. 1...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the outcomes of conbercept therapy between two different angiographic subtypes of PCV. Methods: Fifty-eight patients of PCV were classified into two phenotypes according to indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). In Type 1, both feeder and <b>draining</b> <b>vessels</b> are visible on ICGA and network vessels are numerous. In Type 2, neither feeder nor <b>draining</b> <b>vessels</b> are detectable, and the number of network vessels is small. The patients were treated with intravitreal conbercept (IVC) for 3 months. Additional IVC was given at subsequent monthly visits, if needed. The patients were followed up for 12 months, and changes in mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT), subretinal fluid (SRF) thickness, pigmented epithelial detachment (PED), hemorrhage, and number of polypoidal lesions were evaluated. Results: The mean BCVA in Type 2 PCV (15. 92 ± 9. 76 letters) achieved a significantly greater improvement than that in the Type 1 (14. 10 ± 9. 07 letters) at month 12 (t = 2. 37, P 0. 05).

40|$|The role of {{the cardiac}} lymphatic system has been {{recently}} appreciated since lymphatic disturbances take part in various heart pathologies. This review presents the current knowledge about normal anatomy and structure of lymphatics and their prenatal development for {{a better understanding of}} the proper functioning of this system in relation to coronary circulation. Lymphatics of the heart consist of terminal capillaries of various diameters, capillary plexuses that drain continuously subendocardial, myocardial, and subepicardial areas, and <b>draining</b> (collecting) <b>vessels</b> that lead the lymph out of the heart. There are interspecies differences in the distribution of lymphatic capillaries, especially near the valves, as well as differences in the routes and number of <b>draining</b> <b>vessels.</b> In some species, subendocardial areas contain fewer lymphatic capillaries as compared to subepicardial parts of the heart.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to establish optimal perfusion conditions for high-resolution postmortem angiography that would permit dynamic visualization of the arterial and venous systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cadavers of two dogs and one cat were perfused with diesel oil through a peristaltic pump. The lipophilic contrast agent Lipiodol Ultra Fluide was then injected, and angiography was performed. The efficiency of perfusion was evaluated in the chick chorioallantoic membrane. RESULTS: Vessels could be seen up {{to the level of}} the smaller supplying and <b>draining</b> <b>vessels.</b> Hence, both the arterial and the venous sides of the vascular system could be distinguished. The chorioallantoic membrane assay revealed that diesel oil enters microvessels up to 50 microm in diameter and that it does not penetrate the capillary network. CONCLUSION: After establishing a postmortem circulation by diesel oil perfusion, angiography can be performed by injection of Lipiodol Ultra Fluide. The resolution of the images obtained up to 3 days after death is comparable to that achieved in clinical angiography...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{sequestration}} {{is a rare}} {{congenital anomaly}} that consists of abnormal pulmonary tissue for which the arterial supply is usually derived from the aorta or its major branches. Considering clinical and anatomical aspects two types of sequestration, intralobar and extralobar, have been described. The definite diagnosis requires exact visualization of the anomalous feeding and <b>draining</b> <b>vessels</b> and this condition is essential when surgical treatment is necessary because of recurrent pulmonary infections. We report on 3 cases of intralobar sequestration successfully and extensively diagnosed in adults by spiral angioCT. Our series includes one symptomatic left case confirmed by surgery and two rare fortuitous asymptomatic right cases. In the three cases, the pulmonary abnormal tissue, the arterial supply and venous drainage were clearly identified. We conclude that, probably more than MRI, spiral angio-CT can presently be considered the first choice procedure to diagnose and evaluate pulmonary sequestration; the equal performance of spiral CT in imaging lung and vessels makes classical angiography unnecessary.

SWI {{is sensitive to}} susceptibility effects from deoxyhemoglobin with excellent spatial resolution. Only scarce case reports have described the utility of SWI in cases of BCT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an observational retrospective study of 33 BCTs in 27 consec-utive patients examined from August 2009 to January 2011 with MR imaging, including SWI. Mor-phology, signal intensity characteristics, and additional vascular malformations were analyzed. Preced-ing or follow-up examinations were available in 18 patients with a median time interval of 14. 5 months (range, 2 – 115 months).

40|$|In mammals, the lymphatic {{vascular}} system develops by budding of lymphatic progenitor endothelial cells from embryonic veins {{to form a}} distinct network of <b>draining</b> <b>vessels</b> with important functions in the immune response and in cancer metastasis. However, the lineage-specific molecular characteristics of blood vascular versus lymphatic endothelium have remained poorly defined. We isolated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and blood vascular endothelial cells (BVECs) by immunomagnetic isolation directly from human skin. Cultured LECs but not BVECs expressed the lymphatic markers Prox 1 and LYVE- 1 and formed LYVE- 1 -positive vascular tubes after implantation in vivo. Transcriptional profiling studies revealed increased expression of several extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules in BVECs, including versican, collagens, laminin, and N-cadherin, and of the growth factor receptors endoglin and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 1 /Flt- 1. Differential immunostains of human skin confirmed the blood vessel-specific expression of these genes. During embryonic development, endoglin expression was gradually down-regulated on lymphatic endothelium whereas vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 1 was absent from lymphatics. We also identified several genes with specific expression in LECs. These results demonstrate that some lineage-specific genes are only expressed during distinct developmental stages and they identify new molecular markers for blood vascular and lymphatic endothelium with important implications for future studies of vascular development and function...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{retrospectively}} {{analyze the}} imaging features of hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in children on dynamic contrast-enhanced multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. METHODS: From September 1999 to April 2012, {{a total of}} 218 cases of hepatic FNH were confirmed by either surgical resection or biopsy in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and the Cancer center of Sun Yat-sen University, including 12 cases (5. 5 %) of FNH in children (age &#x 2264; 18 years old). All the 12 pediatric patients underwent MSCT. We retrospectively analyzed the imaging features of FNH lesions, including the number, location, size, margin, density of FNH demonstrated on pre-contrast and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning, central scar, fibrous septa, pseudocapsule, the morphology of the feeding arteries {{and the presence of}} <b>draining</b> <b>vessels</b> (portal vein or hepatic vein). RESULTS: All the 12 pediatric cases of FNH had solitary lesion. The maximum diameter of the lesions was 4. 0 - 12. 9 cm, with an average diameter of 5. 5 1; 2. 5 cm. The majority of the FNH lesions (10 / 12, 83. 3 %) had well-defined margins. Central scar (10 / 12, 83. 3 %) and fibrous septa (11 / 12, 91. 7 %) were commonly found in children with FNH. Central scar was either isodense (n = 7) or hypodense (n = 3) on pre-contrast CT images and showed progressive enhancement in 8 cases in the equilibrium phase. Fibrous septa were linear hypodense areas in the arterial phase and isodense in the portal and equilibrium phases. Pseudocapsule was very rare (1 / 12, 8. 3 %) in pediatric FNH. With the exception of central scars and fibrous septa within the lesions, all 12 cases of pediatric FNH were homogenously enhanced on the contrast-enhanced CT images, significantly hyperdense in the arterial phase (12 / 12, 100. 0 %), and isodense in the portal venous phase (7 / 12, 58. 3 %) and equilibrium phase (11 / 12, 91. 7 %). Central feeding arteries inside the tumors were observed on CTA images for all 12 cases of FNH, whereas no neovascularization of malignant tumors was noted. In 9 cases (75. 0 %), there was a spoke-wheel shaped centrifugal blood supply inside the tumors. The draining hepatic vein was detected in 8 cases of pediatric FNH. However, the <b>draining</b> <b>vessels</b> in the other 4 cases could not be detected. No associated hepatic adenoma or hemangioma was observed in the livers of the 12 pediatric cases.

40|$|Background: Antiangiogenic and anti-vascular therapies present {{intriguing}} {{alternatives to}} cancer therapy. However, despite promising preclinical results and significant delays in tumor progression, none have demonstrated long-term curative features to date. Here, {{we show that}} a single treatment session of Tookad-based vascular targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) promotes permanent arrest of tumor blood supply by rapid occlusion of the tumor feeding arteries (FA) and draining veins (DV), leading to tumor necrosis and eradication within 24 – 48 h. Methodology/Principal Findings: A mouse earlobe MADB 106 tumor model was subjected to Tookad-VTP and monitored by three complementary, non-invasive online imaging techniques: Fluorescent intravital microscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering Imaging and photosensitized MRI. Tookad-VTP led to prompt tumor FA vasodilatation (a mean volume increase of 70 %) with a transient increase (60 %) in blood-flow rate. Rapid vasoconstriction, simultaneous blood clotting, vessel permeabilization and {{a sharp decline in}} the flow rates then followed, culminating in FA occlusion at 63. 2 sec 61. 5 SEM. This blockage was deemed irreversible after 10 minutes of VTP treatment. A decrease in DV blood flow was demonstrated, with a slight lag from FA response, accompanied by frequent changes in flow direction before reaching a complete standstill. In contrast, neighboring, healthy tissue vessels of similar sizes remained intact and functional after Tookad-VTP.

We report an alternative surgical approach of controlled intra-operative transvenous embolisation with long-term results in seven cases. Materials and methodsBetween 1980 and 2008, we treated seven patients (four men, three women, mean age 50 years). Indications were rectal bleeding (one case), urinary tract problems (four cases), oedema of lower limb (one case) and high-output cardiac failure (one case). Four of them had previous operations and three had previous attempts for embolisation. Embolisation of the malformation was performed through the internal iliac vein. This was done after clamping of all the feeding and <b>draining</b> <b>vessels.</b> The agent used was cyanocrylate (one case), Ethibloc (one case) and bone wax (five cases). ResultsMortality was 0 %. Complications occurred in two patients (28, 5 %), one pulmonary embolism and one regressive femoral paresis. Three patients were re-operated for various reasons. The mean follow-up period was 6 years (1 – 12 years). Symptoms resolved in all patients, while control by computed tomography (CT) angioscan revealed one residual shunt. ConclusionComplete surgical excision of pelvic AVMs is not always possible. Embolisation does not offer a permanent cure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to adapt and improve a {{minimally}} invasive two-step postmortem angiographic technique for use on human cadavers. Detailed mapping of the entire vascular system is almost impossible with conventional autopsy tools. The technique described should be valuable in the diagnosis of vascular abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postmortem perfusion with an oily liquid is established with a circulation machine. An oily contrast agent is introduced as a bolus injection, and radiographic imaging is performed. In this pilot study, the upper or lower extremities of four human cadavers were perfused. In two cases, the vascular system of a lower extremity was visualized with anterograde perfusion of the arteries. In the other two cases, in which the suspected cause of death was drug intoxication, the veins of an upper extremity were visualized with retrograde perfusion of the venous system. RESULTS: In each case, the vascular system was visualized up to the level of the small supplying and <b>draining</b> <b>vessels.</b> In three of the four cases, vascular abnormalities were found. In one instance, a venous injection mark engendered by the self-administration of drugs was rendered visible by exudation of the contrast agent.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the clinical, angiographic and {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) findings of a patient with a large retinal capillary hemangioma who was treated by indocyanine green-mediated photothrombosis. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: An 18 -year,old male patient was treated at a tertiary referral center with a novel laser-dye procedure that uses low-irradiance 810 -nm laser and intravenous indocyanine green injection and was prospectively evaluated with fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, as well as OCT. RESULTS: Vision improved from 20 / 125 to 20 / 32 + 1 at 1 -year follow-up. Fundus photography showed marked reduction of a 3 disk diameters retinal capillary hemangioma. Both fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography demonstrated reduced tumor perfusion and narrowing of the lesion feeder and <b>draining</b> <b>vessels,</b> as early as 5 days after indocyanine green-mediated photothrombosis; OCT showed immediate decrease in retinal elevation and complete resolution of subretinal fluid within 2 months of treatment.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ultrasonic features of the cavo-hepato-atrial pathway in Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), by which blood is drained from the occluded inferior vena cava (IVC) to the right atrium via hepatic veins. Ultrasonograms from 11 patients with BCS with cavo-hepato-atrial pathways were retrospectively studied. Doppler ultrasound was used to observe the direction of the flow and measure the velocity of the blood-draining vessels. Blood flow in the <b>draining</b> <b>vessels</b> and the collaterals was shown as blue, red or bicolored depending on whether the flow direction was away from the transducer, towards the transducer or both. For measurement, the Doppler angle between the axis of the Doppler beam and that of the vein examined was always < 60 °. Ultrasonography was performed 1 - 2 weeks prior to digital subtraction angiography (DSA). All patients were confirmed by DSA. Membranous and segmental occlusions of IVCs were observed in seven and four cases, respectively. Blood flow from the IVC reversed to the hepatic/accessory hepatic vein, continued through the dilated intrahepatic collaterals, onward to the other hepatic vein and finally to the right atrium. The majority of the inlets (8 / 11) of hepatic veins above the occlu-sion were narrow compared with the dilated distant parts of the lumens. Accelerated blood flow in the inlets was detected in all patients regardless of the luminal diameter. In conclu-sion, the results from the present study suggest that the unusual cavo-hepato-atrial pathway can be diagnosed reliably by ultra-sonography, which may be useful for clinical management...|$|R
