40|$|Three {{subjects}} {{related to}} epitaxial GaAs-GaAlAs optoelectronic devices {{are discussed in}} this thesis. They are: 1. Embedded Epitaxy This is a technique of selective multilayer growth of GaAs- Ga 1 -x Al x As single crystal structures through stripe openings in masking layers on GaAs substrates. This technique results in prismatic layers of GaAs and Ga 1 -x Al x As "embedded" in each other and leads to controllable uniform structures terminated by crystal faces. The dependence of the growth habit on {{the orientation of the}} stripe openings has been studied. Room temperature embedded double heterostructure lasers have been fabricated using this technique. Threshold current densities as low as 1. 5 KA/cm 2 have been achieved. 2. Barrier Controlled PNPN Laser Diode It is found that the I-V characteristics of a PNPN device can be controlled by using potential barriers in the base regions. Based on this principle, GaAs-GaAlAs heterostructure PNPN laser diodes have been fabricated. GaAlAs potential barriers in the bases control not only the electrical but also the optical properties of the device. PNPN lasers with low threshold currents and high breakover voltage have been achieved. Numerical calculations of this barrier controlled structure are presented in the ranges where the total current is below the holding point and near the lasing threshold. 3. Injection Lasers on Semi-Insulating Substrates GaAs-GaAlAs heterostructure lasers fabricated on semi-insulating substrates have been studied. Two different laser structures achieved are: (1) Crowding effect lasers, (2) Lateral injection lasers. Experimental results and the working principles underlying the operation of these lasers are presented. The gain induced guiding mechanism is used to explain the lasers' far field radiation patterns. It is found that Zn diffusion in Ga 1 -x Al x As depends on the Al content x, and that GaAs can be used as the <b>diffusion</b> <b>mask</b> for Zn diffusion in Ga 1 -x Al x As. Lasers having very low threshold currents and operating in a stable single mode have been achieved.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Vacuum {{evaporated}} dielectrics {{for use in}} MOS {{structures were}} studied in this research project. Dielectric films were deposited on substrates by electron bombardment evaporation of sapphire and quartz source materials. These deposited films were studied using infrared spectroscopy, index of refraction, density, and dielectric constant measurements. Etching tests were also conducted on the dielectric films. Annealing these films was also tried. From {{the results of these}} tests, it was concluded that suitable aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide films can be obtained by e-Gun evaporation. The best results were obtained for slowly evaporated films on substrates heated above 200 ° C. Better films were obtained after annealing for ten minutes at 1100 °C in dry nitrogen. The <b>diffusion</b> <b>masking</b> properties of the e-Gun evaporated silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide films were studied. The evaporated films were tested for the masking of phosphorus and boron diffusion into silicon, of gallium and indium diffusion into germanium, and of zinc diffusion into gallium arsenide. From the results of these tests, it was concluded that both of these e-Gun evaporated films will effectively <b>mask</b> the <b>diffusion</b> of all the above mentioned impurities. The aluminum oxide films were better <b>diffusion</b> <b>masks</b> because they were more impervious to the diffusion of impurities. It required significantly thinner films of aluminum oxide to effectively <b>mask</b> the <b>diffusion</b> of all the impurities studied. The e-Gun evaporated films were used to fabricate MOS capacitors. Both aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide films produced good capacitors. The threshold voltages and surface-state densities of the capacitors were studied. Aluminum oxide films produced MOS capacitors which were relatively stable under bias-temperature tests. The e-Gun evaporated films were used in the fabrication of MOS transistors. The electrical properties of these transistors were studied using I-V characteristics. Both dielectrics produced good MOS transistors. Aluminum oxide films produced transistors with transconductances which were twice as large as the transconductances of the transistors with silicon dioxide films of the same thickness.

This approach {{is in contrast}} to conventionally used high-temperature thermal doping processes, which require multistep patterning processes to produce <b>diffusion</b> <b>masks.</b> Both MoOx and LiF thin films are inserted between the Si absorber and Al electrodes interdigitatedly at the rear cell surfaces, facilitating effective carrier collection at the MoOx/Si interface and suppressed recombination at the Si and LiF/Al electrode interface. With optimized MoOx and LiF film thickness as well as the all-back-contact design, our 1 -cm 2 Si nanohole solar cells exhibit a conversion efficiency of up to 15. 4 %, with an open-circuit voltage of 561 mV and a fill factor of 74. 6 %. In particular, because of the significant reduction in Auger/surface recombination as well as the excellent Si-nanohole light absorption, our solar cells exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 83. 4 % for short-wavelength light (~ 400 nm), resulting in a dramatic improvement (54. 6 %) in the short-circuit current density (36. 8 mA/cm 2) compared to that of a planar cell (23. 8 mA/cm 2).

40|$|Recently, {{silicon nitride}} films have {{received}} consider-able attention (1 - 3), mainly for passivating silicon, constructing <b>diffusion</b> <b>masks,</b> and use as gate insulators.

Studies of the electrical conductivity of silicon ni-tride films in strong electric fields can give information concerning the mechanism of the increase of conduc-tivity, the existence and location of trap levels, and dielectric constant. Experimental The substrates used for this study were mechanically polished 2 ohm-cm, p-type silicon. Just before loading into the reactor, the substrates were chemically etched in fresh, concentrated HF and rinsed in deionized water.

40|$|In {{the initial}} {{investigation}} of this thesis, Fick's second law of diffusion was modified to describe both the transient, and the steady-state, transdermal transport of hydrophilic permeants through unbranched, aqueous pore channels. This new transport model, combined with dual radiolabeled diffusion experiments, was {{then used to}} separately evaluate how the porosity, the tortuosity, and the hindrance factor of the aqueous pore channels {{that exist in the}} skin varied as the extent of skin perturbation due to simultaneous treatment of the skin with low-frequency ultrasound (US) and a chemical enhancer, the surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), and as the radius of the hydrophilic permeant delivered across the skin, were increased. This investigation revealed that the values of the hindrance factor and of the tortuosity decreased as the radius of the hydrophilic permeant increased, and that the value of the porosity of the aqueous pore channels increased as the extent of skin perturbation due to the application of US increased. This last result suggested that low-frequency US primarily enhances the transport of hydrophilic permeants by increasing the fraction of the skin surface occupied by the aqueous pore channels. (cont.) This modeling approach was next applied to the passive delivery of hydrophobic permeants through the branched pathways located in the intercellular lipid bilayer domain of untreated stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the skin. The existence of these branched pathways {{led to the development of}} a new theoretical model, the Two-Tortuosity Model, which requires two tortuosity factors to account for: 1) the effective diffusion path length, and 2) the total volume of the branched, intercellular transport pathways, both of which may be evaluated from known values of the SC structure. After validating the Two-Tortuosity model with simulated SC diffusion experiments in FEMLAB (a finite element software package), the vehicle-bilayer partition coefficient, Kb, and the lipid bilayer diffusion coefficient, Db, in untreated human SC were evaluated using this new model for two hydrophobic permeants, naphthol (Kb = 233 + 44, Db = 1. 6 * 10 - 7 + 0. 3 * 10 - 7 cm 2 /s) and testosterone (Kb = 100 + 14, Db = 1. 8 * 10 - 8 + 0. 2 * 10 - 8 cm 2 /s). This investigation demonstrated that the new proposed method to evaluate Kb and Db is more direct than previous methods, in which SC permeation experiments were combined with octanol-water partition experiments, or with SC solute release experiments, to evaluate Kb and Db. (cont.) Previous studies on ultrasound-mediated transdermal drug delivery had hypothesized that the discrete regions which form on the surface of skin treated with low-frequency US in the presence of a colored permeant are regions of high permeability. To test this hypothesis, full-thickness pig skin was treated simultaneously with low-frequency US and SLS in the presence of a hydrophilic fluorescent permeant, sulforhodamine B (SRB), which was used to observe the location of the hypothesized localized transport regions (LTRs) and of the surrounding regions of US-treated skin (the non-LTRs). After US-pretreatment, <b>diffusion</b> <b>masking</b> experiments, a novel experimental method in which hydrophobic vacuum grease was selectively applied to the skin surface, demonstrated that the permeability of calcein, another hydrophilic fluorescent permeant, in the LTRs was - 80 -fold greater than in the non-LTRs. Furthermore, measurements of the skin electrical resistivity in both the LTRs and the non-LTRs revealed significant decreases relative to the skin electrical resistivity in untreated skin (- 5000 -fold and - 170 -fold, respectively), suggesting that two levels of significant structural perturbation exist in skin treated simultaneously with ultrasound and SLS. (cont.) Finally, an analysis of the porosity-to-tortuosity ratio values suggested that transcellular transdermal transport pathways exist within the LTRs. To confirm the results of the previous investigation, the transdermal delivery of SRB and of rhodamine B hexyl ester (RBHE), a fluorescent hydrophobic permeant, in skin treated with low-frequency ultrasound (US) and/or a chemical enhancer (SLS) relative to untreated skin (the control) was analyzed with dual-channel two-photon microscopy (TPM). An analysis of the average fluorescence intensity profiles as a function of skin depth, obtained from the TPM images, revealed that SRB and RBHE penetrated beyond the stratum corneum and into the viable epidermis only in the LTRs of US-treated and of US/SLS-treated skin. Further analysis of the average fluorescence intensity profiles and of the enhancements in the vehicle-skin partition coefficient, the intensity gradient, and the effective diffusion path length confirmed that a chemical enhancer was required in the coupling medium during US-treatment to obtain two significant levels of increased penetration of SRB and RBHE into the skin. (cont.) Finally, by comparing the heights and the widths of the fluorescence intensity peaks obtained from the dual-channel TPM images, the existence of transcellular pathways was confirmed in the LTRs of US-treated and of US/SLS-treated skin for SRB and RBHE, as well as in SLS-treated skin for SRB. In the final investigation of this thesis, the differences in the hindrance factor, the porosity, and the tortuosity of the aqueous pore channels located in the LTRs and in the non-LTRs were evaluated for the delivery of four hydrophilic permeants (urea, mannitol, raffinose, and inulin) using the transport model developed in the initial investigation of this thesis combined with dual radiolabeled <b>diffusion</b> <b>masking</b> experiments. In this analysis, three different idealized cases were examined. In the first case, where the porosity and the tortuosity were assumed to be independent of the permeant radius, the hindrance factor, and, therefore, the average pore radius, was found to be statistically larger in the LTRs than in the non-LTRs. In the second case, where a distribution of pore radii was assumed to exist in the skin, no meaningful results could be obtained due to the large variation in the shape of the distribution of pore radii used in the analysis. (cont.) In the final case, where infinitely large aqueous pores were assumed to exist in the skin, the value of the porosity of the LTRs was found to be 3 - to 8 -fold larger than that of the non-LTRs, while there little difference was found in the values of the tortuosity of the LTRs and of the non-LTRs. by Joseph Kushner, IV.

40|$|Efficient {{methods for}} the {{calculation}} of radial influence are described and applied to two image processing problems, digital halftoning and mixed content image compression. The methods operate recursively on scanlines of image values, spreading intensity from scanline to scanline in proportions approximating a Cauchy distribution. For error diffusion halftoning, experiments show that this recursive scanline spreading provides an ideal pattern of distribution of error. Error <b>diffusion</b> using <b>masks</b> generated to provide this distribution of error alleviate error diffusion "worm" artifacts. The recursive scanline by scanline application of a spreading filter and a complementary filter {{can be used to}} reconstruct an image from its horizontal and vertical pixel difference values. When combined {{with the use of a}} downsampled image the reconstruction is robust to incomplete and quantized pixel difference data. Such gradient field integration methods are described in detail proceeding from representation of images by gradient values along contours through to a variety of efficient algorithms. Comparisons show that this form of gradient field integration by convolution provides reduced distortion compared to other high speed gradient integration methods. The reduced distortion can be attributed to success in approximating a radial pattern of influence. An approach to edge-based image compression is proposed using integration of gradient data along edge contours and regularly sampled low resolution image data. This edge-based image compression model is similar to previous sketch based image coding methods but allows a simple and efficient calculation of an edge-based approximation image. A low complexity implementation of this approach to compression is described. The implementation extracts and represents gradient data along edge contours as pixel differences and calculates an approximate image by performing integration of pixel difference data by scanline convolution. The implementation was developed as a prototype for compression of mixed content image data in printing systems. Compression results are reported and strengths and weaknesses of the implementation are identified...|$|R

The first two ratings {{account for the}} high sound loss at frequencies that are important for intelligibility. ESL treats {{the difference between the}} masking spectrum and the background spectrum as an additional loss. The figure on the right shows the Speech Loss for a furniture panel with high STC; it is the excess loss caused by sound diffraction over the panel. The Effective Speech Loss is higher and shows sound masking as if it were part of the partition. The masking level for this example was set at 47 dB(A) and the background level was 39 dB(A). This graph demonstrates the significant value of sound masking when it acts as an additional panel height. It is clear that the level used in the graph only would be necessary for low panel heights, but is excessive with higher panels. The graph also demonstrates the panel tradeoff with sound masking. Adding masking permits lower panels to achieve the same speech loss. Adding masking roughly permits a reduction of at least 12 inches in panel height so there can be a significant cost savings.The reflection of speech from a ceiling in an open office depends on the sound absorbing characteristics of the ceiling tile and the height of the suspended ceiling. Because ceiling tiles tend to absorb the higher frequencies better, the speech loss is relatively good, as seen in the figure on the right. It should be noted that an upgrade in NRC rating adds expense but not always appreciable speech privacy improvement. A goal of SL=20 for the ceiling would require the panel height to be at least 60-66 inches to balance the two paths with added masking, otherwise, the panel would be the weakest sound path.

We tested whether intratumoral expression of the peptide hormone relaxin (Rlx) would result in ECM degradation and the improvement of trastuzumab therapy. As viral gene delivery into epithelial tumors with extensive tumor ECM is inefficient, we used a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) -based approach to deliver the Rlx gene to the tumor. In mouse models with syngeneic breast cancer tumors, HSC-mediated intratumoral Rlx expression resulted in a decrease of ECM proteins and enabled control of tumor growth. Moreover, in a model with Her 2 /neu-positive BT 474 -M 1 tumors and more treatment-refractory tumors derived from HCC 1954 cells, we observed a significant delay of tumor growth when trastuzumab therapy was combined with Rlx expression. Our results have implications for antibody therapy of cancer {{as well as for}} other anticancer treatment approaches that are based on T-cells or encapsulated chemotherapy drugs...|$|R
40|$|We {{designed}} {{an experiment}} {{to examine the}} effects of g-jitter on mixing of two miscible liquids using the Microgravity Vibration Isolation Mount (MIM). The global bifurcation of the interface was observed with the MIM operating alternatively to either transmit the g-jitter, isolate from the g-jitter or to provide controlled vibration levels with well defined amplitude and frequency content. With the MIM in isolation mode, the interface remains stationary indicating buoyancy induced convection is negligibly small such that mixing occurs via intrinsic mass <b>diffusion</b> without the <b>masking</b> effect of vibration driven convection. Analytical and computational results are in agreement with the experimental findings. Operation of the MIM in forced mode with conditions typical of g-jitter shows that vibration induced convective flows can excite instability mechanisms such as Kelvin-Helmholtz to generate large amplitude quasi-stationary waves oriented vertically for various cases with Stokes-Reynolds number in the range of 0. 003 to 0. 5. The two and four mode quasi-stationary waves are also predicted with a mathematical model. Though unplanned, the effect of a primary thruster filing was captured and shown to cause a catastrophic bifurcation, enhancing local mass transport. In light of the findings, experiments planned for the International Space Station should consider the potential effects of g-jitter...|$|R
40|$|The GaInSb {{material}} {{system is}} attractive for application in thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells since its band gap can be tuned {{to match the}} radiation of the emitter. At present, most of the TPV cells are fabricated using epitaxial layers and hence are expensive. To reduce the cost, Zn diffusion using elemental vapors in a semi-closed diffusion system is being pursued by several laboratories. In this paper, the authors present studies carried out on Zn diffusion into n-type (Te-doped) GaSb substrates in an open tube diffusion furnace. The dopant precursor was a 2, 000 {angstrom} thick, zinc doped spin-on glass. The diffusion was carried out at temperatures ranging from 550 to 600 C, for times from 1 to 10 hours. The diffused layers were characterized by Hall measurements using step-and-repeat etching by anodic oxidation, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements and TPV device fabrication. For diffusion carried out at 600 C, the junction depth was 0. 3 {micro}m, and the hole concentration near the surface was 5 {times} 10 {sup 19 }/cm{sup 3 }. The external quantum efficiency, measured without any anti-reflection coating, of the TPV cells fabricated using mesa-etching had a maximum value of 38 %. <b>Masked</b> <b>diffusion</b> was also carried out by opening windows in a Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } coated, GaSb wafer. TPV cells fabricated on these structures had similar quantum efficiency, but lower dark current...|$|R
40|$|Halftoning is the {{rendition}} of continuous-tone pictures on displays, paper or other media that {{are capable of}} producing only two levels. In digital halftoning, we perform the gray scale to bilevel conversion digitally using software or hardware. In the last 3 decades, several algorithms have evolved for halftoning. Examples of algorithms include ordered dither, error <b>diffusion,</b> blue noise <b>masks,</b> green noise halftoning, direct binary search (DBS), and dot diffusion. In this paper we first review some of the algorithms which have a direct bearing on our paper and then describe some of the more recent advances in the field. The dot diffusion method for digital halftoning has the advantage of pixel-level parallelism unlike the error diffusion method, which is a popular halftoning method. However, the image quality offered by error diffusion is still regarded as superior to most of the other known methods. We first review error diffusion and dot diffusion, and describe a recent method to improve the image quality of the dot diffusion algorithm which takes advantage of the Human Visual System (HVS) function. Then, we discuss the inverse halftoning problem. Inverse halftoning is the reconstruction of a continuous tone image from its halftoned version. We give a brief review of the methods used in inverse halftoning, and discuss the advantadges of a recent inverse halftoning algorithm: Look Up Table (LUT) Method for inverse halftoning. The method is extremely fast (no filtering is required) and the image quality achieved is comparable to the best method...|$|R
40|$|Photodeposition of {{metallic}} nanostructures onto ferroelectric surfaces, {{which have}} been chemically patterned using a proton exchange process, has recently been demonstrated. By varying the molar concentration of the AgNO 3 solution and the illumination time, one can determine the initial nucleation sites, control the rate of nucleation and the height of silver nanostructures formed, and study the mechanisms by which these processes occurs. The nanoparticles are found to deposit preferentially in the boundary between ferroelectric and proton exchanged regions, in an area proton exchanged via lateral <b>diffusion</b> under the <b>masking</b> layer used for chemical patterning, consistent with our previous results. Using a short illumination time (3 min), {{we are able to}} determine that the initial nucleation of the silver nanostructure, having a width of 0. 17 ± 0. 02 µm and a height of 1. 61 ± 0. 98 nm, occurs {{near the edge of the}} reactive ion etched area within this lateral diffusion region. Over longer illumination times (15 min), we find that the silver deposition has spread to a width of 1. 29 ± 0. 06 µm, extending across the entire lateral diffusion region. We report that at a high molar concentration of AgNO 3 (10 ¯² M), the amount of silver deposition for 5 min UV illumination is greater (2. 88 ± 0. 58 nm) compared to that at low (10 ¯ 4 M) concentrations (0. 78 ± 0. 35 nm), however, this is not the case for longer time periods. With increasing illumination time (15 min), experiments at 10 ¯ 4 M had greater overall deposition, 6. 90 ± 1. 52 nm, compared to 4. 50 ± 0. 76 nm at 10 ¯² M. For longer exposure times (30 min) at 10 ¯² M the nanostructure height is 4. 72 ± 0. 59 nm, suggesting a saturation in the nanostructure height. The results are discussed in terms of the electric double layer that forms at the crystal surface. There is an order of magnitude difference between the Debye lengths for 10 ¯² and 10 ¯ 4 M solutions, i. e., 3. 04 vs. 30. 40 nm, which suggests the Debye length plays a role in the availability of Ag+ ions at the surface...|$|R
