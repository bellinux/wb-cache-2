5|$|Jane's {{reported}} in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents {{in his home}} about a U.S. attack on Iraq. When they raided the house, fighting broke out between Abu Nidal's men and Iraqi intelligence. In the midst of this, Abu Nidal rushed into his bedroom and was killed; Palestinian sources told Jane's {{that he had been}} shot several times. Jane's suggested Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> him killed because he feared Abu Nidal would act against him {{in the event of an}} American invasion.|$|E
5|$|The British favoured the {{prospect}} of the Temenggong in taking over the administration of Johor from the Sultan. Sultan Ali's claims to sovereignty were quickly refuted by the British and the Temenggong, who was {{quick to point out that}} the Sultan's late father, Sultan <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> never pursued active claims to his sovereignty rights over Johor in spite of his recognition by the British in the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. At that time, Johor came under the effective charge of the Temenggong's late father, Abdul Rahman, as with Pahang, which was under the control of the Bendahara. Further documents revealed that if Johor were to be under the control of a monarch, de jure sovereignty would have been laid under the charge of the Sultan of Lingga, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah and not with Sultan Ali.|$|E

25|$|A second {{unofficial}} video, apparently showing Saddam's body on a trolley, emerged {{several days}} later. It sparked {{speculation that the}} execution was carried out incorrectly as Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> a gaping hole in his neck.|$|E
25|$|Ali (son of <b>Hussein),</b> <b>had</b> {{great respect}} for his uncle Abbas. He often wept when his eyes fell on Ubaidullah, {{explaining}} that he {{reminded him of his}} father's heroic and tragic exploit on that day in Karbala.|$|E
25|$|Both Yazid and <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> been {{involved}} in the siege of Constantinople a few years earlier. Hussein was in the army that laid siege under the command of Muawiyah's son Yazeed in AH 51. After the peace treaty with Muawiya, Hussein would frequently visit Muawiya with his brother and show great hospitality in return.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> three younger siblings. His {{sisters are}} Princess Iman and Princess Salma, while his {{youngest}} sibling is Prince Hashem.|$|R

25|$|Though Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> renounced {{the use of}} {{chemical}} weapons in 1989, many did not believe he would really honor that during a conflict with the United States and the broader coalition forces. As American troops headed to the desert, analysts speculated about their vulnerability to CB attack. Although the location of Hussein's chemical munitions was unknown, their existence was never doubted.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 presidential elections, {{conducted}} by a secret poll of National Assembly members, pitted former prime minister Shermarke against Osman. Again the central issue was moderation versus militancy on the pan-Somali question. Osman, through <b>Hussein,</b> <b>had</b> stressed priority for internal development. Shermarke, who had served as prime minister when pan-Somalism was at its height, {{was elected president of}} the republic.|$|E
25|$|The main {{allegations}} were: that Saddam possessed or {{was attempting}} to produce weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> used {{in places such as}} Halabja, possessed, and made efforts to acquire, particularly considering two previous attacks on Baghdad nuclear weapons production facilities by both Iran and Israel which were alleged to have postponed weapons development progress; and, further, that he had ties to terrorists, specifically al-Qaeda.|$|E
5000|$|According to Arab media, Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> opened {{training}} camps in Iraq for Arab volunteers willing {{to carry out}} suicide bombings against U.S. forces, if an attack on Iraq takes place.|$|R
5000|$|Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra {{confirms}} that Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> been his patient {{over the last}} two decades, stating that he has developed a [...] "close relationship with Saddam" [...] in the time they worked together.|$|R
5000|$|This {{claim is}} however disputed. Dr Ala Bashir, Saddam Hussein's former {{personal}} physician, stated, [...] "The stories about Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>having</b> body doubles, {{to foster the}} impression that the Iraqi dictator was everywhere, are nonsense." ...|$|R
25|$|Although the {{disagreements}} primarily involved {{personal or}} group political ambitions, the debate {{leading to the}} initial vote of confidence centered {{on the issue of}} Greater Somalia. Both Osman and prime minister-designate Hussein wanted to give priority to the country's internal economic and social problems. Although <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> supported militant pan-Somalism, he was portrayed as willing to accept the continued sovereignty of Ethiopia and Kenya over Somali areas.|$|E
25|$|One bomb {{missed the}} {{compound}} entirely {{and the other}} three missed their target, landing {{on the other side of}} the wall of the palace compound. Saddam Hussein was not present, nor were any members of the Iraqi leadership. The attack killed one civilian and injured fourteen others, including four men, nine women and one child. Later investigation revealed that Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> not visited the farm since 1995.|$|E
25|$|The SYL's {{governing}} Central Committee and its parliamentary groups became split. <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> been a {{party member}} since 1944 and {{had participated in}} the two previous Shermarke cabinets. His primary appeal was to younger and more educated party members. Several political leaders who had been left out of the cabinet joined the supporters of Shermarke to form an opposition group within the party. As a result, the Hussein faction sought support among non-SYL members of the National Assembly.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> {{been criticized}} by conservatives on the Internet, who raised {{questions}} about his images months before he was detained. [...] One blogger, Michelle Malkin, wrote about him {{on the day of}} his arrest, citing an anonymous military source in Iraq.|$|R
5000|$|As {{evidence}} in today's modern world, {{events such as}} the Trial of Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>have</b> proven what British jurist A. V. Dicey said in 1885, when he popularized the phrase [...] "rule of law" [...] in 1885. Dicey emphasized three aspects {{of the rule of law}} : ...|$|R
50|$|Muhammad Ahmad <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> {{been the}} current Grand Mufti of Jerusalem since July 2006, {{when he was}} {{appointed}} by Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian National Authority. Hussein replaced Ekrima Sa'id Sabri, who was reportedly fired by Abbas for his growing popularity and open expression of highly contentious political views.|$|R
25|$|During this {{political}} and social crisis, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein attempted {{to take advantage of}} the disorder of the Revolution, the weakness of the Iranian military and the revolution's antagonism with Western governments. The once-strong Iranian military had been disbanded during the revolution, and with the Shah ousted, <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> ambitions to position himself as the new strong man of the Middle East, and sought to expand Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf by acquiring territories that Iraq had claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah's rule.|$|E
25|$|On 13 December 2003, in Operation Red Dawn, Saddam Hussein was {{captured}} by American forces after being found hiding in {{a hole in the}} ground near a farmhouse in ad-Dawr, near Tikrit. Following his capture, Saddam was transported to a U.S. base near Tikrit, and later taken to the American base near Baghdad. On 14 December, U.S. administrator in Iraq L. Paul Bremer confirmed that Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> indeed been captured at a farmhouse in ad-Dawr near Tikrit. Bremer presented video footage of Saddam in custody.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, he {{went for}} a period of Islamic study at a Shiite seminary in Najaf, Iraq. Nasrallah was forced to return to Lebanon in 1979, by that time having {{completed}} the first part of his study, as Saddam Hussein was expelling many Shia's, including Khomeini and Abbas Musawi a year earlier. Back in Lebanon, he studied and taught at the school of Amal’s leader Abbas al-Musawi, later being selected as Amal's political delegate in Beqaa, and making him a member of the central political office. Around the same time, in 1980, Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> Sadr executed.|$|E
50|$|Besides her psychotherapeutic and {{consultancy}} work, <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> {{been invited}} to speak on matters {{of interest to the}} Somali community in various radio and television programs, including on Universal TV (Somali TV), Islamic channel, BBC, Al Jazeera and Channel 5. She has also been a guest speaker at many national and international conferences.|$|R

50|$|After its reprint, David Sexton {{wrote in}} the Evening Standard, Here fully thirty years before Master and Commander was {{published}} is the unmistakable texture of O'Brian's historical fiction. <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> it all: the immersion in another world, full of local colour, the delight in a specialised vocabulary, the relish of male camaraderie, travel, treasure and fighting.|$|R
25|$|At the Paris Peace Conference, Prime Minister Lloyd George told Georges Clemenceau and {{the other}} allies that the McMahon-Hussein {{correspondence}} was a treaty obligation. He explained that the agreement with <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> actually been {{the basis for the}} Sykes-Picot Agreement, and that the French could not use the proposed League Of Nations Mandate system to break the terms of the agreement. He pointed out that the French had agreed not to occupy the area of the independent Arab state, or confederation of states, with their military forces, including the areas of Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo. British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour (later Lord Balfour) and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson were present at the meeting.|$|E
25|$|After Hasan's {{accidental}} death in February 1823, another son-in-law of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, Hussein Bey, led a well-organised and well-armed joint Turkish-Egyptian force of 12,000 soldiers {{with the support}} of artillery and cavalry. On 22June 1823, Emmanouil Tombazis, appointed Commissioner of Crete by the Greek revolutionary government, held the Convention of Arcoudaina in an attempt to reconcile the factions of local captains and unite them against the common threat. He then gathered 3,000 men in Gergeri to face Hussein, but the Cretans were defeated by the much larger and better-organised force, and lost 300 men at the battle of Amourgelles on 20August 1823. By the spring of 1824, <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> managed to limit the Cretan resistance to just a few mountain enclaves.|$|E
25|$|On 25 January Hussein {{returned}} abruptly to the United States, after experiencing feversa sign {{of recurrent}} lymphoma. On 4February {{it was reported}} that <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> suffered internal organ failure, and was in critical condition. The next day, and at his request, he was flown to Jordan where he arrived unconscious after a second bone marrow transplant failed. Fighter jets from several countries flew with his plane as it passed over its territory, including the United States, Britain, and Israel. Hussein arrived at the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman where it was raining heavily, yet thousands flocked from all over Jordan and gathered at the main entrance. The crowds chanted his name, some weeping, others holding his pictures. On 7February Hussein was pronounced dead.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> {{recognised}} {{the major}} role Turabi {{played in the}} formation of the ideology that led the 1989 coup attempt, and spoke in 2002 about how although disliked the rift with Turabi due to the intellectual and political debt they owed him, Turabi's imprisonment was in fact necessary to protect the state that Turabi had advocated for.|$|R
5000|$|As {{he leaves}} the building, he passes a {{newspaper}} stand where the headlines declare the official end of the Cold War. Four weeks later, whilst fishing outside his retirement cottage, he hears over the radio that Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> invaded Kuwait. Upon hearing this news, vindicated and unmoved, he decides it's [...] "time to change his bait".|$|R
5000|$|Johnson {{opposed the}} Iraq War since its beginning, {{and called for}} the American {{presence}} in Iraq to end.
