40|$|This article {{examines}} the evolution of China's land system {{in the past two}} decades. Since the early 1980 s, China has altered its land use arrangements and introduced new regulations to manage land use changes. In the process the administrative allocation of land to users has been transformed into a complex hierarchical system of primary and secondary markets for land use rights. The changes in China's land system were adopted primarily for two reasons: to develop land markets to allocate land more efficiently and to protect agricultural land. An analysis of available data suggests that the development of land markets is still at an early stage, that the conversion of land to non-agricultural use continues but at a slower pace, and that <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> is pervasive. The article concludes with an assessment of the new land system and a discussion of some likely future changes. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> sites in {{developing}} countries that are experiencing a process of rapid urbanization. Short-interval, such as monthly, land use and land cover (LULC) change information is important for detecting and preventing illegal land development at its early stage. Conventional optical remote sensing is limited by weather conditions and has great limitation in collecting images in regions characterized by frequent cloud cover. Radar remote sensing, not affected by clouds, is therefore an effective tool for collecting timely LULC information in these regions. Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) is a currently advanced radar remote sensing technique. This study explores the potential of PolSAR data in short-interval monitoring of LULC change by using RADARSAT- 2 PolSAR images. Monthly LULC changes were extracted from a time series of RADARSAT- 2 images by using change vector analysis and post-classification comparison based on object-oriented image analysis. The average detection accuracy, average false alarm rate, and average overall error rate for change detection were 91. 29 %, 1. 37 %, and 1. 97 % respectively. The average overall accuracy and average kappa value for determining types of changes were 72. 44 % and 0. 68 respectively. The results indicate that it is effective in using a time series of RADARSAT- 2 PolSAR images in short-interval monitoring of LULC change, especially in monitoring potential illegal land development...|$|E

To maintain {{the full range of}} forest ecosystem services and support the development of effective conservation policies, we must understand the overall impact of degradation on different forest resources. This research investigates the response to disturbance of forest structure using several indicators: soil carbon content, arboreal richness and biodiversity, functional composition (guild and wood density), and productivity. We drew upon large field and remote sensing datasets from different forest types in Ghana, characterized by varied protection status, to investigate impacts of selective logging, and of <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and resources extraction, which are the main disturbance causes in West Africa. Results indicate that functional composition and the overall number of species are less affected by degradation, while forest structure, soil carbon content and species abundance are seriously impacted, with resources distribution reflecting the protection level of the areas. Remote sensing analysis showed an increase in productivity in the last three decades, with higher resiliency to change in drier forest types, and stronger productivity correlation with solar radiation in the short dry season. The study region is affected by growing anthropogenic pressure on natural resources and by an increased climate variability: possible interactions of disturbance with climate are also discussed, together with the urgency to reduce degradation in order to preserve the full range of ecosystem functions...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} was to obtain a general impression of {{the activities of the}} Peracchi sawmill in the Tailândia region, Pará. This was to assess its potential as a partner in the project ‘Sustainable forest management at commercial scale’, a cooperative project between Embrapa Amaz 6 nia Oriental and the Center for International Forestry Research. The study included a general description of the region, the stakeholders involved in the use of forest resources, and a financial analysis of sawmill activities. Students of the Agrar Faculty of Pará gathered the field information during two weeks in October 1998. The study showed, that Tailandia was a typical older frontier region, which depended strongly on the forest sector. After more than 15 years of timber harvesting and industrialisation by more than 50 sawmills, the forest resources near the city decreased significantly. As a result of the high number of legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> incentives and the strong fluctuation, the system of forest stakeholders was complex and heterogeneous.

This has resulted in <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and development and the eventual situation of informal settlements developing at a rapid rate. However most governments in the developing world, including South Africa have failed to acknowledge that most new urban informal settlements are developed by an illegal process as informal settlement residents willingly or unwittingly contravene planning regulations, contravene laws out of ignorance of the legal requirements, coupled with the inability to conform to the high standards set. Consequently, States respond to this illegality in the form of eviction as it threatens the economic, social and political stability of the urban environment. Concepts promoted internationally and identified in international literature recognize that the solution to informality lies in appropriate protection of rights which should ensure access to secure shelter leading to access to other benefits such as livelihood opportunities, public services and credits. That flowing from International Laws and Covenants, Human Rights Law needs to be looked at as a system of law that creates legally binding obligations for states with the aim of protecting, respecting and promoting housing rights for informal settlement residents. In the context of rights, Fernandes goes further in emphasising the legal constitutional perspective of the urban phenomenon where law is used as a vehicle for urban development and social change as well as encouraging state action and its attempts at socio-political legitimization in the context of informal settlement intervention...|$|E
30|$|China, as {{one country}} in Asia, has {{distinct}} land management practices. (Zhang 2012) {{notes that the}} country adopted land-banking systems {{in which there are}} recognised, hence official, agencies governing local land conversions, preparation, and transactions. This transformation in urban land policy has emanated from the local economic characteristics, pressure from peer cities, provincial governments, policy professionals, and policy-making communities. Over the past years, China has been shifting from a centrally planned to a market oriented economy. Land management issues are critical in China’s transformation. Urban land development planning shapes the landscape and sustainability of rapidly growing cities (Zhang, 2012). The concept of land banking systems was actually borrowed from other cities that were practicing such. Cities such as Dalian, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Qingdao began to experiment with the land banking system based on the lessons learned from land banking practices in the United States and Hong Kong. In the context of China, such practices had positive results. The new system brings considerable efficiency gains. It enables local governments to regain control over a large share of land conveyance profits that was formerly possessed by illegal land traders and corrupt officials. Moreover, this system enables local governments to enjoy the benefits of land value appreciation driven by China’s rapid industrialization and urbanisation process. In their article, (Ho and Lin 2003) explore China’s land management practices, changes introduced and the rationale behind such transition. Since the early 1980 s, China has altered its land use arrangements and introduced new regulations to manage land use changes. In the process, the administrative allocation of land to users has been transformed into a complex hierarchical system of primary and secondary markets for land use rights. The changes in China’s land system were adopted primarily for two reasons: (i) to develop land markets to allocate land more efficiently and (ii) to protect agricultural land.

40|$|A Journey to Freedom: The Life of Richard Oakes 1942 - 1972,” is {{the story}} of Indigenous leader and activist Richard Oakes, and focuses on the climax of the {{national}} movement toward Native self-determination and freedom. “A Journey to Freedom” investigates the intersections of place, space, identity, and socio/political coalitions within the Red Power movement. Oakes’ leadership was influential in the Alcatraz (1969) and Fort Lawton (1970) takeovers, as well as Pit River’s resistance to PG&E Corporation’s <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> Each successive takeover pushed for land rights, treaty rights, and the development of ecological centers that forged links between reservation and urban spaces. Oakes’ political activism also influenced other organizations such as the Black Panthers, Brown Berets, Atzlan, and the national environmental movement. The assassination of Richard Oakes led to the Trail of Broken Treaties march on Washington D. C. and ultimately resulted in the passage of federal self-determination legislation. I use two theoretical models to construct an “alternative” twentieth-century history: what I define as “Intertribalism” and the advent of an “Indian City. ” While the term “Pan-Indian” implies the Ethnic-American destruction of Tribal identity, Intertribalism emphasizes the study of coalitions between Tribes. Native history, within this context, is transnational history. Intertribalism, I argue, emerged as a central force of American Indian Nationalism. Intertribalism is also connected to Indian Cities. Unlike traditional ethnic neighborhoods, these cities were comprised of institutions (Indian Centers, Indian bars, health centers, businesses, churches, and a host of others) that politicized a highly migrant and dispersed urban population. “A Journey to Freedom” is the first urban comparative study to examine the construct of Indian Cities within New York, San Francisco, and Seattle. Oakes’ unique life provides an alternative narrative to previous scholarship that placed the American Indian Movement as the lone icon of Red Power. My dissertation counters this representation by emphasizing the multiple roles of community, ideology, identity, and nationalism. “A Journey to Freedom,” moves beyond an examination of contemporary Native leadership, and exposes the deep and diverse foundations of the larger Red Power movement that informs contemporary definitions of Native politics and sovereignty.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I address emerging {{land and}} labor {{issues associated with}} the rapid urbanization in China over the past decades, including {{the negative effects of}} the real estate booms on manufacturing development, land conflicts, and gender inequality among migrants. The thesis consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 offers an introductory discussion on the overarching objective and specific questions of the whole research. Chapter 2 focuses on the effects of housing price appreciation on firm investment. I find a robust negative relationship between local housing prices and the investment of manufacturing firms. A detailed examination of the underlying mechanism probes that it is mainly due to a Dutch disease effect of the real estate price boom: rising housing prices push up wages and other production costs for manufacturing firms and therefore reduce the incentive to invest. Chapter 3 applies a difference-in-differences approach to identify the intra-industry resource allocation effects of the real estate boom. The results show that industries intrinsically highly linked with real estate sectors experienced increasing heterogeneity in firm total factor productivity (TFP), suggesting sorting-in or expansion of less-efficient firms in more real-estate-exposed industries. Chapter 4 investigates the effects of foreign direct investment and fiscal decentralization on jurisdictional land conflicts. The results show that the FDI growth rate has a positive and significant impact on the growth rate of <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> when there is a high degree of fiscal decentralization. It thus suggests that FDI inflows trigger tensions over land in provinces {{with a high degree of}} fiscal decentralization. Chapter 5 examines the wage gap between female and male rural-urban migrant workers in China. I test whether the differences can be attributed to human capital characteristics, gender discrimination or other factors. I find a relative small gender wage gap of 16 - 18 %, and that most of the gender wage gap cannot be attributed to gender differences in observed characteristics. In addition, the paper documents important differences in factors affecting gender wage gaps between the sub-sample of migrants living at their workplace and those living at urban communities.

40|$|Conventional {{land use}} change detections with remote sensing use annual remote sensing images {{because of the}} {{limitations}} of optical sensors that cannot collect data in bad weather and cloudy conditions. This limits its applications in rapidly developing areas which are cloudy, such as the Pearl River Delta in China. These areas also need to detect land use changes in short intervals, such as on a monthly basis, in order to monitor <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> changes and prevent irreversible land use changes that may damage the environment. The objective of the thesis is to examine short-interval land use change detection, especially the change from agriculture to built-up areas, using RADARSAT- 1 images which can go through clouds. This thesis firstly examines the classification of RADARSAT- 1 images with pixel-based and object-based classification methods respectively. Based on the classification results, post-classification change detection method are conducted in order to obtain the detailed information of land use changes for the analysis of short-interval land use change. Land use change detection accuracies can be improved as the number of the RADARSAT- 1 images used in land use change detection increased. More images, which represent longer monitoring period, can obtain better results of land use change detection. For short-interval land use changes detection, four time periods is the maximum otherwise the period of monitoring will be too long. Agricultural activities such as planting and harvesting have significant effects on the monitoring of land use changes. In planting and harvesting months, the accuracies of the land use change detection are lower than other months because its land cover is often confused with other land uses, such as water and bare soils. The process of construction can be considered as a three-stage process and a combination of two land uses. However, construction sites are often confused with vegetation and bare soil in RADARSAT- 1 images because the values of backscatter coefficients of construction sites and the two land uses are very similar. The land cover changes during the planting and harvest seasons are often confused with the process of construction. It is found that construction sites can be identified with their two stages of low values of backscatter coefficients, which is not found in the pattern curves of backscatter coefficients of other land uses. By the comparison of the accuracies of identifying construction sites using two, three and four RADARSAT- 1 images, it is found that using three time periods can get better accuracies which is different from the result of general land use change detection. This thesis does not try to evaluate land use change detection methods or find the best method for monitoring land use changes. Instead, it focused on the analysis of confusions caused by the time periods of land use change detection and seasonal variation of vegetations. The main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) it explores the use of multi-temporal RADARSAT- 1 images into the land use change detection to overcome the problems of cloudy conditions, making short-interval land use change detection possible for areas which are often covered by clouds; 2) pixel-based maximum likelihood method and the object-based classification method were compared for their accuracies in land use classification of RADARSAT- 1 images; 3) it examines the optimal time periods for land use change detection; and 4) it examines the appropriate number of images that are needed for monitoring land use changes in different seasons in order to obtain the best accuracies. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Not {{only because}} of {{congenital}} deficiency such as rain imbalance and poor land quality, but postnatal dislocation such as man-made damage and imperfect system, Taiwan water resource is still in poor situation of excess, shortness and pollution. However, it’s been protected seriously. To {{the bottom of the}} situation are lack of powerful operating policies and managing systems, so that the effect on water resource protection policy cannot be carried out but failed. Based on this research, I make a whole analysis from the latest policy and water resource. Moreover, I get to know the following phenomenon by the initial analysis: reservoirs in Taiwan are badly silted up and polluted. Twenty-two point five percent of them are silted up over fifty percent high; fifty-six percent of them are in TWPC. As a result, the use of Taiwan water resource is seriously influenced. Furthermore, I make an analysis of these four important reservoirs in Taiwan. Then I find that the water quality of Feitsui Reservoir is between less eutrophication and few eutrophication; the other three reservoirs are almost in serious eutrophication situation. Compared to other managing organizations, the main differences are the management of land use and side plans. After the study, we need a complete policy to solve the problems, including policy, rules, organization, budget, management model, feedback system,... etc. u Policy 1. Water resource protection policy is a kind of controllable policy. An organization which is controlled by the coalition can be changeable so that the relationship between them is often unstable. Under the competition, cooperating or not is chosen. 2. “Water & Land Resource Protection, Forever Development, Operating Management Enhancement, Resource Effective Use” are latest governmental policies, that means protection is better than use, management is better than development. Fortunately, water resource management is getting noticed. However, although governmental policies are clear, there are still lack of operating policies and managing systems to carry out. u Rules 1. Since there are no united rules about the water resource protection, each agency can make rules by itself. 2. From the perspective of land use, the purpose of the division of water resource protection area is to promote the rate of economics and protect our own property. From the perspective of managing theory, the division of water quality and water quantity belongs to “ special area division. ” 3. The purpose of water resource protection is absolute. The land located in the water resource protection area is almost controlled and no admittance. One is because of opposition from the native residents; the other reason is afraid of wasting land resource. 4. It is necessary to make special laws. There are references, such as National Park Laws, to get ideas about rules, ways, organizations or budget of the water resource area. u Organization 1. The affairs of protecting the water sources involve into many department of the government. In order to avoid the confusion on the responsibilities, the professional organizations should be set up for enforcing these complex affairs. 2. According to the theories of administrative theoretical master, L. D. White : The affairs of enforce and direction should be decided by the chief leader. The plans and decisions of the policies should be managed to commissioners. It is just the professional one response for the decision; on the other hand, trough more people’s discussions, the plans might be complete. 3. The department of managing water source must have a commission setting up in the central government. The commission responds for deciding the policies and coordinating the affairs of every department; locally, the association belongs to the quality of chief decision responds for enforcing affairs. (1) As to the management of the water collecting zone, many problems about the numerous organizations of management and the separation of authority need to be solved soon. In order to resolving these problems, the commission of managing the water collection zone needs to be set up in Executive yuan. To checking the plans from the water sources protection organizations of different zones is the duty of the commission. Besides, the commission also leads the managing item of the water sources protective zone. (2) In order to enforce the managing items of the zone in protecting water source, every water collection zone has to set up water sources protection organization. By resolving the problems of the limit of authority, it should be resolved through the special regulation. Furthermore, makes the authority back to the TWPC and then it has right to manage every item practically. But not only report to the higher level of organization. Of course, organization、efforts、budget of TWPC could reflect the practical needs on the work of management. u Budget 1. Water resources need money to sustain. 2. In accordance with the instruction of Executive Yuan in 1983, Taiwan provincial government and Taipei municipal government should afford normal administration expenses together; Taipei municipal government should special afford budget for protecting water resources. 3. The public has a common sense of paying for what you use. So we don’t need to worry the lack of protection fund; government can reduce expense; everyone has to pay regardless of identity. If the budget is 23 million dollars, the fund occupies 0. 4 dollars per degree, which is 5 percent of utilities. If the budget is 46 million dollars, deducted central government subsidy, the fund occupied 0. 8 dollars per degree, which is 10 percent of utilities. u Management Model 1. In city planning project, zoning could achieve the purpose of water resources protection. Moreover, case-by-case and periodical examination could provide more flexible approaches to zoning control management. 2. According to related laws, authorities can monitor any exploitation and construction activities to substantiate city planning project. 3. To protect water resources, full-time police squadron should be in charge of any illegal incidences. 4. Reservoir administrations should properly use the allocated budget to take precaution against hillside slide, soil erosion together with other soil and water conservation problems. 5. Authorities should keep working on tree planting in riverhead area. 6. Geographic Information Systems, combining images, pictures, categorized data in the computer and professional knowledge, acts as a practical help to decision-making process in riverhead area. 7. How to employ personnel and machine to solve garbage problems should take budget, clearance efficiency, employment and management system into consideration. 8. Sewerage system and professional personnel are needed to cope with local family polluted water in riverhead area. 9. Before coping with pollution problem, the causes of pollution in riverhead should be carefully investigated and analyzed. For example, the removal of hog farms, game boats and village reallocation further improves long-term <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> problems. 10. Riverhead management and planning should both aim at natural and human pollution. u Feedback System 1. Water resource protection policy should also adopt compensation for restricted land use enforcement to the public. 2. TWMC planned schemes for local development. Local government could apply the schemes based on individual cases. u Public Participation 1. Restricted land use around reservoir might cause conflict. We can follow the example of Danai Valley to cooperate with local resident to protect the environment in riverhead. 2. Restricted land utilization will pose an influence on the public’s right. When making laws or acts, authorities should communicate with the public face to face, like what Water Supply Watershed Protection Advisory Council did. 3. In the process of administration and public cooperation to protect water resources, clear proceeding stages should be specified in advance. In a nutshell, wholesome system, specific regulation and administration and public participation are essential elements in protecting water resource. Moreover, police should investigate and fine illegal activities. This study works on water resource management problems. Authorities could delegate organizations to perform the mission of protection of water resources in one hand, and to enhance compensation mechanism between protection and exploitation. To fundamentally eradicate problems and to maintain permanent management, riverhead protection regarding regulations should be instituted and introduced. 臺灣水源區因降雨時空分布、地質不良等先天不足，再加上人為破壞、制度不全等後天失調，雖然劃設了各種保護區加以種種管制，但仍面臨「水太多」、「水太少」與「水太髒」的窘境；究其原因，主要是對水源區一直缺乏強有力的經營策略與管理機制，致使水資源保育政策難予落實，終致其成效大打折扣。 本研究先從現階段政策面與水源區現況作全面檢討分析，從初步檢討分析中得知：臺灣水庫淤積及污染嚴重，有 22. 5 %水庫之淤積率超過 50 %，有 56 %之水庫呈優養化狀態，已嚴重影響到臺灣水資源之有效利用。 再以臺灣重要水源區設有專責管理機關之四座水庫（翡翠、石門、德基、曾文）作進一步探討時發現，水體水質除翡翠水庫介於貧養與普養之間外，其餘三座水庫均瀕臨優養狀態。比較其管理機關之業務執掌，認為土地利用管理及其他配套措施是其主要不同處，且愈早期設立及地文條件愈差者，問題愈嚴重。 經探討研究之後，得知需要有一完整的策略方能解決問題，包括政策、法規、組織、經費、管理治理方式內容、配套措施等。 一、政策 (一) 水源保護政策屬於管制性政策，受管制者常常透過聯盟（coalition）方式，使其於執行過程中的立場常生變動，致其管制關係常形成一種不穩定之情境，在此種競爭場合中，存在著各種合作與不合作之型態。 (二) 政府對水資源的現階段政策為「保育水土資源，落實永續發展。加強經營管理，有效利用資源。」，即保育重於利用、管理重於開發；水源管理工作漸漸受到重視，政府政策內容雖然明確，但仍缺乏強有力的經營策略與管理機制，致使水資源保育政策難予落實。 二、法規 (一) 既有相關水源保護區的劃定程序並沒有一個統一的規定，而由各個相關法律個別規定或承辦機關自行決定。 (二) 從土地利用的角度看，水源保護區的劃設，屬於土地使用分區管制的一環，其目的在於提高資源配置的經濟效率、保護資源型公共財。從管理理論的觀點看，水源水質水量保護區的劃定，乃屬於「特殊分區」的管制手段。 (三) 相關法規對「水質」的保護，均將水質保護的目的予以絕對化，其區域內土地使用之管制，近乎全面禁止的性質，一方面常遭致地方居民反彈，同時也浪費了土地資源。。 (四) 需要另訂專屬法規，其內容可參考檢討內容及類似法規（如國家公園法），明訂水源區劃設之原則、方式、管制內容、管理機關組織架構、經費預算來源及相關配套措施（如回饋、警察等）。 三、組織 (一) 水源區保護工作牽涉多個部會，為避免互相推諉致責任不明，應設立專責機關負責執行。 (二) 依行政學大師懷特（L．D．White）：執行與指導的事務應採首長制，政策的尋求與決定應採委員制；亦即「任專宜專其責，議事當廣其謀」之理論。 (三) 水源管理單位在中央應設一委員會，決定政策與協調各部會相關事宜；在地方則設首長制機關，負責執行事務。 1. 針對各集水區的管制，為解決目前主管機關眾多以及權限零散的問題，應於行政院設「集水區管理委員會」，職司審議各集水區水源保護局所提的治理計畫，及水源保護區的管制事項。 2. 為執行水源保護區的管制事項，「集水區管理委員會」並於各水源保護區設「水源保護局」。為解決法定權限問題，應透過「水源區管理法」的特別規定，將各相關法律所規定有關水源保護區的管制權限，劃歸「水源保護局」，使其有實際的管理權限，而非向各主管機關查報而已。當然，「水源保護局」的組織、人力、預算，應能充分反應管制工作現實上的需要。 四、經費 (一) 水源保護工作需要有經費做支撐。 (二) 臺北水源會預算編列係依 72 年行政院指示：「一般行政所需費用由臺灣省與臺北市各 1 / 2 共同負擔；為保護水源所為之專項經費，則由臺北市全額負擔。」辦理，然而目前各方財源驟減，時空背景也已大幅改變，行政院指示函應不再適用。 (三) 「使用者付費原則」已獲一般民眾共識，也較符合社會公平性。以臺北水源會年平均預算數約 2. 3 億元（不包括專案）為例，如果由水費附徵，每度約 0. 4 元，約占水費 5 %；既使包括專案，扣除中央補助款，年平均預算 4. 6 億元計，由水費附徵，每度約 0. 8 元，約占水費 10 %。以此比例，相信用水者一定可以接受。如此一來，一者可確保保護經費之無虞；二者可減少各級政府的正常財務支出；三者使用者不分省市民眾，均需負擔保護經費，避免政治性紛擾。 五、經營管理模式 (一) 運用都市計畫為工具，以不影響水源保護之前提下，依據各地區不同程度之發展需求及保護目的，劃設不同之分區，並予以不同程度的管制，可以做到分區分級管制之目的。依都市計畫法規定，尚可以辦理個案變更及定期通盤檢討，是具有彈性的分級分區管理模式。 (二) 建築法規範開發建築行為，是執行都市計畫最主要的輔助法。且建築主管機關可依建築法視需要指定，這在執行管制上，是一個非常好用的方法。 (三) 專屬警察隊確實對違規行為的查報、取締與維護水源居功厥偉；因此配屬專業警察隊是保護水源不可或缺的重要因子之一。 (四) 水源區一般都存在著坡地崩塌、土壤沖蝕等問題，為有效解決上述因素，並防止大量土砂下移至水庫區，水庫管理機關均持續執行防砂工程、崩塌地處理、溪流整治等水土保持工作。囿於政府預算額度所限，水土保持工作更需運用智慧妥為規劃，使最少的經費發揮最大的效益。 (五) 造林除可減低表土沖蝕，對水庫壽命及水源之涵養具有正面之功效。管理單位應將水源區內不當使用之土地，儘速收回後予以造林。 (六) 地理資訊系統（Geographic Information Systems）係使用影像、圖檔及相關屬性資料為分析材料，電腦為工具，結合技術人員專業知識，整合分析後提供決策支援，在幅員廣闊的水源區為非常實用的工具。 (七) 由於政府編制有限，人力不足且民間清運效率高故未來垃圾之清運宜採委託清運方式辦理為佳，至於研究採機具公有、勞務委辦亦或機具勞務均委辦之方式可從清運經費、清運效率、用人制度、管理制度、車輛機具及實際狀況等因素加予考量。 (八) 水源區居民多沿河川兩旁居住，其所產生之家庭廢污水，自然往河川排放，直接對水體造成嚴重影響，需儘速興建污水下水道，排除此污染源。而下水道之興建因屬都市型建設，用在偏遠且高低起伏大之水源區，在設計尚需作調整考量。另污水下水道系統之營運管理上亟需專業技術人力，在組織編制人力無法擴編及技術考量下，可委由民間機構代為操作維護。 (九) 水源區的污染源需要事先進行全面詳細調查、分析，依輕重緩急研擬對策、分期實施，才能徹底解決問題。以養豬戶處理為例，水源會係於 75 年度辦理，反觀高雄地區至今才要辦理，可見當年之正確性與前瞻性；遊艇收購處理減少了遊客直接污染水域之機會；遷村計畫則進一步徹底解決了水庫南岸長久困擾水庫的土地不當利用與違規情形。 (十) 水源區整體經營治理，應包括自然及人為污染兩因素分予研擬規劃，其管理計畫及治理方案，可以臺北特定區經營之管理計畫及治理方案為模式。 六、回饋制度 (一) 水源保護政策既然屬於管制性政策，於執行過程中與受管制者之關係常存在著各種不合作之型態，而「使用者付費，受限者得償」已經是大眾所能接受的共識，在管理制度上，絕對有必要納入「回饋」相關辦法以消弭兩者間之衝突與不滿。 (二) 臺北水源會目前執行的「協助地方建設辦法」，精神上係屬於回饋的一種，因屬全國首創，在執行上仍有改進的空間；然而由各鄉市公所視其特性、需要，自行規劃運用的方式，既可符合地方需求，又可減少民眾對政府的不滿，實可供各管理機關參考。 七、民眾參與 (一) 水庫興建後為維護水庫水質，對集水區內土地使用必須採取限制手段，衝突自難倖免；加以牽涉法令甚多，整合不易；對既得利益者而言，反彈聲浪甚囂塵上。如能引進當地民眾為協助執法者，化阻力為助力，對整個管制工作將有結構性的助益。國內「達娜伊谷」例說明由當地居民參與保護工作，可收事半功倍之效。 (二) 由於水源區的分類影響到區內土地利用、住宅，及工商活動之限制，涉及人民權益，因此美國北卡羅萊納州水源區土地管理有將「民眾參與」納入管理機制中的例子。設計民眾代表加入供水集水區保護顧問委員會(Water Supply Watershed Protection Advisory Council) ，舉辦一系列說明會及公聽會與民眾溝通，反覆修改法規及草案。 (三) 由實際瞭解水源區居民問題癥結後，個人以為，水源區民眾參與管理方式不會立即自動的展開，民眾參與的典範(模式) 亟須建立，其轉移更需要時間，其間難免遭遇許多來自內在、外在的阻力和抗拒。在推動民眾參與水源區管理應逐步擬定計畫分期實施。 綜上，水源區的保護要做好，必須要有健全的制度、專屬法規、專責執行機關，透過詳細規劃、配合民眾參與，依影響水源程度，擬出先後辦理程序依序處理，另配屬警察對違規行為進行查報取締，至於所需經費則由使用者負擔。 本研究針對臺灣地區水資源管理上的問題，在參酌政策理論及永續性發展理念，認為中期可以透過協調、委託、授權等方式授予專責機構足夠權力去執行水源保護業務，同時強化補償與參與機能等方式，去調和水源區保護與開發的衝突。然而，若欲使問題獲得長期的解決並達到永續性管理制度的目標，則必須透過「水源區管理法」的制定，作較大幅度且根本的調整並進行制度之設計。封面 謝誌 中文摘要 Abstract 目錄 表目錄 圖目錄 第一章緒論 第一節研究動機與目的 第二節研究方法、範圍與內容 第三節研究架構與流程 第二章水源保護政策相關理論探討 第一節政策內容因素 第二節政策執行系絡因素 第三節現階段水資源政策 第三章現況與問題分析 第一節自然條件 第二節水源區現況 第三節水源保護區 第四節管理制度 第四章研究區域概述 第一節翡翠水庫 第二節石門水庫 第三節德基水庫 第四節曾文水庫 第五節臺北水源特定區 第六節研究區域分析比較 第五章臺北水源特定區經營管理模式現況與檢討 第一節組織架構 第二節經費預算 第三節經營管理策略 第六章分析與討論 第一節水源保護政策 第二節機關組織 第三節經費預算 第四節經營管理模式 第五節回饋制度 第六節民眾參與 第七節法規探討 第七章結論與建議 參考文獻 個人資...|$|E

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>use</b> and <b>land</b> cover (LULC) change {{information}} {{is essential in}} urban planning and management. With the rapid urbanization in China, many <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> developments have emerged in some rapidly developing regions and have caused irreversible environmental problems, posing a threat to sustainable urban development. Short-interval monitoring of LULC change therefore is necessary in these regions to control and prevent <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> developments at an early stage. Conventional optical remote sensing is limited by weather conditions and has difficulties collecting timely data in tropical regions characterized by frequent cloud cover. Radar remote sensing, not affected by clouds, is therefore a potential tool for collecting timely LULC information in these regions. Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) is more suitable than single-polarization SAR for monitoring LULC change because it can discriminate different types of scattering mechanisms. The overall objective {{of this study is}} to conduct short-interval monitoring of LULC change using RADARSAT- 2 PolSAR images. Classification methods that achieve high accuracy for PolSAR images are essential in monitoring LULC change. In this study, a new method, based on the integration of polarimetric decomposition, PolSAR interferometry, object-oriented image analysis, and decision tree algorithms, is proposed for LULC classification using RADARSAT- 2 PolSAR data. A comparison between the proposed classification method and Wishart supervised classification which is commonly used for the classification of PolSAR data showed that the proposed method can significantly improve LULC classification accuracy. Polarimetric decomposition, PolSAR interferometry, object-oriented image analysis, and decision tree algorithms have been determined to contribute to the improvement achieved by the proposed classification method. Selection of appropriate incidence angle is important in LULC classification using PolSAR images because incidence angle influences the intensity and patterns of radar return. Based on the proposed classification method, the present study further investigates the influence of incidence angle on LULC classification using RADARSAT- 2 PolSAR images. LULC classifications using incidence angles of 31. 50 and 37. 56 ° were conducted separately. The influence of incidence angle on the classification was investigated by comparing the results of the two independent classifications. The comparison showed that large incidence angle performs much better than small incidence angle in the classification of different vegetation types, whereas small incidence angle outperforms large incidence angle in reducing the confusion between urban/built-up areas and vegetation, that between vegetable and barren land, and that among barren land, water, and lawn. Considering that the detection of urban/built-up areas and barren land is important in monitoring <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> developments, small incidence angle is more suitable than large incidence angle in monitoring <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> developments. Change detection methods that achieve high accuracy for PolSAR data are also essential in monitoring LULC change. The current study proposes a new method for LULC change detection using RADARSAT- 2 PolSAR images. The proposed change detection method combines change vector analysis (CVA) and post-classification comparison (PCC) to detect LULC changes using object-oriented image analysis. The classification of PolSAR images is based on the proposed classification method. Compared with the PCC based on Wishart supervised classification, the proposed change detection method can achieve much higher accuracy for LULC change detection. Further investigation indicated that CVA, PCC, and object-oriented image analysis all contribute to the higher accuracy achieved by the proposed change detection method. Short-interval monitoring of LULC change was carried out using a time series of RADARSAT- 2 PolSAR images. The monitoring was based on monthly LULC change detection using the proposed change detection method and appropriate incidence angle. The influence of environmental factors on short-interval monitoring of LULC change was investigated by analyzing the monthly change detection results. Paddy harvesting and planting, seasonal crop growth, and change in soil moisture and surface roughness were found to exert significant influence on the short-interval monitoring of LULC change. High accuracy can be achieved for short-interval monitoring of construction sites and bulldozed <b>land</b> <b>using</b> RADARSAT- 2 PolSAR images. However, paddy harvesting and growth still cause false alarms on the monitoring of these two LULC classes. The study indicated that conducting short-interval monitoring of LULC change using RADARSAT- 2 PolSAR images is effective. High accuracy can be achieved for short-interval monitoring of construction sites and bulldozed <b>land</b> <b>using</b> the proposed change detection and classification methods, which can provide important information for the control and prevention of <b>illegal</b> <b>land</b> developments at an early stage. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
