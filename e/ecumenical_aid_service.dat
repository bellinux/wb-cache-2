40|$|Skripsie (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1990 The {{main purpose}} of this investigation, namely an {{appreciation}} of the Education <b>Aid</b> <b>Service</b> of the TED, was briefly formulated in Chapter 1. Central concepts as used in the study, were broadly defined. Chapter 2 is mainly a review of relevant literature and deals with the aim and functioning of Guidance <b>Services</b> I Education <b>Aid</b> <b>Services</b> in general, with specific reference to the organization and administration of such services and the nature of guidance programmes in the United States of America, Britain and West Germany. Different approaches to Guidance and the principles of Guidance Services were reviewed. The training and qualifications of Guidance personnel in the • above-mentioned countries were also investigated. The aim of this review was to set criterion on which the Education <b>Aid</b> <b>Service</b> of the TED could be judged in chapter 5. The origin and development of the Education <b>Aid</b> <b>Service</b> of the TED since its modest inception in 1914 is described in chapter 3. This was outlined in four clearly distinguishable stages, viz. the origin and development of the Psychological Service, the development of the Vocational Guidance Service, the amalgamation of these two services in 1955 and the inception of the present Education <b>Aid</b> <b>Service</b> in 1983. The aims and policy, organization and administration as well as personnel aspects of the Transvaal Education <b>Aid</b> <b>Service</b> of the present day were investigated in chapter 4. A distinction was drawn between the general guidance program in schools and the activities of the specialised field of the Education Aid Centres and Child Guidance Clinics. The Education <b>Aid</b> <b>Service</b> was evaluated in chapter 5 and general conclusions derived from the study were summarized. A few recommendations based on these conclusions were finally made. They include an empirical investigation into the aims of the present guidance programmes of the Education <b>Aid</b> <b>Service,</b> a change in approach by the Educational Aid Centre, understaffing at Child Guidance Clinics and Education Aid Centres, physical facilities for guidance in schools and training and qualifications of guidance personnel.
