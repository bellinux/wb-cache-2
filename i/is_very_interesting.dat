25|$|The book <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting,</b> but {{you still}} need more evidence. We don't regard it as an {{historical}} book, but as a narrative one. I {{want to see more}} proof. But at least Menzies has started something, and people could find more evidence.|$|E
25|$|The Whistle! {{series has}} {{received}} good reception. A review by Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics {{stated that the}} Whistle! manga had good drawings that showed the characters move around with the soccer ball during matches. David Welsh of Precocious Curmudgeon said the series <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> that {{those who do not}} have soccer background will enjoy reading the manga, {{as well as with the}} realistic illustration used.|$|E
25|$|The town of Willow Bunch is {{occupied}} with Francophone and Métis people who settled upon these lands. The history {{in this small}} town <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> to Saskatchewan. The Métis {{played an important role}} in Saskatchewan history. Yet the Métis had fewer advantages in the Francophone town and they had very passive voices. Even today, the Métis are still trying to regain their rights and to educate about the history of the Métis and the roles they played. Just like First Nations peoples, Métis face the same inequality and misconceptions from non-Métis peoples.|$|E

25|$|Six tombs {{were built}} on a {{perfectly}} outlined patio, one of them unfinished; there is another one associated to this group with the same characteristics; the walls are made with stone blocks perfectly cut and jointed with mortar; the floor is compacted earth; the tombs are covered by large stone slabs, some with worked edges. The location dimensions of six of them <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> as they were constructed symmetrically; in {{the central part of}} the group, the slab forming the roof of tomb number 2 serves as weight to number 4, that is oriented perpendicularly, with a cruciform aspect although in fact they are two rectangles. Each grave contained remains of an adult primary burial accompanied by rich and numerous offerings consisting of pottery, shell objects, bone and stone tools. A three by eighteen ditch was excavated, in which sixty three primary and secondary burials were found with numerous fragments clearly identified as decapitations or mutilations, that is to say, skulls with the atlas and maxillary bone in place or the bones of an arm with hand but without the rest of the body.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz {{was inspired}} to write the episode after watching the 1972 American thriller film Deliverance. Spotnitz recounted, [...] "the idea of being stranded in a hostile environment <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> to me {{and so is the}} idea of something moving the brush that you can't see." [...] Series writer Vince Gilligan contributed to the [...] "team builder" [...] exercise bit. The ending was left intentionally ambiguous. Spotnitz explained, [...] "it's scarier if you think [...] could still be out there." ...|$|E
500|$|In Revenge of the Sith, McDiarmid {{played a}} darker {{interpretation}} of the character. He explained that [...] "when you're playing a character of solid blackness, that in itself <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting,</b> {{in the sense that}} you have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power." [...] He admitted, [...] "I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera." [...] McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare's Othello: ...|$|E

500|$|When Lisa Edelstein (Dr. Cuddy) heard {{she had to}} do a strip {{scene in}} the episode, she called actress Sheila Kelley, wife of Richard Schiff (with whom Edelstein had worked {{previously}} on The West Wing and Relativity). Kelley had worked on a movie about strippers long ago and Edelstein asked her for her advice on the choreography of the striptease. On the episode itself, Edelstein commented: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> what happens {{in the first half of}} the finale in terms of learning about how House sees people and getting the world from his point of view entirely". Before the filming of the scene started, Edelstein showed the dance to Hugh Laurie, who, according to Edelstein, was [...] "incredibly supportive, like a cheerleader". Edelstein commented that after the scene was filmed she, [...] "felt beautiful, and it ended up being a really lovely experience".|$|E

2500|$|Observers of Martian {{topography}} {{will notice}} a dichotomy between {{the northern and}} southern hemispheres. [...] Most of the northern hemisphere is flat, with few impact craters, and lies below the conventional ‘zero elevation’ level. In contrast, the southern hemisphere is mountains and highlands, mostly well above zero elevation. The two hemispheres differ in elevation by 1 to 3km. [...] The border separating the two areas <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> to geologists.|$|E

2500|$|When it was proved Mantell {{was correct}} in 1825, the only {{question}} was what to call his new reptile. His original name was [...] "Iguana-saurus" [...] but he then {{received a letter from}} William Daniel Conybeare, [...] "Your discovery of the analogy between the Iguana and the fossil teeth <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> but the name you propose will hardly do, because it is equally applicable to the recent iguana. Iguanoides or Iguanodon would be better." [...] Mantell took this advice to heart and called his creature Iguanodon.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} year (1969) that Jensen proved NFU consistent, Grishin proved [...] consistent. [...] is the {{fragment}} of NF with full extensionality (no urelements) and those instances of Comprehension which can be stratified using just three types. This theory is a very awkward medium for mathematics (although there have been attempts to alleviate this awkwardness), largely {{because there is no}} obvious definition for an ordered pair. Despite this awkwardness, [...] <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> because every infinite model of TST restricted to three types satisfies Amb. Hence for every such model there is a model of [...] with the same theory. This does not hold for four types: [...] is the same theory as NF, and we have no idea how to obtain a model of TST with four types in which Amb holds.|$|E
2500|$|A {{winemaking}} {{technique called}} [...] "reducing" [...] or [...] "technology" [...] has been developed. Very fashionable in Australia and New Zealand, this technique seeks highly aromatic white wines and <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> on aromatic varieties such as Sauvignon B, Colombard B, and Riesling B, although less so for varieties such as Chardonnay B. It works by limiting Premature oxidation in the must or the wine at {{all stages of}} development. The use of inert gases such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2) isolates the grapes from oxygen from the air and cold partially inhibits the action of oxidative enzymes in the must. Tyrosinase, a natural enzyme in the grape, and laccase, an enzyme coming from the gray mold are very active in oxidation. Laccase can be eliminated by sorting the grapes. Strong limitation {{on the amount of}} polyphenols in the wine by reducing the time between harvest and pressing is another technique that aims to make a very light wine, protected from yellowing.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 several {{previously}} unpublished {{letters from}} Hughes to Craig Raine {{were published in}} the literary review Areté. They relate mainly to the process of editing Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being, and also contain a sequence of drafts of letters in which Raine attempts to explain to Hughes his disinclination to publish Hughes's poem The Cast in an anthology he was editing, {{on the grounds that it}} might open Hughes to further attack on the subject of Sylvia Plath. [...] "Dear Ted, Thanks for the poem. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> and would cause a minor sensation" [...] (4 April 1997). The poem was eventually published in Birthday Letters and Hughes makes a passing reference to this then unpublished collection: [...] "I have a whole pile of pieces that are all – one way or another – little bombs for the studious and earnest to throw at me" [...] (5 April 1997).|$|E
