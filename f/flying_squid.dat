5|$|Within its range, the blackmouth {{catshark}} {{is one of}} the most abundant sharks over the upper and middle continental slope. It is nomadic in nature and may be found alone or in groups. Relatively slow, this shark swims with strong eel-like (anguilliform) undulations of its body. It often cruises just above the sea floor, perhaps taking advantage of the ground effect (a reduction in the drag on a wing when close to the ground) to save energy. It has also been seen resting motionless on the bottom. Known predators of the {{blackmouth catshark}} include the kitefin shark (Dalatias licha) and the European <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> (Todarodes sagittatus).

5|$|In the North Pacific, {{they feed}} on euphausiids in the genera Euphausia, Thysanoessa, and Nyctiphanes, large copepods in the genus Neocalanus, small {{schooling}} fish (e.g. the genera Engraulis, Mallotus, Clupea, and Theragra), and squid. Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58°N), their main prey species were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, Cololabis saira; and Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the diversity and}} distribution of two communities, micronekton organisms and large predatory fishes, sampled in mesoscale features of the Mozambique Channel from 2003 to 2009, by combining mid-water trawls, stomach contents of fish predators and instrumented longline fishing surveys. The highest species richness for assemblages was found in divergences and fronts {{rather than in the}} core of eddies. Despite an unbalanced scheme, diversity indices did not differ significantly between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, divergences and fronts. We found that eddies and associated physical cues did not substantially affect the distribution of micronektonic species which are mainly driven by the diel vertical migration pattern. Top predators exhibited a more complex response. Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) associated better with mesoscale features than tunas, with a clear preference for divergences which is consistent with the diel vertical migrations and occurrence of its main prey, the <b>flying</b> <b>squids</b> Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis (Ommastrephidae). On the other hand, the probability of presence of yellowfin tuna was not tied to any specific eddy structure. However, the highest values of positive yellowfin CPUEs were associated with low horizontal gradients of sea-level anomalies. We also showed a non-linear response of positive yellowfin CPUEs with respect to the depth of the minimal oxygen content. The larger the distance between the hooks and the minimal oxygen layer, towards the surface or at greater depths, the higher the CPUE, highlighting that yellowfin congregated in well-oxygenated waters. Micronekton sampled by mid-water trawls and stomach contents exhibited different species composition. The highly mobile organisms were not caught by trawling whereas they remain accessible to predators. The combination of stomach contents and mid-water trawls undoubtedly improved our understanding of the micronekton assemblage distribution. Our results provide some evidence that mesoscale features in the Mozambique Channel do not strongly affect the distribution of the mid-trophic level organisms such as micronekton and most of the large predatory fishes, and hypotheses are proposed to support this result...|$|R
40|$|Comunicación presentada en el European Mycoplasma Meeting: Mycoplasmas - A Practical Approach, celebrado los días 6 y 7 de junio de 2013 en Dubrovnik (Croacia) Mollicutes {{have been}} found in nearly all living beings on the planet. Mycoplasma species have been {{reported}} in marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds) and fish. Among marine invertebrates, Mollicutes have been identified in bryozoans, American oysters, corals and a variety of marine crustacean species like crayfish and shrimps. This work describes the methodology and the attempts to isolate mollicutes from non-mammal marine animals. One hundred and seven fish of twenty one different species, seven octopus (Octopus vulgaris), two European <b>flying</b> <b>squids</b> (Todarodes sagittatus) and four batches of jellyfish (Pelagia nocticula) were tested for the presence of mollicutes. Samples were cultured using a variation of the SP 4 -II medium. Originally the SP 4 -II medium was supplemented with 1. 5 % of NaCl and incubated at 18 ºC anaerobically. However, after the first isolation was obtained, the growth conditions were adjusted to 3 % of NaCl and aerobically incubation at 25 ºC. DNA was extracted after one month of incubation and a Class Mollicutes real time PCR has been done. Mollicutes isolations were obtained from squid in three samples; two from octopus and four from jellyfish. It was not possible to get isolations from fish, although two samples gave positive to the class PCR. Isolates were analyzed biochemically and genetically (16 S- 23 S Intergenic Spacer Region (ISR) and 16 S rDNA). PCR products were sent for sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were compared using the GeneBank software. A partial 16 S rDNA sequence from a jellyfish isolation was classified as Spiroplasma spp. 16 S rDNA and ISR from squids and octopus isolations differs significantly from all known Mycoplasma species, but have 98 - 99 % of similarity with a partial 16 S rDNA sequence (738 bp; AY 226323) detected in environmental samples (brine water, Mediterranean Sea) Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Cephalopods are {{marine organisms}} which {{play a crucial}} role in the food webs of all the world oceans both as preys and predators. They are also {{actively}} exploited in many areas, with a rapid increase of their commercial value in the last decades. Despite this, the knowledge on the role of cephalopods in the host-parasite relationships is partial and frammentary, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea. This doctoral thesis was aimed to analyze the parasite fauna of 15 species and the orders Octopoda, Sepiida, Sepiolida, Myopsida, and Oegopsida, collected during research programs from the seas surrounding Sardinia (Geographic Sub-Area 11, code: GSA 11). Some of the collected octopuses and squids are of commercial interest while other have only ecological importance, and/or are very rare in western Mediterranean. Techniques of light microscopy were mostly used for morphologic analyses and the parasites were examined as fresh mounts. Histological sections of infected organs were also examined, to find evidences of pathological effects. Furthermore, SEM microscopy for details of external morphology, and molecular tools to determine the species of Anisakis spp. third-stage larvae were used. The host-parasite complexes were also epidemiologically investigated, highlighting the relationships between levels of infections and sex, maturity, size, or geographic area of sampling. Among protozoans, five associations between the coccidian genus Aggregata and cephalopods were observed: Aggregata octopiana in the common octopus; A. sagittata in T. sagittatus, as a new geographical record; a probably new species in Histioteuthidae, here described in detail; and two cases in A. lichtensteinii and R. macrosoma. To date, only two species of these coccidians were known in the Mediterranean Sea. The helminth parasite fauna collected were dominated by third-stage larvae of anisakid nematodes of the species Anisakis pegreffii, A. physeteris and Lappetascaris sp. Type A (sensu Nagasawa and Moravec, 2002). With only one exception (one larva in E. cirrhosa), these roundworms were all found in Oegopsida. The same is valid for the digenean metacercariae of the family Didymozoidae, observed only in <b>flying</b> <b>squids.</b> Among Cestoda, plerocercoid larvae of Tetraphyllidea were the only harboured by octopods, even with infection indices lower than those observed in oegopsid squids. Trypanorhyncha plerocercoids of the genus Nybelinia were exclusively detected in Todarodes sagittatus. Regarding Anisakis species is important to remark the high values of infection of these zoonotic agents observed in commercial squids as Illex coindetii, T. sagittatus and Todaropsis eblanae. These data should provide basic information in the planning of food safety related to the consumption of raw or undercooked cephalopods. Histological observations of the lesions highlited the typical inflammatory response of molluscs to protozoan and metazoan infections, e. g. cystic encapsulation of parasites, hemocytic infiltration and distension of tissues. One interesting question deals with how the impact of such environmental biotic stressors as parasitic diseases may affect the dynamics of cephalopod populations, also since positive correlations were generally observed between prevalence and intensity of infections and the size and sexual maturity of hosts. Possible reasons include the increased feeding that occurs with growth and a change in diet with growth. Host sex-related preference were not markedly seen, although females are slightly more involved as hosts than males. The centrality of cephalopods in the oceanic food web is strongly confirmed by their role as intermediate and paratenic hosts for anisakids, didymozoids and cestodes which exploit their mobility to reach their definitive hosts in different levels of the water column. This indicates that squids in particular are prey items of primary importance for large marine top predators as cetaceans, scombrids, and elasmobranchs rispectively. A decrease in the abundance of parasites relatively to depth of trawl samplings was observed, excepted for that of Lappetascaris sp. Type A whose this infection index was very higher in lower bottoms. Given also the fact that the intermediate hosts of Aggregata spp. are usually benthic crustaceans, the findings of these parasites in neritic cephalopod hosts suggest that their feeding habits include a substantial component of predation in the seabed of the continental slope. Moreover, it seems to indicate that the still unknown definitive host for Lappetascaris sp. Type A may be a large demersal teleost. Data collected allowed to evaluate the potential use of some taxa of parasites as biological indicators of ecology and biology of cephalopod hosts, particularly concerning their trophic links with predators and preys, and the variations in diet depending on size or depth. These informations may represent a contribute to an holistic and multidisciplinary approach in the study on marine biocenosis including resources which need accurate management and prediction models for exploitation...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying {{variation}} in animals' paleodiet from {{the fossil record}} is difficult as a continuous record of their remains is difficult to obtain. Here we assess dietary change in seabirds from Guangjin Island, Xisha Archipelago, South China Sea, by using stable nitrogen isotopes in seabird bones and prey remains collected from a coral sand ornithogenic sediment profile. N- 15 of seabird bone collagen varied from 11. 7 parts per thousand to 14. 1 parts per thousand (averaging 12. 8 parts per thousand +/- 0. 4 parts per thousand), but that of fish bones and scales showed minor variations. Flying fish and squid are two favorite foods of tropical seabirds, and the average values of muscle N- 15 in typical <b>flying</b> fish and <b>squid</b> samples were 9. 2 parts per thousand and 10. 2 parts per thousand, respectively. Based on nitrogen isotope mass balance calculation, we conclude that flying fish accounts for 80 % +/- 40 % of seabird diet averaged over the past 1200 years, but this prey accounted for only about 37 % +/- 30 % during the Little Ice Age' (AD 1400 - 1850). Flying fish averaged up to 88 % +/- 2 % during the Medieval Warm Period' (AD 850 - 1200), close to modern observed value of 89. 6 %. Thus, it appears that seabirds on Guangjin Island mainly preyed on flying fish during warm periods, and shift to squid during cooler periods. Our results suggest that recent global warming and human activities have likely caused a rapid decrease in tropical seabird population and dietary shift...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In this paper, we {{describe}} the skulls of Magnificent Frigatebird Fregata magnificens (Fregatidae) and Brown Booby (Sulidae) Sula leucogaster, with focus on the structures associated with the Musculi mandibulae. We discuss the results {{in the context of}} the feeding biology of the two species, which feed mainly on <b>flying</b> fish and <b>squids.</b> Frigatebirds capture prey from just above, or just below, the water surface in flight. The hook-shaped Apex maxillae in F. magnificens can be viewed as an adaptation for grasping prey from near the water surface. Boobies catch prey by plunging; thus, the dorsoventrally flattened skull and conical bill of S. leucogaster may reduce water resistance when it dives, or swims underwater. The bill is long in both species, such that it is on average 70 % of the whole skull length in F. magnificens and 60 % in S. leucogaster. Consequently, the Mm. mandibulae in the two species are more posteriorly positioned relative to the Apex rostri. This results in low mechanical advantage for the mandible opening-closing lever, indicating adaptations for a fast, rather than a strong, bite. Fast-moving mandibles would be advantageous for ‘mandibulating’ prey while swallowing. The Fossa musculorum temporalium and the Palatum osseum in both species provide a broad area for origins of the Musculus adductor mandibulae externus (all parts) and the Musculus pterygoideus. The Processus orbitalis quadrati is longer and thicker in F. magnificens than in S. leucogaster, and so is the Musculus pseudotemporalis profundus. We suggest that Mm. adductores mandibulae are relatively well developed in the two species; therefore, their mandibulae are still probably capable of a powerful adduction. In both species there is a mechanisms that contribute to protect the jaws from disarticulation and damage. Such mechanism involves the incorporation of a ‘flange-like’ Crista intercotylare on the Margo medialis cotylae medialis fossae articularis quadratica that grips the Condylus medialis quadrati. In S. leucogaster, the retractor-stop ‘notch’ formed by Ossa lacrimale et nasale also serves to protect the jaws against sudden external forces when birds are diving or swimming underwater for prey. A more detailed hypothesis for the jaw movements and strength in F. magnificens and in S. leucogaster and their relation with feeding habits should necessarily incorporate data on the jaw and anterior neck musculatures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCharacteristics of the {{tropical}} oceanic environment (low productivity, little seasonality) and poor diversity of tropical seabird foraging methods and prey relative to temperate and polar species suggest that tropical seabirds overall encompass a narrow range of isotopic niches, with large overlaps among species. To test this hypothesis, we examined the stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotopic composition of blood and feathers of 5 seabird species from Europa Island, Mozambique Channel. While differences were small, blood δ 13 C and δ 15 N values characterized 5 distinct and non-overlapping trophic niches during the breeding period. Seabirds used 2 distinct foraging areas (δ 13 C), one used by sooty tern Sterna fuscata and white-tailed tropicbird Phaethon lepturus and one used by red-footed booby Sula sula and great Fregata minor and lesser F. ariel frigatebirds. Seabird species overall encompassed less than 1 trophic level (δ 15 N), which is in agreement with a diet mainly based on <b>flying</b> fish and <b>squid.</b> Feather δ 13 C and δ 15 N values showed that the trophic structure of the community was different during the breeding and non-breeding (moulting) periods, suggesting {{a shift in the}} feeding ecology when adult birds were no longer central-place foragers. The stable isotope method underlined sex-related (red-footed booby) and age-related (great frigatebird immatures and adults) feeding strategies. It also suggested that breeding adults could feed themselves on different prey than those given to their chicks (sooty tern). Within {{the tropical}} pelagic ecosystem, seabirds overall shared the same trophic level as large predatory fishes (albacore, yellowfin and skipjack tunas), but they had lower δ 15 N values than the deeper-dwelling bigeye tuna and swordfish. We conclude that analyzing stable isotope values in blood and feathers appears to be a promising alternative method for investigating food and feeding ecology of tropical seabirds year round, and for determining sex- and age-related differences in their foraging strategies. A limitation of the method is the lack of information on marine isoscapes; future studies aimed at isotopically characterizing the tropical marine environment could help to associate consumer signatures to geographic origins...|$|R
