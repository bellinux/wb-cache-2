25|$|His {{interest}} in antiquities—in particular scholarly {{observation of the}} architectural details of historic buildings—became reinforced by his membership of the forerunner of the Royal Historical Society, the Camden Society. Indeed, historical accuracy came to characterise Hosking's approach to architecture, as he sought to mix historical elements in appropriate ways. This eye for historical detail was combined with a concern for equally detailed practical improvements in construction techniques (such as fire retardation, <b>damp</b> <b>proofing,</b> {{and other aspects of}} what has become known today as a branch of civil engineering known as building control).|$|E
25|$|Moisture may ascend into a {{building}} from {{the foundation of a}} wall or gain ingress into {{a building}} from a wet patch of ground, where it meets a solid wall. The manifest result of this process is called damp. One of many methods of resisting such ingresses of water is to construct the wall with several low courses of dense engineering bricks such as Staffordshire blue bricks. This method of <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> appears as a distinctive navy blue band running around the circumference of a building. The efficacy of this means of keeping out damp is more limited by the permeability of the mortar bedding and perpends joining the bricks, than by that of the bricks themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{thickness}} specified for a wall {{is determined}} by such factors as <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> considerations, {{whether or not the}} wall has a cavity, load-bearing requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working. Wall thickness specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in partition walls, others brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base. The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.|$|E

2500|$|Given {{the humid}} {{environment}} directly over running water, mold had {{proven to be}} a problem. The elder Kaufmann called Fallingwater [...] "a seven-bucket building" [...] for its leaks, and nicknamed it [...] "Rising Mildew".

2500|$|In 1838, {{there was}} a flurry of {{entrepreneurial}} activity involving asphalt, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt {{could also be used}} for flooring, <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, both of which were also proliferating in the 19th century. On the London stockmarket, there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from France, Germany and England. And numerous patents were granted in France, with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in England due to their similarity to each other. In England, [...] "Claridge's was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s".|$|E

50|$|A {{physical}} <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course {{made from}} plastic {{can be installed}} into an existing building by cutting into short sections of the mortar course, and installing short sections of the <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course material. This method can provide an extremely effective barrier to rising damp, but is not widely used as it requires experienced contractors to carry out if structural movement is to be avoided and takes considerably longer to install than other types of rising damp treatment. The cost is also several times higher than for other types of rising damp treatment.|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{assessing}} damp is to check for standing water. Removing water with good drainage will remove any form of dampness. Once done, and dampness remains, {{the next step is}} to look for the presence of a damp-proof course. If a damp-proof course is present, it is likely to be functioning, as the materials from which <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> courses are manufactured tend to have a long lifespan. However, it should be acknowledged that there are cases where existing <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> courses fail for one reason or another.|$|R

50|$|<b>Damp</b> <b>proofing</b> {{is defined}} by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as a {{material}} that resists the passage of water with no hydro-static pressure and waterproof as a treatment that resists the passage of water under pressure. Generally <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> keeps moisture out of a building where vapor barriers keep interior moisture from getting into walls. Moisture resistance is not necessarily absolute: it is usually defined by a specific test method, limits, and engineering tolerances.|$|E
50|$|Sandstone for {{the church}} was {{obtained}} from the nearby Yangan quarry and the granite, used in the piers both internally and externally, from Greymare. A <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course, of sheet lead in asphalt was inserted to all the walls.|$|R
50|$|Water {{resistant}} and waterproof often {{refer to}} penetration {{of water in}} its liquid state and possibly under pressure, whereas <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> refers to resistance to humidity or dampness. Permeation of water vapor through a material or structure is reported as a moisture vapor transmission rate.|$|R

50|$|The groundworkers {{are usually}} {{the first and last}} trades {{performed}} on site. They will start the job putting in levels, digging the ground, excavating and concreting the foundations, and building the foundations until the floor is on and the work is up to the <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course (dpc). They are also the team responsible for the drainage; connecting to the existing pipes installing in the new pipes.|$|R
50|$|Concrete {{normally}} allows moisture to {{pass through}} so a vertical <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> barrier is needed. Barriers may be a coating or membrane applied to {{the exterior of the}} concrete. The coating may be asphalt, asphalt emulsion, a thinned asphalt called cutback asphalt, or a rubber polymer. Membranes are rubberized asphalt or epdm rubber. Rubberized products perform better because concrete sometimes develops cracks and the barrier does not crack with the concrete.|$|R
5000|$|A {{damp-proof}} course (DPC) is a barrier through the structure {{designed to prevent}} moisture rising by capillary action such as through a phenomenon known as rising damp. Rising damp {{is the effect of}} water rising from the ground into property. The <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course may be horizontal or vertical. A DPC layer is usually laid below all masonry walls, regardless if the wall is a load bearing wall or a partition wall.|$|R
50|$|Butyl rubber sealant is {{used for}} <b>damp</b> <b>proofing,</b> rubber roof repair and for {{maintenance}} of roof membranes (especially around the edges).

40|$|Abstract. Flexible polymer {{heart valves}} are {{promising}} clinical prostheses for replacement of diseased or malfunctioned natural heart valves. However, the flexible polymer leaflets {{are prone to}} fatigue fracture, which hinders their practicality in clinical applications. In this study, micro strain sensor (gauge) for strain measurement is designed in the polyurethane (PU) thin film to measure the stress/strain in situ. In our design, the strain gauge is embedded in PU which is different to the commercial strain gauge of sticking to the sample. The metal layer of strain gauge {{used in this study}} is gold. The overall size of the designed strain gauge is 1 mm x 1 mm x 0. 1 μm and the resistance value was measured to be 200 ± 30 Ω. The static test of strain gauge without <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> shows that gauge sensitivity G was measured to be 4 and 1. 8 when strain range is less than 1 % and between 1 - 1. 5 %, respectively. While, the static test of strain gauge with <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> shows that gauge sensitivity G was measured to be 2. 6 when strain range is less than 1. 2 %. Dynamic test of strain gauge was also applied in this study...|$|R
50|$|Damp proofing: This is {{waterproofing}} used {{where the}} water table {{is lower than the}} structure and there is good free-draining fill. The membrane deals with shedding of water and the ingress of water vapor only, with no hydrostatic pressure. Generally, this incorporates a <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> membrane (DPM) to the walls with a polythene DPM under slab. With higher grade DPM, some protection from short-term Hydrostatic pressure can be gained by transitioning the higher quality wall DPM to the slab polythene under footing, rather than at the footing face.|$|R
50|$|Dry rot (Serpula lacrymans) is {{considered}} difficult to remove, requiring drastic action. Remedial timber treatment and <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> companies typically recommend stripping out of building fabric beyond the visible {{extent of the}} infestation {{and the use of}} fungicide. More holistic approaches attempt to eradicate dry rot by controlling the local environment to reduce timber moisture levels and increase ventilation in order to promote drying.|$|E
50|$|Common {{measures}} {{of the effectiveness of}} a building envelope include physical protection from weather and climate (comfort), indoor air quality (hygiene and public health), durability and energy efficiency. In order to achieve these objectives, all building enclosure systems must include a solid structure, a drainage plane, an air barrier, a thermal barrier, and may include a vapor barrier. Moisture control (e.g. <b>damp</b> <b>proofing)</b> is essential in all climates, but cold climates and hot-humid climates are especially demanding.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of Riga Dome Cathedral was initiated in 1211, {{at the same}} time the Capithulum hall of Cathedral was built. In order to diminish the problems caused by moisture, during the last restoration (already in 1888 - 1891) the walls of Capithulum hall were covered with <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> sandwich-type plaster, consisting of cement – glass tile (ca 4 - 5 mm thick) – cement. Thus the evaporation of water through the walls is hindered. Soluble salts crystallise on the surface of carvings dislocated above the level of historical hydroisolation and cause damages. The processes of corrosion of historical building materials of Capithulum hall were studied from the viewpoint of moisture and salt migration. The type, range and distribution of salts and moisture in masonry of Capithulum hall were detected by qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis, measurement of physical properties and XRD analysis...|$|R
