5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided <b>free</b> <b>at</b> the point of usage.|$|E
30|$|MTT {{was used}} to examine the {{inhibiting}} effects of <b>free</b> <b>Ats</b> and Ats-loaded BSA NPs in SMMC- 7721 cells and Plc cells at different time intervals. The results (Fig.  1 d, e) showed that the cytotoxicity of <b>free</b> <b>Ats</b> increased with the increase of the drug concentration, and Ats-loaded BSA NPs showed the gradual enhanced cytotoxicity. This proved that Ats and Ats-loaded BSA NPs inhibited the growth of tumor cells and that the inhibition ratio was dependent on the dose of <b>Ats.</b> Compared with <b>free</b> <b>Ats,</b> Ats-loaded BSA NPs demonstrated higher cytotoxicity and higher sensitivity in both cells, and they resulted in greater cell inhibition. As shown in Fig.  1 d, e, treatment of both cells with Ats-loaded BSA NPs caused a significant decrease in cell viability at 24  h when compared with that of <b>free</b> <b>Ats.</b> The 50 % maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values for the SMMC- 7721 cells and Plc cells treated with Ats-loaded BSA NPs were 50.1 and 44.9  μg/mL at 24  h, respectively, which is compared with the values obtained of 69.2 and 74.9  μg/mL at 24  h in cells treated with <b>free</b> <b>Ats.</b> This indicated that when Ats was loaded in BSA NPs, it might change its intracellular location, as mediated by the NPs, and ultimately killed more cells.|$|R

5|$|The National Health Service (NHS) is the {{publicly}} funded healthcare system in England {{responsible for providing}} the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect {{the provisions of the}} National Health Service Act 1946. It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by economist and social reformer William Beveridge. The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including National Insurance payments, and it provides most of its services <b>free</b> <b>at</b> the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.|$|E

In 2009 the paper became available on a web portal known as BG Views. The paper prints 7,000 copies of the paper Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and on Wednesday during the summer. The university's independent, student operated yearbook was first published in 1918 but stopped after one edition for six years. In 1924 it resumed production and was published every year as a record of students, activities, and events for a given year. In 2008, the yearbook was replaced with a magazine format, The Key Magazine, and is published semi-annually, in fall and spring semesters.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have maxillary teeth {{along their}} upper jaw {{which are used}} to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue {{normally}} lies coiled in the mouth, <b>free</b> <b>at</b> the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food {{as they can be}} retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.|$|E

5|$|London {{became the}} largest and most populous {{metropolitan}} area in the world during the Victorian era, and trade within the British Empire—as well as the standing of the British military and navy—was prestigious. Political agitation at home from radicals such as the Chartists and the suffragettes enabled legislative reform and universal suffrage. Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the Allies. Two decades later, in World War II, the United Kingdom was again one of the Allies. At the end of the Phoney War, Winston Churchill became the wartime Prime Minister. Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during the Blitz. Following the war, the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation, and there was a speeding up of technological innovations; automobiles became the primary means of transport and Frank Whittle's development of the jet engine led to wider air travel. Residential patterns were altered in England by private motoring, and by the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. The UK's NHS provided publicly funded health care to all UK permanent residents <b>free</b> <b>at</b> the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. Combined, these changes prompted the reform of local government in England in the mid-20th century.|$|E
5|$|Originally the {{unlimited}} company Bjorøy og Tyssøy ANS {{had been}} attempted established with capital from locals, but instead the company Fastlandssambandet Bjorøy – Tyssøy AS was established on 29 September 1993. Capital for NOK40,000 was paid by Fjell Municipality, NOK20,000 by Sund Municipality and NOK10,000 by Jack Jahnsen. The plans {{were sent to}} the Ministry of Transport and Communications in October 1992, who started working on a proposal for parliament in January 1993. Issues raised by the ministry were that the loans had been issued in 1987, and whether the land estimated value of the guaranteed real estate was real. The project was presented to the Parliament of Norway, who must approve all toll roads. By then the costs were estimated at NOK61.5 million, including NOK4.5 million in ordinary county grants and NOK30 million in extraordinary county grants. The proposal estimated annual toll collection costs to NOK825,000, with the collection taking place on Bjorøy. It was originally planned that the toll plaza would be manned between 06:00 and 22:00, meaning passing would be <b>free</b> <b>at</b> night.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax <b>free</b> <b>at</b> infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines <b>free</b> <b>at</b> the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|E
