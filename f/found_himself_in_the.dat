Rivero eventually reached {{the rank of}} Full-Admiral (four-stars) and in October 1962, <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis. As Commander of amphibious forces, Atlantic Fleet, {{he was on the}} front line of the vessels sent to the Caribbean by President Kennedy to stop the Cold War from escalating into World War III.|$|E
5|$|After {{just half}} a year as vice president, Arthur <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{executive}} mansion due to the assassination of his predecessor. To the surprise of reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, though it had once led to his expulsion from office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions. He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating {{since the end of}} the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, Wallace {{began the}} journey along the Shunpike, a route {{familiar}} to his men. A member of Grant's staff, William R. Rowley, found Wallace between 2 and 2:30p.m. on the Shunpike, after Grant wondered where Wallace was {{and why he}} had not arrived on the battlefield, while the main Union force was being slowly pressed backward. Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing. If Wallace continued in the same direction, he would have <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear of the advancing Confederate troops.|$|E

5|$|Expectations {{were high}} for the 2008 season, but Cleveland {{finished}} last in the AFC North with a 4–12 record. Anderson shared starts with Ken Dorsey, who the Browns had acquired by trading away Trent Dilfer, and Brady Quinn, a young quarterback the team drafted in 2007. The Browns never contended during 2008 and failed to score a touchdown in the final six games. Near {{the end of the}} season, two scandals shook the team. It was revealed that several Browns players, including Winslow, were suffering from staph infections, which raised questions about sanitation in the Browns' Berea practice facilities. In November, Savage <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of a media storm after an angry e-mail exchange with a fan was published on Deadspin, a sports blog. Shortly after the final game, a 31–0 loss to the Steelers, Lerner fired Savage and, a day later, Crennel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Khrushchev's ousting, three members were {{elected to the}} Presidium: Alexander Shelepin, the Chairman of the State Control Commission; Petro Shelest, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine; and Kirill Mazurov, a First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. While Brezhnev may have been General Secretary, {{he did not have}} a majority in the Presidium; when Kosygin and Podgorny agreed on policy, which was not often the case, Brezhnev <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minority. Brezhnev could only count on three to four votes in the Presidium: Suslov, who often switched sides, Kirilenko, Pelše and Dmitry Polyansky. Brezhnev and Kosygin often disagreed on policy; Brezhnev was a conservative while Kosygin was a modest reformer. Kosygin, who had begun his premiership as Brezhnev's equal, lost much power and influence within the Presidium when he introduced the 1965–1971 Soviet economic reform.|$|E
5|$|While Smythe was away, a committee, {{headed by}} Ed Bickle, Bill MacBrien, and Selke ran Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. Upon {{his return from}} the military, Smythe <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a power {{struggle}} over the presidency of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. Smythe suspected that MacBrien, {{a member of the}} board of directors, wanted to succeed Bickle as president and give Smythe's job to Selke, who had been acting general manager in Smythe's absence. Smythe wanted to be president and asked Selke for his support. Selke equivocated, and relationship between the two long-time friends turned acrimonious, leading to Selke's resignation in May 1946. Two months later, Selke became head of hockey operations for the Montreal Canadiens and manager of the Montreal Forum, succeeding Tommy Gorman.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the minor}} league team that last held Jim Thorpe's {{contract}} had disbanded in 1910, he <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rare {{position of being}} a sought-after free agent at the major league level during {{the era of the}} reserve clause, and thus had a choice of baseball teams for which to play. In January1913, he turned down a starting position with the American League cellar-dwelling St. Louis Browns, choosing instead to join the 1912National League champion New York Giants, who, with Thorpe playing in 19 of their 151games, would repeat as the 1913National League champions. Immediately following the Giants' October loss in the 1913 World Series, Thorpe and the Giants joined the Chicago White Sox for a world tour. Barnstorming across the United States and then around the world, Thorpe was the celebrity of the tour. Thorpe's presence increased the publicity, attendance and gate receipts for the tour. He met with Pope Pius X and Abbas II Hilmi Bey (the last Khedive of Egypt), and played before 20,000 people in London including King George V.|$|E
5|$|Jussi <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unusual {{position}} {{of attempting to}} defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, {{he was forced to}} rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not even know how to baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to England from his first Hollywood trip, Wood <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a feud between the {{chairman}} of Chappell's, William Boosey, and the BBC. Boosey had conceived a passionate hostility to the broadcasting of music, fearing that {{it would lead to}} the end of live concerts. He attempted to prevent anyone who wished to perform at the Queen's Hall from broadcasting for the BBC. This affected many of the artists whom Wood and Newman needed for the Proms. The matter was unresolved when Newman died in 1926. Shortly afterwards, Boosey announced that Chappell's would no longer support concerts at the Queen's Hall. The prospect that the Proms {{might not be able to}} continue caused widespread dismay, and there was a general welcome for the BBC's announcement that it would take over the running of the Proms, and would also run a winter series of symphony concerts at the Queen's Hall.|$|E

5|$|While details {{regarding}} Richard Cantillon's {{life are}} scarce, {{it is thought}} that he was born sometime during the 1680s in County Kerry, Ireland. He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of Ballyheigue. Sometime {{in the middle of the}} first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship. By 1711, Cantillon <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> employment of British Paymaster General James Brydges, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the War of Spanish Succession. Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and political connections, before returning to Paris. Cantillon then became involved in the banking industry working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank. Two years later, thanks in large part to financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank. Given the financial and political connections Cantillon was able to attain both through his family and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in money transfers between Paris and London.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Norway {{as a part}} of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did not get any notification of what was happening, and only music was played on the radio. Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the Oslo Cathedral School, only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and Karl Johans gate, where he witnessed the Germans marching through. The next (or possibly the same) day, a German Junkers plane crashed near him and his friend when they were on their way from Lysaker to get a closer view of the captured Fornebu Airport. He briefly <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but the heat was unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded. The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint Vidkun Quisling as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems-Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected if he had not been through recruit training, and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for Northern Norway. They came as far north as Nord-Trøndelag, where they however gave up and returned home.|$|E
5|$|Theramenes {{remained}} a general through 407 BC, but, in that year, when the Athenian defeat at Notium {{led to the}} downfall of Alcibiades and his political allies, Theramenes was not reelected. In the next year, however, he did sail as a trierarch in the scratch Athenian relief fleet sent out to relieve Conon, who had been blockaded with 40 triremes at Mytilene by Callicratidas. That relief force won a surprising victory over the more experienced Spartan force in the Battle of Arginusae, but {{in the wake of}} that battle Theramenes <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a massive controversy. At the end of the battle, the generals in command of the fleet had conferred to decide on their next steps. Several pressing concerns presented themselves; 50 Peloponnesian ships under Eteonicus {{remained a}}t Mytilene, blockading Conon, and decisive action by the Athenians could lead to the destruction of that force as well, but, at the same time, ships needed to be dispatched to recover the sailors of the twenty five Athenian triremes sunk or disabled in the battle. Accordingly, all eight generals, with the larger part of the fleet, set out for Mytilene, while a rescue force under Thrasybulus and Theramenes, both of whom were trierarchs in this battle but had served as generals in prior campaigns, remained behind to pick up the survivors and retrieve corpses for burial. At this point, however, a severe storm blew up, and both of these forces were driven back to shore. Eteonicus escaped, and a great number of Athenian sailors—estimates as to the precise figure have ranged from near 1,000 to as many as 5,000—drowned.|$|E
