50|$|The {{common name}} is olive nerite, but that same common name {{is also used}} for Neritina usnea.Neritina reclivata is a <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organism</b> living at salinities ranging from 0 to 19 ppt. It feeds on epiphytic and epibenthic algae. It ranges from north Florida on the Atlantic Coast through the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea to Trinidad (Russell, 1941). Neritina reclivata lives in shallow {{protected}} bays from just above high water to approximately 1.5 meters in depth where it is found on sea grasses, emergent marsh plants, rocks, and stumps. It is known to climb up marsh grass blades at high tide to avoid predators. One such predator is the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus.|$|E
40|$|The fishhook waterflea (Cercopagis pengoi) {{native to}} the Ponto-Caspian region, is an {{excellent}} example of an invasive species. Within one decade from its first appearance, Cercopagis pengoi has colonized nearly the entire Baltic Sea and most of the Great Lakes of North America. The spe-cies spread rapidly owing to its ecological and biological profile. The fishhook waterflea is an <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organism</b> marked by a predominance of parthenogenetic reproduction over sexual re-production. This taxon quickly colonized inhabited ecosystems to create stable populations. The ecological and economic consequences of the species ’ appearance are noticeable, but they have not been fully investigated and require further analysis...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{trial was}} conducted to evaluate {{the effect of the}} combination of four temperatures (23 °, 26 °, 29 ° and 32 °C) and four salinities (25, 30, 35 and 40 PSU), on clearance (FR) and filtration (CR) rates, {{as well as on the}} assimilation efficiency (AE) of the mangrove oyster Crassostrea corteziensis. The interaction temperature-salinity had a significant effect on the feeding physiology of the oyster; optimum results were observed in the combination of 32 °C and 35 PSU with a FR of 38. 08 L•h- 1 •g- 1, and a CR of 1. 61 mg•h- 1 •g- 1. The AE was higher in the combination of 29 °C and 35 PSUs with a value of 65. 1 %. Results suggest that C. corteziensis maintains its feeding physiology in the gradient of temperature and salinity evaluated, which characterizes the bivalve as an eurythermal and <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organism,</b> with a better performance at moderate temperatures (29 - 32 єC) and salinities (~ 35 PSU) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Euryhaline</b> <b>organisms</b> {{are able}} {{to adapt to a}} wide range of salinities. An example of a {{euryhaline}} fish is the molly (Poecilia sphenops) which can live in fresh water, brackish water, or salt water. The green crab (Carcinus maenas) is an example of a euryhaline invertebrate that can live in salt and brackish water. <b>Euryhaline</b> <b>organisms</b> are commonly found in habitats such as estuaries and tide pools where the salinity changes regularly. However, some <b>organisms</b> are <b>euryhaline</b> because their life cycle involves migration between freshwater and marine environments, as is the case with salmon and eels.|$|R
50|$|The {{opposite}} of <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organisms</b> are stenohaline ones, {{which can only}} survive within a narrow range of salinities. Most freshwater organisms are stenohaline, and will die in seawater, and similarly most marine organisms are stenohaline, and cannot live in fresh water.|$|R
50|$|Heterotrophic organisms consume {{autotrophic}} {{organisms and}} use the organic compounds in their bodies as energy sources and as raw materials {{to create their own}} biomass. <b>Euryhaline</b> <b>organisms</b> are salt tolerant and can survive in marine ecosystems, while stenohaline or salt intolerant species can only live in freshwater environments.|$|R
30|$|Salinity {{explains}} the chlorosite of water, {{which is the}} percentage of chloride in water. We distinguish normal seawater salinity of 35  g/l of chlorides and fresh waters that contain up to 5  g/l. The salinity factor controls the distribution of fauna, flora and minerals. The normal salinity water shelters stenohaline forms (Brachiopods, crustaceans and lamellibranches). Brackish waters shelter to some <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organisms</b> and freshwater shelters to freshwater organisms.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe paralic {{flora and}} fauna from the Late Jurassic of Chassiron (Oléron Island, western France) are described. The Tithonian-aged bonebeds of Purbeck facies of this {{locality}} have yielded a rich and diverse vertebrate assemblage including fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals, alongside numerous plant and invertebrate remains. The Chassiron locality thus appears as a peculiar Konzentrat-Lagerstätte in {{which most of the}} palaeoecosystem's biological components (both aquatic and terrestrial) have been preserved. The depositional environment was probably subject to salinity fluctuations, as indicated by the co-occurrence of freshwater and <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organisms.</b> This is one of the richest localities and the first mammal-bearing site known from the Jurassic of France...|$|R
40|$|The North American Great Lakes {{have been}} invaded and {{dramatically}} altered {{by more than}} 145 alien species. Many invasions have occurred {{during the past few}} decades because of the release of Eurasian ballast water from transoceanic ships. Current regulations require ships to exchange foreign ballast with highly saline water before entering the Great Lakes; this procedure should prevent colonization by strictly freshwater species, but species with broad salinity tolerance might survive transport in exchanged water. A recent series of invasions by <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organisms</b> from the Black and Caspian Seas region signals a new phase in the transformation of the Great Lakes - one that supports the concept of an 2 ̆ 7 invasional meltdown 2 ̆ 7...|$|R
40|$|The {{blue crab}} Callinectes sapidus inhabits estuarine environments that range in {{salinity}} from full-strength sea water to fresh water (Mangum and Amende, 1972; Lynch et al., 1973; Cameron, 1978). Like many <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organisms,</b> blue crabs have evolved compensatory mechanisms to minimize perturbations to the intracellular environment during osmotic stress. While the hemolymph of blue crabs fluctuates iso-osmotically {{with the environment}} at salinities above 25 ‰, below this threshold the hemolymph is maintained hyperosmotic relative to the surrounding water (Ballard and Abbott, 1969; Mangum et al., 1985; Lynch et al., 1973; Robinson, 1994). The major site of active osmoregulation in blue crabs is the posterior gills, where a number of membrane-bound ion pumps and other transport-related enzymes associated with osmoregulation are located (Mantel an...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem for <b>euryhaline</b> aquatic <b>organisms</b> is {{the maintenance of}} a body fluid composition different from that of their immediate environment.

40|$|The predatory cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi has {{extended}} its range {{over the past}} decade from the Ponto-Caspian basin into the Baltic Sea and the Laurentian Great Lakes. This study employs mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) se-quence analysis to elucidate the invasion corridors exploited during this range expansion. The Caspian and Black Sea populations of C. pengoi exhibit marked genetic divergence, enabling their discrimination as potential sources of the Baltic and Great Lakes populations. The limited mtDNA haplotype diversity detected in the Baltic populations suggests they were founded by a small number of colonists from the Black Sea. The colonization of North America was apparently a result of the transfer of animals from the Baltic Sea in ballast water. Transoceanic shipping activities and canals linking natu-rally segregated watersheds on single continents are provok-ing a massive redistribution of freshwater life. <b>Euryhaline</b> <b>organisms</b> are well positioned to exploit these dispersal cor-ridors, because shipping often occurs via waters of varying salinity. The Ponto-Caspian basin has had a turbulent history of salinity fluctuation and, consequently, many elements o...|$|R
40|$|Many {{aquatic organisms}} exist in {{fluctuating}} salinities or spend {{portions of their}} life cycle {{in a mixture of}} marine, freshwater or estuarine habitats. Despite wide differences in ionic compositions and concentrations of these environments, teleost fishes maintain a relatively constant internal milieu (Evans, 1979). The gill tissue of teleosts is a key interface between an organism and its environment. In addition to its roles in gas exchange, in the elimination of nitrogenous waste and in acid–base balance, the gill plays a central part in ion- and osmoregulatory processes (McDonald et al., 1991). Variation in environmental salinity invokes a suite of responses in teleosts. These responses involve several different levels of biological organization such as (1) rates of drinking (Hirano, 1974; Karnaky, 1980), (2) cell morphology and composition in the gill (Virabhadrachari, 1961; Karnaky et al., 1976 a; Kültz et al., 1995) and (3) the activities of enzymes associated with osmoregulatory processes such as Na+/K+-ATPase (Epstein et al., 1967; Sargent and Thomson, 1974). Modulation of the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase in gill is arguably among the most widespread of these responses. It is well documented that Na+/K+-ATPase activities from the gills of <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organisms</b> are positively correlated with salinit...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a noninvasive rapid fluorimetric method {{for the investigation}} of growth of adhering (benthic) phototrophic microorganisms. The technique {{is based on the}} sensitive detection of the in vivo fluorescence of chlorophylls chlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll a and monitors increases in signal over time as an indicator for growth. The growth fluorimeter uses modulated excitation light of blue-light-emitting diodes and a photodiode as the detector. The light-emitting diodes are mounted geometrically in an aluminum housing for efficient and uniform illumination of the bottoms of the growth containers. The fluorimeter was characterized with respect to detection limit and dynamic range. This system is capable of resolving in vivo chlorophyll a concentrations of 0. 5 (mu) g liter(sup- 1) in cyanobacteria and 0. 03 (mu) g liter(sup- 1) in diatoms as well as in vivo bacteriochlorophyll a concentrations in phototrophic bacteria of 0. 3 (mu) g liter(sup- 1), which points to an extremely high sensitivity compared with that of similar available techniques. Thus, the new fluorimeter allows the determination of growth at extremely low cell densities. The instrument was used successfully to measure the growth of several adhering isolates of the filamentous cyanobacterium Microcoleus chthonoplastes from benthic microbial mats in seawater of different salinities. The data obtained demonstrate broad growth responses for all strains, which thus can be characterized as <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organisms...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{salinity}} {{increases the}} geochemical speciation of Cu is altered {{as a result}} of organic/inorganic complexation/competition. Such salinity changes may further challenge the osmoregulatory capabilities of <b>euryhaline</b> <b>organisms.</b> This chemical-biological interaction complicates the understanding of the impacts of Cu in estuarine waters. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been widely established to be an important modifier of Cu toxicity in freshwaters however its effectiveness in modulating Cu toxicity across the range of salinities that occur in estuarine conditions has not been studied in a systematic manner. Site to site differences in DOM quality with respect to the potential for toxicity mitigation are also not well understood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the mitigating effects of salinity and DOM on acute/chronic Cu toxicity to mysids (Americamysis bahia) using EPA-standardized 96 h and 7 d toxicity tests. An array of Cu concentrations (0 – 800 µg/L) were tested in duplicate (acute) and quadruplicate (7 d) exposure over a wide range of salinities (5 – 40 ppt) with DOM from 4 different sources (at 0 - 4 mg C/L). A protective effect of salinity on acute Cu toxicity was observed however the organism was found to be more sensitive to Cu at salinity extremes. A protective effect of salinity was observed only for biomass and minimal effect was observed for other chronic end-points. The presence of DOC resulted in a protective effect to A. bahia against Cu toxicity at both 15 and 25 ppt. This protection was variable among sources, with some sources imparting greater protective effects than others and this difference could not be explained by optical characteristics of DOM. There was little variation among sources and resultant toxicity suggesting that DOM quality may not be as important in predicting Cu toxicity in estuarine environments. Overall, the results of this study suggest that toxicity prediction in estuarine environments may not only be dependent on Cu geochemistry but the physiological capabilities of the organisms. Future estuarine toxicity prediction models for estuarine systems therefore need to account for the variability in physiology of estuarine organisms to develop models that accurately predict Cu toxicity. This project helps towards improving the understanding of Cu toxicity in estuarine systems and contributes data towards development of toxicity prediction models which may contribute to guidelines/criteria development for protection of aquatic biota...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} address the impact on phytoplankton, {{sampling}} was conducted monthly at 4 fixed stations, from April/ 86 to March/ 87 at diurnal low and high tide using a plankton net (65 mum mesh size) and a 1 L Van Dorn bottle. Among the 133 taxa identified, marine littoral euryhaline species were most common, outranking Gyrosigma balticum (Ehrenberg) Rabenhorst, Nitzschia sigma (Kützing) Wm. Smith, Licmophora abbreviata Agardh, Climacosphenia moniligera Ehrenberg, Surirella febigerii Lewis, Terpsinoe musica Ehrenberg and Cylindrotheca closterium (Ehrenberg) Reiman and Lewis. The port construction caused significant changes to the phytoplankton community with a strong influence of marine species (mainly dinoflagellate) because of {{the opening of the}} reef near the river mouth in 1983. The shallow depth and hydrodynamic brought many littoral species to the water columm. The community was composed by marine <b>euryhaline</b> and limnetic <b>organisms,</b> influenced by the salinity, rain and tide. Species diversity was high (> 3 bits. cel- 1) owing to the high environmental heterogeneity (marine, freshwater and benthic interactions). After the port implantation, a strong decrease occurred in phytoplankton density owing to high loads of suspended matter. Lowest values (121, 00 cells. l- 1) were registered during rainy season. During dry season, when light intensity was higher, phytoplankton presented highest density (1, 789, 000 cells. l- 1) ...|$|R
