However, Aristotle immediately rejected the possibility, and he was in any case discussing ontogeny, the Empedoclean coming <b>into</b> <b>being</b> of an individual from component parts, not phylogeny and natural selection.|$|E

On 1 July 2006, the successor regiment amalgamated, joining with two others to form the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Otto pursued policies, such as {{balancing}} power {{among all the}} parties and sharing offices among the parties, ostensibly to reduce {{the power of the}} parties while trying to bring a pro-Othon party <b>into</b> <b>being.</b> The parties, however, became the entree into government power and financial stability.|$|E

5|$|A {{transport}} fleet {{protected by}} warships was organised; sixty ships sailed in all.

5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought <b>into</b> <b>being,</b> but it did periodically publish good stories. In the end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Hermaphroditism {{appeared}} in medical literature {{enough to be}} considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman <b>into</b> <b>being</b> seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force <b>into</b> <b>being,</b> the TF {{was intended to be}} a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.|$|E

5|$|In {{completely}} arbitrary fashion Collet {{chose the}} names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, {{for no other reason}} than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come <b>into</b> <b>being.</b>|$|E
5|$|In season five, Lex becomes {{obsessed with}} {{uncovering}} Clark's secret; he breaks three metahuman criminals out of Belle Reve and sends {{them to the}} Kent Farm, where they hold several people close to Clark hostage. The scheme amounts to nothing, however, and Clark cuts Lex out of life completely upon finding out. His curiosity into the symbols, which he believes to be alien in nature, results in Brainiac (James Marsters) arranging him to be possessed by {{the spirit of the}} Kryptonian criminal Zod. In season six, Lex married Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) after deceiving Lana <b>into</b> <b>being</b> pregnant with his child. Upon learning the truth, Lana faked her own death and attempted to pin the murder on Lex.|$|E
