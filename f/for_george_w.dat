5|$|Barlow {{returned}} to Britain in 1838 {{to take up}} a post as assistant engineer on the Manchester and Birmingham Railway working <b>for</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Buck.

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support <b>for</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush {{in the presidential election}} against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{charges of}} media bias were leveled against the {{networks}} by Republicans.

Congress held hearings on this matter, and the networks claimed to have no intentional bias in their election night reporting. However, {{a study of the}} calls made on election night 2000 indicated that states carried by Gore were called more quickly than states won by Bush; however, notable Bush states, like New Hampshire and Florida, were very close, and close Gore states like Iowa, Oregon, New Mexico and Wisconsin were called late as well.|$|E

500|$|On March 23, 2007 Jones {{announced}} {{he was running for}} the United States Senate against incumbent Republican Saxby Chambliss. Jones was criticized by his chief rival Jim Martin over his more conservative politics and past support <b>for</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush. Jones' campaign was also marred by two new controversies. Jones sent out a flier in which he appeared in a digitally altered picture next to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama with the words [...] "Yes We Can." [...] However, Obama himself stated he not only never posed with Jones, he did not endorse Jones or any other candidate for the Democratic nomination for Senate. In response, Jones blamed his [...] "liberal opponents backed by the liberal media" [...] for trying to ruin his campaign. Jones also received criticism for the appearance of the tagline [...] "Vote Vernon Jones for GA Senate" [...] on tickets, produced using county funds, for the Dekalb County Blues and Jazz Festival. The company who printed the tickets, supporters of Jones' campaign, took responsibility for the incident; saying that they were unaware campaign finance laws made such an action illegal.|$|E
