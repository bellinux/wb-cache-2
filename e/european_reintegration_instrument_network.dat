The present cabinet is aiming to reshape the measures and provisions in the context of disablement and inability to work so that both employers and employees become more aware of the necessity of reducing the demand on social security provisions for persons on extended sick leave or with a long-term incapacity for work.

Morphology of the nanocomposites has been examined by electronic microscopy. The relationship between the preparation method, morphology, and electrical conductivity was studied. Electronic microscopy images reveal that the nanocomposites exhibit well dispersed graphene platelets. The incorporation of EG to the PET results in a sharp insulator-to-conductor transition with a percolation threshold (Ï† c) as low as 0. 05 wt %. An electrical conductivity of 10 - 3 S/cm was achieved for 0. 4 wt % of EG. The low percolation threshold and relatively high electrical conductivity are attributed to the high aspect ratio, large surface area, and uniform dispersion of the EG sheets in PET matrix. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We have explored the functionalisation of a sample containing single- and double-walled carbon nanotubes with different diaryldiazomethane derivatives by using the high reactivity of the intermediate carbenes formed under actinic irradiation to insert to the carbon nanotube structure. Besides characterisation by bulk techniques (Raman, FTIR and TGA), we provide direct evidence on the location of the functional groups on the sidewalls of the carbon nanotubes by an electron microscopy study of a heavy-element tagged sample.

This work investigates regional and local variations of aerosols based on Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observation Networks (DRAGON). We constructed DRAGON-Japan and DRAGON-Osaka in spring of 2012. The former network covers almost all of Japan {{in order to obtain}} aerosol information in regional scale over Japanese islands. It was determined from the DRAGON-Japan campaign that the values of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) decrease from west to east during an aerosol episode. In fact, the highest AOT was recorded at Fukue Island at the western end of the network, and the value was much higher than that of urban areas.

The data from previous reports were used to analyze a potential correlation between CRB 1 variants and the clinical features of respective patients.

40|$|Deciphering {{the whole}} network of protein {{interactions}} {{for a given}} proteome (interactome) {{is the goal of}} many experimental and computational efforts in Systems Biology. Separately the prediction of the structure of protein complexes by docking methods is a well-established scientific area. To date, docking programs have not been used to predict interaction partners. We provide a proof of principle for such an approach. Using a set of protein complexes representing known interactors in their unbound form, we show that a standard docking program can distinguish the true interactors from a background of 922 non-redundant potential interactors. We additionally show that true interactions can be distinguished from non-likely interacting proteins within the same structural family. Our approach may be put {{in the context of the}} proposed funnel-energy model; the docking algorithm may not find the native complex, but it distinguishes binding partners because of the higher probability of favourable models compared with a collection of non-binders. The potential exists to develop this proof of principle into new approaches for predicting interaction partners and reconstructing biological networks. © 2011 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Unique spatiotemporal patterns of HR formation occurred in barley with Mla 1, Mla 3, or MlLa R genes challenged with B. graminis f. sp. hordei. With Mla 1, a rapid HR, limited to epidermal cells, arrested fungal growth before colonies initiated secondary attacks. With Mla 3, mesophyll HR preceded that in epidermal cells whose initial survival supported secondary infections. With MlLa, mesophyll survived and not all attacked epidermal cells died immediately, allowing colony growth and secondary infection until arrested. Isolines with Mla 1, Mla 3, or MlLa genes inoculated with B. graminis f. sp. hordei ranging from 1 to 100 conidia mm 2 showed abnormally high gl during dark periods whose timing and extent correlated with those of each HR. Each isoline showed increased dark gl with the nonpathogen B. graminis f. sp. avenae which caused a single epidermal cell HR. Guard cell autofluorescence was seen only after drying of epidermal strips and closure of stomata suggesting that locked open stomata were viable.

40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{framework}} for modelling mixing in porous media flows, {{in which the}} scalar mixture is represented as an ensemble of lamellae evolving through stretching, diffusion and coalescence. Detailed numerical simulations in Darcy scale heterogeneous permeability fields are used to analyse the lamella deformation process, which controls the local concentration gradients and thus {{the evolution of the}} concentration mixture through stretching enhanced diffusion. The corresponding Lagrangian deformation process is shown to be well modelled by a Langevin equation with multiplicative noise, which can be coupled with diffusion to predict the temporal evolution of the concentration probability density function (PDF). At late times, lamella interaction is enforced by confinement of the mixture within the dispersion area. This process is shown to be well represented by a random aggregation model, which quantifies the frequency of lamella coalescence and allows us to predict the temporal evolution of the concentration PDF in this regime. The proposed theoretical framework provides an accurate prediction of the concentration PDFs at all investigated times, heterogeneity levels and Péclet numbers. In particular, it relates the temporal behaviour of mixing, as quantified by concentration moments, scalar dissipation rate or spatial increments of concentration, to the degree of structural heterogeneity. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

Focusing on these bio-hydrodynamic interactions, we will demonstrate how the physical structure of different assemblages, via their interaction with currents and waves, results in spatio-temporal variation in transfer rates {{at a range}} of scales. Examples {{will be used to}} highlight the, sometimes complex, interactions between organism/population properties (i. e, height, area, volume, flexibility, density and distribution) and near-bed hydrodynamics. Innovative approaches for examining transfer rates under natural hydrodynamic conditions will demonstrate how these interactions can determine the transfer (and retention) of nutrients and particles between the water column and benthos, creating intra-specific micro-niches (or zones) with different physiochemical properties (potentially influencing biodiversity). Finally, inter-specific differences in bio-hydrodynamic effects will be discussed in relation to benthic processes (such as the burial of organic matter, i. e, the “blue carbon hypothesis”) and suggestions will be made about the potential consequences of changes in benthic habitat distribution for the functioning of shallow, benthic ecosystems.
