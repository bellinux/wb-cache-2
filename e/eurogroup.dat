5|$|In a {{marathon}} meeting on 20/21 February 2012 the <b>Eurogroup</b> {{agreed with the}} IMF and the Institute of International Finance on the final conditions of the second bailout package worth €130 billion. The lenders agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering of the interest rates of the Greek Loan Facility {{to a level of}} just 150 basis points above Euribor. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117% and 120.5% of GDP by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Faced by {{the threat}} of a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme. The <b>Eurogroup</b> recently granted a six-month technical extension of its current bailout programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining bailout transfers now is very short. Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1980 s, the European Union {{has created}} {{mechanisms}} {{to integrate the}} increasing lobbying activity of European-wide interest groups. This has led to considerable pressures upon national interest groups to participate in European level organisations. This chapter will focus on how Portuguese interest groups reacted to these Europeanisation pressures in the EU multi-level governance system. It is frequently argued that, due to common pressures such as economic and monetary union (EMU), Trade Unions and Business associations {{need to work together}} more closely at the European level. This chapter maintains that although Portuguese employers and Trade Union actors have gained some multi-level leverage after joining the major transnational <b>Eurogroups,</b> they still lag behind in terms of using all the possibilities of influence in the multilevel governance system. Their actions consist in reacting to policies set up by the <b>Eurogroups</b> in which they are integrated. The chapter explores how Europe impacts on the day-to-day business of these groups and will offer some explanations as to why they fail to exploit its full potential...|$|R
40|$|Talks {{continued}} through the night in Brussels, with Eurozone leaders eventually reaching an agreement on Greece. Christopher Bickerton writes that while negotiations were always likely to be tough, the original discussions between Greece and its creditors did not break down because of an unbridgeable ideological gap, but instead reflected {{a reaction to the}} negotiating tactics pursued by the Greek government under finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. He argues that by breaching the etiquette of the <b>Eurogroup’s</b> decision-making process, Varoufakis generated entrenched opposition among Greece’s creditors for which the country is now being punished...|$|R
50|$|In the European Parliament {{election}}, 2014, Syriza won {{the election}} with 26.58% of the vote (a swing of 21.88%) taking 6 seats (up 5), with Golden Dawn coming 3rd taking 3 seats, the Communist Party taking 2 seats and the Independent Greeks gaining their first ever seat. Syriza's leader Tsipras said he's not anti-European and {{does not want to}} leave the euro. According to The Economist, Tsipras is willing to negotiate with Greece's European partners, and it is believed a Syriza victory could encourage radical leftist parties across Europe. Alexis Tsipras vowed to reverse many of the austerity measures adopted by Greece since a series of bailouts began in 2010, at odds with the <b>Eurogroup's</b> positions.The current government coalition in Greece is composed by Syriza and ANEL (right-wing hard Eurosceptic party, led by Panos Kammenos, who is the current Minister of Defence).|$|R

40|$|The {{point of}} {{departure}} for this paper is that the European Union (EU) has affected national politics, policies and polities. This process, labelled Europeanization, has led to changes in two interconnected political dimensions. First, it has led to modifications in the relationships between state and non-state actors within the national arena. Second, it has changed the interactions between the sub-national, national and supranational actors (state and non-state). To explore these propositions the paper conducts an analysis of the interest representation patterns exhibited by nonstate actors. The paper compares firms (in the telecommunications, gas and electricity sectors) and environmental groups (focused on nature conservation or biodiversity policy), both based in the United Kingdom (UK), in order to determine how, to what extent and why Europeanization has affected their interest representation behaviour. The activities displayed by the two sets of interests are compared and contrasted in terms of chosen lobbying targets (i. e. national government departments and EU institutions), routes and allies (i. e. direct contact or via intermediaries such as <b>Eurogroups)</b> and the timing and character of the contact.

40|$|Book synopsis: Can {{the euro}} area survive without a more {{centralized}} economic policy? What lessons {{can be drawn}} from Economic and Monetary Union about new modes of policy-making in the European Union? Have euro area members spoken with one voice on the international stage and {{what does this mean for}} the European Union's ambitions to be a global actor in its own right? This book explores these three key questions through an in-depth analysis of euro area governance from the launch of the single currency in 1999 to the sovereign debt crisis of 2010. Drawing insights from the study of European Union politics, comparative political economy and international political economy, it examines: Economic and Monetary Union's break from the Community method of policy-making; the European Central Bank's ambivalence about the pursuit of ever closer union; the <b>Eurogroup's</b> rise and fall as a forum for economic policy coordination; the interplay between national fiscal institutions and the stability and growth pact; the broad economic policy guidelines' failure to apply peer pressure; the European Union's influence within the G 20 and the International Monetary Fund at the height of the global financial crisis; euro diplomacy towards China and other rising powers; and current debates about the fate of EMU and the reform of euro area governance in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The book's conclusions challenge claims that the euro area is in crisis because of its decentralized approach to decision-making alone and the corollary that the euro can be saved only through a further transfer of sovereignty to the supranational level...|$|R
25|$|The eurozone {{consists}} of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. Other EU states (except for Denmark and the United Kingdom) {{are obliged to}} join once they meet the criteria to do so. No state has left, {{and there are no}} provisions to do so or to be expelled. Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City have formal agreements with the EU to use the euro as their official currency and issue their own coins. Kosovo and Montenegro have adopted the euro unilaterally, but these countries do not officially form part of the eurozone and do not have representation in the European Central Bank (ECB) or in the <b>Eurogroup.</b>|$|E

500|$|Tsakalotos' first {{official}} meeting as Minister of Finance was on 7 July {{and was an}} emergency meeting of the <b>Eurogroup</b> following {{the vote in the}} referendum. Tsakalotos brought a note with him that reminded him to display [...] "no triumphalism" [...] after the 'No' vote in the Greek bailout referendum. Following the talks, he was described as [...] "Much better than Varoufakis". Greece was given 48 hours to agree to a new bailout plan or it would face being forced to leave the eurozone on 8 July, leading to a plan being submitted by the Greek government on 10 July. In a nine-hour <b>Eurogroup</b> meetings on 11 July, Tsakalotos was noted for his calmness in the [...] "tough, even violent" [...] atmosphere of the talks by observers.|$|E
500|$|The first {{review of}} the bailout {{programme}} carried out by Greece's lenders stalled in February 2016 over pension reforms. Speaking to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Tsakalotos urged the lenders to complete the review by 1 May as [...] "This question of time is important {{if we want to}} move from a vicious to a virtuous circle." [...] He wrote to other members of the <b>Eurogroup</b> on 6 May to appeal for their support against extra demands for austerity that, he argued, were beyond the mandate of the Greek government.|$|E
500|$|At {{the annual}} {{meetings}} of the IMF and the World Bank between 9 and 11 October 2015, Tsakalotos {{had a number of}} meetings with high-level attendees. On 8 January 2016, Tsakalotos began a tour of European cities, including Rome, Lisbon, Paris, Helsinki and Berlin, meeting with finance ministers, prior to a <b>Eurogroup</b> meeting on 14 January. In February 2016, Spyros Economides, Director of the Hellenic Observatory, commented on Tsakalotos' performance as Minister of Finance: [...] "In some ways, he has done an extremely good job because the mess left by his predecessor both in substantive and presentational terms was horrific." [...] Tsakalotos visited the European Parliament in March 2016 and told MEPs of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that he welcomed their role in monitoring the reforms.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{a delayed}} reform {{schedule}} and a worsened economic recession, {{the new government}} immediately asked the Troika to be granted an extended deadline from 2015 to 2017 before being required to restore the budget into a self-financed situation; which in effect was equal to a request of a third bailout package for 2015–16 worth €32.6bn of extra loans. On 11 November 2012, facing a default {{by the end of}} November, the Greek parliament passed a new austerity package worth €18.8bn, including a [...] "labour market reform" [...] and [...] "midterm fiscal plan 2013–16". In return, the <b>Eurogroup</b> agreed on the following day to lower interest rates and prolong debt maturities and to provide Greece with additional funds of around €10bn for a debt-buy-back programme. The latter allowed Greece to retire about half of the [...] in debt that Athens owes private creditors, thereby shaving roughly [...] off that debt. This should bring Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio down to 124% by 2020 and well below 110% two years later. Without agreement the debt-to-GDP ratio would have risen to 188% in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, in June 2012, Spain {{became a}} prime {{concern for the}} Euro-zone when {{interest}} on Spain's 10-year bonds reached the 7% level and it faced difficulty in accessing bond markets. This led the <b>Eurogroup</b> on 9 June 2012 to grant Spain a financial support package of up to €100 billion. The funds will not go directly to Spanish banks, but be transferred to a government-owned Spanish fund responsible to conduct the needed bank recapitalisations (FROB), and thus it will be counted for as additional sovereign debt in Spain's national account. An economic forecast in June 2012 highlighted {{the need for the}} arranged bank recapitalisation support package, as the outlook promised a negative growth rate of 1.7%, unemployment rising to 25%, and a continued declining trend for housing prices. In September 2012 the ECB removed some of the pressure from Spain on financial markets, when it announced its [...] "unlimited bond-buying plan", to be initiated if Spain would sign a new sovereign bailout package with EFSF/ESM. Strictly speaking, Spain was not hit by a sovereign debt-crisis in 2012, as the financial support package that they received from the ESM was earmarked for a bank recapitalization fund and did not include financial support for the government itself.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of 2014, the Greek {{government}} again negotiated with the Troika. The negotiations were this time about how to comply with the programme requirements, to ensure activation of the payment of its last scheduled eurozone bailout tranche in December 2014, and about a potential update of its remaining bailout programme for 2015–16. When calculating the impact of the 2015 fiscal budget presented by the Greek government, there was a disagreement, with the calculations of the Greek government showing it fully complied with the goals of its agreed [...] "Midterm fiscal plan 2013–16", while the Troika calculations were less optimistic and returned a not covered financing gap at €2.5bn (being required to be covered by additional austerity measures). As the Greek government insisted their calculations were more accurate than those presented by the Troika, they submitted an unchanged fiscal budget bill on 21 November, to be voted for by the parliament on 7 December. The <b>Eurogroup</b> was scheduled to meet and discuss the updated review of the Greek bailout programme on 8 December (to be published on the same day), and the potential adjustments to the remaining programme for 2015–16. There were rumours in the press that the Greek government has proposed immediately to end the previously agreed and continuing IMF bailout programme for 2015–16, replacing it with the transfer of €11bn unused bank recapitalization funds currently held as reserve by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), along with establishment of a new precautionary Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL) issued by the European Stability Mechanism. The ECCL instrument is often used as a follow-up precautionary measure, when a state has exited its sovereign bailout programme, with transfers only taking place if adverse financial/economic circumstances materialize, but with the positive effect that it help calm down financial markets as the presence of this extra backup guarantee mechanism makes the environment safer for investors.|$|E

2500|$|On 9 June 2012 the <b>Eurogroup</b> held an {{emergency}} {{meeting to discuss}} how to inject capital into Spanish banks. The IMF estimated [...] the capital needs of the Spanish banks to be about 40 billion euros. The <b>Eurogroup</b> announced intentions to provide up to 100 billion euro to the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring to the Spanish government. The Spanish government is then expected to give the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the respective banks. On 21 June 2012 it was decided that 62 billion euros would be shared among the Spanish banks in need.

2500|$|In 2009 {{the authors}} of a {{confidential}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) report suggested that {{in light of the}} ongoing global financial crisis, the EU Council should consider granting EU member states which are having difficulty complying with all five convergence criteria the option to [...] "partially adopt" [...] the euro, {{along the lines of the}} monetary agreements signed with the microstates outside the EU. These states would gain the right to adopt the euro and issue a national variant of euro coins, but would not get a seat in ECB or the <b>Eurogroup</b> until they met all the convergence criteria. However, the EU has not made use of this alternative accession process.|$|E
2500|$|The 2012–2013 Cypriot {{financial}} crisis {{led to an}} agreement with the <b>Eurogroup</b> in March 2013 to split the country's second largest bank, the Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), into a [...] "bad" [...] bank which would be wound down over time and a [...] "good" [...] bank which would be absorbed by the Bank of Cyprus. In return for a €10billion bailout from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "troika", the Cypriot government was required to impose a significant haircut on uninsured deposits, a large proportion of which were held by wealthy Russians who used Cyprus as a tax haven. Insured deposits of €100,000 or less were not affected.|$|E
2500|$|The Eurozone is {{a special}} case where some members, principally Germany, enjoy a large current account surplus and so could accept or even benefit from {{currency}} appreciation. [...] Other countries though such as Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have twin deficits and so {{to a large extent}} would benefit from a depreciation. [...] While the European Central Bank (ECB) did practice some QE in 2009, this was to a much lower extent than the US or UK, and they did not deploy a second round. The value of the Euro has been effectively left to float, and in fact early in 2010 central authorities intervened to defend the Euro’s value against the market. Following the generally positive results from bank stress testing that were released in summer, [...] market participants stopped speculating against the Euro, and the currency has tended to rise as a result of other countries practicing competitive devaluation. A major driver for the rise in the Euro {{in the latter half of}} 2010 was China's purchase of Euro-denominated bonds. While China's intervention was in some ways helpful for the Eurozone, it also generated concern with several European officials speaking out against the action. These officials included: [...] ECB governor Jean-Claude Trichet and <b>Eurogroup</b> president Jean-Claude Juncker.|$|E
2500|$|Socialist leaders {{rejected}} Podemos' referendum {{outcome and}} announced {{they would not}} break their pact with C's, yet they would not try to reach any agreement with the PP either.

On 21 April, C's leader Albert Rivera called for PP and PSOE leaders {{to step back and}} support an independent candidate as Prime Minister. Rajoy replied by suggesting Rivera to [...] "do it first himself"—in reference to him stepping back—while also announcing he would note the King on his own lack of support to be elected while censoring Sánchez for rejecting his offer for a grand coalition. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos was recorded on 22 April saying to <b>Eurogroup</b> president Jeroen Dijsselbloem that a new election was all but certain, with the PP hoping that, even if a similar result to December was obtained, [...] "common sense would prevail" [...] and the PSOE would reluctantly agree to an alliance with them. On 24 April, Rajoy remarked that his party was [...] "ready" [...] for a new electoral campaign and blamed both PSOE and C's for an election repeat, with both [...] "having made [...] impossible".|$|E
2500|$|All EU members {{which have}} joined the bloc since {{the signing of the}} Maastricht treaty in 1992 are legally obliged to adopt the euro once they meet the criteria, since the terms of their {{accession}} treaties make the provisions on the euro binding on them. [...] In order for a state to formally join the eurozone, enabling them to mint euro coins and get a seat at the European Central Bank (ECB) and the <b>Eurogroup,</b> a country must {{be a member of the}} European Union and comply with five convergence criteria, which were initially defined by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. These criteria include: complying with the debt and deficit criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact, keeping inflation and long-term governmental interest rates below reference values, and stabilizing their currency's exchange rate versus the euro. [...] Generally, it is expected that the last point will be demonstrated by two consecutive years of [...] participation in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), though according to the Commission [...] "exchange rate stability during a period of non-participation before entering ERM II can be taken into account." [...] The country must also ensure that their national laws are compliant with the ECB statute, ESCB statute and [...] of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2015, the new elect Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said, {{that it was}} {{absolutely}} possible for Bulgaria to join ERM-II before the term of the current government ends in 2018, {{and that he would}} begin talks with the <b>Eurogroup</b> to map what sort of preparations the state should undertake to qualify for membership. The former governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, , in office when the currency board of the state was established, believes the euro should be adopted in January 2018, because this would [...] "trigger a number of positive economic effects": Sufficient money supply (leading to increased lending which is needed to improve economic growth), getting rid of the currency board which prevents the national bank functioning as a lender of last resort to rescue banks in financial troubles, and finally private and public lending would benefit from lower interest rates (at least half as high). The former deputy governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, , agreed with Paramov, stating {{that it was possible to}} adopt the euro already in 2018, and [...] "Bulgaria’s membership in the eurozone will bring only positive effect on the economy" [...] because [...] "since establishing the currency board in 1997, we have been accepting all the negative effects of accession into the eurozone without getting the positive ones (access to the European financial market)".|$|E
