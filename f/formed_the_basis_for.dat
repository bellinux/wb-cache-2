5|$|After her commissioning, Sachsen {{joined the}} German fleet, which was tasked {{primarily}} with coastal defense against France and Russia, who were {{presumed to be}} the most likely enemies in a continental war. In the early 1880s, heightened tensions with Russia prompted the naval command developed more offensively-minded contingencies. These <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the annual summer fleet maneuvers, in which Sachsen took part.|$|E

5|$|Also {{gone from}} the film are the flashbacks to Lecter's childhood, in which he sees his younger sister, Mischa, eaten by German deserters in 1944. These flashbacks <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the 2007 film Hannibal Rising (written {{concurrently}} with the 2006 novel of the same name) which portrays Lecter as a young man.|$|E
5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought style {{battleship}} built in the French Navy; the previous Magenta-class ships were barbette ships, a type of ironclad battleship. Brennus <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the subsequent group of five broadly similar battleships built to the same design specifications, begun with Charles Martel, though they reverted to the armament layout of the earlier Magentas which saw the main guns distributed in single turrets in a lozenge pattern.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{textbook}} {{was at once}} well received, being admired both by zoologists and naturalists {{and among}} allied soldiers.

The first government operator of the 757 was the Mexican Air Force, which took delivery of a VIP-configured 757-200 in November 1987.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway {{was raised}} in Oak Park, Illinois.

5|$|The true {{impact of}} Operation Mincemeat is unknown, {{although}} {{the island was}} liberated more quickly than anticipated and losses were lower than predicted. The events were depicted in Operation Heartbreak, a 1950 novel by the former cabinet minister Duff Cooper, before one of the agents who planned and carried out Mincemeat, Ewen Montagu, wrote a history in 1953.

5|$|The two men {{credited}} {{with the birth of}} forecasting as a science were officer of the Royal Navy Francis Beaufort and his protégé Robert FitzRoy.

5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important cutting-edge problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> several important textbooks, {{such as those of}} van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E
5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy built in the late 19th century. She was laid down in January 1889, launched in October 1891, and completed in 1896. Her design was unique and departed from earlier ironclad battleship designs by introducing a number of innovations. These included a main battery of heavy guns mounted on the centerline and the first use of Belleville boilers. She <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> several subsequent designs, beginning with Charles Martel.|$|E
5|$|Brin had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} three ships, but their great cost forced him to settle for two. At the time, Italy's industrial capacity was insufficient to build the ships out of domestic material. Everything from the iron used to build the hulls to the ships' machinery and guns had to be imported. The Caio Duilio class <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the following two ironclad designs, the , also designed by Brin and laid down in 1876, and the , designed by Giuseppe Micheli and laid down in 188182.|$|E
