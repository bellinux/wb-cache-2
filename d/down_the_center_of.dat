5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{entering}} Cayuga County, NY31 crosses {{and begins to}} parallel the New York State Thruway (I-90), which NY31 does {{for most of its}} routing west of the outer Syracuse suburbs. In Port Byron, NY31 intersects NY38 {{in the center of the}} village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY31 continues alone to Weedsport, where the route meets NY34 and County Route31B (CR31B, formerly NY31B) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the strip of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY31 to the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of SBS on the Woodhaven/Cross Bay corridor {{has been supported}} by transit advocates and bus riders, particularly those in the Rockaways. However, many residents of the communities north of the Rockaways, particularly car users and business owners, have opposed the Select Bus Service project. Much of the opposition has been due to the {{implementation of}} bus lanes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the boulevard, which could cause increased traffic congestion. The plan in April 2015 would have prohibited left-turns at twelve intersections.|$|E

5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to {{the underside of the}} tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua {{to the floor of the}} mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
5|$|The {{backbone}} of Phoenix's freeway system {{is composed of}} three major freeways—Interstate 10, Interstate 17, and U.S. Route 60. Interstate 10, being a transcontinental route between California and Florida, is the most heavily traveled freeway in the Valley of the Sun. Interstate 17 runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Arizona, connecting Phoenix with Sedona, Prescott, Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon. U.S. Route 60 spans most of the country, but is only a controlled-access highway (i.e. freeway) for a few short stints, one of them being in the East Valley. West of Phoenix, it shuttles travelers to cities such as Wickenburg, Kingman and Las Vegas (by way of a connection in Wickenburg with U.S. Route 93). In addition to these three freeways, three beltways, Routes 101, 202, and 303 loop around Phoenix, the East Valley, and the West Valley, respectively. State Route 51 connects Downtown with the northern reaches of the city, and Arizona State Route 143 is a distributor for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.|$|E
5|$|The freeway {{enters the}} Salt Lake Valley {{on the former}} {{alignment}} of North Temple Street until it passes the Salt Lake City International Airport, where the freeway veers slightly south and leaves the North Temple Street corridor which leads to Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. The Green Line of the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) TRAX system briefly parallels I-80 before traveling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> North Temple Street. I-80 becomes concurrent with I-15 after interchanges with SR-58 and 600South and continues south for about , passing along the western and southern edges of downtown Salt Lake City. The southern interchange with I-15, which also includes SR-201 (21st South Freeway) and {{marks the end of}} the concurrency, is known as the Spaghetti Bowl,. In the southwestern corner of the Spaghetti Bowl is another portion of the UTA TRAX Green Line as it travels towards West Valley City. After separating from I-15, the freeway continues easterly through South Salt Lake, loosely following an alignment just south of 2100South and the UTA S Line streetcar through the Sugar House neighborhood and past Sugar House Parkonce the home of the Sugar House Prison towards the clockwise terminus of the I-215 270° belt route around Salt Lake. It continues through Parley's Canyon, where the freeway joins the historical route of the Lincoln Highway. Between the mouth of the canyon and the Summit county line, the route re-enters the Wasatch National Forest.|$|E

5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek {{a crack in the}} soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E

25|$|A {{road surface}} marking is {{any kind of}} device or {{material}} that is used on a road surface in order to convey official information for drivers and pedestrians. Edward N.

25|$|A superficially similar honeyeater is {{the black}} honeyeater, (Sugomel nigrum). It has a {{different}} call, is smaller, with a finer bill, shorter tail and lacks the bare eye patch. Males of this species also have a distinctive stripe <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the chest and abdomen, while females have plainer wings and less streaking on the breast (eds Higgins et al. 2001).|$|E
25|$|At one time, Modesto was the {{operational}} {{center of the}} Tidewater Southern Railway, which had its main line <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Ninth Street, a major north-south street. A city ordinance passed by the city council kept electric power lines over this section of street activated long after the railroad had converted to steam power. In 2000, the last trains ran down Ninth Street. Now the railroad (owned by the Union Pacific Railroad since 1983) no longer passes through Modesto.|$|E
25|$|On calm summer afternoons {{with little}} {{prevailing}} wind, sea breezes from both coasts may collide in the middle, creating especially severe storms <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the state. These thunderstorms can drift towards either the west or east coast {{depending on the}} relative strengths of the sea breezes, and sometimes survive to move {{out over the water}} at night, creating spectacular cloud-to-cloud lightning shows for hours after sunset. Due to its large size Lake Okeechobee may also contribute to this activity by creating its own lake breeze which collides with the east and west coast sea breezes.|$|E

25|$|The {{top deck}} {{on the new}} bridge was {{originally}} just a flat space. Traversing the bridge in the harshness of winter was very uncomfortable, so an enclosure running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the pedestrian area was added by the 1970s. Originally {{meant to be a}} heated indoor pedestrian area, due to energy cost concerns, the walkway is mostly unheated. There are some heaters inside that keep the area slightly warmer than outside, and some heat loss from the steam mains, but it can still dip below the freezing point. The structure also adds a windbreak for the top level, improving conditions for people who choose to walk outside. In the summer, large overhangs also provide some shade.|$|E
25|$|On September 21, 2005, JetBlue Flight 292, an Airbus A320 {{discovered}} {{a problem with}} its landing gear as it took off from Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California. It flew in circles for three hours to burn off fuel, then landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport on runway 25L, balancing on its back wheels as it rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the runway. Passengers were able to watch their own coverage live from the satellite broadcast on JetBlue in-flight TV seat displays of their plane as it made an emergency landing with the front landing gear visibly becoming damaged. Because JetBlue did not serve LAX at the time, the aircraft was evaluated and repaired at a Continental Airlines hangar.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Lower Peninsula {{was home}} to many {{different}} railroads during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century. One of these lines was the Detroit, Bay City & Alpena Railroad, later known as the Detroit and Mackinac Railway. The railroad had a main line along the Lake Huron shore and branch lines connecting to logging camps and gravel quarries. The railroad was a part owner of the SS Chief Wawatam a rail car ferry that crossed the Straits of Mackinac. Running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the Northern Lower Peninsula was the Michigan Central Railroad, which connected Mackinaw City with Bay City, Detroit, Lansing, and beyond. This line later became the New York Central and was sold to the Detroit and Mackinac Railway in 1976. Several other railroads have existed in Alpena's history.|$|E

25|$|The Fahd 240 {{is based}} upon the latest Mercedes Benz LAP 1424/32 chassis. This variant {{includes}} a far more powerful engine and a slight increase in armor. It has the same engine as the Fahd. All original Fahds have been updated to this standard, and it is the main variant in service with the Egyptian Army. It weighs 11.6 tons. The seating arrangement and design characteristics are similar to the original Fahd APC. It has a crew of two and can carry ten soldiers. On top of the passenger compartment are two large roof hatches, hinged {{at the center of the}} vehicle. They sit facing outward <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle. Each passenger has a firing port, giving four ports on either side of the vehicle. The armament is similar to the original Fahd.|$|E
25|$|Middle Plantation was {{included}} in James City Shire when it was established in 1634, as the Colony reached a total population of approximately 5,000. (James City and the other shires in Virginia changed their names a few years later; James City Shire then became known as James City County). However, the middle ground ridge line was essentially the dividing line with Charles River Shire, which was renamed York County after King Charles I fell out of favor with the citizens of England. As Middle Plantation and later Williamsburg developed, the boundaries were adjusted slightly. For most of the colonial period, {{the border between the}} two counties ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Duke of Gloucester Street. During this time, and for almost 100 years after the formation of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States, despite practical complications, the town remained divided between the two counties.|$|E
25|$|The playfield is a {{planar surface}} {{inclined}} upward {{from three to}} seven degrees (current convention is {{six and a half}} degrees), away from the player, and includes multiple targets and scoring objectives. Some operators intentionally extend threaded levelers on the rear legs and/or shorten or remove the levelers on the front legs to create additional incline in the playfield, making the ball move faster and harder to play. It is important that the playfield be level left-to-right; a quick visual test compares the top of the back cabinet against a brick or block wall behind it, or to roll a marble <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the playfield glass. If it clearly rolls off to one side, a player may be inclined to stuff folded paper beneath the legs on the lower side to level the playfield. Additionally, leg levelers that are all extended fully make the game easier to nudge; when collapsed low, the entire game is more stable, and nudging becomes harder.|$|E
