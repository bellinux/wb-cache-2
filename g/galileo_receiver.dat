The tool has been developed by Deimos Space under Alenia Spazio specification. A Software (SW) Receiver is a key element in the GARDA project. GRANADA covers a dual role: test-bench for integration and evaluation of receiver technologies on one side, and SW receiver as asset for GNSS application developers on the other side. GRANADA is conceived as a modular and configurable tool, in which the user can embed and test his/her own algorithms with a user-friendly interface.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of <b>Galileo</b> <b>receivers</b> will be a key factor to determine the market approach and penetration. The massive use of the Galileo services will be impacted, {{as well as the}} estimated economical return of the Galileo linked activities. In general, GNSS receivers use similar mathematical models for the computation of the global positioning from a standard parameter set. However, receivers design and implementation solutions are often inherently dependent on the specific parameter representations defined in the Signal-In-Space (SIS) interface specifications. In this paper, we introduce Interface Communication Modeling Language (ICML) as a model-based approach for the SIS interface specification to support the engineering of <b>Galileo</b> <b>receivers.</b> We argue that a model-based specification can potentially bring several technical benefits to the design of <b>Galileo</b> <b>receivers,</b> including support for specification communication among stakeholders, reuse and adaptation of existing GPS software and chipsets, and receiver-side multi GNSS interoperability, for example. As a result, a model-based SIS interface specification can contribute to increase the use of the Galileo services by reducing the impact of the technical factors leading to the extra costs. In the paper, we present the overall layout of the ICML language and preliminary applications. In particular, we present a simplified excerpt of a Galileo-like SIS specification and functional schema of GNSS receivers and show how the ICML-based specification can support the design of <b>Galileo</b> <b>receivers.</b> An important caveat: no endorsement is made {{for the use of the}} ICML language for the official Galileo SIS interface specification...|$|R

Galileo {{is a completely}} civil system that offers various levels of services especially for civil users including service with safety guarantee. Galileo system employs modern signal structure and modern BOC (Binary Offset Carrier) modulation. The <b>Galileo</b> <b>Receiver</b> is investigated {{in the frame of}} the GARDA project solved by consortium under leadership of Alenia Spacio – LABEN. The aim of <b>Galileo</b> <b>Receiver</b> Core Technologies subtask is to investigate the key problems of the <b>Galileo</b> <b>receiver</b> development. The Galileo code and carrier tracking subtask of the <b>Galileo</b> <b>Receiver</b> Core Technologies is carried out at the Czech Technical University. The problem was analysed and split to the particular tasks. The aim of this paper is focused on BOC correlator architecture. The correlation function of the BOC modulation is more complex with a plenty of correlation peaks. The delay discriminator characteristic of such signal has several stable nodes, which cause stability problem. The standard solutions of this problem like BOC non-coherent processing, very early – very late correlator and deconvolution correlator are analysed. The new correlator architecture for BOC modulation processing has been developed. The developed correlator has two outputs, one for fine tracking and the second one for correct node detection. The second output is based on comparison of the correlation function envelopes. The simplified method of correlation function envelope calculation is described in this paper. The correlator is planned to be tested in the GRANADA software simulator including a sophisticated method of correlator output combination...|$|E

40|$|Future {{navigation}} services and performance limits {{provided by the}} upcoming Galileo satellite system will require corresponding improvements of the user navigation receiving systems. Therefore, the Institute of Communciations and Navigation of the German Aerospace Center originated {{the development of a}} <b>Galileo</b> <b>Receiver</b> Demonstrator (GALANT). The aim is to develop a complete Safety-of-Life (SoL) <b>Galileo</b> <b>receiver</b> system. For SoL applications, interference and multipath signals can cause serious performance degradations, which cannot be tolerated. Advanced signal-processing algorithms including antenna array techniques like digital beam-forming will contribute to overcome this problem by suppressing interference and multipath signals and improving the reception of useful line-ofsight satellite signals and thus enable a more accurate and reliable positioning. The first part of this paper describes the antenna array and the basic design issues. The second part is a short discussion of the front end concept utilized for the demonstrator.

40|$|The current Search and Rescue (SAR) service, {{which is}} based on the Cospas-Sarsat system, suffers from major {{limitations}} such as poor position accuracy, long alert times and high false alarm rate. Two types of distress signals are used, the first 121. 5 MHz/(up to 100 mW) and the second 406 MHz/ 5 W, the latter being able to carry digitally encoded identification and position data. The Galileo system will importantly contribute to the improvement of the SAR system. Indeed, the Galileo satellites will include a transponder in order to re-broadcast the 406 MHz message, which will allow a better coverage (27 Galileo satellites plus the current seven Cospas-Sarsat satellites) and also a shorter alert time. They will also include a return link message (RLM) in the Galileo E 1 b open service signal, which will reduce the number of false alarms. The Galileo system is therefore a great opportunity {{for the development of a}} new generation of beacons which will include a <b>Galileo</b> <b>receiver</b> and therefore be able to take advantage of the better coverage provided by the Galileo constellation to provide shorter alert times and of the RLM to reduce the number of false alarms. One of the major issue when designing a <b>Galileo</b> <b>receiver</b> to be operated in a distess beacon is to design a front-end that is sensitive enough to pick the very weak Galileo signals and on the same time rejects the strong distress messages. Indeed, when the beacon is turned on, the <b>Galileo</b> <b>receiver</b> is in cold start conditions and a short amount of time is left to the receiver to get a first fix before any distress message is actually emitted. However, in some cases, the receiver is not able to determine its position sufficiently fast and the front-end therefore has to acquire the satellites in the presence of the distress signals. This paper presents a Galileo radio frequency front-end designed in order to operate in the presence of such signals...|$|E

In this paper, we first introduce a double-dwell structure with hybrid search strategy for fast acquisition of CDMA signals with long spreading factors. We also derive its Mean Acquisition Time (MAT) and we compare its performance with that of single-dwell hybrid-search structures. Typically, doubledwell architectures have been preferred to single-dwell architectures. However, comparisons between the two structures are still hard to find in the existing literature, especially for hybrid-search approaches.
