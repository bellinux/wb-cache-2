5000|$|Götze’s large-format {{works in}} the artist’s {{hallmark}} pop-art style often deal with watershed moments in history, historic figures {{and the state of}} the German society. [...] In 2006/07 Götze produced the 700 piece enamel composition Victoria. In 2012-2016 he decorated the interior of the Baroque castle church St. Giles in Bernburg, Saxony-Anhalt with <b>enamel</b> <b>sheet</b> steel plates.|$|R
50|$|The Union {{automobile}} had {{a gasoline}} tank {{that was built}} {{in the back of the}} seat hidden from sight. It has a capacity sufficient to run the automobile about 125 mi. The engine was water-cooled with a circulating pump, driven by a gear from the cam shaft. There was a large radiator coil provided. The electric current for ignition was supplied by dry batteries for starting. A generator was used in normal operation. The automobile was equipped with 34 in pneumatic tires. Kerosene oil lamps were furnished it came with <b>enameled</b> <b>sheet</b> steel mud guards.|$|R

25|$|Early {{road signs}} were usually cast iron, {{but this was}} {{increasingly}} displaced by cast aluminium in the 1930s. Cast signs were designed to be maintained by being repainted with the raised lettering and symbol easily picked out by an untrained hand. This sort of sign was sometimes given an element of night use by the inclusion of glass reflectors. An alternative to casting and painting was vitreous <b>enamelled</b> <b>sheet</b> iron or steel. In the 1950s cast signs were quickly displaced by sheet metal (usually aluminium) coated with adhesive plastics; these could be made reflective, famously by Scotchlite. Such signs had become almost universal by the reforms of the early 1960s.|$|R

50|$|The Patent Enamel Company Ltd, {{founded in}} 1888, {{moved to a}} purpose built factory in Heeley Road in the {{following}} year. Benjamin Baugh had begun to manufacture tough vitreous <b>enamelled</b> <b>sheet</b> wrought iron in Bradford Street In 1857. He combined with William Walters, and H W Elliott to form the Patent Enamel Co Ltd. The products were used for advertising on railway stations, hotels and public houses. Competition and the improved paper posters and plastics caused the business to decline and the company closed in 1965. The site was occupied by several small firms until it was destroyed by fire. Comet moved onto the site and later moved onto the Battery Retail Park.|$|R
50|$|The {{ability to}} apply {{porcelain}} <b>enamel</b> to <b>sheet</b> steels was not developed until 1900, {{with the discovery}} that making {{minor changes to the}} composition of the enamel, such as including cobalt oxides as minor components, could drastically improve its adhesion ability to carbon steels. Concurrent with this development was the first use of wet-slurry enamel application; this allowed porcelain enamel to be applied to much more complex shapes by dipping the shape into the liquid enamel slurry.|$|R
50|$|Removal of {{the metal}} slat wall cover {{treatment}} has begun. As of June 2009, a new wall treatment had started to be installed. The new treatment appears to be <b>enamel</b> painted <b>sheet</b> metal that is white in colour with dark green trim and lettering. On March 25, 2010, the panels were replaced with new versions that showed less buckling; however, the buckling issue has not been totally resolved and a new stronger version is being developed.|$|R
50|$|Pearson and {{her husband}} James came to public {{attention}} through works shown at the Society of Artists of Great Britain in its exhibitions in 1775-77. The works she showed there were mostly depictions of birds, especially parrots and parakeets. Most of her output consisted of works on a single sheet of glass. Following {{the practice of the}} time, the Pearsons used a technique in which the image was painted in <b>enamels</b> on <b>sheets</b> of colourless glass and then fired.|$|R
50|$|Pearson and {{his wife}} came to public {{attention}} through works shown at the Society of Artists of Great Britain in its exhibitions in 1775-77. Although the couple usually worked on separate pieces they occasionally collaborated, as on their stained glass copy after Carlo Maratti’s Salutation, shown in 1775. A later joint work was one after Guido Reni’s Aurora, shown in London in 1793. The Pearsons used a technique in which the image was painted in <b>enamels</b> on <b>sheets</b> of plain glass and then fired.|$|R
25|$|The {{interiors}} {{of the three}} refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers. The Green Dining Room (1866–68) {{was the work of}} Philip Webb and William Morris, and displays Elizabethan influences. The lower part of the walls are panelled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure, with moulded plaster foliage on {{the main part of the}} wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained-glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones. The Centre Refreshment Room (1865–77) was designed in a Renaissance style by James Gamble. The walls and even the Ionic columns in this room are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile, the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on <b>enamelled</b> metal <b>sheets</b> and matching stained-glass windows, and the marble fireplace was designed and sculpted by Alfred Stevens and was removed from Dorchester House prior to that building's demolition in 1929. The Grill Room (1876–81) was designed by Sir Edward Poynter; the lower part of its walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by wood panelling, while above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months, painted by ladies from the Art School then based in the museum. The windows are also stained glass; there is an elaborate cast-iron grill still in place.|$|R
40|$|The {{cold rolling}} {{effect on the}} {{hydrogen}} permeability (TH value) and on the microstructure have been studied on samples prepared from Al-killed low carbon steel sheets after several cold rolling levels. The TH values of the hot rolled strips were very short, but due to the cold rolling increase exponentially. The fragmentation of large cementite phase has a significant influence {{on the evolution of}} texture during the cold rolling process. The cold deformation effects on the TH value were studied on four annealed <b>enamelling</b> grade steel <b>sheets</b> also. Depending on the carbides sizes and carbides position in ferrite grains after annealing the TH values increase or decrease after low deformation degrees, due to the steel texture modification and dislocation character. Dislocations act as major tripping site for hydrogen, if deformation degree is higher than 30 %...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{porcelain}} enamels are inorganic coatings for metallic components {{based on}} a special ceramic-vitreous matrix in which specific additives are randomly dispersed. The ceramic-vitreous matrix is made by a mixture of various raw materials and elements and in particular {{it is based on}} boron-silicate glass added with metal oxides(1) of titanium, zinc, tin, zirconia, alumina, ecc. These additions are often used to improve and enhance some important performances such as corrosion(2) and wear resistance, mechanical strength, fracture toughness and also aesthetic functions. The coating process, called enamelling, depends {{on the nature of the}} surface, but also on the kind of the used porcelain <b>enamel.</b> For metal <b>sheets</b> coatings two industrial processes are actually used: one {{based on a}} wet porcelain enamel and another based on a dry-silicone porcelain enamel. During the firing process, that is performed at about 870 °C in the case of a steel substrate, the enamel raw material melts and interacts with the metal substrate so enabling the formation of a continuous varying structure. The interface domain between the substrate and the external layer is made of a complex material system where the ceramic vitreous and the metal constituents are mixed. In particular four main regions can be identified, (i) the pure metal region, (ii) the region where the metal constituents are dominant compared with the ceramic vitreous components, (iii) the region where the ceramic vitreous constituents are dominant compared with the metal ones, and the fourth region (iv) composed by the pure ceramic vitreous material. It has also to be noticed the presence of metallic dendrites that hinder the substrate and the external layer passing through the interphase region. Each region of the final composite structure plays a specific role: the metal substrate has mainly the structural function, the interphase region and the embedded dendrites guarantee the adhesion of the external vitreous layer to the substrate and the external vitreous layer is characterized by an high tribological, corrosion and thermal shock resistance. Such material, due to its internal composition, functionalization and architecture can be considered as a functionally graded composite material. The knowledge of the mechanical, tribological and chemical behavior of such composites is not well established and the research is still in progress. In particular the mechanical performances data about the composite coating are not jet established. In the present work the Residual Stresses, the Young modulus and the First Crack Failure of the composite porcelain enamel coating are studied. Due to the differences of the porcelain composite enamel and steel thermal properties the <b>enamelled</b> steel <b>sheets</b> have residual stresses: compressive residual stress acts on the coating and tensile residual stress acts on the steel sheet. The residual stresses estimation has been performed by measuring the curvature of rectangular one-side coated specimens. The Young modulus and the First Crack Failure (FCF) of the coating have been estimated by four point bending tests (3 - 7) monitored by means of the Acoustic Emission (AE) technique(5, 6). In particular the AE information has been used to identify, during the bending tests, the displacement domain over which no coating failure occurs (Free Failure Zone, FFZ). In the FFZ domain, the Young modulus has been estimated according to ASTM D 6272 - 02. The FCF has been calculated as the ratio between the displacement at the first crack of the coating and the coating thickness on the cracked side. The mechanical performances of the tested coated specimens have also been related and discussed to respective microstructure and surface characteristics by double entry charts...|$|R
