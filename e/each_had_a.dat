5|$|Armed {{with the}} canal company's specifications, Samuel ordered three tankers from William Gray & Company in {{northern}} England. Named , Conch and Clam, <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> capacity of 5,010long tons of deadweight. These three ships {{were the first}} tankers of the Tank Syndicate, forerunner of today's Royal Dutch Shell company.|$|E
5|$|Soranus {{wrote that}} Hippocrates' father was Heraclides, a physician, {{and his mother}} was Praxitela, {{daughter}} of Tizane. The two sons of Hippocrates, Thessalus and Draco, and his son-in-law, Polybus, were his students. According to Galen, a later physician, Polybus was Hippocrates' true successor, while Thessalus and Draco <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> son named Hippocrates (Hippocrates III and IV).|$|E
5|$|The ships had {{extensive}} electrical generator systems. Leipzig had three power plants that <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> 180kilowatt turbo-generator and a 180kW diesel generator; this gave the ship a combined output of 1,080kW at 220volts. Nürnberg had four generators which comprised two 300kW turbo-generators and two 350kW diesel generators, {{for a total}} output of 1,300kW, also at 220volts.|$|E

5|$|A {{soup kitchen}} {{was built in}} 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by public subscription and dispensed soup to the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891. The soup was not free: it cost half a pence per pint. People who had donated <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> number of tickets which they could give {{to those people who}} they believed qualified for the ration. The deserving poor in Victorian times were those unable to work during the winter months. Those individuals classed as undeserving were those whose poverty was deemed to be caused by indolence and alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
5|$|All {{excavated}} tombs were intrusive burials interred under residential platforms. They {{were all}} {{found in a}} squatting position without any particular orientation. Many of the remains were found accompanied by a broken obsidian blade. Some burials had other offerings, for example that of a woman accompanied by domestic utensils, {{some of which were}} blackened with soot. Two child burials <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> jade bead and the burial of an elderly male was accompanied by pieces of burnt pine and evergreen oak.|$|E

5|$|His first {{encounter}} with photography came after he took {{a position in the}} household of Lady Vivian, widow of Hussey Vivian, 3rd Baron Vivian; Lady Vivian's twin daughters <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> camera, and Brooks was entrusted with developing the films. Paying by weekly shilling installments, he bought a camera himself which he used to take pictures of prominent people for publication; his first portrait was sold to several newspapers through an agency, earning him seven guineas.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, von Zittel divided stegocephalians {{among three}} taxa: Lepospondyli, Temnospondyli, and Stereospondyli. He placed microsaurs in Lepospondyli, a group which he {{characterized}} as having simple, spool-shaped vertebral centra. Temnospondyli included forms with the centra divided into pleurocentra and intercentra. All members of Stereospondyli had amphicoelous centra composed {{only of the}} intercentra. Cope objected to von Zittel's classification, considering the vertebrae of lepospondyls and stereospondyls indistinguishable because <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> simple spool shape. He continued to use Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta (which he alternatively referred to as Rhachitomi) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occipital condyles.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Parachute Brigade {{was formed}} at RAF Kibrit in the Middle East on 1December1942. Upon {{formation}} {{it consisted of}} the brigade headquarters, signals company, defence platoon and three parachute battalions. The battalions assigned were the 156th Parachute Battalion (156 Para), raised from British servicemen in India, the 10th Parachute Battalion (10 Para), formed around a cadre from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment, and the 11th Parachute Battalion (11 Para), created from a cadre of 156 Para. The brigade's battalions all had the same composition: three rifle companies, each comprising a company headquarters, and three platoons. <b>Each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Support Company of mortar, machine gun and carrier platoons, along with a Headquarters Company. The brigade's first commander, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Smyth, was replaced by Brigadier John Hackett on 4January 1943.|$|E

The west exit on the Manhattan-bound platform also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> full-time token booth.|$|R
5|$|The Medway long barrows all {{conformed}} {{to the same}} general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. <b>Each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> stone chamber at {{the eastern end of}} the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them {{to the site of the}} monument to be erected.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} primarily {{developed for}} the ZX Spectrum, given Chris's expertise with its Z80 processor. Tim would later also develop the concepts behind new intellectual properties. The brothers <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strong intuition for {{the elements of a}} successful game. Ultimate found success with games such as Jetpac (1983), Atic Atac (1983), Sabre Wulf (1984), and Knight Lore (1984), whose expansive experiences exceeded the scope of their contemporary arcade games. The brothers outsourced the programming of their games for other platforms to outside developers, for they preferred the work of making new games over re-programming old ones.|$|E
5|$|Veronica Mars is {{a student}} who {{progresses}} {{from high school to}} college while moonlighting as a private investigator under the tutelage of her detective father. In each episode, Veronica solves a different stand-alone case while working to solve a more complex mystery. The first two seasons of the series <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> season-long mystery arc, introduced in the first episode of the season and solved in the season finale. The third season took a different format, focusing on smaller mystery arcs that would last the course of several episodes.|$|E

5|$|When the {{agreement}} was finalised, the United Kingdom and West Germany <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> 42.5% stake of the workload, with the remaining 15% going to Italy; this division of the production work was heavily influenced by international political bargaining. The front fuselage and tail assembly was assigned to BAC (now BAE Systems) in the United Kingdom; the centre fuselage to MBB (now EADS) in West Germany; and the wings to Aeritalia (now Alenia Aeronautica) in Italy. Similarly, tri-national worksharing was used for engines, general and avionic equipment. A separate multinational company, Turbo-Union, was formed in June 1970 to develop and build the RB199 engines for the aircraft, with ownership similarly split 40% Rolls-Royce, 40% MTU, and 20% FIAT.|$|E
5|$|The Nisshōki flag is {{designated}} as the national flag in the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem, which was promulgated and became effective on August 13, 1999. Although no earlier legislation had specified a national flag, the sun-disc flag had already become the de facto national flag of Japan. Two proclamations issued in 1870 by the Daijō-kan, the governmental body of the early Meiji period, <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> provision for a design of the national flag. A sun-disc flag was adopted as the national flag for merchant ships under Proclamation No. 57 of Meiji 3 (issued on February 27, 1870), and as the national flag used by the Navy under Proclamation No. 651 of Meiji 3 (issued on October 27, 1870). Use of the Hi no maru was severely restricted {{during the early years}} of the Allied occupation of Japan after World War II; these restrictions were later relaxed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{installment}} of the story-based DLC The Knife of Dunwall was praised for its level design, which encouraged exploration to find hidden content and alternative routes through areas. The modifications to certain abilities, particularly Blink were similarly well received for the changes they brought to the gameplay from the main game. The story, however, was generally criticized. Polygon noted that the deadly assassin Daud had no motive for seeking redemption, and allowing him to be played as a non-lethal character created a disconnect with the narrative. IGN considered that it felt like only half of a complete game, lacking any urgency in its story and featuring a disappointing conclusion. The Brigmore Witches story received a mixed response, with Destructoid saying that it offered a more gripping narrative, while Polygon stated that it lacked the same tension as The Knife of Dunwall, and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. However, the gameplay was generally considered an improvement, providing more intricate level design and nuanced world building that produced gameplay requiring a more thoughtful approach. PC Gamer appreciated that the levels <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> distinct theme, and adequately provided for both stealth and violent gameplay, while Polygon said that only the last level improved over the preceding DLC, introducing new mechanics that forced changes in stealth players.|$|E

5|$|The {{magneto-optical}} drive manufactured by Canon Inc. {{was used as}} the primary mass storage device. These drives were relatively new to the market, and the NeXT was the first computer to use them. They were cheaper than hard drives (blank media especially so: though <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> cost of $150 to Canon, Jobs's typically forthright negotiations saw Canon agree to a retail of only $50 apiece) but slower (with an average seek time of 96 ms). The design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, since each NeXT Computer had only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system. Storage options proved challenging for the first NeXT Computers. The magneto-optical media was relatively expensive and had performance and reliability problems despite being faster than a floppy drive. The drive was not sufficient to run as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system both in terms of speed and capacity.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of archbishop was usually {{held by a}} scion of nobility, and not necessarily a priest; this widespread practice allowed younger sons of noble houses to find prestigious and financially secure positions without the requirements of priesthood. The archbishop and prince-elector was chosen by the cathedral chapter, the members of which also served as his advisers. As members of a cathedral chapter, they participated in the Mass, or sang the Mass; in addition, they performed other duties as needed. They {{were not required to}} be priests but they could, if they wished, take Holy Orders. As prebendaries, they received stipends from cathedral income; depending on the location and wealth of the cathedral, this could amount to substantial annual income. In the Electorate, the Chapter included 24canons of various social ranks; they <b>each</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> place in the choir, based on their rank, which in turn was usually derived from the social standing of their families.|$|E
