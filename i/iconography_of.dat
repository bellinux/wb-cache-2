50|$|The <b>iconographies</b> <b>of</b> the yogini {{images in}} four yogini temples are not uniform.

In Bhedaghat temple, yogini images are seated in Lalitasana.|$|R
50|$|Much of Keck's writing oscillates between absurdist {{comedy that}} centers around altered states of {{consciousness}} and sexuality and serious reflections on religious themes. His most recent books suggest an association with Discordianism as the cover art displays many <b>of</b> the <b>iconographies</b> <b>of</b> Discordian beliefs, such as the Sacred Chao, and direct reference to the Greek goddess Eris.|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, {{the authors}} propose a {{theoretical}} lens to critically examine the <b>iconographies</b> <b>of</b> contemporary organizations. In doing so, {{they seek to}} understand how iconographies {{can be used to}} legitimize organizations. They distinguish between two iconographies – ‘image-object’ and ‘screen-object’ – and examine how they are intricately related to organizational legitimation practices. They then go on to illustrate these iconographies and their relationships in the case study of a French university that has faced intense and changing legitimacy demands. The authors investigate the relationships between these iconographies in the extreme case of the command room of the former North American Treaty Organization (NATO), as the university in question occupies the former NATO headquarters. The case study reveals how university members shifted between <b>iconographies</b> <b>of</b> ‘image-object’ and ‘screen-objects’ to legitimize their organizing practices. As a conclusion, implications for debates about sociomateriality and its relationship with organizational legitimacy are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Although the art {{produced}} (particularly pottery, grave stelai and figurines) {{was used}} by {{a wider range of}} people than much Athenian literature was—including women and children—it is not known how accurately the <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> classical art mapped the reality of classical society.|$|E
5|$|Another {{representation}} of Kamadhenu shows {{her with the}} body of a white Zebu cow, crowned woman's head, colourful eagle wings and a peacock's tail. According to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, this form is influenced by the <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> the Islamic Buraq, who is portrayed with a horse's body, wings, and a woman's face. Contemporary poster art also portrays Kamadhenu in this form.|$|E
5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to the crucifixion theme until his 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion. That {{depiction}} is a far more oblique and less literal utilisation of the <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> the biblical scene, but a more direct invocation of imagery of the slaughterhouse and slabs of meat.|$|E

50|$|World {{trees are}} a {{prevalent}} motif {{occurring in the}} mythical cosmologies, creation accounts, and <b>iconographies</b> <b>of</b> the pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica. In the Mesoamerican context, world trees embodied the four cardinal directions, which also serve to represent the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic axis mundi which connects the planes of the Underworld and the sky {{with that of the}} terrestrial realm.|$|R

5|$|Kaumodaki (IAST: Kaumodakī) is the gada (mace) of the Hindu god Vishnu.

The gada is also found in <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> some of Vishnu's avatars.|$|E
5|$|Others {{are less}} sure: the Olmec-style sculptures may simply imply a common <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> {{power on the}} Pacific and Gulf coasts. In any case, Takalik Abaj was {{certainly}} a place of importance for Olmecs. The Olmec-style sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Middle Preclassic. Except for Monuments1 and 64, the majority were not found in their original locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Ardhanarishvara {{images are}} dated to the Kushan period, {{starting from the}} first century CE. Its iconography evolved and was perfected in the Gupta era. The Puranas and various iconographic treatises write about the mythology and <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> Ardhanarishvara. While Ardhanarishvara remains a popular iconographic form found in most Shiva temples throughout India, very few temples are dedicated to this deity.|$|E

5|$|The <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> Vaikuntha Chaturmurti was {{influenced}} by Gandhara architectural tradition, which impacted the iconographic depictions of sculptures of Northwest India, particularly those made in Kashmir. Keeping with the Gandhara style, the body and legs are depicted as strong and sturdy. The muscular body {{is considered to be}} inflated with prana (life-breath), an Indian concept. The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school of sculpture. The presence of the earth goddess at the feet also reflects Central Asian influence. The ayudhapurushas in the icon may be inspired by those in the Vishnu <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> Gupta art. They and the earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu iconography, even when he is depicted as one-headed.|$|E
5|$|The scholar van Kooij {{notes that}} the <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> Chhinnamasta has the {{elements}} of heroism (vira rasa) and terror (bhayanaka rasa) as well as eroticism (sringara rasa) {{in terms of the}} copulating couple, with the main motifs being the offering of her own severed head, the spilling and drinking of blood, and the trampling of the couple.|$|E

Use of the {{familiar}} <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> his martyrdom, showing the apostle bound to an X-shaped cross, first appears in the Kingdom of Scotland in 1180 during the reign of William I. It was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century, including on one used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286.|$|E

40|$|The {{miniature}} of the eschatological banquet of the Just {{in paradise}} pictured {{at the end}} of the Ambrosian Bible is read here through the lens of a cultural history or histoire des mentalités. The banquet motif is interpreted as a symbolic representation of transcendent order, by means of a bricolage of preexisting images and <b>iconographies</b> <b>of</b> social order. Ultimately, the eschatological setting of the aristocratic banquet involves a polemical critique of a society that excluded Jews, and a vision of the courtly, exclusionary hierarchies of aristocratic Europe subverted...|$|R
50|$|In 1962, Houser {{was asked}} to join the faculty of a new Native American art school, the Institute of American Indian Arts. He {{returned}} to Santa Fe {{with his family to}} head up the Institute’s sculpture department. Casting his first bronzes in 1967, Houser was student and teacher as well, bringing forth his own history and ideas for a student body culled from every corner of Native America. He began working with the <b>iconographies</b> <b>of</b> other tribes, using modernist sculptural influences to forge the tribal and the abstract into a visual lexicon all his own.|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} the <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini. She depicted the saint with a mustache and short beard, wearing a cloak and a crown inscribed with lilies, holding a cross in his right hand, and his severed head in his left hand. A portable icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> Kashmir, {{during the}} 8th and 9th centuries, {{the gods of}} Hindu Trimurti - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - each are {{depicted}} with three heads. In a sculpture displayed in the Metropolitan Art Museum of New York, the four-headed Brahma as well as Shiva are shown with three visible heads. Vishnu is depicted as Vaikuntha Chaturmurti in this configuration, with three visible heads.|$|E
5|$|The <b>iconography</b> <b>of</b> Bhikshatana is {{discussed}} in all Shaiva Agamic texts, including Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama, Karanagama and the iconographic work Shilparatna; the texts are mostly South Indian in origin. The iconography is quite {{similar to that of}} the Kankala-murti aspect who, like Bhikshatana, is associated with the legend of Shiva's atonement for severing Brahma's head. The chief difference is that Bhikshatana is nude and Kankala-murti is clothed.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{contains elements}} typical of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the drapery folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions.
