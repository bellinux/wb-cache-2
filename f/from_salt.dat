5|$|The firm's origins can {{be traced}} back to 1790 when Archibald Dundonald, with John and William Losh, experimented on how to produce soda <b>from</b> <b>salt.</b> In about 1793 they opened a works at Bells Close, near Newcastle. Dundonald sent William Losh to Paris to study Nicolas Leblanc's process for making soda <b>from</b> <b>salt.</b> In 1807, the Loshes opened an alkali works at Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland. It was the first in England to use the Leblanc process. Dundonald left the {{partnership}} and the business continued as Walker Alkali Works.|$|E
5|$|About 75% of {{the island}} chain lost power {{for a few hours}} during the storm. Damage {{occurred}} to downed trees and wooden homes. Between 13 and 17percent of the non-native Australian pine on San Salvador Island experienced damage, primarily from snapping, though some browning <b>from</b> <b>salt</b> spray was noted. Several feet of water flooded the international airport at Freeport.|$|E
5|$|After 1860 handcarts were {{no longer}} used. The Church {{implemented}} {{a new system of}} emigration, in which wagon trains travelled east <b>from</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City in the spring and returned with emigrants in the summer. The transcontinental railroad was being constructed, and the railroad terminus gradually moved westward, shortening the trip.|$|E

5|$|The first {{railroad}} track laid through Thistle was a narrow-gauge {{spur line}} servicing coal mines near today's Scofield Reservoir, built in 1878 by the Utah and Pleasant Valley Railway. By 1890, the Denver and Rio Grande Western, which acquired {{the line in}} a foreclosure sale in 1882, had rebuilt the line to standard gauge. The D connected this line with one they had built west from Colorado, completing a link <b>from</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City to Denver.|$|E
5|$|Ballpark is {{near the}} point where the Salt Lake and Utah {{interurban}} streetcar line crossed the first mainline built south <b>from</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City (which has been known by many names, but is most associated with the Union Pacific Railroad). The TRAX tracks north of the station follow the old route of the Salt Lake and Utah, while the tracks south of the area follow those used by Union Pacific. The electrified spur track visible to the northwest of the current station is the northern continuation of the original Union Pacific mainline; only a few traces of the southern continuation of the Salt Lake and Utah line (which headed due southwest to the vicinity of UTA's Redwood Junction station before turning south) remain.|$|E
50|$|Recently, {{recovery}} of potassium fertilizer <b>salts</b> <b>from</b> sea {{water has been}} studied in India. During extraction of <b>salt</b> <b>from</b> seawater by evaporation, potassium salts get concentrated in bittern, an effluent <b>from</b> the <b>salt</b> industry.|$|R

5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage <b>from</b> <b>salt</b> crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Vary Chamberlin (January 3, 1879October 31, 1967) was an American biologist, ethnographer, and {{historian}} <b>from</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City, Utah. He was {{a faculty member}} of the University of Utah for over 25 years, where he helped establish the School of Medicine and served as its first dean, and later became head of the zoology department. He also taught at Brigham Young University and the University of Pennsylvania, and worked {{for over a decade}} at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, where he described species from around the world.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is a {{component}} of mixed-metal oxide (MMO) anodes used for cathodic protection of underground and submerged structures, and for electrolytic cells for such processes as generating chlorine <b>from</b> <b>salt</b> water. The fluorescence of some ruthenium complexes is quenched by oxygen, finding use in optode sensors for oxygen. Ruthenium red, 6+, is a biological stain used to stain polyanionic molecules such as pectin and nucleic acids for light microscopy and electron microscopy. The beta-decaying isotope 106 of ruthenium is used in radiotherapy of eye tumors, mainly malignant melanomas of the uvea. Ruthenium-centered complexes are being researched for possible anticancer properties. Compared with platinum complexes, those of ruthenium show greater resistance to hydrolysis and more selective action on tumors.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-18th century, salt was mined, the English used Vila do Maio {{to export}} its <b>salt</b> <b>from</b> its <b>salt</b> mines of the {{northwest}} to England and the Portuguese used Calheta to export its <b>salt</b> <b>from</b> Terras Salgadas to Portugal.|$|R

5000|$|It {{was first}} {{prepared}} by Alfred Stock by pyrolysis of diborane at about 200 °C. An improved synthesis starts <b>from</b> <b>salts</b> of B3H8−, which {{is converted to}} the bromide B3H7Br− using HBr. Pyrolysis of this bromide gives pentaborane.|$|R
5|$|Salt is {{processed}} <b>from</b> <b>salt</b> mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad {{suggests}} {{breathing exercises}} {{in a variety}} of ways, such as breathing with one nostril and exhaling with another, asserting that a regular practice multiple times a day cleans up the Nadis (blood vessels), improves digestive powers, stamina, leanness and causes the skin to glow. The text recommends restraining oneself <b>from</b> <b>salt,</b> mustard, acidic foods, spicy astringent pungent foods. The text also states that the yoga student should avoid fasting, early morning baths, sexual intercourse, and sitting near fire. Milk and ghee (clarified butter), cooked wheat, green gram and rice are foods the text approves of, in verses 46–49. The Upanishad also recommends massage, particularly areas of body that tremor or profusely perspire during the practice of yoga.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the route predates the {{invention}} of the automobile; the Donner Party, California Trail and Pony Express all followed the present-day path of the highway. During the 1910s, the route was designated a state highway and, in 1939, State Route 201 was officially written into law, running from Magna east to the mouth of Parley's Canyon. At one point, the highway carried US-50 Alternate west of State Street and both US-40 and US-40 Alternate east of that road, though all were truncated <b>from</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City by the late 1970s. Construction of the freeway portion of SR-201 west of I-15 commenced in the mid-1960s and was fully completed by 1986.|$|E
50|$|Fishcakes {{have also}} {{traditionally}} been made <b>from</b> <b>salted</b> fish (most commonly cod, haddock, or pollock). Fishcakes are also prepared without breadcrumbs or batter, and {{are made with}} a mixture of cooked fish, potatoes, and occasionally eggs formed into patties and then fried.|$|R

5|$|A large {{force of}} Israeli {{infantry}} and armor went east {{to block the}} road <b>from</b> <b>Salt</b> to the Allenby bridge, and they encountered the Jordanian 60th Armored Brigade trying to join the defense of Karameh. In the resulting battle, the Jordanians lost eight Patton tanks without destroying any Israeli tanks, then withdrew to the hills to dig in and continue firing down on the Israelis. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes against Jordanian armor and artillery positions, {{but was unable to}} stop the firing. Within the next two hours, Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against Jordanian defenses on the Musri-Karameh road, the Salt road, and east of Abdullah Bridge. The Israelis also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes and artillery, and began demolishing the camp. A total of 175 houses were blown up.|$|E
5|$|Bounded on each {{sides by}} {{military}} training grounds, the I-80 corridor is overflown by commercial airliners traveling west <b>from</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City International Airport. The freeway veers north around the Cedar Mountains {{in a small}} gap {{between them and the}} Lakeside Mountains. Further east, the highway passes the Stansbury Mountains, which are located in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. After the mountain ranges, the freeway arrives at the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake and closely follows the shore towards the western suburbs of Salt Lake City. However, the historical routes from which the route of I-80 was derived were routed further from the lake, passing through the towns of Grantsville and Tooele before crossing a bottleneck between the Oquirrh Mountains and Stansbury Island in the Great Salt Lake. These communities are now served by SR-138 and SR-36 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Importing {{horses for}} use as general {{transportation}} and in army cavalries of Indian kingdoms was a flourishing business on the western seaboard. The forests were harvested for rich woods such as teak which was exported through ports located {{in the area of}} present-day Kerala. Song dynasty records from China mention the presence of Indian merchants in ports of South China, indicating active trade with overseas kingdoms. South India exported textiles, spices, medicinal plants, precious stones, pottery, salt made <b>from</b> <b>salt</b> pans, jewels, gold, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, aloe wood, perfumes, sandalwood, camphor and condiments to China, Dhofar, Aden, and Siraf (the entryport to Egypt, Arabia and Persia). Architects (Vishwakarmas), sculptors, quarry workers, goldsmiths and other skilled craftsmen whose trade directly or indirectly related to temple construction were also prosperous due to the vigorous temple building activities.|$|E
