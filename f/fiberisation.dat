40|$|Thermal Ceramics {{manufacture}} high-temperature thermal insulation, much {{of which}} {{is made in the}} form of fibre, for use in furnaces, aeroengines, domestic appliances, fire protection systems and other applications. In the manufacturing process, a melt stream emerges from a circular orifice and falls on to two successive spinning wheels, resulting in <b>fiberisation.</b> However, the process also results in a significant fraction of unfiberised material in the form of shot particles. The presence of shot tends to increase the thermal conductivity of the final product. Moreover, some areas of application, such as the automotive industry, require clean fibre with zero shot. Reducing the amount of shot that is produced in the <b>fiberisation</b> process would also reduce the costs of 'cleaning' the fibres for these markets. The Study Group was asked to look at how melt transfers on to the spinning wheels, what kind of melt layer exists on the wheels, and how this layer breaks up. By using a mathematical model to understand the relative importance of various parameters, it is hoped to guide experimental trials and then the scale-up to production levels...|$|E
40|$|Fibre {{evanescent}} wave spectroscopy (FEWS) cure monitoring {{has previously been}} demonstrated with reinforcing fibres using low refractive index epoxy systems. To enable sensing {{of a range of}} aerospace grade epoxy systems, chalcogenide fibres with high refractive index (RI) and a large infra-red (IR) transmission were used for FEWS cure monitoring. However, chalcogenides have low chemical durability and poor mechanical properties resulting in fibre fractures and degradation of the optical properties with time. The aim of the project was to produce a high RI silicate glass, suitable for near infra-red (1000 - 2500 nm) FEWS cure monitoring all possible epoxy resin systems throughout the entire curing process, whilst maintaining mechanical properties suitable for reinforcement. A range of alkali and alkali free silicate glasses and epoxy systems were produced and their refractive indices optically characterised using ellipsometry. The glasses were thermally analysed for the liquidus and fibre forming temperatures for <b>fiberisation.</b> A fibre up-drawing jig was constructed and custom glass fibres were drawn. The composition was then mechanically characterised, demonstrating mechanical properties similar to reinforcing fibres. Subsequently, the fibres were embedded into sunflower oil, liquid epoxy systems and epoxy pre-preg systems. Sunflower oil systems demonstrated proof of FEWS sensing showing excellent peak correlation. Liquid epoxy systems were successfully cure monitored by FEWS. Pre-preg systems did not display FEWS peaks, but were monitored using light intensity...|$|E
