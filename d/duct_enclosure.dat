40|$|Performance of {{compressed}} Gas Insulated Switchgear and Gas Insulated {{systems are}} affected by metallic particle contaminants. 20 % of failures in Gas Insulated Substations {{is due to the}} existence of various metallic contaminations in the form of loose particles. These particles may be free to move in the electric field or may be fixed on the conductors, thus enhancing local surface fields. In this paper basic equations for the movement of metallic particles like aluminum, copper in a bus duct is formulated. The particle motion is simulated using MATLAB. Effect of particle size for various electric fields on particle movement are analyzed. Particles of aluminum, copper, of 10 mm in length at different radii on a 1 -phase bus <b>duct</b> <b>enclosure</b> have been considered. The results show that as the size of particle smaller larger the particle movement and leads to break down. It is also observed that peak movement in radial direction for Aluminium particle is higher than that of copper due to its density...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Characterization and {{quantification}} of the transient electromagnetic (EM) fields {{generated in}} a gas-insulated substation (GIS) during switching operations has become important in recent years. This {{is due to}} increased use of sensitive electronic devices in the control circuitry of such substations. In this paper, a numerical model based on the finite-difference time-domain technique has been developed to compute the EM field emission from the gas-insulated bus duct through nonmetallic flange of the support insulator during switching operations. The shielding effectiveness (SE) of the bus duct/section for the EM fields has been evaluated using a derivative Gaussian current source and a short time sinusoidal current source. The effect of variations in dimensions of the slot formed by the nonmetallic flange as well as electromagnetic properties of the insulator/bus <b>duct</b> <b>enclosure</b> on SE has been studied. The variation in field pattern along the axis of bus duct at various distances due to the transient currents of different frequencies has been analyzed. The enhancement factor for the EM field levels due {{to the presence of}} a metallic structure has been reported. Finally, emission levels are calculated for the very fast transient currents generated in a 245 kV GIS and their dominant frequencies have been identified...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Treadport Active Wind Tunnel (TPAWT) -a full-body immersive virtual {{environment for the}} Treadport locomotion interface designed for generating wind on a user from any frontal direction at speeds up to 20 kph. The goal is to simulate the experience of realistic wind while walking in an outdoor virtual environment. A recirculating-type wind tunnel was created around the pre-existing Treadport installation by adding a large fan, <b>ducting,</b> and <b>enclosure</b> walls. Two sheets of air in a non-intrusive design flow along the side screens of the back-projection CAVE-like visual display, where they impinge and mix at the front screen to redirect towards the user in a full-body cross-section. By varying the flow conditions of the air sheets, the direction and speed of wind at the user are controlled. Design challenges to fit the wind tunnel in the pre-existing facility, and to manage turbulence to achieve stable and steerable flow, were overcome. The controller performance for wind speed and direction is demonstrated experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{system to}} recover {{part of the}} energy of exhaust air from an axial fan of 75 kW using a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine is {{discussed}} in this paper. The actual air data at the fan outlet are collected from central air conditioning station of a composite textile mill (Kombolcha Textile Share Company) using log-Tchebycheff method. Since the air flow type determines the steps in progress the air flow type is arithmetically found to be fully turbulent. A duct is designed to correct the air turbulence and transport the exhaust air from the fan to the turbine. The <b>enclosure</b> <b>duct</b> design is developed in consideration of the actual situation of the company to attain a fully developed region where the air speed attains a uniform velocity profile and create a venturi effect (to increase the air speed) for better energy output and guide the air before it interacts with the wind turbine blades. By turning what was exhausted to useable form 5. 7 kW of electric power can be harvested. As there are vast application areas of industrial air system, utilizing the exhaust from such air systems as energy resource could be helpful and used as supplementary power for industry production floor lighting and little power supply requiring auxiliary processes...|$|R
