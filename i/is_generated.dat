5|$|Renewable {{energy in}} Russia mainly {{consists}} of hydroelectric energy. The {{country is the}} sixth largest producer of renewable energy in the world, although it is 56th when hydroelectric energy is not taken into account. Some 179TWh of Russia's energy production comes from renewable energy sources, {{out of a total}} economically feasible potential of 1823TWh. 16% of Russia's electricity <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> from hydropower, and less than 1% <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> from all other renewable energy sources combined. Roughly 68% of Russia's electricity <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> from thermal power and 16% from nuclear power.|$|E

Application of two dimensional array grammars in kolam generation {{has been discussed}} [1]. Motivated by this we have used Array Token Petri Nets to generate kolam patterns.

The Kolam patterns which <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> by Regular Grammars <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> by Array Token Petri Nets and Kolam patterns which <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> by Context-free and Contextsensitive grammars <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> by Array Token Petri Nets with inhibitor arcs...|$|R

5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP <b>is</b> <b>generated.</b> Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Control {{of water}} {{was the primary}} concern in the {{building}} of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{resistance}} welding (ERW) – a welding process that produces coalescence of laying surfaces where heat {{to form the}} weld <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> by the electrical resistance of the material. In general, an efficient method, but limited to relatively thin material.|$|E
50|$|A {{production}} {{order is}} an order issued within {{a company to}} produce a specific quantity of material within a certain timeframe. A production order may be issued pursuant to a sales order, and its issuance triggers a number of events. If components {{in the bill of}} materials are in stock, reservations <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> for those items; if they are not in stock, then requisition orders may <b>be</b> <b>generated.</b> Requisition orders may also <b>be</b> <b>generated</b> for production that occurs externally to the firm. Planned costs for the order <b>are</b> also <b>generated</b> and capacity requirements <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> for the work centers.|$|R

5|$|Hydrogen is {{sometimes}} produced and {{consumed in the}} same industrial process, without being separated. In the Haber process {{for the production of}} ammonia, hydrogen <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> from natural gas. Electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co-product.|$|E
5|$|Steering may be {{supplied}} by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself. This self-stability <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> {{by a combination}} of several effects that depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and forward speed of the bike. Tires, suspension, steering damping, and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.|$|E

An estimated 75% of the total volcanic eruptive volume <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> by submarine eruptions near mid ocean ridges alone, however because of {{the problems associated with}} detecting deep sea volcanics, they remained virtually unknown until advances in the 1990s made it possible to observe them.|$|E
5|$|Taste <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> from receptors on {{the tongue}} and passed along the facial and {{glossopharyngeal}} nerves into the solitary tract in the brainstem. Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the vagus nerve. Information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the gustatory cortex.|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> by {{receptor}} cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity. This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the olfactory nerve.

5|$|These sharp limits {{from the}} non-observation {{of the effects}} caused by the galactic vector {{potential}} {{have been shown to}} be model dependent.

5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> by nuclear fusion. The {{temperature}} and density of this core {{are at the}} levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional heat <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E

5|$|Although many false {{claims of}} its {{discovery}} were {{made over the}} years, the element was first synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in 1940. Since then, most neptunium has been and still is produced by neutron irradiation of uranium in nuclear reactors. The vast majority <b>is</b> <b>generated</b> as a by-product in conventional nuclear power reactors. While neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present, it {{is used as a}} precursor for the formation of plutonium-238, used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft. Neptunium has also been used in detectors of high-energy neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat <b>is</b> <b>generated.</b> The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
