25|$|Baseball players use thin, round {{bats and}} wear gloves to field (with the catcher wearing a special, more {{protective}} glove), while cricketers use wide, flat bats and field barehanded (except for the wicket-keeper, who wears gloves and protective leg pads).

In cricket a batsman wears protective gear such as pads, gloves, thigh pads, helmet, a chest guard, an arm pad and a box (A.K.A. a cup), whereas the only required protective gear for baseball batters is an unsecured helmet (as required in major league baseball rule 1.16); many batters also use elbow, shin, ankle, or hand protectors, and most wear a cup (A.K.A. a box) and use batting gloves (similar to <b>golf</b> <b>gloves)</b> to aid grip.|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{was developed}} {{that provides a}} dynamic representation of the hand-glove interaction inside a baseball glove during catching situations. Until recent history, baseball manufacturers relied primarily upon player input and practical necessity to develop their technology; the use of scientific exploration was minimal. To add scientific technology {{to the design of}} baseball gloves, the project consisted of a sensor glove component and a visual interface, developed to better understand the hand-glove interaction. The sensor glove was created by attaching FlexiForce A 201 sensors to a <b>golf</b> <b>glove</b> to fit inside a baseball glove. The sensors measure the forces in a variety of locations on the back and front of the hand. The project resulted in a simple user interface that presents a better representation of the hand-glove interaction and provides a means to better identify characteristics of glove use. y Brian A.

A 27 -year-old woman golfer presented with recurrent, pruritic, erythematous plaques that had been occurring on both hands for several years.

To identify the causative agent, patch tests were performed and the results demonstrated a strong positive reaction to potassium dichromate 0. 5 % and to her own glove. The amount of chromium in her golf glove was analyzed to be 308. 91 ppm and based on this, a diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis due to a chromium-tanned leather glove was made.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, grip {{force was}} {{measured}} during a standard golf tee shot using two dif-ferent measurement techniques.

The second method involved 31 individual thin-film force sensors strategically placed on two <b>golf</b> <b>gloves,</b> allowing the force output of specific regions of the hands to be measured. Twenty golfers of varying ability parti-cipated in each test. The discovery of a unique grip force ‘signature ’ for each golfer emerged from these data. That is, each golfer had a very repeatable total grip force trace, but these traces varied considerably between golfers. High-speed video was also recorded {{for many of the}} gol-fers tested so that key phases in the swing could be identified on the force traces...|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} wearable controllers, {{or simply}} wearables, for gesture based applications, {{in addition to}} simply being accurate devices must further be intuitive, body conforming, and unrestricting of motion. The premise behind wearables is that some physical interaction is required to interface with every day electronic devices be it, for example, a keyboard, mouse, remote control, knob, or button. In the sense that humans {{have a tendency to}} gesticulate when verbally communicating with other humans, wearables allow humans to communicate with, or rather control, electronic devices through intuitive, programmable, gesticulations. Being presented is the design, development, and quantification of two wearable gesture based controllers. The first controller, worn on the forearm, uses the thin film piezoelectric polymer Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) to detect hand motion based muscle contractions. The PVDF was spatially shaded to enhance its sensitivity to the forces being exerted on it. A time delay artificial neural network algorithm was used to process the PVDF signal and identify the hand motion that generated it. Two distinct sets of hand gestures were studied: fist, extension, and flexion and right and left. Using microcontrollers and Bluetooth, applications demonstrating the capabilities of the controller were developed for the right and left gesture set including an Android oscilloscope style application showing PVDF voltage and identified gesture and a Microsoft PowerPoint Add-In that allows for gestures to navigate the presentation. The second controller uses a bimetallic thin foil strain gauge bonded to the elastomer PDMS mounted on a <b>golf</b> <b>glove</b> above the MPC joint of the right index finger. The dynamic behavior of the sensor was studied and a relation between sensor measurements and MPC joint angle developed. A custom printed circuit board (PCB) featuring a microcontroller and RF communication was developed enabling the device, in response to joint angle, to control the throttle input to a quadcopter. The fabrication and use of PVDF, in conjunction with its electrostrictive terpolymer P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE), in a self-sensing bimorph beam is also discussed. While bending in the beam is induced by applying voltage across the terpolymer, measured voltage from the PVDF is shown to give real time tip deflection...|$|R
