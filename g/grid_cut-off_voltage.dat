The <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> is selected such that the voltage lies above desired target <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> for the memory cells. The voltage pulses connected to verification pulses (10) are adjusted such that the voltage pulses reduce the <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> of the memory cells approximately to the target <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for operating charge-trapping based-non volatile semiconductor memory cells. USE - Method for increasing non-volatile NAND flash memory holding time during operation of charge-trapping based non-volatile semiconductor memory cells. ADVANTAGE - The voltage pulses connected to the verification pulse are adjusted such that the voltage pulses reduce the <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> of the memory cells approximately to the target <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage,</b> thus reducing long-term charge loss and shifting the associated <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage,</b> and hence increasing non-volatile NAND flash memory holding time during operation of the memory cells...|$|R
50|$|In batteries, the <b>cut-off</b> (final) <b>voltage</b> is the {{prescribed}} lower-limit voltage at which battery discharge is considered complete. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> is usually chosen {{so that the}} maximum useful capacity of the battery is achieved. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> is different from one battery {{to the other and}} it is highly dependent on the type of battery and the kind of service in which the battery is used. When testing the capacity of a NiMH or NiCd battery a <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> of 1.0 V per cell is normally used, whereas 0.9 V is normally used as the <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> of an alkaline cell. Devices that have too high <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltages</b> may stop operating while the battery still has significant capacity remaining.|$|R
50|$|In electronics, the <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> is {{the voltage}} {{at which a}} battery is {{considered}} fully discharged, beyond which further discharge could cause harm. Some electronic devices, such as cell phones, will automatically shut down when the <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> has been reached.|$|R
50|$|A high <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> is more {{widespread}} than perhaps assumed. For example, a certain brand of mobile phone that is powered with a single-cell Lithium-ion battery cuts off at 3.3V. The Li‑ion can be discharged to 3V and lower; however, with a discharge to 3.3V (at room temperature), about 92-98% of the capacity is used.Importantly, {{particularly in the}} case of lithium ion batteries which are used {{in the vast majority of}} portable electronics today, a <b>voltage</b> <b>cut-off</b> below 3.2V can lead to chemical instability in the cell, with the result being a reduced battery lifetime. For this reason, electronics manufacturers tend to use higher <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltages,</b> removing the need for consumers to buy battery replacements before other failure mechanisms in a device take effect.|$|R

We could show that with ongoing cycling transition metal dissolution from the cathode increased over time. However, it was less pronounced at 4. 3 V compared to elevated charge <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltages</b> of 4. 6 V. After a maximum of 100 cycles, we detected an overall transition metal loss of 0. 2 wt‰ {{in relation to the}} whole cathode active material for cells cycled to 4. 3 V. At an increased charge <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> of 4. 6 V, 4. 5 wt‰ transition metal loss in relation to the whole cathode active material could be detected. The corresponding transition metal dissolution induced capacity loss at the cathode could thus be attributed to 1. 2 mAh g− 1. Compared to the overall capacity loss of 80 mAh g− 1 of the complete cell after 100 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles the value is quite low. Hence, the overall full cell capacity fade cannot be assigned exclusively to the transition metal dissolution induced cathode fading...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCommercial Li-ion {{batteries}} are typically cycled between 3. 0 and 4. 2  V. These voltages limits are chosen {{based on the}} characteristics of the cathode (e. g. lithium cobalt oxide) and anode (e. g. graphite). When alternative anode/cathode chemistries are studied the same <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltages</b> are often, mistakenly, used. Silicon (Si) based anodes are widely studied as a high capacity alternative to graphite for Lithium-ion batteries. When silicon-based anodes are paired with high capacity cathodes (e. g. Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminium Oxide; NCA) the cell typically suffers from rapid capacity fade. The purpose of this communication is to understand how the choice of upper <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltage</b> affects cell performance in Si/NCA cells. A careful study of three-electrode cell data will show that capacity fade in Si/NCA cells is due to an ever-evolving silicon voltage profile that pushes the upper voltage at the cathode to > 4. 4  V (vs. Li/Li+). This behaviour initially improves cycle efficiency, due to liberation of new lithium, but ultimately reduces cycling efficiency, resulting in rapid capacity fade...|$|R

The anomalous nanoarchitectured PI coating layer, which behaves as an ion-conductive protection barrier to mitigate the undesired side reactions predominantly occurring onto the charged LiCoO 2 surface, plays a viable role in improving the cell performance and alleviating the interfacial exothermic reaction between the delithiated LiCoO 2 and liquid electrolyte.

This approach allows the impact of electrolyte additives on the impedance of cells cycled to different <b>cut-off</b> <b>voltages</b> to be studied systematically. The addition of 2 % PES or “PES- 211 ” proved to be beneficial in suppressing impedance growth when cells are cycled up to and above 4. 4 V. Long-term cycling tests between 3. 0 V and 4. 4 V at 45 ◦C showed that “PES- 211 ” had the best capacity retention (∼ 85 %) and the least impedance growth after 500 cycles. The results suggest the use of “PES- 211 ” could lead to longer lived and higher power NMC/graphite Li-ion cells with better tolerance to high voltage (4. 4 V) which will improve energy density. © The Author(s) 2014.

Even without surface coating or cation doping, the porous Nb 2 O 5 electrode could deliver durable capacity within the operating voltage window of 1. 0 - 3. 0 V vs. Li/Li+, with a reversible capacity of 201 mA h g - 1 after 300 cycles at a current density of 0. 4 A g- 1.
