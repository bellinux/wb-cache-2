The limit analysis of structures and the reference stress method (RSM) have been proven to be successful in problems pertaining to two-criteria failure assessment, creep growth, rupture damage, and more recently, elastic-plastic fracture toughness.

The elastic properties of orange fruits subjected to axial and axial contact were measured such that elastic limit force, elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio and bioyield stress were obtained as 18 N, 0. 691 MPa, 0. 367, 0. 009 MPa for axial compression and <b>for</b> <b>radial</b> <b>loading</b> were 15. 69 N, 0. 645 MPa, 0. 123, 0. 010 MPa.

The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to introduce analytical closed form solutions for the prediction of effective axial and transverse Young's modulus and Poisson ratios of a matrix-filled nanotube (i. e., a representative element of nanotube reinforced nanocomposites) as well as its mechanical behavior (i. e., displacements, strains and stress distributions) when it is subjected to externally applied uniform axial and <b>radial</b> <b>loads.</b> In this work, both the nanotube and its filler material are considered to be generally cylindrical orthotropic.

Analytical formulae are developed based on the principles of linear elasticity and continuum mechanics and then exact solutions are obtained for displacements, strains and stress distributions within the domain of each individual constituent. To validate and verify the accuracy of the closed form solutions obtained from the analytical approach, a 3 -D model of a matrix-filled nanotube is generated and solved for displacements, strains and stresses, numerically, using a finite element method.

To assemble the gliding yaw bearings, their cages split in several segments that are assembled together during wind turbine installation or manufacturing.|$|R

40|$|In this diploma thesis two partial {{studies of}} the {{instrumentation}} of a hydropower unit are conducted. These are carried out {{within the scope of}} the JUSPOWER-project. The first part of the thesis deals with the instrumentation of the runner. The incorporation of sensors in a Kaplan runner blade is tested in a experimental set-up on a laboratory scale without dismantling the runner. A further development of the design is suggested that enables damaged sensors to be replaced. The sensors are calibrated with a system destined to be used on site. The results show that the sensors function properly in the test set-up. Further calibration will though be needed during the installation on the runner blade and under operational conditions. The suction cup of the calibration system may have to be modified depending on the shape of the runner blade. The second part is a comparison study concerned with the choice of sensors <b>for</b> <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> measurements at the guide bearings. To measure the load on the bearing segments, the dowel peg on the bearing segment would either be replaced by a load cell or modified so strain gages could be bonded onto the peg itself. The performance of the sensors is evaluated in a loading machine with respect to linearity, hysteresis and sensitivity. Furthermore, the stiffness of the load cell is experimentally determined in a load machine. The results show that the strain gages bonded on the modified dowel peg do not have a reliable output signal. However, the installation of the tested load cell would alter the stiffness of the dowel peg. The load cell had a stiffness that was almost 50 % lower than the dowel peg...|$|R

To undertake this task, a purpose-built test rig was employed for collecting AE signals from the journal bearings.

40|$|A proof-of-feasibility {{demonstration}} {{showed that}} high temperature superconductor (HTS) coils {{can be used}} in a high-load, active magnetic bearing in liquid nitrogen. A homopolar radial bearing with commercially wound HTS (Bi 2223) bias and control coils produced over 200 lb (890 N) <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> capacity (measured non-rotating) and supported a shaft to 14000 rpm. The goal was to show that HTS coils can operate stably with ferromagnetic cores in a feedback controlled system at a current density similar to that in Cu in liquid nitrogen. Design compromises permitted use of circular coils with rectangular cross section. Conductor improvements will eventually permit coil shape optimization, higher current density and higher bearing load capacity. The bias coil, wound with non-twisted, multifilament HTS conductor, required negligible power to carry its direct current. The control coils were wound with monofilament HTS sheathed in Ag. These dissipated negligible power for direct current (i. e. <b>for</b> steady <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> components). When an alternating current (AC) was added, the AC component dissipated power which increased rapidly with frequency and quadratically with AC amplitude. In fact at frequencies above about 2 hz, the effective resistance of the control coil conductor actually exceeds that of the silver which is in electrical parallel with the oxide superconductor. This is at least qualitatively understandable in the context of a Bean-type model of flux and current penetration into a Type II superconductor. Fortunately the dynamic currents required for bearing stability are of small amplitude. These results show that while twisted multifilament conductor is not needed for stable levitation, twisted multifilaments will be required to reduce control power for sizable dynamic loads, such as those due to unbalance...|$|R

A rolling element bearing's static load rating is defined to avoid this failure type. Increasing the number of elements can provide better distribution of the load, so bearings intended for a large load may have many balls, or use needles instead. This decreases the chances of brinelling, but increases friction and other factors. However, although roller and ball bearings work well <b>for</b> <b>radial</b> and thrust <b>loading,</b> they are often prone to brinelling when very high impact loading, lateral loading, or vibration are experienced. Babbitt bearings or bronze bushings are often used instead of roller bearings in applications where such loads exist, such as in automotive crankshafts or pulley sheaves, to decrease the possibility of brinelling by distributing the force over a very large surface area.|$|R

Under this action, the arch may suddenly deflect laterally and twist {{out of the}} plane of loading and fail in a flexural-torsional buckling mode. In most studies of the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of arches under uniform compression, the directions of the uniformly distributed loads are assumed to be unchanged and parallel to their initial directions during buckling. In practice, arches may be subjected to hydrostatic or to uniformly distributed directed <b>radial</b> <b>loads.</b> Hydrostatic loads always remain normal to the tangent of the deformed arch axis, while uniformly distributed directed <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> always remain directed toward a specific point during buckling. These uniform <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> may act at a load height, such as at the top surface of the cross-section.
