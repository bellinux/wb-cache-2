40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} (hC), carbon footprint (CF) and operating costs (CC) of home dried pasta cooking were assessed. In particular, hC for the electric hot-plate (46 ± 3 %), induction (33 ± 5 %), or LPG (30 ± 4 %) hob {{was found to}} be definitively smaller than the minimum {{energy efficiency}} performance requirements for EU domestic hobs. Pans of different size, but with the same high thermal diffusivity, had a negligible effect on hC at the probability level of 0. 05. By covering the pan with its lid and setting the power rate of each cooking appliance initially to the maximum level to make the cooking water boil faster, and then to the minimum one to keep almost constant the cooking water temperature and allow starch granule gelatinization, GHG emissions reduced by 81, 73, or 86 % with respect to those released with the LPG, electric, or <b>induction</b> <b>hob</b> adjusted at the maximum power setting, respectively. Such a cooking practice applied to the <b>induction</b> <b>hob</b> allowed CF and CC to be minimized to 0. 67 kg CO 2 e and € 0. 47 per kg of pasta cooked. The resulting energy saving amounted to 31 or 18 % of the energy consumed under the same procedure by the LPG or electric cooker, respectively. Such a cooking system in conjunction with the aforementioned practice might represent an eco-friendly solution to limit the environmental impact of dried pasta consumption.

40|$|Induction cooking hobs {{have greatly}} gained in {{popularity}} m Europe during the 1980 's. This fact has {{focused attention on}} the particular problems encountered in their design. To this day, the design approaches remain largely empirical This thesis presents an analysis technique specially adapted to the <b>induction</b> <b>hob</b> generator The series resonant converter is seen to be widely used in the induction cooking application. As a first step, a technique for determining steady-state operation of the converter is presented. This is done for all the operation modes and control schemes encountered. The technique in question {{is based on the}} well known state plane but has been adapted for use in induction. This technique is then extended {{to make use of the}} properties of the state plane in order to demonstrate the behaviour of the converter under various load and control conditions. At this point, the didactic qualities of the state plane representation are exploited to their full in order to demonstrate the intricate relationships between the operation of the series resonant converter and its load impedance. All of the work described in the previous paragraph is based on the assumption of knowing the load impedance of the converter. This reveals itself to be a major assumption, given the variety of loads that can be encountered by an <b>induction</b> <b>hob</b> and the difficulties involved in measuring or modelling such a load. In order to allow the verification of this technique with respect to real cases, a load measurement technique is presented. This technique overcomes the pitfalls of existing techniques by carrying out analyses on wave forms measured m-situ while the converter is working. This contrasts with the existing techniques which measure the isolated load at low signal levels...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{domestic}} induction hobs have rapidly {{come into}} wide use in Japan. When cooking a strong high frequency magnetic field is {{generated in the}} area of <b>induction</b> <b>hob.</b> However, there are few reports of the measurement of the magnetic field during actual cooking. The magnetic field resulting from various working conditions of several types of induction hobs are reported here. Measurements of the magnetic field due to differences in various types of converter, the size and materials of the cooking vessels, and installation positions, were also performed. Results indicate an obvious difference in the spatial distribution of the magnetic field in the cooking work area.

40|$|IKEA’s {{vision is}} to create a better {{everyday}} life for the many people by offering functional and welldesigned home furnishing products at low prices. In order to achieve and retain low prices it is critical to monitor the product cost development. To monitor and lower costs it is necessary to have knowledge of what drives costs in a specific product. The {{purpose of this study is}} to increase the awareness of the costs by identifying and analyzing cost drivers for two product ranges within the kitchen appliances, hoods and <b>induction</b> <b>hobs.</b> The study will also expose cost saving potential within the product ranges. In a broader perspective this may result in a cost reduction and increased value for IKEA and its customers. The authors of this study defined a product cost structure including costs for; material, manufacturing process, assembly, packaging, transport and other related costs for kitchen appliances. The result of the research showed that material cost accounts for a significant part of the total cost for both hoods and <b>induction</b> <b>hobs.</b> For hoods raw material is a much higher cost than for <b>induction</b> <b>hobs,</b> whereas <b>induction</b> <b>hobs</b> have much higher relative cost for semi-finished components. The research also showed that cost for assembly and transport account for a significant part of the total cost in some cases. Conclusions made from the analysis indicated several cost saving potentials. IKEA should in the future consider using different type of steel for some products in the hood range. It is also recommended to consider how the design of the hood affects the performance, and thereby required motor choice. For the <b>induction</b> <b>hobs</b> the choice of ceramic glass and the solution for the printed circuit board should be considered. Using methodologies to decrease required assembly time and number of components in the hoods can reduce assembly cost. For some products there is also a substantial cost saving potential in sourcing assembly operations to low cost countries...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} a method proposed for vessel detection and coil powering in an all-surface inductive heating system composed of outer squircle coils. Besides conventional circular coils, coils with different shapes such as outer squircle coils {{are used for}} and enable efficient all-surface inductive heating. Validity of the method, which relies on measuring inductance and resistance values of a loaded coil at different frequencies, is experimentally demonstrated for a coil with shape different from conventional circular coil. Simple setup was constructed with a small coil to model an all-surface inductive heating system. Inductance and resistance maps were generated by measuring coil’s inductance and resistance values at different frequencies loaded by a plate made of different materials and located at various positions. Results show that in an <b>induction</b> <b>hob</b> for various coil geometries {{it is possible to}} detect a vessel’s presence, to identify its material type and to specify its position on the hob surface by considering inductance and resistance of the coil measured on at least two different frequencies. The studied method is important in terms of enabling safe, efficient and user flexible heating in an all-surface inductive heating system by automatically detecting the vessel’s presence and powering on only the coils that are loaded by the vessel with predetermined current levels...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the European Ecodesign Directive {{has emerged}} as a new {{approach}} to integrate environmental concerns into the product design and related processes. Ecodesign aims to minimize environmental impacts throughout the product life cycle, without compromising performances and costs. In addition, the recent Ecodesign Directives require products which are increasingly eco-friendly and eco-efficient, preserving high-performances. It is very important for producers measuring performances, for electric cooking ranges, hobs, ovens, and grills for household use, and a low power consumption of appliances represents a powerful selling point, also in terms of ecodesign requirements. The Ecodesign Directive provides a clear framework about the sustainable design of products and it has been extended in 2009 to all energy-related products, or products with an impact on energy consumption during the use. The European Regulation establishes measures of ecodesign of ovens, hobs, and kitchen hoods, and domestic use and energy efficiency of a product has a significant environmental aspect in the use phase which is the most impactful in the life cycle. It is important that the product parameters and performances are not affected by ecodesign requirements from a user’s point of view, and the benefits of reducing energy consumption in the use phase should offset the possible environmental impact in the production stage. Accurate measurements of cooking appliance performance are essential to help the industry to produce more energy efficient appliances. The development of ecodriven products requires ecoinnovation and ecodesign tools to support the sustainability improvement. The ecodesign tools should be practical and focused on specific ecoobjectives in order to be largely diffused. The main scope of this paper is the development, implementation, and testing of an innovative tool, which could be an improvement for the sustainable design of <b>induction</b> <b>hobs.</b> In particular, a prototypical software tool is developed in order to simulate the energy performances of the <b>induction</b> <b>hobs.</b> The tool is focused on a multiphysics model which is able to simulate the energy performances and the efficiency of <b>induction</b> <b>hobs</b> starting from the design data. The multiphysics model is composed by an electromagnetic simulation and a thermal simulation. The electromagnetic simulation is able to calculate the eddy current induced in the pot, which leads to the Joule heating of material. The thermal simulation is able to measure the energy consumption during the operational phase. The Joule heating caused from the eddy currents is the output of electromagnetic simulation and the input of thermal ones. The aims of the paper are the development of integrated tools and methodologies of virtual prototyping {{in the context of the}} ecodesign. This tool could be a revolutionary instrument in the field of industrial engineering and it gives consideration to the environmental aspects of product design and focus on the ecodesign of energy-related products, in order to achieve a reduced environmental impact...|$|R

40|$|Material and methodsWe {{carried out}} a multicenter survey in 8 French centers. Each patient {{received}} a questionnaire to evaluate his perceptions on information and consent, risks associated with pacemaker implantation and ability to perform various routine activities. ResultsWe included 185 patients. The mean age was 75. 4 + 10. 5 years. A large number of patients considered many routine activities as unsafe, such as sleeping {{on the side of}} the pacemaker (12 %), swimming (15 %), driving automobiles (17 %) and passing through metal detectors (47 %). Patients had also misconceptions about using <b>induction</b> <b>hobs</b> (38 %) and arc welding equipment (32 %). As regards medical imaging, 38 % did not know if they could undergo MRI exams. As regards medical follow up, 11 % of patients thought they did not need heart medications and 17 % that they were exempt from monitoring by a cardiologist. In univariate analysis, the factors associated to misconceptions about pacemakers were an age above 75 years and a primary implantation. ConclusionThe results of our study highlight patients’ misperceptions on life with a pacemaker. This should lead cardiologists to better inform patients at the time of pacemaker implantation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Domestic <b>induction</b> <b>hobs</b> {{have been}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular, {{due to its}} specific features of safety, cleanliness, quick warming and high efficiency. Some of these features derive {{of the fact that}} the heating is directly generated in the vessel, unlike the traditional contact heating methods. Specially, the later feature is attracting the attention of researchers devoted to highly efficient power electronic systems. Domestic induction heating technology requires specific features such as high output power levels in a reduced enclosure, large load variation, and reduced cost with high efficiency. Domestic induction appliances require power converters that feature high efficiency and accurate power control in a wide range of operating conditions. In order to achieve this aim, an ac– ac boost resonant converter is proposed in this paper. The main features of this proposal are the improved efficiency, reduced component count, proper output power control and reduced Total harmonic distortion (THD). With the addition of a passive filter circuit, input current total harmonic distortion can be decreased. Converter design procedure is also analyzed. And an experimental setup has been carried out.

40|$|Topics: Power Electronic topologies; Microwave oven; {{energy saving}} Today’s Microwave ovens are often {{equipped}} with inverterized MW generators; compared with old style appliances, the magnetron {{is no more}} driven by a bulky ferro-resonant power supply, but by an electronic inverter, lighter, more efficient and, moreover, able to modulate the MW power, at least to a certain extent. The electronic power supply is generally designed around a resonant inverter which drives an HV transformer, followed by a voltage multiplying rectifier, needed to provide the 4 - 6 kV DC requested by the magnetron. Single ended parallel resonant inverter is often a good choice, at least for MW ovens fed by 115 V line. Being such topology also used for low cost <b>induction</b> heating <b>hobs,</b> it could appear similar design process may be applied; unfortunately, {{the presence of the}} HV transformer and of the voltage multiplier changes a lot the way the converter operates, and a revised design procedure needs to be developed.

Indeed, evolution in the dimension of technology is keeping growing up from the first micro wave to the recent <b>induction</b> cooking <b>hobs.</b> The precision cooking method is also part of these new technologies but have not been adopted by many households yet. In this paper, consumer perception has been investigated to identify the hindrances to acceptation of precision cooking technique in households. These brakes have been investigating through implementing a consumer survey in the United States. An online questionnaire has been answered by 280 north-American people for one month including hypothesis testing. 	Three groups of people have been identified during the research: “Don’t know precision cooking method”, “Know the precision cooking method” and “Use the precision cooking method”. As a general opinion people who have already experience a food product cooked using this specific method was positive. The group of people not familiar with the technique have a bigger interest than the one who know it already. However, both groups perceive the precision cooking method or so called “sous-vide” technique, as complexed and time consuming. These two dimensions being the major factors they look at while purchasing a new kitchen appliance before looking at the price. The resistance to change and the nutrition aspect are the major brakes tested in the survey not to use the precision cooking method at home.
