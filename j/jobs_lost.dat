Specifically, critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation detract from (and outweigh) the costs and energy saved in the production process; also that the jobs produced by the recycling industry can be a poor trade for the <b>jobs</b> <b>lost</b> in logging, mining, and other industries associated with production; and that materials such as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the {{social costs of}} job loss due to environmental regulation. Per <b>job</b> <b>lost,</b> potential social costs of job loss are high, plausibly over $ 100, 000 in present value costs (2012 dollars) per permanently <b>lost</b> <b>job.</b> However, these social costs will typically be {{far less than the}} earnings associated with <b>lost</b> <b>jobs,</b> because labor markets and workers adjust, increased leisure has some value, and employers benefit from wage reductions. A plausible range for social costs is 8 - 32 percent of the associated earnings of the <b>lost</b> <b>jobs.</b> Social costs will be higher for older workers, high-wage jobs, and in high unemployment conditions. Under plausible estimates of job loss for most environmental regulations, the social costs of job loss will typically be less than 10 percent of other measured social costs of regulations. Therefore, adding in job loss is unlikely to tip many regulatory benefit-cost analyses...|$|R

40|$|How many <b>jobs</b> were <b>lost</b> {{with the}} {{collapse}} of Ansett? The objective {{of this paper is to}} determine the adverse impact of the collapse of Ansett on employment using the latest Australian input-output table. The indirect contribution of the collapse of Ansett to the creation of unemployment in various industries is quantified by adopting the "shut-down of industry " approach. Ansett operated within the air and space transport industry which possesses strong backward and forward linkages. It is found that due to sectoral multiplier and flow-on effects each <b>job</b> <b>lost</b> in such an important sector leads to a loss of approximately 3 extra jobs in the economy as a whole. The empirical results are broadly consistent with previous estimates. Overall, the Ansett collapse brought about an indirect loss of 54880 jobs in 105 sectors of the Australian economy. Losses were particularly marked in the following industries which were the fastes...|$|R
