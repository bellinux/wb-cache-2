5|$|Some {{legends of}} the Kami and Cahuilla tribes {{probably}} refer to Lake Cahuilla.

5|$|Van der Weyden appears {{intelligent}} and handsome, but weather-worn. He inserted a self-portrait into one other work; the lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald, known through a tapestry copy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Historical</b> Museum of Bern.

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{the fleet}} sent by Darius {{consisted}} of 600 triremes. There {{is no indication}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> sources of how many transport ships accompanied them, if any. Herodotus claimed that 3,000 transport ships accompanied 1,207 triremes during Xerxes's invasion in 480 BC. Among modern historians, some have accepted this number of ships as reasonable; {{it has been suggested}} either that the number 600 represents the combined number of triremes and transport ships, or that there were horse transports in addition to 600 triremes.|$|E
5|$|By 1445 Richard {{had become}} a knight, {{probably}} at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 22April that year.

He performed military service in the north with his father, and might have taken part {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI.|$|E

5|$|From {{the sixth}} century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> record.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> {{writing of}} the time, the humble devotion of the Decembrist women was contrasted with the intrigues and hedonism of female aristocrats of the 18thcentury, like Catherine the Great, whose excesses were seen as the danger of too-sudden liberation for women. Although they did not {{explicitly}} espouse a feminist agenda, the Decembrist women were used as an example by later generations of Russian feminists, whose concern for gender equality was also tied to revolutionary political agendas.|$|E
5|$|Neville first appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> {{record as}} the butler of Count Waleran of Meulan in 1138. Neville {{may have been}} in Waleran's service prior to this, {{but this is the first}} secure appearance. For serving as butler, Neville {{received}} rents from the market dues at Pont-Audemer worth 100 shillings annually. He appears as a witness to a charter of Waleran's to the Abbey of Tiron, which is dated sometime before 1141. Neville witnessed ten other of Waleran's charters, ending in the 1150s.|$|E

He had commanded the group of Greek colonists who founded Amphipolis in 437–6 BC, had served as a general on several occasions before and during the Peloponnesian War, and was one of the signers of the Peace of Nicias. Hagnon's career overlapped with his son's when he served as one of the ten commissioners appointed by the government of the 400 to draft a new constitution in 411 BC.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Neville (or Ralf Nevill; died 1244) was {{a medieval}} clergyman and {{politician}} {{who served as}} Bishop of Chichester and Lord Chancellor of England. Neville first appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> record in 1207 {{in the service of}} King John of England, and remained in royal service throughout the rest of his life. By 1213 Neville had custody of the Great Seal of England, although he was not named chancellor, the office responsible for the seal, until 1226. He was rewarded with the bishopric of Chichester in 1222. Although he was also briefly Archbishop-elect of Canterbury and Bishop-elect of Winchester, both elections were set aside, or quashed, and he held neither office.|$|E
5|$|Regenbald first appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> {{record in}} 1050, when he {{witnesses}} a charter of King Edward. King Edward gave him large estates {{as a reward}} for his service to the king as a royal chaplain. The Domesday Book records him owning at least seven churches, but only two of them have any indication that he performed any ecclesiastical services personally. Another royal reward was the grant to Regenbald of the status, without the actual office, of a bishop. He probably was unable to be promoted to a bishopric, either because he was married or because his style of life was known to be unchaste.|$|E

He is also claimed to have held the office of Provost of Beverley Minster as the immediate predecessor to Thomas Becket, but this is unlikely, as Becket did not become provost until 1154, long after Robert had become Dean of York.|$|E
