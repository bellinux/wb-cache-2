40|$|Abstract. The {{main issue}} in the joint {{operation}} of a grain harvester and a transport vehicle is determining {{the moment when the}} vehicle has to start travelling to the harvester, so that it will arrive at it when the hopper is full. The result of the incorrect determining of that moment is that the productivity of the transport vehicle is not efficiently used and in the case when the hopper is unloaded at a harvester stantstill position, the harvester productivity is also reduced due to more frequent stops. The article proposes a method for determining the part of the grain harvester <b>hopper</b> <b>volume</b> after the filling of which the signalling shall be switched on indicating to the vehicle driver when to start moving toward the harvester. The results of real measurements are shown on different farms of the time of movement of the vehicle to the harvester for unloading. An analysis of the results has been {{made on the basis of}} the developed method as well and recommendations have been made to regulate the time of switching on the signalling. A nomogram has been proposed for determining the part of the grain <b>hopper</b> <b>volume</b> after the filling of which the signalling is to be switched on depending on the ratio between the time for moving of the vehicle and the time for filling the grain harvester hopper to the top...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” A {{particle}} filter {{is applied to}} the estimation of overflow losses in a hopper dredger. The filter estimates on-line the overflow mixture density and flow-rate, based on the measurements of the total <b>hopper</b> <b>volume,</b> mass, incoming mixture density and flow-rate. These data are readily available on board of every modern hopper dredger. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that the {{particle filter}} uses straight-forward nonlinear mass balance equations and does not rely on complex sedimentation models with uncertain parameters. The performance was evaluated in simulations as well as with real measurements and the results are encouraging. The filter can be used to improve parameter estimation in complex mechanistic models of the hopper sedimentation process and to facilitate decision making on board of the hopper dredger. I...|$|E
40|$|The Kalman {{filter and}} its {{nonlinear}} variants {{have been widely}} used for filtering and state estimation. However, models with severe nonlinearities are not handled well by Kalman fil-ters. Such an application is presented in this paper: the estimation of the overflow losses in a hopper-dredger. The overflow mixture density and flow-rate have to be estimated based on noisy measurements of the total <b>hopper</b> <b>volume,</b> mass, incoming mixture density and flow-rate. We propose a decomposition of the nonlinear process model into two simpler subsystems. Different types of observers are considered for each sub-process. The perfor-mance is evaluated for simulated and real-world data and compared for the centralized and distributed settings and four combinations of the particle filter and the unscented Kalman filter. The results indicate that the distributed observer achieves the same performance as the centralized one, while leading to increased modularity, reduced complexity, lower com-putational costs and easier tuning...|$|E
40|$|A 10 -inch READCO mixer is {{used for}} mixing the premix (45 (wt%) fly ash, 45 wt% slag, and 10 wt% portland cement) with salt {{solution}} in the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF). The Saltstone grout free falls into the grout hopper which feeds the suction line leading to the Watson SPX 100 duplex hose pump. The Watson SPX 100 pumps the grout through approximately 1500 feet of piping prior to being discharged into the Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF) vaults. The existing grout hopper has been identified by the Saltstone Enhanced Low Activity Waste Disposal (ELAWD) project for re-design. The current nominal working <b>volume</b> of this <b>hopper</b> is 12 gallons and does not permit handling an inadvertent addition of excess dry feeds. Saltstone Engineering has proposed a new hopper tank {{that will have a}} nominal working volume of 300 gallons and is agitated with a mechanical agitator. The larger <b>volume</b> <b>hopper</b> is designed to handle variability in the output of the READCO mixer and process upsets without entering set back during processing. The objectives of this task involve scaling the proposed hopper design and testing the scaled hopper for the following processing issues: (1) The effect of agitation on radar measurement. Formation of a vortex may affect the ability to accurately measure the tank level. The agitator was run at varying speeds and with varying grout viscosities to determine what parameters cause vortex formation and whether measurement accuracy is affected. (2) A dry feeds over addition. Engineering Calculating X-ESR-Z- 00017 1 showed that an additional 300 pounds of dry premix added to a 300 gallon working volume would lower the water to premix ratio (W/P) from the nominal 0. 60 to 0. 53 based on a Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) salt simulant. A grout with a W/P of 0. 53 represents the upper bound of grout rheology that could be processed at the facility. A scaled amount of dry feeds will be added into the hopper to verify that this is a recoverable situation. (3) The necessity of baffles in the hopper. The preference of the facility is not to have baffles in the hopper; however, if the initial testing indicates inadequate agitation or difficulties with the radar measurement, baffles will be tested...|$|R
