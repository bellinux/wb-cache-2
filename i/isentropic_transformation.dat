40|$|The {{classical}} {{isentropic exponent}} {{appearing in the}} isentropic change equations of the ideal gas is replaced {{in each of these}} equations by one of three different exponents so that these equations may describe very accurately small <b>isentropic</b> <b>transformations</b> of real gases. Analytical expressions are provided for the three exponents introduced and their numerical values are calculated in the case of real air {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Two methods, based on these three exponents, are proposed for calculating <b>isentropic</b> <b>transformations</b> of real gases. Both methods are very accurate and very economical with respect to computer time. In the first, the entropy equation of the real gas is solved iteratively with accelerated convergence due to a good initiation obtained by use of the new exponents. The other may be used in cases where the entropy equation is not available. The methods have been applied in the calculation of the one-dimensional isentropic flow of real air within the temperature and pressure ranges of practical interest...|$|R
40|$|The van der Waals {{polytropic}} gas {{model is}} used to investigate the role of attractive and repulsive intermolecular forces {{and the influence of}} molecular complexity on the possible nonclassical gas dynamic behavior of vapors near the liquid-vapor saturation curve. The decrease of the sound speed upon isothermal compression is due to the well-known action of the van der Waals attractive forces and this effect is shown here to be comparatively larger for more complex molecules with a large number of active vibrational modes; for these fluids isentropic flows are in fact almost isothermal. Contributions to the speed of sound resulting from intermolecular forces and the role of molecular complexity are analyzed in details for both isothermal and <b>isentropic</b> <b>transformations.</b> Results of the exact {{solution to the problem of}} a finite pressure perturbation traveling in a still fluid are presented in three exemplary cases: ideal gas, dense gas and nonclassical gas behavior. A classification scheme of fluids based on the possibility of exhibiting different gas dynamic behaviors is also proposed. Process and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} the {{fundamental}} derivative of gas dynamics, Gamma, is a quantitative measure of the variation {{of the speed of}} sound with respect to density in <b>isentropic</b> <b>transformations,</b> such as those occurring, for example, in gas-dynamic nozzles. The accurate computation of its value, which is a constant for a perfect gas, is key to the understanding of real-gas flows occurring in a thermodynamic region where the polytropic ideal gas law does not hold. The fundamental derivative of gas dynamics is a secondary thermodynamic property and so far, no experiments have been conducted with the aim of measuring its value. Several studies document the estimation of Gamma for fluids composed of complex molecules using mainly simple thermodynamic equations of state, e. g [...] that of Van der Waals. A review of these studies has revealed that the calculated values of Gamma are affected by large uncertainties; these uncertainties are due to the functional form of the adopted equations and because of uncertainties in the available fluid property data on which these equations were fitted. In this work, the fundamental derivative of gas dynamics of molecularly simple fluids is computed with the aid of, among other models, modern reference equations of state. The accuracy of these computations has been assessed. Reference thermodynamic models however, are not available for molecularly complex fluids; some of these molecularly complex fluids are the substances of interest in studies on the so-called nonclassical gas dynamics. Therefore, results of the computation of Gamma for few, molecularly simple hydrocarbons, like methane, ethane, etc., are used as a benchmark against which the performance of simpler equations of state, can be assessed. For the selected substances, the Peng-Robinson, Stryjek-Vera modified, cubic equation of state yields good results for Gamma-predictions, while the modern multiparameter technical equations of state, e. g., the one in the Span-Wagner functional form, are preferable, provided that enough accurate thermodynamic data are available. Another notable result of this study, is that Gamma for a fluid composed of complex molecules is less affected by the inaccuracy of C-v-information (C-v is the isochoric heat capacity), if compared to the estimation of Gamma for simple molecules. Inspection {{of the results of the}} calculation of Gamma in the proximity of the critical point confirms that analytical equations of state fail to predict the correct physical behavior, even if they include terms which allow for the correct estimation of thermodynamic properties.

40|$|In {{this study}} we utilize {{potential}} vorticity - <b>isentropic</b> (PVI) coordinate <b>transformations</b> {{as a means of}} combining ozone data from different sources to construct daily, synthetic three-dimensional ozone fields. This methodology has been used successfully to reconstruct ozone maps in particular regions from aircraft data over the period of the aircraft campaign. We expand this method to create high-resolution daily global maps of profile ozone data, particularly in the lower stratosphere, where high-resolution ozone data are sparse. Ozone climatologies in PVI-space are constructed from satellite-based SAGE II and UARS/HALOE data, both of which-use solar occultation techniques to make high vertical resolution ozone profile measurements, but with low spatial resolution. A climatology from ground-based balloonsonde data is also created. The climatologies are used to establish the relationship between ozone and dynamical variability, which is defined by the potential vorticity (in the form of equivalent latitude) and potential temperature fields. Once a PVI climatology has been created from data taken by one or more instruments, high-resolution daily profile ozone field estimates are constructed based solely on the PVI fields, which are available on a daily basis from NCEP analysis. These profile ozone maps could be used for a variety of applications, including use in conjunction with total ozone maps to create a daily tropospheric ozone product, as input to forecast models, or as a tool for validating independent ozone measurements when correlative data are not available. This technique is limited to regions where the ozone is a long-term tracer and the flow is adiabatic. We evaluate {{the internal consistency of the}} technique by transforming the ozone back to physical space and comparing to the original profiles. Biases in the long-term average of the differences are used to identify regions where the technique is consistently introducing errors. Initial results show the technique is useful in the lower stratosphere at most latitudes throughout the year,and in the winter hemisphere in the middle stratosphere. The results are problematic in the summer hemisphere middle stratosphere due to increased ozone photochemistry and weak PV gradients. Alternate techniques in these regions will be discussed. An additional limitation is the quality and resolution of the meteorological data...|$|R
