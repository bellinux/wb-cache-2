5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner {{is talking about}} the other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E
25|$|As she {{approaches}} the castle, the Beast is watching her movements through {{the reflection of}} his drink. As she comes into the castle the Beast hurriedly removes himself. The woman sits <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> rests by the fire. The beast watches her from his hall of mirrors and contemplates approaching her but is ashamed of his appearance. She later is seen having a bath interspersed with the police officers finding the dead officer's body and preparing to raid the castle. She is later seen trying to sleep while being seduced by 3 vampy women while the Beast {{sits in a chair}} (a reference to Dracula and the Brides). The Beast leaves the room and, seeing his reflection, begins to smash up the mirrors. The woman, hearing the noise, comes out and follows him into a presumable living room. The Beast observes her from above and levitates the chaise she is sitting on.|$|E
500|$|Booth {{opened the}} door, stepped forward, and shot Lincoln from behind with a derringer. The bullet entered Lincoln's skull behind his left ear, passed through his brain, {{and came to}} rest {{near the front of}} the skull after {{fracturing}} both orbital plates. Lincoln slumped over <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> then fell backward. Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like [...] "Freedom!" ...|$|E

500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Guy Love" [...] was {{the first}} of two music videos {{released}} by NBC on YouTube in advance of the episode's air date [...] the other being [...] "Everything Comes Down To Poo". The videos have since been removed from YouTube. In addition, the night before [...] "My Musical" [...] aired, actors Zach Braff and Donald Faison appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and after an interview with the host, Braff grabbed a hand held microphone that was hidden <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> the two began singing [...] "Guy Love". The song also appeared in [...] "My Road to Nowhere", as Turk's cell phone ring tone for Carla, and as an arranged incidental version in [...] "My Words of Wisdom", and was played as background music while Turk and J.D. hugged in [...] "My Comedy Show". The song was also used in the season 9 premiere [...] "Our First Day of School." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{was drawn}} to this story because {{he spent much of}} his {{childhood}} in San Anselmo in Marin County during the initial Zodiac murders. [...] "I remember coming home and saying the highway patrol had been following our school buses for a couple weeks now. [...] And my dad, who worked from home, and who was very dry, not one to soft-pedal things, turned slowly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> said: 'Oh yeah. There's a serial killer who has killed four or five people, who calls himself Zodiac, who's threatened to take a high-powered rifle and shoot out the tires of a school bus, and then shoot the children as they come off the bus. For Fincher as a young boy, the killer [...] "was the ultimate boogeyman". The director was also drawn to the unresolved ending of Vanderbilt's screenplay because it felt true to real life, as cases are not always solved. Toschi later stated that he had watched Zodiac several times and added [...] "I thought Ruffalo did a good job," [...] but also reported that the film reminded him of old frustrations that the case was never closed.|$|E
60|$|The master {{sat back}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> white <b>and</b> dumb. Incredible, extraordinary, and utterly unlooked for as was this revelation, he felt instinctively {{that it was}} true.|$|R
60|$|He went to {{the desk}} near the window, pulled <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> twice <b>and</b> read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.|$|R
60|$|The King said nothing, {{but merely}} {{went back up}} {{the steps of the}} daïs, like a man dazed. He fell back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> again <b>and</b> kicked <b>his</b> heels.|$|R
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 2, 1921, Masterson {{attended}} {{his last}} heavyweight championship fight, the so-called [...] "Million Dollar Gate", promoted by Tex Rickard, in which Jack Dempsey defended (and retained) his title of heavyweight {{champion of the}} World. Three months later on October 7, silent-screen cowboy star William S. Hart (1864-1946) visited Masterson. They were photographed standing together {{on the roof of the}} New York Morning Telegraph building and went back to Masterson's office where he asked Hart to sit <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> pose for a second photo with him. According to Hart: [...] "I did so, and he stood beside me. Mr. Masterson was sitting in that same chair eighteen days later when he heard the last call." [...] Hart subsequently cast a Masterson lookalike as Masterson in his biographical film Wild Bill Hickok, which was released in 1923.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a chance}} meeting in an Upper East Side New York {{restaurant}} in 1982, Gloria Leonard first met Mailer. He {{struck up a}} conversation with Leonard after recognizing her. The meeting was rumored to have led to a brief affair between the two. Later, Leonard was approached by a group of movie distributors from the Midwest to finance what was described as [...] "the world's first million-dollar pornographic movie". She invited Mailer to lunch and made her pitch for his services as a writer. In an interview Leonard said that the author [...] "sat straight up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I always knew I'd one day make a porny.'" [...] Leonard then asked what his fee would be and Mailer responded with [...] "Two-hundred fifty thousand". Leonard then asked if he'd be interested in adapting his novel-biography of Marilyn Monroe, but Mailer replied that he wanted to do something original. The project later ended due to scheduling conflicts between the two.|$|E

6000|$|... "Does he--does he--think--WHAT does he think! Tell him--tell him--" [...] Then he sunk down <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> limp <b>and</b> weak, and says, so as {{you could}} hardly hear him: [...] "Go away--go away!" ...|$|R
