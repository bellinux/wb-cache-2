2500|$|Teriparatide ( [...] a {{recombinant}} {{parathyroid hormone}} [...] ) {{has been shown}} to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy, while effective for osteoporosis, is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptoms. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. Raloxifene, while effective in decreasing vertebral fractures, does not affect the risk of nonvertebral fracture. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. <b>Denosumab</b> is also effective for preventing osteoporotic fractures but not in males. In hypogonadal men, testosterone {{has been shown to}} improve bone quantity and quality, but, as of 2008, no studies evaluated its effect on fracture risk or in men with a normal testosterone levels. Calcitonin while once recommended is no longer due to the associated risk of cancer and questionable effect on fracture risk.|$|E
50|$|It is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with hypocalcemia, and sufficient calcium and vitamin D levels must be reached before starting on <b>denosumab</b> therapy. Data regarding interactions with other drugs are missing. It is unlikely that <b>denosumab</b> exhibits any clinically relevant interactions.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{whom are}} {{diagnosed}} with multiple myeloma have approximately 80-100% chance of developing bone complications {{due to an}} increase in activity and/or formation of osteoclasts and a decrease activity of osteoblasts. In a stage II clinical trial, <b>denosumab</b> had decrease bone turnover markers by blocking the RANKL/RANK pathway. Once this trial was completed, 1176 patients with either multiple myeloma or progressed cancers were entered into the stage III clinical trial (known as NCT00330759). The main objective of the NCT00330759 trial was to compare effects of patients who were given 120 mg of <b>denosumab</b> relative to patients give 4 mg of zoledronic acid. As a result of this trial, during a month period, patients who received <b>denosumab</b> had a decrease in pathological fractures and spinal cord compression; however, as time progressed it appear that <b>denosumab</b> had significantly delayed bone complications. In both breast and prostate cancers, patients in either <b>denosumab</b> or zoledronic acid groups both appeared to have comparable adverse events and survival rates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Denosumab</b> is an FDA-approved fully human {{monoclonal}} antibody to RANKL and during pre-clinical trials {{was first used}} to treat postmenopausal patients suffering with osteoporosis (PMO). In denosumab's third stage of the FDA's clinical trial, it was shown to: (1) decrease bone turnover, (2) reduce fractures in the PMO population, and (3) increase bone mineral density. Since then the anti-RANKL antibody, <b>denosumab,</b> {{has been used in}} some cancer clinical trials. In both prostate and breast cancer, <b>denosumab</b> has been shown to reduce cancer treatment-induced bone loss.|$|E
50|$|<b>Denosumab</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with low blood calcium levels.|$|E

50|$|On 17 December 2009, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) {{issued a}} Positive Opinion for <b>denosumab</b> for the {{treatment}} of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women and {{for the treatment}} of bone loss in men with hormone ablation therapy for prostate cancer. <b>Denosumab</b> was approved for marketing by the European Commission on 28 May 2010.|$|E
50|$|On 2 June 2010, <b>denosumab</b> was {{approved}} for post-menopausal osteoporosis by the US FDA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Denosumab</b> {{works by}} {{lowering}} the hormonal message that leads to excessive osteoclast-driven bone removal and is active in the body for only six months. Similarly to bisphosphonates, <b>denosumab</b> appears to be implicated in increasing the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) following extraction of teeth or oral surgical procedures but, unlike bisphosphonate, the risk declines to zero approximately 6 months after injection.|$|E
50|$|In June 2010, <b>denosumab</b> was {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in postmenopausal women with risk of osteoporosis under the trade name Prolia, and in November 2010, as Xgeva, for the prevention of skeleton-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. <b>Denosumab</b> is the first RANKL inhibitor to be approved by the FDA.|$|E
5000|$|... 252 {{patients}} {{enlisted in}} the HALT-BC clinical trial (also known as NCT00089661). In addition to receiving vitamin D and calcium supplements, half of the patients were randomly given 60 mg of <b>denosumab</b> while the other half were given a placebo. Patients given <b>denosumab</b> had an increase in lumbar spine bone mineral density, a decrease in bone turnover markers, with no significant change in survival rates.|$|E
50|$|Another {{clinical}} trial (NCT00321620) {{was established to}} determine the safety and effectiveness of using <b>denosumab</b> compared to zoledronic acid. In this trial, they used 1901 bone metastatic prostate patients whom were also suffering with other complication of bone diseases. Again, patients were randomized and some were given either 120 mg of <b>denosumab</b> or 4 mg of zoledronic acid. Patients who were given 120 mg of <b>denosumab</b> (in comparison {{to those who were}} given 4 mg of zoledronic acid) showed a greater increase in hypocalcemia, a greater resistance to bone turnover markers uNTx, a delay response in both pathological fractures and spinal cord compression. However, survival rates for both clinical groups were comparable.|$|E
50|$|In October 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) delayed {{approval}} of <b>denosumab,</b> stating {{that they needed}} more information.|$|E
50|$|The HALT-prostate cancer trial (also {{known as}} NCT00089674) {{included}} 1468 non-metastatic prostate cancer {{patients who were}} currently receiving androgen deprivation therapy. Randomly selected patients were given either 60 mg of <b>denosumab</b> or calcium and vitamin D supplements. This was done to measure the effectiveness of preventing treatment-induced bone loss. The patients who received 60 mg of <b>denosumab</b> showed a +5.6% increased in bone mineral density and a 1.5% decrease in bone fracture rates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Denosumab</b> is {{used for}} those with {{osteoporosis}} {{at high risk for}} fractures, bone loss due to certain medications, and in those with bone metastases.|$|E
50|$|A 2012 {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} <b>denosumab</b> {{was better than}} placebo, zoledronic acid and pamidronate in {{reducing the risk of}} fractures in those with cancer.|$|E

50|$|<b>Denosumab</b> (trade names Prolia and Xgeva) {{is a human}} {{monoclonal}} antibody {{for the treatment of}} osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, metastases to bone, and giant cell tumor of bone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Denosumab</b> is a RANKL inhibitor, {{which works}} by {{preventing}} {{the development of}} osteoclasts which are cells that break down bone. It {{was developed by the}} biotechnology company Amgen.|$|E
5000|$|Most therapies {{that target}} the RANK/RANKL/OPG axis aim to either {{down-regulate}} expression of RANKL or upregulate {{the expression of}} the decoy receptor OPG. For example, <b>denosumab</b> is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is directed against RANKL. In phase I and II trials, <b>denosumab</b> led to a decrease in bone resorption in multiple myeloma, prostate cancer and breast cancer patients. [...] Another study looked into developing small mimetics based on the structure of OPG that bind to RANK as well as RANKL and cause defective coupling between the two.|$|E
50|$|On 13 August 2009, {{a meeting}} was held between Amgen and the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs (ACRHD) of the (FDA) {{to review the}} {{potential}} uses of <b>denosumab.</b>|$|E
5000|$|XGEVA (<b>denosumab)</b> (for the {{prevention}} of skeletal-related events (SREs) (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors) ...|$|E
50|$|NCT00321464 {{was another}} phase III RCT. Similar to NCT00321620 (prostate), this trial {{measured}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of <b>denosumab</b> versus zoledronic acid. Both groups showed similar survival rates and adverse event frequency.|$|E
50|$|Combined {{teriparatide}} and <b>denosumab</b> increased BMD {{more than}} either agent alone {{and more than}} has been reported with approved therapies. Combination treatment might, therefore, be useful to treat patients {{at high risk of}} fracture.|$|E
50|$|On 13 June 2013, the US FDA {{approved}} <b>denosumab</b> {{for treatment}} of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone that is unresectable or where resection would result in significant morbidity.|$|E
50|$|Osteoprotegerin {{production}} is stimulated in vivo by the female sex hormone estrogen, {{as well as}} the osteoporosis drug, strontium ranelate. <b>Denosumab</b> is a pharmacologic agent that in essence acts like osteoprotegerin as a decoy receptor for osteoblastic RANKL.|$|E
50|$|A {{new drug}} called <b>denosumab</b> acts to raise bone mineral density and reduce {{fracture}} rates in many patient sub-groups by inhibiting RANKL. RANKL acts through its receptor RANK, {{which in turn}} promotes NF-κB,RANKL normally works by enabling the differentiation of osteoclasts from monocytes.|$|E

50|$|Hormone {{receptor}} positive {{breast cancer}} patients have a significant increased risk of complications such as osteopenia and osteoporosis. About two {{out of every three}} {{breast cancer patients}} are hormone receptor positive. In the past several years, <b>denosumab</b> has been used in clinical trials, primarily because a large population is affected by bone complication among those who have breast cancer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} side effects are joint and muscle {{pain in the}} arms or legs. There is an {{increased}} risk of infections such as cellulitis, hypocalcemia (low blood calcium), hypersensitivity allergy reactions, and osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures. [...] Another trial showed significantly increased rates of eczema and hospitalization due to infections of the skin. It has been proposed that the increase in infections under <b>denosumab</b> treatment might be connected to the role of RANKL in the immune system. RANKL is expressed by T helper cells, and is thought to be involved in dendritic cell maturation.|$|E
50|$|Biophosphonates are {{drugs that}} are used to prevent bone mass loss and are often used to treat osteolytic lesions. Zoledronic acid (Reclast) is a {{specific}} drug given to cancer patients to prevent the worsening of bone lesions and has been reported to have anti-tumor effects as well. Zoledronic acid has been clinically tested in conjunction with calcium and vitamin D to encourage bone health. <b>Denosumab,</b> a monoclonal antibody treatment RANKl inhibitor that targets the osteocyte apoptosis regualtory RANKl gene, is also prescribed to prevent bone metastases and bone lesions. Most biophosphonates are co-prescribed with disease-specific treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation for cancer patients.|$|E
50|$|Precursors to osteoclasts, called pre-osteoclasts, express surface receptors called RANK (receptor {{activator}} {{of nuclear}} factor-kappa B). RANK {{is a member}} of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. RANK is activated by RANKL (the RANK-Ligand), which exists as cell surface molecules on osteoblasts. Activation of RANK by RANKL promotes the maturation of pre-osteoclasts into osteoclasts. <b>Denosumab</b> inhibits this maturation of osteoclasts by binding to and inhibiting RANKL. This mimics the natural action of osteoprotegerin, an endogenous RANKL inhibitor, that presents with decreasing concentrations (and perhaps decreased avidity) in patients who are suffering from osteoporosis. This protects bone from degradation, and helps to counter the progression of the disease.|$|E
5000|$|Patients with tumors {{that are}} not {{amenable}} to surgery are treated with radiation therapy. However caution is employed since a majority of recurrent tumors with transformations to the malignant sarcoma phenotype have been in patients receiving radiotherapy for their primary benign lesion. [...] Pharmacotherapy for GCTOB, includes bisphosphonates such as Zoledronate, which are thought to induce apoptosis in the MNGC fraction, preventing tumor-induced osteolysis. Indeed, in vitro studies have shown zolidronate {{to be effective in}} killing osteoclast-like cells. [...] More recently, humanized monoclonal antibodies such as <b>Denosumab</b> targeting the RANK ligand have been employed in treatment of GCTOB in a phase II study. This is based on the notion that increased expression of RANK-ligands by stromal cells plays a role in tumor pathogenesis.|$|E
