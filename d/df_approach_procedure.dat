40|$|Individual's and couple's {{entering}} retirement face {{an uncertain}} future. They {{have to decide}} how to manage their savings so that they live the fullest life possible from a financial standpoint, while minimizing the risk of outliving their money. To get the best financial growth, retirees should invest their savings in a portfolio consisting of equity and fixed income securities. We use dynamic programming to maximize annual portfolio withdrawals dependent on mortality tables and stochastic models for stock and bond returns. We call our approach the Dynamic Forecasting (<b>DF)</b> <b>approach</b> because it assumes that the retiree's portfolio will repeat its past performances in the future. Two variations on the <b>DF</b> <b>approach</b> are the relaxed <b>DF</b> <b>approach</b> and the alternate <b>DF</b> <b>approach.</b> These provide two opposite withdrawal structures while guaranteeing a 0 % probability of failure. Our strategy is compared with the Constant Dollar (CD) approach and the Endowment approach, also known as the Constant Percentage approach (CP), using the Withdrawal Efficiency Rate (WER) metric. The strategies are compared under increasing, decreasing, and constant equity glide paths. The DF and alternate <b>DF</b> <b>approaches</b> outperform the other strategies under the WER metric and are the only strategies evaluated that a probability of failure of zero and are guaranteed to not leave money unspent {{at the end of the}} retirement period...|$|R

40|$|Extensive and {{computationally}} complex {{signal processing}} and control applications are commonly constructed from small computational blocks where the load decomposition and balance {{may not be}} easily achieved. This requires the development of mapping and scheduling strategies based on application to processor matching. In this context, several application algorithms are utilised and investigated in this work within the Development Framework (<b>DF)</b> <b>approach.</b> The <b>DF</b> <b>approach</b> supports the specification, design and implementation of real-time control systems. It also contains several mapping and scheduling tools to improve the performance of systems as well as tools for code generation. To improve the performance of an application, a new approach, namely the the priority-Based Genetic Algorithm, (PBGA) is developed and reported in this paper. The approach is applied to several applications using parallel and distributed heterogeneous architectures and its performance verified in comparison to several previously developed strategies...|$|R
40|$|Calculations of the {{discrete}} Cl 1 s and 2 p excitation {{spectra of}} HCl are performed employing accurate ab-initio.. Configuration Interaction CI and Density Functional <b>DF</b> <b>approaches.</b> The core excited spectra above edge are described {{with a new}} DF method based on a one-centre approximation. The highly correlated quasi-degenerate perturbation scheme gives results in excellent accord with experimental data and allows a definite assignment of the Rydberg excited states below edge. The simpler 1 h– 1 p CI scheme shows some deficiencies essentially attributed {{to the use of}} inadequate orbitals, although it appears adequate for a qualitative description of the spectra. The <b>DF</b> <b>approach</b> provides dependable results for the lower-energy states of the discrete spectra while some limitations affect the present description of the higher Rydberg states. Good agreement with experimental data is obtained for the calculated cross-section profiles relative to the Cl 1 s and 2 p photoionization. Also the theoretical asymmetry parameter profiles are analysed. q 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The high {{competition}} on global marketplace caused by unforeseeable and changeable customer’s demand is affecting {{all kinds of}} industries. In this turbulent scenario, an engineering-oriented Digital Factory (<b>DF)</b> <b>approach,</b> with the integration of multi-objective mathematical procedures, represents a strategic opportunity to satisfy quality, time and cost goals. Alternative process configurations are reengineered and evaluated in a concurrent manufacturing extent of the digital world with few efforts and in short time.

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of flight guidance, the development of laterally segmented <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> allow for rerouting around congested areas and is thus a promising approach in coping with these issues. To enable independent operations of segmented approaches at parallel runway systems, an elementary safety concept was developed in previous work. Having developed such a safety concept, the question arises regarding how <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> in the Terminal Maneuvering Area need to be designed to allow for optimal sequencing and maximized throughput taking into account equipage and legislative considerations. In this paper, an <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> design is presented that integrates the aforementioned constraints.

40|$|The {{demand for}} fuel {{efficient}} flight paths which include shorter routes and routes {{adapted to the}} prevailing terrain {{as well as the}} aim to reduce the perceived noise {{on the ground in the}} terminal area of airports lead to the development of curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures.</b> To be able to conduct curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures,</b> an aircraft is on the one hand required to be able to determine its position very precisely. On the other hand, it is required to be able to follow the required flight path very accurately. The first is usually archived with satellite navigation or a combination of different navigation systems and the latter can be achieved by an autopilot which has to be rather sophisticated when intending to follow a curved approach path. This indicates that an aircraft has to be highly equipped with navigation and guidance avionics systems. To fully exploit the advantages of curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures,</b> it is desired that the majority of aircraft are able to conduct curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> even with a less sophisticated degree of equipage. A key enabler for curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> is a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS). It broadcasts pseudorange corrections for all satellites in view to enable airspace users to augment their own position. In addition, it broadcasts desired flight paths. Next to standard “straight-in” Final Approach Segments (FAS), GBAS messages are defined in the RTCA standard DO- 246 D that provide the possibility to broadcast curved precision approach paths. This Terminal Area Path (TAP) functionality in combination with the augmentation of the user’s position can be used as a sole means to conduct a curved approach. The advantage of this setup is that a high accuracy and a high integrity in the lateral as well as in the vertical position domain can be achieved and the aircraft does not have to be equipped with a current database for the published <b>approach</b> <b>procedures.</b> Different ways to present flight path data were investigated and flight tested in this work. ...|$|R
