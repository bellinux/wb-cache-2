40|$|Background: Increasing {{emphasis}} on integrated control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) requires identification of coendemic <b>areas.</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>surveys</b> for lymphatic filariasis (LF), schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection have been recommended for this purpose. <b>Integrated</b> <b>survey</b> designs inevitably involve balancing {{the costs of}} surveys against accuracy of classifying areas for treatment, so-called implementation units (IUs). This requires {{an understanding of the}} main cost drivers and of how operating procedures may affect both cost and accuracy of surveys. Here we report a detailed cost analysis of the first round of <b>integrated</b> NTD <b>surveys</b> in Southern Sudan. Methods and Findings: Financial and economic costs were estimated from financial expenditure records and interviews with survey staff using an ingredients approach. The main outcome was cost per IU surveyed. Uncertain variables were subjected to univariate sensitivity analysis and the effects of modifying standard operating procedures were explored. The average economic cost per IU surveyed was USD 40, 206 or USD 9, 573, {{depending on the size of}} the IU. The major cost drivers were two key categories of recurrent costs: i) survey consumables, and ii) personnel. Conclusion: The cost of <b>integrated</b> <b>surveys</b> in Southern Sudan could be reduced by <b>surveying</b> larger administrative <b>areas</b> for LF. If this approach was taken, the estimated economic cost of completing LF, schistosomiasis and STH mapping in Southern Sudan would amount to USD 1. 6 million.

40|$|Much of the {{evidence}} used to-date to back up statements about the market share of faith-inspired providers {{of health care in}} sub-Saharan Africa comes from data on health care facilities, and especially on the share of hospital beds held by Christian Health Associations in the countries where these associations operate. In those countries, estimates of the market share of faith-inspired health care providers based on hospital beds or similar measures are the 30 percent to 50 percent range. On the other hand, {{the evidence}} available from multi-purpose <b>integrated</b> household <b>surveys</b> that ask households where they go for health care and that identify specifically faith-inspired providers in survey questionnaires tells a different story, with lower market shares for faith-inspired facilities. One could ask whether the evidence from these multi-purpose <b>integrated</b> household <b>surveys</b> is itself robust. The objective in this chapter is to assess whether this is the case. Specifically, the idea is to compare market share estimates obtained from different types household surveys, by considering not only multi-purpose <b>integrated</b> <b>surveys,</b> but also Demographic and Health Surveys for which country coverage is larger. The findings suggest that market share estimates for faith-inspired healthcare providers are of a similar order of magnitude in both Demographic and Health <b>Surveys</b> and multi-purpose <b>integrated</b> <b>surveys.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistics}} of shear peaks {{have been shown}} to provide valuable cosmological information beyond the power spectrum, and will be an important constraint of models of cosmology with the large <b>survey</b> <b>areas</b> provided by forthcoming astronomical surveys. <b>Surveys</b> include masked <b>areas</b> due to bright stars, bad pixels etc, which must be accounted for in producing constraints on cosmology from shear maps. We advocate a forward-modeling approach, where the impact of masking (and other survey artifacts) are accounted for in the theoretical prediction of cosmological parameters, rather than removed from survey data. We use masks based on the Deep Lens Survey, and explore the impact of up to 37 % of the <b>survey</b> <b>area</b> being masked on LSST and DES-scale surveys. By reconstructing maps of aperture mass, the masking effect is smoothed out, resulting in up to 14 % smaller statistical uncertainties compared to simply reducing the <b>survey</b> <b>area</b> by the masked area. We show that, even in the presence of large survey masks, the bias in cosmological parameter estimation produced in the forward-modeling process is ~ 1 %, dominated by bias caused by limited simulation volume. We also explore how this potential bias scales with <b>survey</b> <b>area</b> and find that small <b>survey</b> <b>areas</b> are more significantly impacted by the differences in cosmological structure in the data and simulated volumes, due to cosmic variance.

40|$|An {{integrated}} sedimentologic and GPR {{investigation has}} been carried out on a fluvial channel sandstone in the mid-Cretaceous Ferron Sandstone at Coyote Basin along the southwestern flank of the San Rafael Uplift in east-central Utah. This near-surface study, which covers a area of 40 {times} 16. 5 meters to a depth of 15 meters, integrates detailed stratigraphic data from outcrop sections and facies maps with multi-frequency 3 -D GPR surveys. The objectives of this investigation are two-fold: (1) to develop new ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technology for imaging shallow subsurface sandstone bodies, and (2) to construct an empirical three-dimensional sandstone reservoir model suitable for hydrocarbon flow-simulation by imaging near-surface sandstone reservoir analogs with the use of GPR. The sedimentological data base consists of a geologic map of the <b>survey</b> <b>area</b> and a detailed facies map of the cliff face immediately adjacent to the <b>survey</b> <b>area.</b> Five vertical sections were measured along the cliff face adjacent to the <b>survey</b> <b>area.</b> In addition, four wells were cored within the <b>survey</b> <b>area</b> from which logs were recorded. In the sections and well logs primary sedimentary structures were documented along with textural information and permeability data.

40|$|Control of {{neglected}} tropical diseases (NTDs) {{is suggested}} {{to be more}} cost-effective when drugs are co-administered through a single integrated delivery system rather than separate systems. An essential prerequisite for such efficiency gains is sufficient geographical overlap of the targeted diseases – lymphatic filariasis (LF), onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminth infection and trachoma. Lack of data on geographical NTD distribution currently hampers the implementation of integrated control in many African countries. To generate the required data quickly and efficiently, <b>integrated</b> <b>surveys</b> of several NTDs simultaneously have been recommended. However, experience with <b>integrated</b> <b>surveys</b> is limited and requires additional research on cost and effectiveness to inform improvements in methodology and to guide scale-up. Here we analyse costs of the first <b>integrated</b> NTD <b>survey</b> round in Southern Sudan, generating average costs per implementation unit surveyed.
