40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the assessment of}} the effect of engine installation parameters such as engine position, size and power setting on the performance of a typical 300 seater aircraft at cruise condition. Two engines with very-high by-pass ratio and with different fan diameters and specific thrusts are initially simulated in isolation to determine the thrust and drag forces for an isolated configuration. The two engines are then assessed in an engine-airframe configuration to determine the sensitivity of the overall <b>installation</b> <b>penalty</b> to the vertical and axial engine location. The breakdown of the interference force is investigated to determine the aerodynamic origins of beneficial or penalising forces. To complete the cruise study a range of engine power settings were considered to determine the <b>installation</b> <b>penalty</b> at different phases of cruise. This work concludes with the preliminary assessment of cruise fuel burn for two engines. For the baseline engine, across the range of installed positions the resultant thrust requirement varied by 1. 7 % of standard net thrust. The larger engine was less sensitive with a variation of 1. 3 %. For an assessment over a 10000 km cruise flight the overall effect of the lower specific thrust engine showed that the cycle benefits of – 5. 8 % in specific fuel consumption was supplemented by a relatively beneficial aerodynamic installation effect but offset by the additional weight to give a - 4. 8 % fuel burn reduction...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} {{performed at the}} Large Low-speed Facility of the German-Dutch wind tunnels (DNW-LLF) to study the pylon interactions associated with pusher propellers. The aerodynamic and aeroacoustic effects of pylon trailing edge blowing and swirl recovery vanes (SRVs) were evaluated. The pylon installation increased the summed tonal noise levels by up to 13 dB in unblown conditions, while the propulsive performance was affected in asymmetric inflow conditions only. At a sideslip angle of + 6 °, pre-swirl of the flow due to the pylon tip vortex led to a thrust increase of 10 % at high thrust up to 45 % at a low thrust setting. Stereoscopic PIV measurements showed the beneficial effect of pylon blowing in compensating the momentum deficit in the pylon wake. At the optimal blowing rate, a recovery effect of about 80 % was obtained compared to the unblown case. Application of the blowing system eliminated the pylon <b>installation</b> <b>penalty,</b> recovering the noise levels to those measured for the isolated propeller. Installation of the SRVs downstream of the isolated propeller resulted in a swirl recovery of 50 %, {{at the cost of}} a 2 dB tonal noise increase.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the results of}} an in-depth study investigating the impacts of variable pitch, geared turbofan cycle parameters on a two-fan, subsonic, V/STOL aircraft. Variations in fan pressure ratio, compressor pressure ratio and combustor exit temperature are presented as they affect critical mission legs, aircraft performance, engine thrust-to-weight ratio and as a total systems impact in terms of aircraft takeoff gross weight. Several parameters have counter acting components which, when combined, synergistically result in an optimum value for that parameter.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{and impact}} of implementing a laminar flow control system on a supersonic transport configuration were investigated. A hybrid laminar flow control scheme consisting of suction controlled and natural laminar flow was developed for a double-delta type wing planform. The required suction flow rates were determined from boundary layer stability analyses using representative wing pressure distributions. A preliminary design of structural modifications needed to accommodate suction through a perforated titanium skin was carried out together with the ducting and systems needed to collect, compress and discharge the suction air. The benefits of reduced aerodynamic drag were weighed against the weight, volume and power requirement penalties of suction system installation in a mission performance and sizing program to assess the net benefits. The study showed a feasibility of achieving significant laminarization of the wing surface by use of a hybrid scheme, leading to an 8. 2 percent reduction in the cruise drag. This resulted in an 8. 5 percent reduction in the maximum takeoff weight and a 12 percent reduction in the fuel burn after {{the inclusion of the}} LFC system <b>installation</b> <b>penalties.</b> Several research needs were identified for a resolution of aerodynamics, structural and systems issues before these potential benefits could be realized in a practical system...|$|R
40|$|A {{road tunnel}} {{ventilation}} {{system should be}} objectively grated taking into account both the installation efficiency of individual fans and the interaction between adjacent fans and consecutive fan sets. This can be a reason for reduced of <b>installation</b> efficiency <b>penalties</b> and excessively high installation prices. A comprehensive series of tests were carried out on a 1 / 10 scale model of a vehicle tunnel in order to investigate the effects of tunnel velocity, jet swirl, jet momentum, inclination and distances between jet axes and tunnel roof.

40|$|The {{effects of}} pylon wake {{interaction}} on far-field propeller noise are studied using a model scale SR- 2 propeller in a low-speed anechoic wind tunnel. The {{variation in the}} pusher noise penalty with axial angle theta and circumferential angle phi is {{compared to that of}} the tractor noise penalty; and the former exhibits minima occurring in the propeller plane and maxima occurring toward the propeller axis. The magnitude of the pusher <b>installation</b> noise <b>penalty</b> decreased with in increase in shaft horsepower and tip Mach number. Directivity comparisons revealed that both a noise reduction and a directivity pattern change resulted when the pylon was moved farther from the propeller. Noise emerging from the wake interaction was distinguished from that of the propeller by means of a modal decomposition...|$|R
40|$|The noise goal of 95 PNdb for STOL {{aircraft}} imposes severe technology {{demands on}} propulsion systems. Effects of this goal {{on the design}} of the propulsion system are reviewed. Results from recent development programs associated with STOL noise reduction, such as high bypass fan tests, 25 PNdb acoustic suppression tests, sonic inlets, and powered lift system noise tests, are presented. Integrated propulsion system designs for the blown flap and augmentor wing powered lift systems capable of meeting the noise goal are shown and the performance, <b>installation,</b> and economic <b>penalties</b> assessed...|$|R
40|$|A twin-engine, low-wing {{transport}} model, with a {{supercritical wing}} of aspect ratio 10. 8 {{designed for a}} cruise Mach number of 0. 77 and a lift coefficient of 0. 55, was tested in the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel. The purpose of this test was to compare the wing-nacelle interference effects of flow-through nacelles simulating superfan engines (very high bypass ratio (BPR is approx. = 18) turbofan engines) with the wing-nacelle interference effects of current-technology turbofans (BPR is approx. = 6). Forces and moments on the complete model were measured with a strain-gage balance, and extensive external static-pressure measurements (383 orifice locations) were made on the wing, nacelles, and pylons of the model. Data were taken at Mach numbers from 0. 50 to 0. 80 and at model angles of attack from - 4 deg to 8 deg. Test results indicate that flow-through nacelles with a very high bypass ratio can be installed on a low-wing transport model with a lower <b>installation</b> drag <b>penalty</b> than for a conventional turbofan nacelle at a design cruise Mach number of 0. 77 and lift coefficient of 0. 55...|$|R
40|$|A semispan {{model with}} a powered {{propeller}} has been tested to provide data on the <b>installation</b> drag <b>penalty</b> of advanced propfan-powered transports designed to cruise at a Mach number of 0. 8. These tests, conducted in 14 -foot and 11 -foot transonic wind tunnels, {{are a part of}} a NASA program to develop efficient, high-speed propellers for more fuel-efficient commercial transports for the 1990 s and beyond. The model is instrumented for measuring propeller forces, wing/nacelle forces and moments, and pressure distributions over the wing and nacelle. The body in these tests was nonmetric, being connected to the wing by an RTV seal at the wing/body juncture. Tests were run at angles of attack from - 3 to + 5 deg over the Mach number range 0. 6 to 0. 85 at a Reynolds number of about 9, 000, 000. Results of these tests indicate that the nacelle interference drag can be quite large relative to an uninstalled nacelle. However, the losses due to the nacelle were reduced to acceptable levels by changes to the wing leading edge and nacelle intersection. The propeller slipstream causes substantial changes in the wing span load distribution indicating that twist modifications are needed to recover a more favorable span load distribution...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study was}} carried out {{on the effects of}} replacing submarine turbine-reduction gear propulsion drive systems with an equivalent electric drive system. Alternating current (A. C.) and direct current (D. C.) systems were designed using computer based machine synthesis programs. The systems considered included direct drive motors operating at the speed of the submarine drive shaft and motors operating at higher speeds in conjunction with integral single stage reduction gears. Methods to improve the efficiency of the various motors for speeds other than rated speed were examined. The impacts of the electric system designs were evaluated in terms of the ability of a mechanical drive submarine design to accept the replacement of the mechanical components with the equivalent electric components and meet standard submarine design closure criteria. All electric drive variants met the basic naval architectural feasibility requirements. Electric drive systems were heavier, required less arrangeable volume and were generally less efficient than the mechanical baseline ship. Gear reduced electric systems were lighter and more than the direct drive, low speed motor based systems. Electric submarine drive is a feasible alternative to conventional mechanical, locked train transmission systems. Electric drive <b>installations</b> carry <b>penalties</b> in terms of added weight and reduced propulsion plant efficiency that must be recognized and accepted by the ship designer.

40|$|Pylon-mounted pusher {{propellers}} su_er from installation e_ects due to {{the interaction}} between the pylon and the propeller. The impact of angular inow on these installation e_ects was quanti_ed at the Large Low-Speed Facility of the German-Dutch wind tun- nels (DNW-LLF). Particle-image-velocimetry measurements showed that the pylon wake's width and velocity de_cit were hardly a_ected by the introduction of a six-degree sideslip angle. Application of pylon trailing-edge blowing reduced the integral velocity de_cit in the wake by up to 65 %. Evaluations of the surface pressures on the blades con_rmed the sinusoidal loading behavior in angular inow and the impulsive loading peak {{due to the}} pylon-wake encounter. The circumferential velocity components induced by the pylon tip vortex strongly a_ected the steady-state propeller performance by modifying the e_ective advance ratio sensed by the blades. Increased performance was measured when the rota- tion direction of the pylon tip vortex was opposite to that of the propeller. Angular inow a_ected the propeller noise emissions due to the resulting unsteady blade loads and the circumferential variation of the e_ective Mach number of the blade sections. The instal- lation of the pylon added a noise source due to the unsteady blade loads caused by the pylon-wake encounter. Depending on the sideslip angle, application of blowing eliminated {{a large part of the}} <b>installation</b> noise <b>penalty,</b> despite remaining non-uniformities in the blown wake pro_les.

40|$|The {{severity}} of proposed noise goals for STOL systems {{has resulted in}} a new design approach for aircraft propulsion systems. It has become necessary to consider the influence of the noise goal on the design of engine components, engine systems, and the integrated nacelle, separately and collectively, from the onset of the design effort. This integrated system design approach is required in order to effect an optimization of the propulsion and aircraft system. Results from extensive design studies and pertinent test programs are presented which show the effect of noise specifications on component and system design, and the trade offs possible of noise versus configuration and performance. The design optimization process of propulsion systems for powered lift systems is presented beginning with the component level and proceeding through to the final integrated propulsion system. Designs are presented which are capable of meeting future STOL noise regulations and the performance, <b>installation</b> and economic <b>penalties</b> are assessed as a function of noise level...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{stochastic}} programming approach to solving an intra-ring Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) design problem. This research differs from pioneering SONET design studies in two fundamental ways. First, while traditional approaches to solving this problem {{assume that all}} data are deterministic, we observe that for practical planning situations, network demand levels are stochastic. Second, while most models disallow demand shortages and focus only on the minimization of capital Add-Drop Multiplexer (ADM) equipment expenditure, our model minimizes a mix of ADM <b>installations</b> and expected <b>penalties</b> arising from the failure to satisfy {{some or all of}} the actual telecommunication demand. We propose an L-shaped algorithm to solve this design problem, and demonstrate how a nonlinear reformulation of the problem may improve the strength of the generated optimality cuts. We next enhance the basic algorithm by implementing powerful lower and upper bounding techniques via an assortment of modeling, valid inequality, and heuristic strategies. Our computational results conclusively demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm as opposed to standard L-shaped and extensive form approaches to solving the problem. ...|$|R
