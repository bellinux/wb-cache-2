5|$|The fossils {{found in}} {{abundance}} along this coastline provide <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> {{animals and plants}} evolved in this region. During the Triassic this area was a desert, while in the Jurassic {{it was part of}} a tropical sea, and in the Cretaceous it was covered by swamps. The fossilised remains of the animals and plants that lived in those periods are very well preserved, providing a wealth of information on their body shapes, the way they died and even the fossilised remains of their last meals. Fossil groups found here include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, reptiles and a few mammals. At Lulworth Cove there is a fossil forest of conifers, tree-ferns and cycads.|$|E
5|$|The {{last half}} of the 19th century saw a {{tremendous}} expansion in paleontological activity, especially in North America. The trend continued in the 20th century with additional regions of the Earth being opened to systematic fossil collection, as demonstrated by a series of important discoveries in China {{near the end of the}} 20th century. Many transitional fossils have been discovered, and there is now considered to be abundant <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> all classes of vertebrates are related, much of it in the form of transitional fossils. The last few decades of the 20th century saw a renewed interest in mass extinctions and their role in the evolution of life on Earth. There was also a renewed interest in the Cambrian explosion that saw the development of the body plans of most animal phyla. The discovery of fossils of the Ediacaran biota and developments in paleobiology extended knowledge about the history of life back far before the Cambrian.|$|E
5|$|The {{records of}} the priory and abbey have not survived, but the {{excavations}} {{and the study of}} other documents have produced <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the monastic lands were managed. The principal source of income came from farming. This income was required not only for the building and upkeep of the property, but also for feeding the canons, their guests, and visiting pilgrims. The priory also had an obligation from its foundation to house travellers fording the Mersey. It has been estimated that nearly half of the demesne lands were used for arable farming. The grain grown on priory lands was ground by a local windmill and by a watermill outside the priory lands. Excavations revealed part of a stone handmill in the area used in the monastic kitchen. In addition to orchards and herb gardens in the moated enclosures, it is likely that beehives were maintained for the production of honey. There is evidence from bone fragments that cattle, sheep, pigs, geese and chickens were reared and consumed, but few bone fragments from deer, rabbits or hares have been discovered. Horseflesh was not eaten. Although few fish bones have been discovered, it is known from documentary evidence that the canons owned a number of local fisheries. The fuel used consisted of wood and charcoal, and turf from marshes over which the priory had rights of turbary (to cut turf).|$|E

It is more probable that they were based in the milecastles or forts, and manned the turrets in rotation.

In 2003, archaeologists found a rare 17th century double-barred, white bronze Caravaca cross {{at the bottom of a}} 19th-century trash pit. Crafted in Spain, it predates the boarding house era by two centuries and is the most mysterious object found on the site to date.|$|E

The carbon dating of these sites (and earlier sites at Çatalhöyük and Neolithic B sites in Jordan) are based on left over grape pips (seeds) and while they provide solid evidence of wine making, they don't necessarily provide <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the wine was made and if the modern concept of pressing (i.e. extracting juice from the skins and separating it from the skins and seeds) was used.|$|E

500|$|In 1859, when Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species {{was first}} published, {{the fossil record}} was poorly known. Darwin {{described}} the perceived lack of transitional fossils as, [...] "...the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory," [...] but explained it by relating it to the extreme imperfection of the geological record. He noted the limited collections available at that time, but described the available information as showing patterns that followed from his theory of descent with modification through natural selection. Indeed, Archaeopteryx was discovered just two years later, in 1861, and represents a classic transitional form between earlier, non-avian dinosaurs and birds. Many more transitional fossils have been discovered since then, and there is now abundant <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> all classes of vertebrates are related, including many transitional fossils. Specific examples of class-level transitions are: tetrapods and fish, birds and dinosaurs, and mammals and [...] "mammal-like reptiles".|$|E

Historian Charles McGlashan later called this snowshoe party the [...] "Forlorn Hope". Two of those without snowshoes, Charles Burger and 10-year-old William Murphy, turned back early on. Other members of the party fashioned a pair of snowshoes for Lemuel on the first evening from one of the packsaddles that they were carrying.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, states {{initially}} {{tried to}} prohibit driving {{with a high}} level of BAC, and a BrAC test result was merely presented as indirect evidence of BAC. [...] Where the defendant had refused to take a subsequent blood test, the only way the state could prove BAC was by presenting scientific <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> alcohol in the breath gets there from alcohol in the blood, along with <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to convert from one to the other. [...] DUI defense attorneys frequently contested the scientific reliability of such evidence. [...] In response, many states like California subsequently modified their BAC statutes so to directly prohibit a certain level of alcohol in the breath as an alternative to a prohibited level of BAC. In other words, the breath test result itself, the BrAC level, became the direct predicate evidence for conviction. In other states, such as New Jersey, the statute remains tied to BAC, but the BrAC results of certain machines have been judicially deemed presumptively accurate substitutes for blood testing when used as directed.|$|E
