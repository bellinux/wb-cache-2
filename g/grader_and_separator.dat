The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the effect of each processing machine alone on the physical and physiological qualities of the soybean seeds. Seed samples of two soybean cultivars - BMX Potência RR and NK 7059 RR - were collected from five machines separately: air-screen machine, spiral <b>separator,</b> size <b>grader</b> <b>and</b> gravity <b>separator.</b> The experimental design was a completely randomized factorial, varying with the equipment, with 20 replications. Samples were assessed by germination test, accelerated aging, viability and vigor by tetrazolium test (TZ), weathering damages (TZ class 3), mechanical damages (TZ 1 - 8) and (TZ 6 - 8), stink bug damages (TZ 1 - 8) and weight of one thousand seeds. The air-screen machine <b>and</b> the spiral <b>separator</b> did not contribute to improve physiological quality of seeds; the size grader concentrated mechanical damages in larger sizes and stink bug damages in smaller sizes. Gravity separators showed higher quality seeds at the upper part of the machine compared to intermediate and lower parts. Mechanical damages and stink bug damages can be reduced by gravity <b>separator</b> <b>and</b> weathering damages are not eliminated by any of the machines...|$|R

The magnetic particle manipulator <b>and</b> <b>separator</b> is integrated on a substrate, preferably a silicon wafer. The magnetic particle manipulator <b>and</b> <b>separator</b> is comprised of a fluid flow channel and integrated inductive components formed {{on each side of the}} channel. Each inductive component is comprised of a magnetic core and a conductor coil. Preferably, a meander-type inductor is used. The magnetic cores have ends located adjacent the fluid channel which function as electromagnet poles. When approximately 500 mA of DC current at less than 1 volt is supplied to the circuit, the inductive components produce magnetic fields and the magnetic particles suspended in the fluid clump onto the electromagnet poles. When the current is removed, the magnetic particles are released from the electromagnet poles. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

40|$|Five {{experiments}} (conducted in 1968 on observing {{responses and}} vigilance, reward preterences, and learning strategies in concept formation) indicate that socioeconomic level (SEL) has {{an influence on}} intellectual and educational functioning of elementary school children. Expectation of reinforcement was tested in experiment 1, using 60 kindergartners. Low SEL children rapidly stopped making observing responses when an expected event did not occur, while high SEL children maintained a significant rate of observing responses. In experiment 2, 32 second <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> 24 fourth <b>graders</b> were tested to investigate left-right directional preference. Fourth <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> high SEL second graders performed with more directional responses than did low SEL second <b>graders.</b> Reward preferences <b>and</b> reinforcement were investigated in 60 kindergartners in experiment 3. Low SEL children had significantly greater preference for consistency than high SEL children. Experiment 5 tested 60 first <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> indicated that the chaotic reinforcement variable alone produces deterioration of performance. Comparatively, low SEL children failed to observe environmental stimuli not previously conditioned to learned responses. Furthe...|$|R
