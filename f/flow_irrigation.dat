40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to review the theory of {{available}} models and select an appropriate model for surge <b>flow</b> border <b>irrigation.</b> Field data taken from surge <b>flow</b> border <b>irrigation</b> was used to evaluate the performance of the selected model. A FORTRAN model named BRDRFLW was selected for evaluation because it was commercially available, affordable and it could simulate the complete process of irrigation. BRDRFLW was designed for conventional continuous <b>flow</b> border <b>irrigation.</b> The model had three options to generate the solution parameters, the zero-inertia option, the kinematic-wave option, and the hybrid of the two. The data from Merriam et al. (1978) was used to calibrate the model. The zero-inertia option of the BRDRFLW model produced the best results. The zero-inertia option was then tested for surge <b>flow</b> border <b>irrigation.</b> The result of this study indicated that the BRDRFLW model can be used to predict the process of surge <b>flow</b> border <b>irrigation.</b> However, this study has been done based on limited field data. More field data are required in addition to some modifications of the model's software before the BRDRFLW model can be reliably used to predict the performance of the surge <b>flow</b> border <b>irrigation...</b>|$|R

50|$|Much of the GVNML {{operational}} area is downstream from Sambhar Salt Lake, where, unless ground {{water can be}} recharged farmers {{have to rely on}} salt water for irrigation. This water has high levels of Total Dissolved Solubles (TDS) leading to reduced soil fertility. These area specific problems are coupled with droughts leading to real challenges for sustainably managing natural resources. The community has been hit hard by the repercussions of declining agriculture. Against an average rainfall of 600 mm, Laporiya gets only 323 mm When the monsoon does come, it is essential to carry out surface water storage to establish moisture, provide drinking water for animals, domestic use and gravity <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Most villages have a large water holding structure, or talab to use either for irrigation or recharging ground water. Village tube wells with hand pumps and open wells can only function if the recharging structures are in place. Drinking water supplies are fully dependent on ground water, and agriculture relies on it for 80% of its needs, so it must be recharged.|$|E

An Agreement between His Majesty’s Government of Nepal and the Government of India on the Gandak Irrigation and Power Project, signed at Kathmandu on 4 December 1959; which came in force upon signature (somewhat modified in 1964), {{to construct the}} project comprising a barrage, canal head regulators and other appurtenant works about 33 m (100 ft) below the existing Triveni Canal Head Regulator and of taking out canal systems for purposes development of irrigation and power for Nepal and India.

Basically there is an agreed share of water for ‘western Canal System including a power station in Nepal and Eastern canal System. As a part of this bilateral agreement, the Gandak Barrage, a part of Gandak Project, has been built (1968/69.) over the Gandak river for providing irrigation to Nepal, U.P. and Bihar. The irrigation potential of this project is 11,510 km², spread in the district of West Champaran, East Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Saran, Siwan & Gopalganj.

40|$|Egypt is {{a country}} of {{tremendous}} land resources but limited water resources. The area of cultivated land is only 3. 2 % of the gross area. The river Nile is {{the main source of}} water. In the recent years the Government established large-scale agricultural projects in light of food security related to the population growth. Expansion of irrigated agriculture has to be predominantly realized by increasing the water use efficiency. In Egypt, the dominant irrigation method is surface irrigation, which covers approximately 83 % of the irrigated areas. Surface irrigation or gravity methods are generally characterized by a low efficiency. One opportunity to increase the efficiency is to convert surface irrigation to modern irrigation systems, which are generally highly expensive for a country like Egypt. Another option to increase the efficiency of surface irrigation systems is to convert the traditional irrigation method based on continuous flow to surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> is the intermittent application of water to furrows in a series of relatively short on and off time periods.

40|$|Several studies {{carried out}} in long furrows have shown that surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> offers the {{potential}} of increasing the efficiency of irrigation. The effects of surge flow in short fields, such as in Egypt, are still not well known, however. To investigate the effect of surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> in short fields a series of experiments {{have been carried out}} at two different locations in Egypt. The first location with a clay soil was situated at the Agriculture Experimental Station, Assiut University, Assiut. The second location with a sandy soil was situated at the Assiut University Experimental Station for Desert Land, El-Wadi El-Assuity, Assiut. The blocked end furrow lengths and widths were 70 and 0. 70 m respectively. Three discharges were selected for each soil type, namely 0. 46, 0. 74 and 0. 90 l s- 1 for clay soil and 0. 73, 1. 0 and 1. 4 l s- 1 for sandy soil. For each discharge two cycle times were investigated, namely 16 and 24 minutes. For each cycle time three cycle ratios were chosen, 1 / 4, 1 / 2 and 3 / 4 for the 16 -minute and 1 / 3, 1 / 2, and 2 / 3 for the 24 -minute cycle time. The water content was measured at three locations, namely at the beginning, middle and end of the furrow. In each location three points were measured in a vertical line at a depth of 0 - 0. 1, 0. 1 - 0. 3 and 0. 3 - 0. 7 m. The results show that surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> leads to a more uniform water distribution along the furrows than continuous flow. This uniformity is more pronounced in clay soil than in sandy soil. Surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> decreases the advance time in comparison to continuous flow. The reduction in advance time was more pronounced with the discharges of 0. 74 and 1. 0 l s- 1 in clay and sandy soil respectively. The 24 -minute cycle time is better than the 16 -minute cycle time. The reduction in advance time with a cycle time of 24 minutes is due to the effect of the off-time. Different cycle ratios can be used but the 1 / 3 cycle ratio may be the best. In conclusion, surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> under the short field conditions as prevailing in Egypt decreases the advance time, increases uniformity and efficiency by decreasing deep percolation and reduces applied water volume by 15 - 35...|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to assess the effect of tillage on water advance and water distribution in the root zone area (0. 5 m) under continuous and surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> in a cotton field. The experiment was conducted at the Agriculture Experimental Station, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. The location was classified as clay soil. The furrows with blocked ends were 76 cm long and 0. 70 m wide with 0. 0024 m m- 1 of slope. To monitor the advance time, six points were established along the furrows at 9, 18, 27, 36, 45 and 76 m from the inlet. In order to study the water distribution along the furrows, soil moisture content was measured using the gravimetric method at 0 - 0. 25 and 0. 25 - 0. 50 m depths at the beginning, middle {{and end of the}} furrows. A hand hoeing tillage system (HH) was compared with a weed control tillage system (WC) under continuous flow (CF) and surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> (SF). Hand hoeing tillage decreased the water advance time compared to weed control tillage either under continuous or surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Surge flow also decreased the advance time compared to continuous flow. The greatest effect on the advance time reduction resulted from the combined effect of surge flow with tillage (SFHH), which reduced the total supplied water by 22. 4 and 25. 7 % during the first and second irrigation, respectively. The single effect of either tillage (CFHH) or surging (SFWC) also reduced the total amount of supplied water compared to continuous flow with weed control tillage (CFWC), but the reduction was less than that in the combined treatments. Due to tillage and surge effects, soil water was efficiently used and distributed uniformly along the furrow length. Combining surge irrigation and tillage could be an efficient method to use irrigation water efficiently and ensure uniform distribution of soil wate...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} movement of a surface flow profile over an infiltrating soil under conditions of surge flow, and theory related thereto, for use in preliminary design procedures for surge irrigation systems. Four specific research areas were: a) development of a surge flow infiltration model; b) the effect Or wetted perimeter on infiltration in furrow; c) design, construction, and calibration of a physical model of an irrigation border/furrow; and d) development of a surge flow furrow irrigation computer model for use in designing surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems. The effect Or wetted perimeter on infiltration in furrows was investigated using field data. Overall, the Kostiakov cumulative infiltration equation, modified to include wetted perimeter raised to a power greater than unity, appeared to satisfactorily represent the effect of wetted perimeter on infiltration in furrows. The effect of surge flow cycle time and cycle ratio on infiltration in furrows was investigated using a recirculating furrow infiltrometer which simulates surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> for various cycle times and cycle ratios. The data collected were used to evaluate two empirical surge flow infiltration models. The effects Of furrow geometry, surface storage, and recession time were considered. The results indicated that infiltration during surge <b>flow</b> <b>irrigation</b> can be effectively described using an empirical model based on the Kostiakov cumulative infiltration equation, the surge cycle ratio, and the surge cycle time. A physical model of an irrigation border/furrow was constructed using a 61 meter long by 0. 76 meter wide tilting flume with a 0. 09 meter deep infiltrating gravel bed. The model was partitioned into 15 sections of equal length. Each section contained a small computer controlled submersible pump by which water was uniformly withdrawn from the section through the gravel bed. Real time predictor/corrector computer algorithms were developed to simulate discrete spatially and temporally varying nonlinear infiltration. Each partitioned section also contained an electronic water depth sensor. All 15 water depth sensors are connected to a real time data acquisition system which relays depth of flow information to the computer simulating infiltration. The hydraulic effects of the infiltration simulator partitions, the effect of downstream boundaries on upstream flow depths, {{and the effect of}} flow depth and velocity distribution on energy loss were investigated. A computer model Or surge flow hydraulics and infiltration was developed for the preliminary design of surge flow systems. The model is based on the kinematic wave assumptions for overland flow, and the cycle ratio-time infiltration model developed during this research project. Hypothetical irrigation simulations indicate that for some high intake rate soils, surge flow has potential for markedly improving distribution efficiency over conventional continuous irrigation. However, the model also indicated that an improperly operated surge flow system can actually have lower efficiency than a continuous flow system; this factor is seldom mentioned in literature on surge irrigation...|$|E
