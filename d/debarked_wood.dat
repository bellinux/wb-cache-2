30|$|To {{conclude}} {{the results from}} this study, closely <b>debarked</b> <b>wood</b> (Norway spruce, Scots pine, and Downy birch) gave rise to the least polluted leachates, compared to the other bark/wood treatments. For the spruce, this finding also applied to the gently <b>debarked</b> <b>wood.</b> Additionally, the spruce gave rise to higher concentrations of leached pollutant substances analysed than did the pine and birch. According to the results of this study, using carefully debarked logs for storage and sprinkling is the best method for improving the quality of runoff water. The higher concentrations of pollutants from the gently <b>debarked</b> <b>wood</b> (for the pine and birch) illustrate the importance of the debarking method and the need for proper debarking in practice. Irrigating debarked logs is an interesting and promising alternative to other methods that have been suggested [24, 25] for industries trying to reduce pollutants in log yard runoff.|$|E

30|$|Sprinkling {{wood with}} {{water is a}} common method for {{protecting}} wood during storage, yet the polluted runoff generated by the log yard is a major drawback. To study bark’s ability to leach pollutants from logs, the Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, and Betula pubescens wood species were submerged with and without bark for 6  weeks. The water was analysed during the study for total organic carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, colour, pH, and distillable phenols. The {{results showed that the}} leaching from carefully <b>debarked</b> <b>wood</b> is lower than that of both gently <b>debarked</b> <b>wood</b> and intact wood. Storing carefully debarked logs is a viable method for reducing pollutants in log yard runoff.|$|E
30|$|The {{leaching}} {{from the}} pine (Fig.  2) {{was lower than}} that of the spruce, and the differences between the storage treatments were generally smaller. However, the P concentrations for the pine showed clearer differences between the treatments (Fig.  2) than did the spruce, with higher concentrations from the pine with bark and the gently debarked pine. For both P and TOC, the highest leaching occurred from the gently <b>debarked</b> <b>wood.</b> It was also noted that the TOC leaching from both the pine bark and the pine wood with bark was higher than that of the closely <b>debarked</b> <b>wood</b> but {{lower than that of}} the gently <b>debarked</b> <b>wood.</b> The colour values did not show any clear differences, except for the pure bark, which gave rise to visibly darker water {{in the second half of}} the storage period than did the other treatments. In contrast, the pure bark gave rise to the highest mean pH levels over the storage period. The concentration of phenols at the end of the storage period was much higher in the water with the pure bark when compared to the other treatments (Table  3).|$|E

30|$|Un{{degraded}} {{logs and}} logs degraded by shiitake fungi for 2, 14, 26, 38, and 50  months {{were used as}} materials for this study. They were sterilized in an autoclave at 121  °C for 1  h and dried in an oven at 105  °C until the moisture content (MC) reached 0 %. The logs, including inoculation points and spawn, were <b>debarked,</b> converted to <b>wood</b> powder (WP) using a Wiley Mill (WT- 150; Miki Seisakusho, Japan) with a 1  mm screen mesh, and stored as a mix of homogenized WP. The hardness and density of the logs varied with degradation duration, a proxy for the degree of degradation; consequently, {{the time required to}} powderize the wood differed. Approximately 500  g of each sample was powderized to produce WP; WP that did not pass through the 1  mm screen mesh (less than 5 % by weight) was excluded as waste WP. WP for the manufacture of boards and chemical analyses were sampled from the same mixture.|$|R
40|$|Short {{rotation}} forestry (SRF) is a promising feedstock for production of biofuels via the thermochemical route. Five poplar biomasses (SRF of different clones and ages, and <b>debarked</b> <b>wood)</b> were ground and separated into three particle size fractions: 0. 4 mm. The characterization of these samples {{was performed to}} evaluate the quality and homogeneity of SRF feedstocks. Some major properties related to thermochemical processes were measured: chemical composition, organic and inorganic elemental compositions. The heterogeneity in SRF feedstock properties, resulting from high bark content, appeared {{to be transferred to}} particle size fractions. The results obtained highlighted that fine particles below 0. 2 mm had very specific properties, close to those of bark. The removal of this fraction would result in a more homogeneous feedstock, avoiding the issue caused by segregation risk for process stability. Such removal of small particles would also modify the biomass properties by reducing bark amount, improving the suitability of SRF feedstock for thermochemical conversion. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
30|$|For the spruce (Fig.  1), {{concentration}} differences {{could be}} seen between the four wood/bark treatments (see Table  1). For TOC and colour, in particular, {{it was obvious that}} the wood with bark led to higher concentrations/values than either the gently or the closely <b>debarked</b> <b>wood.</b> The leaching rate from the pure bark did not decline over time {{in the same manner as}} it did for the other treatments. At the end of the storage period, this bark had given rise to the most polluted water with respect to the TOC and colour. The P concentrations from the wood with bark were also higher, especially at the end of the period, but otherwise the differences in the P were less clear than those in the TOC and colour. The differences in the pH values between the treatments were even smaller (Table  1). The concentration of phenols in the water with the pure bark at the end of the storage was much higher than those of the other treatments (Table  3).|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of bark in wood can constitute a serious limitation for the bioconversion of forest residues into bioethanol, especially {{due to the}} {{presence of}} high content of extractives, which may inhibit ethanol fermentation. However, a perfectly <b>debarked</b> <b>wood</b> chip may not represent an economical source of carbohydrates for industrial applications. An option is to utilise bark as a source of renewable energy and chemicals, within a biorefinery platform. In this study, enzymatic hydrolysis and bioethanol fermentation of Douglas-fir bark were studied before and after organosolv and diluted acid pre-treatments performed at 150 °C and 180 °C. The recovery of valuable platforms molecules was also determined after pre-treatment. Results showed that an organosolv-free acid pre-treatment performed at 150 °C gave the best results in terms of platforms molecules recovery (40 % w/w) and bioethanol yield (2 g. 100 g- 1 total solids). However, the low glucose and ethanol yields obtained (6 % and 16 % of the theoretical values, respectively) confirmed that enzymatic hydrolysis remains the limiting step of bioethanol fermentation from bark. Interestingly, ethanol was produced without inhibition of fermentation from the untreated and pretreated substrates...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the opportunities to}} use small size round wood as a raw material for wood pellets. Article is aimed to give an insight to {{results of the study}} and to initiate discussion related on topical questions among pellet industry: what is the quality of pellets produced of undebarked young thinning wood (pine and pine-birch mixture) or <b>debarked</b> young thinning <b>wood.</b> Other topics of the study are to find out: has felling timing or growing habitat any influence to the chemical composition of pellets. Fuel quality indicates that high quality pellets can be produced of alternative raw materials. Key findings of this study are that there is a big opportunity to use undebarked small diameter pine and undebarked small diameter pine pinebirch mixture as a raw material for wood pellets. According chemical analysis small diameter thinning wood with bark is useful raw material for EN 14961 - 2 (2011) A 1 wood pellets. In Finland traditionally small diameter wood {{has been used as a}} raw material for wood chips and for pulp and paper industry.

30|$|Consistent {{with earlier}} {{findings}} [20], the leachates from the Norway spruce wood and bark caused more polluted water {{than did the}} Scots pine and Downy birch. Within {{the analysis of the}} different species, {{significant differences were found between}} the debarking methods, showing their vital importance for the amount of pollutants created when submerging wood and bark in water. For all of the tree species in the study, removing the bark completely from the wood produced lower overall concentrations of pollutants. It is well known that extracts from bark can be toxic to living organisms [21 – 23]. Concerning the remnants of inner bark on the wood (as in the gently <b>debarked</b> <b>wood),</b> the spruce differed from the pine and birch. The gently debarked treatment did not cause more polluted water for the spruce, while it did for the pine and birch. This difference between the species was perhaps unexpected, as comparing the three species in the study showed that the gently debarked spruce wood pieces had more inner bark remaining on the wood than did the pine and birch. The results indicated that the inner bark is of great importance to the leaching of pollutants from pine and birch, but not from spruce.|$|E
30|$|The wood {{used in the}} {{experiment}} was felled in late March 2009 outside Uppsala in Sweden (59 ° 51 ′ 30 ″N, 17 ° 39 ′ 0 ″E) and stored in the freezer (− 18 °C) until the study began in late April 2009. Approximately 30 -year-old trees of Norway spruce, Scots pine, and Downy birch were used. Wood pieces with bark (only sapwood) were cut from the outer part of the logs, approximately 140  ×  130  ×  40  mm. One-third of the pieces were left with the bark intact, one-third were carefully debarked with a knife to remove all of the bark, and the remaining one-third of the pieces were more gently debarked with a knife to leave the inner bark on the wood. Pure bark {{was used as the}} 4 th type of bark treatment in {{the experiment}}. In practice, the carefully debarked pieces had small remnants of (inner) bark remaining and the gently debarked pieces had most of the inner bark and small remnants of the outer bark. The gently debarked spruce wood had more inner bark remaining compared to the pine and birch. The bark from each carefully <b>debarked</b> <b>wood</b> piece was collected and put into net textile bags, forming the pure bark sample for the experiment. Due to the debarking process, the bark was divided into smaller parts.|$|E
30|$|For all {{the species}} and {{analysed}} substances (with {{the exception of}} the colour value for the pine), there was less leaching from the carefully <b>debarked</b> <b>wood.</b> The higher P leaching from debarked logs found by Halldin and Eriksson [14] and Jonsson [13] was not observed in the present study. The P leaching was also lower from the pure bark of the spruce and pine in this present study. When interpreting the results from the bark samples in the present study, the smaller volume of the bark samples compared to the wood samples may have caused underestimation of the leaching. Due to the debarking process, the pure bark samples were also divided into more pieces, possibly accelerating the leaching. In practice, the results may be considered reasonable, as when the bark is left intact on the logs, the wood beneath is likely to barely affect the leaching. The surface area of the bark also differed between the bark samples and the wood samples with bark, possibly being one source of uncertainty in the interpretation of the results. Even if it was considered to be of minor importance it is possible that this larger surface area contributed to overestimation of the leaching from pure bark. The setup in this study with pieces of wood instead of whole logs as is the case at a normal log yard is also a source of uncertainty. For example, the amount of exposed heartwood (none in this study) and sapwood might differ from reality.|$|E
30|$|The main {{sources of}} {{variation}} in nutrient concentrations were biomass component >[*]>[*]genotype (species)[*]≈[*]age[*]>[*]tree diameter. The concentrations of Ca, Mg and K were most strongly affected by genotype and age. The concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg, S and Cu in the wood component decreased with age, whereas C concentrations increased, with a trend to reach 50 % in the older trees. In the SRF, interamerican poplar and P. trichocarpa genotypes were comparatively more efficient in terms of Ca and K nutrient assimilation index (NAI) (+[*] 65 – 85 %) than eucalypts, mainly because leafless biomass can be removed. In the conventional eucalypt plantations (rotation 15  years), debarking the wood at logging (savings of 225 % of Ca and 254 % of Mg for E. globulus) {{or the use of}} selected genotypes (savings of 45 % of P and 35 % of Ca) will provide wood at a relatively lower nutrient cost. Considering all the E. globulus genotypes together, the management for pulp with removal of <b>debarked</b> <b>wood</b> shows NAI values well above (×[*] 1.7 –×[*] 3.9) the ones found for poplar or eucalypt SRF and also higher (×[*] 1.6 –×[*] 4.0) than the ones found for oak and birch managed in medium or long rotations. The annual rates of nutrient removal were low in the native broadleaved species but the rates of available soil nutrients removed were high as compared to poplar or eucalypts. Management of native broadleaved species should consider nutrient stability through selection of the biomass compartments removed.|$|E
