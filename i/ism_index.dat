40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to further investigate the ISM impact on the temperature and wind regime of the Eastern Mediterranean region, with the aid of multivariate statistics. For this purpose, the standardized Dynamic Indian Monsoon Index by Wang and Fan (1999) was used for a period of 44 years (1958 - 2001) along with ERA 40 Reanalysis data, including monthly means of surface air temperature and wind at 850 hPa with a horizontal resolution of 0. 25 ° latitude x 0. 25 ° longitude. Initially, the correlation maps of the seasonal anomalies of the two variables upon <b>ISM</b> <b>index</b> are computed and subsequently Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis (EOF) is carried out on individual fields. Under this framework, correlation coefficients between the derived EOF amplitudes and <b>ISM</b> <b>index</b> are calculated and in order to validate the results from the first method, the EOF modes that exhibit high correlation coefficients are compared to the aforementioned correlation patterns.

In contrast to the existing literature on ISM surveys, we investigate their marginal impact on these nowcasts when large unbalanced (jagged edge) macroeconomic data sets are used in real time to generate them. We …nd evidence that these <b>ISM</b> <b>indices</b> are helpful in improving the nowcasts when new ISM information becomes available {{in the beginning of the}} month, ahead of other monthly indicators. Furthermore, and while the existing literature has focused almost exclusively on manufaturing information, here we establish the increasingly signi…cant role of the recently created non-manufacturing <b>ISM</b> di¤usion <b>indices</b> in such nowcasting contexts...|$|R
5000|$|All the <b>ISM</b> <b>indexes</b> are {{diffusion}} indexes and are {{indicators of}} month-to-month change. The percent {{response to the}} [...] "Better," [...] "Same," [...] or [...] "Worse" [...] question is difficult to compare to prior periods; therefore, ISM diffuses the percentages for this purpose. A diffusion index indicates {{the degree to which}} the indicated change is dispersed or diffused throughout the sample population. Respondents to ISM surveys indicate each month whether particular activities (e.g., new orders) for their organizations have increased, decreased, or remained unchanged from the previous month. The <b>ISM</b> <b>indexes</b> are calculated by taking the percentage of respondents that report that the activity has increased ("Better") and adding it to one-half of the percentage that report the activity has not changed ("Same") and adding the two percentages. Using half of the [...] "Same" [...] percentage effectively measures the bias toward a positive (above 50 percent) or negative index. As an example of calculating a diffusion index, if the response is 20 percent [...] "Better," [...] 70 percent [...] "Same," [...] and 10 percent [...] "Worse," [...] the Diffusion Index would be 55 percent (20% + x 70%). A reading of 50 percent indicates [...] "no change" [...] from the previous month.Economists and statisticians have determined that the farther the index is away from the amount that would indicate [...] "no change" [...] (50 percent), the rate of change is greater. Therefore, an index of 60% indicates a faster rate of increase than an index of 55% (increased activity is becoming more dispersed), and an index of 35% indicates a faster rate of decrease than an index of 40% (decreased activity is becoming more dispersed). A value of 100 indicates all respondents are reporting increased activity while 0 indicates that all respondents report decreased activity.|$|R

40|$|We {{undertake}} a real-time VAR {{analysis of the}} usefulness of the term spread, the junk-bond spread, the ISM's New Orders Index, and broker/dealer equity for predicting growth in non-farm employment. To get around the "apples and oranges" problem described by Koenig, Dolmas and Piger (2003), we augment each VAR we consider with a flexible state-space model of employment revisions. This methodology produces jobs forecasts consistently superior to those obtained using conventional VAR analysis. They are also superior to Federal Reserve Greenbook forecasts and to median forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. The junk-bond spread is by far the best single predictor of future jobs growth. However, the term spread has some incremental predictive power at medium-to-long horizons. The incremental predictive power of broker/dealer equity, while small, exceeds that of the <b>ISM</b> <b>index</b> at every horizon. Employment forecasting; Asset pricing...|$|E

40|$|The Asian monsoon is an {{important}} component of the Earth's climate. Its associated rainfall variability is a crucial fac¬tor for Thailand's socio-economic development, water resources and agricultural management. An analysis shows that the Thailand rainfall annual cycle is in phase with the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and the western North Pacific summer monsoon (WNPSM). On the basis of the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, the dominant spatial-temporal interannual variability in summer monsoon rainfall (Jun. -Sep.) during 1975 - 2006 could be explained by the first two EOF modes, accounting for 34 % of the total variance. The EOF 1 was spatially dominated by strong positive signals in the central and east, whereas the EOF 2 exhibited dipole variability. The coefficient time series of EOF 1 significantly correlated posi¬tively with <b>ISM</b> <b>index,</b> but negatively with WNPSM index. The results suggest that summer monsoon rainfall in Thailand is higher (lower) than normal during the strengthening (weakening) of ISM. In contrast, rainfall in the north-east (central) is surplus (deficit) during the strengthening (weakening) of WNPSM. These findings imply that, on an interannual time scale, ISM and WNPSM exert their influence to a different extent on summer monsoon rainfall in Thailand. A clear picture of linking mechanisms and interactions with another climate mode in the Indo-Pacific sector needs to be understood. This knowledge is essential for effectively adapting to climate-related hazards and rainfall extremes and for better management of water resource and agriculture in Thailand, especially under current/future warming conditions...|$|E
30|$|The {{third major}} {{explanation}} for seasonality {{is provided by}} Gerlach (2007) and Nikkinen et al. (2007 b). They claim that seasonal clustering of US macroeconomic news announcements causes return seasonality in S&P 500 and S&P 100 index returns. Nikkinen et al. (2007 a, 2009) extend the evidence to stock market indices from Finland, France, Germany, and the UK. For the German DAX they find a TOM effect 1 day {{after the end of}} the month. The effect becomes insignificant after controlling for announcements regarding employment, employment cost, industrial production and <b>ISM</b> <b>indices.</b> However, it remains unclear whether this macroeconomic news hypothesis holds true on other markets. Jalonen et al. (2010), e.g., do not find any supporting evidence on US and German government bond markets. The present paper analyzes effects on German stocks at the stock level (as opposed to the DAX aggregate). We find that macroeconomic news are no plausible explanation for the Early TOM or other seasonal patterns in this context, as they cluster in the first third of a month.|$|R

I use the Carlson and Parkin probability method to construct monthly growth estimates from the qualitative responses of the US <b>ISM</b> production <b>index</b> and the Eurozone manufacturing PMI output index. I apply the method under different assumptions on the cross-sectional distribution of output growth using the uniform, logistic and Laplace distribution. I show that alternative distribution assumptions lead to very similar estimates. I also test the performance of the different growth estimates in an out of sample forecasting exercise of actual industrial production growth. All growth estimates beat a simple autoregressive model of output growth. Distribution assumptions again matter little most of the time except during the financial crisis when the estimates constructed using the Laplace distributional assumption perform the best. My findings are consistent with recent findings of Bottazzi and Sechi (2006) that the distribution of firm growth rates has a Laplace distribution. JEL Classification: C 18, E 27.

40|$|Abstract This paper uses recent gridded {{climatological data}} and a coupled general {{circulation}} model (GCM) simulation {{in order to}} assess the relationships between the interannual variability of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and the El Nin ˜ o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The focus is on the dynamics of the ISM-ENSO relationships and the ability of the state-of-theart coupled GCM to reproduce the complex lead-lag relationships between the ISM and the ENSO. The coupled GCM is successful in reproducing the ISM circulation and rainfall climatology in the Indian areas even though the entire ISM circulation is weaker relative to that observed. In both observations and in the simulation, the ISM rainfall anomalies are significantly associated with fluctuations of the Hadley circulation and the 200 hPa zonal wind anomalies over the Indian Ocean. A quasi-biennial time scale is found to structure the ISM dynamical and rainfall indices in both cases. Moreover, <b>ISM</b> <b>indices</b> have a similar interannual variability in the simulation and observations. The coupled model is less successful in simulating the annual cycle in the tropical Pacific. A major model bias is the eastward displacement of the western North Pacific inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), near the dateline, during northern summer. This introduces a strong semiannual component in Pacific Walker circulation indices and central equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures. Another weakness of the coupled model is a less-thanadequate simulation of the Southern Oscillation due to an erroneous eastward extension of the Southern Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) year round.

40|$|The contrarian model {{assumes that}} {{inferior}} (superior) past performance {{can be used}} as a good indicator of future superior (inferior) performance. In this regard, recent research has integrated the relevance of business magazine cover stories as a possible indicator of this performance, serving as a signal to investors to adopt a particular contrarian investment strategy. This research study replicates with extension a United States-based study that examined whether cover stories acted as effective contrarian indicators. Cover stories from the Financial Mail were collected for a ten-year period to determine whether the nature of the content (classified as either negative, positive or neutral) can act as a useful predictor of future investment performance. The event study method was used to establish whether this future performance was contrarian or momentum in nature, by adjusting the featured company holding-period returns with three benchmark measures: the FTSE-JSE All Share index; a sector-specific index; and an industry-size-matched (ISM) peer company. Statistical tests suggested that while positive stories provided evidence of momentum holding-period return (HPR) performance, negative stories showed weak evidence of contrarian performance for a two-year period. However, when HPR was adjusted for sector or <b>ISM</b> <b>index,</b> most of the abnormal returns dissipated, with only weak evidence of contrarian performance for positive stories and momentum performance for negative stories. The results validated those of the United States-based study, that suggested that magazine cover stories do not function as suitable indicators of either momentum or contrarian performance.

Results: The results showed significant correlation between knee extensors peak torque and performance in the hop tests for GTF and GC groups. There are no significantly correlations between post op knee laxity and Lysholm score compared with the hop tests and peak torque deficits. Concerning the differences between groups, the GTP group showed greater peak torque deficits in knee extensors, worst Lysholm scores and higher percentage of individuals with lower limb symmetry <b>index</b> (<b>ISM)</b> < 90 % in both hop tests when compared to the other two groups.

This study yields a number of empirical results. (1) The explanatory power of macroeconomic factors for S&P 500 index futures outperforms that of technical indicators, as found in most of previous research papers; (2) The D-ANP revealed that five core factors (US dollar <b>index,</b> <b>ISM</b> manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), interest rate, volatility index, and unemployment rate) affect fluctuations in S&P 500 index futures, of which the US dollar index is the most important; (3) A casual diagram shows that the US dollar index and interest rate have mutual effects, and the US dollar <b>index</b> unilaterally affects <b>ISM</b> manufacturing PMI, unemployment rate, and the volatility index; (4) Granger causality test results confirmed some similar results obtained via the D-ANP that the US dollar index, interest rate, and the PMI have major impacts on the S&P 500 index futures; (5) The general regression results confirmed that four of five factors selected via the D-ANP (US dollar index, interest rate, volatility index, and unemployment rate) have strong explanatory power in forecasting the {{rate of return on}} S&P 500 index futures; (6) The GRA revealed that the explanatory power of various factors selected via the D-ANP was better for S&P 500 than for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and Nasdaq 100 index futures; (7) The explanatory power is better for S&P 500 Industrial than for S&P 500 transportation, utility, and financial index futures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{focus of}} this study is to {{document}} the possible role of the southern subtropical IndianOcean in the transitions of the monsoon-ENSO system during recent decades. Composite analyses of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fields prior to El Niño-SouthernOscillation (ENSO), Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), AUstralian Summer Monsoon(AUSM), Tropical Indian Ocean Dipole (TIOD) and Maritime Continent Rainfall (MCR) indices reveal the South East Indian Ocean (SEIO) SSTs during late boreal winter as theunique common SST precursor of these various phenomena after the 1976 - 1977 regime shift. Weak (strong) ISMs and AUSMs, El Niños (La Niñas) and positive (negative) TIOD eventsare preceded by significant negative (positive) SST anomalies in the SEIO, off Australiaduring boreal winter. These SST anomalies are mainly linked to subtropical Indian Oceandipole events, recently studied by Behera and Yamagata (2001). A wavelet analysis of aFebruary-March SEIO SST time series shows significant spectral peaks at 2 and 4 - 8 yearstime scales as for ENSO, <b>ISM</b> or AUSM <b>indices.</b> A composite analysis with respect toFebruary-March SEIO SSTs shows that cold (warm) SEIO SST anomalies are highlypersistent and affect the westward translation of the Mascarene high from austral to borealsummer, inducing a weakening (strengthening) of the whole ISM circulation through amodulation of the local Hadley cell during late boreal summer. At the same time, thesesubtropical SST anomalies and the associated SEIO anomalous anticyclone may be a triggerfor both the wind-evaporation-SST and wind-thermocline-SST positive feedbacks betweenAustralia and Sumatra during boreal spring and early summer. These positive feedbacksexplain the extraordinary persistence of the SEIO anomalous anticyclone from boreal springto fall. Meanwhile, the SEIO anomalous anticyclone favors persistent southeasterly windanomalies along the west coast of Sumatra and westerly wind anomalies over the westernPacific, which are well-known key-factors for the evolution of positive TIOD and El Niñoevents, respectively. A correlation analysis supports these results and shows that SEIO SSTsin February-March has higher predictive skill than other well-established ENSO predictors forforecasting Niño 3. 4 SST at the end of the year. This suggests again that SEIO SST anomaliesexert a fundamental influence on the transitions of the whole monsoon-ENSO system duringrecent decades...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} step in data {{analysis}} {{is represented by the}} data reconstruction. The relatively easiest approach to solve that problem is interpolation. In our work, different interpolation methods has been analyzed and applied to radiation measurements collected by sensors. Numerical quality of the reconstruction and complexity has been evaluated using the O-notation. The methods analyzed are: 1. Interpolation by polynomials: Lagrange and Newton interpolation algorithm. 2. Rational interpolation: Thiele’s formula. 3. Spline interpolation: Bézier, cubic and Catmull-Rom. 4. Least squares method: linear and quadratic (statistical interpolation). 5. Ordinary Kriging method (geostatistical interpolation). For each method we have written an algorithm in pseudo-code used to evaluate the complexity expressed in terms of O-notation, then the Java code has been written using the framework Eclipse and executed on a MacBook Pro armed with a 2. 4 GHz Intel Core Duo. The input dataset used for each interpolation method (except for the Kriging’s method) has 96 samples and corresponds to the day 15 - 07 - 2011 (from the midnight to the midnight) of the photovoltaic field located in Moie (An). We first cancelled both singular samples and subset of data from the original dataset, and then performed the reconstruction. Using the mean square difference <b>index</b> <b>Ism</b> we evaluated the quality of the reconstruction. For the Kriging’s method we used the radiation value recorded at the 15 - 07 - 2011 01. 15 pm in four PV systems. Polynomial and rational interpolation algorithms can be designed with a dynamic programming approach: each partial solutions can be stored in a properly data structure that allows us to optimize computation time and resources management. In terms of complexity, our results suggest to use the algorithms of Newton and Thiele, in particular, for the reconstruction of m points with n= 96 samples we obtain. In terms of Ism, the algorithms that we suggest to use are the Newton or Thiele for a single missing data, Spline Catmull-Rom for an entire subset.

40|$|The role of Brazilian cities {{had great}} changes {{over the last}} twenty-six. The process of {{decentralization}} allowed with the 1988 Constitution aimed the financial and political strengthening of the states and especially the municipalities {{in relation to the}} federal government. Thus, given the cities greater autonomy, as became 'federative'. Areas such as health and education have gained proper attribution of the local governments and increase the administrative burden, thereby increasing the financial and cities now have to raise more to fulfill them. The administration of a municipality is what organizes and prepares it for development. The need for a management organized so that the population is well served in their rights converge for the concept of sustainable development. Whereas a municipality depends on many factors to develop sustainably, that is, given its population and thinking of the future generations, we need studies that seek to analyze the situation of the municipalities in its various aspects in order to find answers or directions to removal or replacement of obstructing the process. As well as for the development to occur in one place, one needs appropriate to their stimulus policies, the government also needs favorable framework conditions for public policies of local development induction be effective. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} analyze whether the municipal administrations of the state of CearÃ contributed, from 2009 to 2012 for the development and sustainability of their municipalities. A Municipal Management index was constructed (IGM) for 2009 and 2012 through structure indicators of the management of municipalities. Through the use of analysis techniques of Principal Components was calculated Municipal Sustainability <b>Index</b> (<b>ISM),</b> and the same variables was made by the group of municipalities in seven clusters. To see the relationship between municipal management and sustainability, we used the cumulative distribution method by quantile regression. Variables such as spending on health, spending on education and the municipal debt proved to be very important for the sustainability of cities. It was concluded that for most municipalities there was no change in sustainability over the three years, though there have been changes of management, however the values decreased, which implies that some of the characteristics of the municipalities at the beginning of his administration in 2009 may have It has been lost, such as stocks and services that are no longer running and available to the population, councils who failed to act, municipal plans that no longer exist, joints that were undone. It was noticed that the management has a direct impact on sustainability, being instrumental in the development of the municipality, in all aspects, but mainly by the variables used here to generate adequate living conditions for its residents. O papel dos municÃpios brasileiros sofreu grandes mudanÃas nos Ãltimos vinte e seis anos. O processo de descentralizaÃÃo permitido com a ConstituiÃÃo de 1988 teve por objetivo o fortalecimento financeiro e polÃtico dos estados e, principalmente, dos municÃpios em relaÃÃo ao governo federal. Com isso, conferiu aos municÃpios maior autonomia, pois passaram a ser âentes federativosâ. Ãreas como saÃde e educaÃÃo ganharam atribuiÃÃes prÃprias dos municÃpios e se aumentam as obrigaÃÃes administrativas, consequentemente, aumentam as financeiras e os municÃpios passaram a ter que arrecadar mais para cumprÃ-las. A administraÃÃo de um municÃpio Ã o que o organiza e o prepara para o desenvolvimento. A necessidade de uma gestÃo organizada para que a populaÃÃo seja bem atendida em seus direitos converge, entÃo, para este conceito de desenvolvimento sustentÃvel. Considerando que um municÃpio depende de muitos fatores para se desenvolver com sustentabilidade, ou seja, atendendo sua populaÃÃo e pensando nas geraÃÃes futuras, sÃo necessÃrios estudos que procuram analisar a situaÃÃo dos municÃpios em seus mais variados aspectos para que se encontrem respostas ou direcionamentos para a remoÃÃo ou substituiÃÃo dos entraves ao processo. Assim como, para que ocorra o desenvolvimento em um local, precisa-se de polÃticas adequadas ao seu estÃmulo, o poder pÃblico tambÃm necessita de condiÃÃes estruturais favorÃveis para que as polÃticas pÃblicas sejam efetivas. Dessa forma, o objetivo geral deste estudo foi analisar se as gestÃes municipais do estado do CearÃ contribuÃram, no perÃodo de 2009 a 2012, para o desenvolvimento com sustentabilidade dos seus municÃpios. Foi calculado um Ãndice de GestÃo Municipal (IGM) para 2009 e 2012 atravÃs de indicadores de estrutura da gestÃo dos municÃpios. AtravÃs do uso das tÃcnicas de AnÃlise dos Componentes Principais foi calculado o Ãndice de Sustentabilidade Municipal (ISM), e com as mesmas variÃveis fez-se o agrupamento dos municÃpios em sete clusters. Para ver as relaÃÃes entre a gestÃo municipal e a sustentabilidade, utilizou-se o mÃtodo de distribuiÃÃo cumulativa, atravÃs da RegressÃo QuantÃlica. VariÃveis como despesa com saÃde, despesa com educaÃÃo e o endividamento municipal mostraram-se muito importantes para a sustentabilidade dos municÃpios. Concluiu-se que para a maior parte dos municÃpios nÃo houve mudanÃa na sustentabilidade ao longo dos trÃs anos, porÃm houveram mudanÃas de gestÃo, entretanto os valores diminuÃram, o que pressupÃe que algumas das caracterÃsticas dos municÃpios no inÃcio de sua gestÃo em 2009 podem ter sido perdidas, como aÃÃes e serviÃos que deixaram de ser executados e oferecidos Ã populaÃÃo, conselhos que deixaram de atuar, planos municipais que deixaram de existir, articulaÃÃes que foram desfeitas.
