40|$|Here {{we report}} {{a new way}} to {{characterize}} the performance of antioxidant additives for <b>dry</b> <b>charged</b> negative plate of the lead acid battery by measuring the anodic excursion peaks (AEPs). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) combined with potential step method have been conducted to investigate the effects of polyhydric compounds (sorbitol) and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) on AEPs and corrosion resistance. The results show that sorbitol increases AEPs but prevents the formation of PbO 2, and on the contrary CTAB promotes the formation of PbO 2 but eliminates AEPs. These phenomena reveal that the increase of AEPs and the increase of corrosion resistance of lead electrode are synchronous, which indicate that the additives that can enhance AEPs could be used as antioxidant additives. The effectiveness of the new AEPs test on searching antioxidant additives for protection of lead electrode has been compared with the general potentiodynamic polarization (Tafel) method, and the results of the two tests are consistent. Also, it has been obtained that characterizing the antioxidative effect of antioxidant additives on lead electrode via measuring AEPs in CV or LSV is reliable and more facile than Tafel.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Economic {{analyses}} were conducted {{to assess the impact of}} rice harvest moisture content (MC) on economic return to a producer. The primary factors considered included percent milled rice, percent head rice, field yield, and drying costs. The results showed that rice harvest MC had a dramatic impact on the final gross income to a producer. The optimal harvest MC was influenced by field yield loss rate and, to a lesser degree, <b>drying</b> <b>charge</b> schedule. The relative price of broken to head rice also affected the optimal harvest MC. Significant losses in gross income could be incurred if rice is harvested at MCs lower than 15 % or higher than 22 %. Keywords. Rice, Moisture content, Economics, Harvest. Harvesting is an important operation in rice production. The time at which rice is harvested directly influences the economic return to a producer (the value of harvested rice less certain specified costs such as harvest, storage, and drying costs). The primary factors that determine this economic return are rice field yield (FY); milling quality, including percent milled rice (PMR) and percent head rice (PHR); and drying costs. Studies (e. g., Lu et al., 1992; Siebenmorgen et al., 1992) have shown that FY, PMR, and PHR are a function of average rice moisture content (MC) (unless otherwise specified, all moisture contents reported in this article ar...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} mentioned problems in relation to processing beetle-killed wood in the British Columbia Interior is that of kiln <b>drying</b> <b>charges</b> consisting of both green and partly dried stock. This results from the fact that dead beetle-killed stems are currently harvested and processed along with green stems from the same stands. The losses, or additional costs, associated with the current procedures include the following: 1. extra cost to kiln dry already dry wood, 2. excessive degrade in the already dry stock, and 3. increased planer breakage due to overdry wood, and related planer production delays. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine some possible alternatives available for dealing with this problem, the equip-ment changes required, the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives and some related considerations. This is done within the framework of a series of studies designed to evaluate the economic merits of the alternatives. PROPOSAL In order to reduce the losses referred to above, it is proposed that the dry beetle-killed wood and green normal wood be segregated and the lumber dried separately. MILL TYPE The type of operation examined in the following alternatives is a typical British Columbian Interior spruce-pine-fir (S-P-F) dimension mill producing 2 x 4 to 2 x 10 in lengths from 8 to 20 feet, requiring 28 basic length and width sorts. SORTING ALTERNATIVES Four basic alternatives for sorting have been identified: 1. No change (control) : continue to run mixed dry and green stock throughout the operation; 2. Sort in woods: segregate dead (red top or older) from live stems as early as possible during harvesting. Haul them separately to the mill and store them separately in the yard; 3. Double the sorts: this alternative requires doubling the number of sorts in a typical bin sorter, and adding an in-line moisture meter to identify and separate the dry from the green pieces...|$|R

40|$|This project {{contains}} {{research in}} the disciplines of wood drying and preservation. It first explored two different avenues for possible improvement in the drying stage of sawn timber production and then studied a novel pre-conditioning method for preservative treatment of radiata pine. The first avenue of investigation for improving drying was the sorting the green timber into more uniform <b>charges</b> for <b>drying</b> usina the large and consistent difference between heartwood and sapwood moisture content. The impetus for this arose {{from the results of}} a preliminary mill-based study of moisture content variation within a typical kiln charge of mixed radiata pine heartwood and sapwood. Green density can be quickly and easily determined from scanned board volume and loadcell-derived board weight and was found to be closely correlated to average board MC and heartwood/sapwood content. Green density was a very good predictor of wood % saturation also. Although little used here in Australia, such a sorting system has potential to improve efficiency in the drying and conditioning stages of radiata pine sawn timber production. Pre-drying treatments (i. e. pressure-steaming and pre-steaming) to improve permeability and drying speed in radiata pine were examined as the second avenue for possible improvement in drying efficiency. The effects of these pre-treatments on drying parameters including measured radial permeability were assessed. Pressure-steaming (a preconditioning. method to improve permeability of radiata pine heartwood for preservation) rendered the wood highly susceptible to checking during drying, resulting in severe degrade. Pressure-steaming also appeared to retard drying rates, especially in the sapwood [...] a phenomenon contrary to the significant improvements to permeability found in the wood samples subjected to this pre-treatment. Pre-steaming at 100 C for 4 hours prior to drying was found to be only of marginal benefit to permeability and drying rates, although its use is necessary for drying heart-in studs and reducing early surface checking. The second part of the project tested the application microwave energy as a novel alternative pre-conditioning method to pressure-steaming for preservation treatment of radiata pine. The microwave pre-conditioning caused very rapid drying of the wood (especially the heartwood) and significantly increased the uptake of preservative solution. However, the distribution of preservative was variable compared with that in wood which had been pressure-steam conditioned. Complete and even preservative distribution was achievable only in wood which had been microwave pre-conditioned for longer time periods at high intensity irradiation. These conditions also resulted in severe checking of the wood and excessive use of preservative solution. The effects on the structure of the wood were somewhat different to those of pressure-steaming in that increased permeability and ease of preservative penetration were facilitated by visible checks of various sizes whereas with pressure-steaming, the wood was altered at the microstructural level, by destroying the soft contents of the rays and thereby significantly increasing permeability in the radial direction. The important conclusions from the study were: (a) There is considerable scope for developing and applying simple but effective pre-drying sorting of green sawn radiata pine to generate greater- uniformity in <b>drying</b> <b>charges</b> and better tailor drying schedules to their specific requirements. This would lead to improved drying efficiency and reduced degrade. (b) Contrary to initial expectations, pressure-steaming is a pre-conditioning method suited to preservation but not to drying, as demonstrated by the retarded drying and severe degrade in pressure-steamed wood samples. (c) Microwave pre-conditioning for preservation treatment of radiata pine has considerable advantages over pressure-steaming in terms of rapidity of drying and deserves further consideration and development. The microwave processing conditions used in this study yielded variable results, demonstrating that much further research is required to optimise the microwave processing conditions to better suit radiata pine.
