40|$|Abstract. Most of {{the fatigue}} damage in {{aircraft}} structures {{can be linked}} to the stress concentration arising at the rivet joints. Interference-fit riveting of a flush rivet can form the uniform <b>interference</b> <b>fit.</b> Thanks to the uniform <b>interference</b> <b>fit,</b> large <b>stress</b> concentration can be avoided. The radial deformation, which is directly relative to <b>interference</b> <b>fit,</b> is therefore of prime importance. Parameters associated with a riveting process that directly affect the quality of rivets {{must be taken into account}} to observe the effect on radial deformation at rivet holes. This paper presents an effective variation analysis to calculate radial deformation at rivet holes by assuming that the axial stresses are constant both along the axial and radius of the rivet slug. Firstly, the rivet process model is built before variation analysis. Secondly, theoretical relationships between radial deformations and contact loads are proposed using elasto-plastic analysis. Later, the expressions of the contact loads are given according to geometrical relationships and analysis of deforming forces. Thirdly, an instance made up of the rivet, top sheet and bottom sheet is used to verify the analysis model. The model paves an efficient way to study the deforming law of the riveting press process and build the pre-estimate model of the rivet deformations and the parameter optimization model...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} hoop {{stresses}} in reducing {{cylindrical roller bearing}} fatigue life was determined for various classes of inner ring <b>interference</b> <b>fit.</b> Calculations were performed for up to seven <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> classes for each of ten bearing sizes. Each fit was taken at tightest, average and loosest values within the fit class for RBEC- 5 tolerance, thus requiring 486 separate analyses. The hoop stresses were superimposed on the Hertzian principal stresses created by the applied radial load to calculate roller bearing fatigue life. The method was developed {{through a series of}} equations to calculate the life reduction for cylindrical roller bearings based on <b>interference</b> <b>fit.</b> All calculated lives are for zero initial bearing internal clearance. Any reduction in bearing clearance due to <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> was compensated by increasing the initial (unmounted) clearance. Results are presented as tables and charts of life factors for bearings with light, moderate and heavy loads and <b>interference</b> <b>fits</b> ranging from extremely light to extremely heavy and for bearing accuracy class RBEC 5 (ISO class 5). <b>Interference</b> <b>fits</b> on the inner bearing ring of a cylindrical roller bearing can significantly reduce bearing fatigue life. In general, life factors are smaller (lower life) for bearings running under light load where the unfactored life is highest. The various bearing series within a particular bore size had almost identical <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> life factors for a particular fit. The tightest fit at {{the high end of the}} RBEC- 5 tolerance band defined in ANSI/ABMA shaft fit tables produces a life factor of approximately 0. 40 for an inner-race maximum Hertz stress of 1200 MPa (175 ksi) and a life factor of 0. 60 for an inner-race maximum Hertz stress of 2200 MPa (320 ksi). <b>Interference</b> <b>fits</b> also impact the maximum Hertz stress-life relation...|$|R
40|$|Railway {{wheels are}} secured onto the axle {{by means of}} an <b>interference</b> <b>fit.</b> The wheel is press fitted onto a pre-lubricated axle, and the {{resulting}} <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> induces a contact pressure at the interface. Occasionally railway wheels fail by fatigue, with the initiation point for the failure frequently traced to the <b>interference</b> <b>fit.</b> The aim of this work is to use ultrasonic reflection to non-destructively determine contact conditions in the <b>interference</b> <b>fit.</b> The rough surface contact at the <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> interface behaves like a spring. If the contact pressure is high the interface is conformal with few air gaps, the stiffness is then high and the transmission of an ultrasonic wave is permitted. However, when pressure is low more air gaps exist, interfacial stiffness is then reduced and more of the ultrasound is reflected. Normalised contact pressure was determined from this stiffness. Maps of the interface have been produced which show the contact pressure to peak {{at the edges of the}} fit, and to experience a continuous variation about a mean value elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|The most {{commonly}} reported complications related to cementless hip stems are loosening and thigh pain; {{both of these}} {{have been attributed to}} high levels of relative micromotion at the boneâ€“implant interface due to insufficient primary fixation. Primary fixation is believed by many to rely on achieving a sufficient <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> between the implant and the bone. However, attempting to achieve a high <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> not infrequently leads to femoral canal fracture either intra-operatively or soon after. The appropriate range of diametrical <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> that ensures primary stability without risking femoral fracture is not well understood. In this study, a finite element model was constructed to predict micromotion and, therefore, instability of femoral stems. The model was correlated with an in vitro micromotion experiment carried out on four cadaver femurs. It was confirmed that <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> has a very significant effect on micromotion and ignoring this parameter in an analysis of primary stability is likely to underestimate the stability of the stem. Furthermore, it was predicted that the optimal level of <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> is around 50 Î¼m as this is sufficient to achieve good primary fixation while having a safety factor of 2 against femoral canal fracture. This result is of clinical relevance as it indicates a recommendation for the surgeon {{to err on the side}} of a low <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> rather than risking femoral fracture. ...|$|R

The reduction in the fatigue life is presented as life factors that are applied to the unfactored bearing life.

Occasionally railway axles fail by fatigue, with the initiation point for the failure frequently traced to the <b>interference</b> <b>fit.</b> In this study, the reflection of ultrasound was used to determine contact conditions in the <b>interference</b> <b>fit.</b> It is a non-intrusive technique preserving the mechanics of the contact. The concept is simple; an acoustic wave bounces back from an incomplete interface. The higher the contact load, the more conformal the contact and hence more of the wave will be transmitted. A spring model is used to determine maps of contact stiffness from ultrasonic reflection data. A calibration procedure is then used to determine the pressure. Two types of wheelsets were used for the measurements, both with a hollow axle that was used as an access point for the ultrasonic transducer. The wheels differed in the design of their web sections. Variations were detected in the determined interface pressure profiles, due to both surface roughness effects and discontinuities in the fit geometry. When comparing the two fits, it was found that material removal from the web of the wheel in the second fit reduced the interface pressure distribution...|$|R
