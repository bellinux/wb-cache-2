40|$|The {{likelihood}} of detecting individual discrete sources of cosmic rays {{depends on the}} mean separation between sources. The analysis here derives the minimum separation that makes it likely that the closest source is detectable. For super-GZK energies, detection is signal limited and magnetic fields should not matter. For sub-GZK energies, detection is background limited, and intergalactic magnetic fields enter the analysis through one adjustable parameter. Both super-GZK and sub-GZK results are presented for four different types of sources: steady <b>isotropic</b> <b>sources,</b> steady jet <b>sources,</b> <b>isotropic</b> bursts, and jet bursts.

30|$|On the downside, {{the method}} can suffer from {{so-called}} “ray effects” (Lathrop 1968): {{due to the}} point evaluation in the angular domain, the scalar flux or incident radiation from small <b>isotropic</b> <b>sources</b> may appear star-like with rays emanating from the source into the chosen angular directions (Stone 2007, p. 2 and following). These effects occur especially pronounced in settings with low scattering and absorption, i.e. in optically thin media.|$|R
5000|$|Parabolic reflectors {{are used}} to collect energy from a distant source (for example sound waves or {{incoming}} star light). Since the principles of reflection are reversible, parabolic reflectors {{can also be used}} to focus radiation from an <b>isotropic</b> <b>source</b> into a narrow beam. [...] In optics, parabolic mirrors {{are used to}} gather light in reflecting telescopes and solar furnaces, and project a beam of light in flashlights, searchlights, stage spotlights, and car headlights. In radio, parabolic antennas are used to radiate a narrow beam of radio waves for point-to-point communications in satellite dishes and microwave relay stations, and to locate aircraft, ships, and vehicles in radar sets. In acoustics, parabolic microphones are used to record faraway sounds such as bird calls, in sports reporting, and to eavesdrop on private conversations in espionage and law enforcement.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt {{has long}} been conjectured that {{isotropic}} radiation by a simple coherent source is impossible due to changes in polarization. Though hypothetical, the <b>isotropic</b> <b>source</b> is usually taken as the reference for determining a radiator's gain and directivity. Here, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that an isotropic radiator can be made of a simple and finite source surrounded by electric-field-driven LC resonator metamaterials designed by space manipulation. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we show the first <b>isotropic</b> <b>source</b> with omnidirectional radiation from a dipole source (applicable to all distributed sources), which can open up several possibilities in axion electrodynamics, optical illusion, novel transformation-optic devices, wireless communication, and antenna engineering. Owing to the electric-field-driven LC resonator realization scheme, this principle can be readily applied to higher frequency regimes where magnetism is usually not present...|$|E

5000|$|In our model, we are {{ignoring}} initial specular reflectance {{associated with}} entering a medium {{that is not}} refractive index matched. With this in mind, we simply need to set the initial position of the photon packet {{as well as the}} initial direction. It is convenient to use a global coordinate system. We will use three Cartesian coordinates to determine position, along with three direction cosines to determine the direction of propagation. The initial start conditions will vary based on application, however for a pencil beam initialized at the origin, we can set the initial position and direction cosines as follows (<b>isotropic</b> <b>sources</b> can easily be modeled by randomizing the initial direction of each packet): ...|$|R

A typical configuration using circular antenna arrays of <b>isotropic</b> <b>sources</b> to transmit and receive OAM waves is considered. We point out issues when usual assumptions are made to express the link budget. Then, we propose to express the power budget associated with OAM in an elementary MIMO matrix approach. Using a single mode communication configuration, some basic numerical calculations and case studies based on the developed formulations can then be led and discussed, highlighting some intrinsic limitations. Indeed, the asymptotic behavior of the link budget leads to question the concepts of gain and propagation losses...|$|R

30|$|Previously, a {{combination}} of spherical sources in an elastic and homogeneous half-space (Mogi 1958) {{was applied to the}} observed deformation in and around Sakurajima (e.g., Iguchi et al. 2013; Yamamoto et al. 2013; Hotta et al. 2016).

Conversely, the August 2015 intrusion event was a dike intrusion in a different location to the preexisting reservoirs.|$|R
