40|$|Motivated by {{studies on}} the {{dynamics}} of heterogeneously interacting systems in neocortical neural networks, we studied heterogeneously-coupled chaotic systems. We used information-theoretic measures to investigate <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> information flow in heterogeneously coupled Rossler systems, which we selected as a typical chaotic system. In bi-directionally coupled systems, spontaneous and irregular switchings of the phase difference between two chaotic oscillators were observed.

When two further oscillatory inputs are added to the coupled systems, this system dynamically selects one of the two inputs by synchronizing, selection depending on the internal phase differences between the two systems.

40|$|A {{technique}} is presented for jointly optimizing the signaling {{in the two}} <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> on a twisted pair communications channel. It is then applied to twisted pair channel models with monotonic channel response and crosstalk transfer functions. While the signaling strategy {{presented in this paper}} can achieve only a lower bound on the true channel capacity, it is a significant improvement over existing signaling schemes. In particular, in contrast with existing schemes, the maximum information rate for the joint signaling strategy increases without bound as the SNR approaches infinity. It is also shown through numerical results that the proposed signaling strategy generalizes naturally to more practical non-monotonic twisted pair channel models incorporating bridge taps and other non-idealities. Finally, the form of the optimal signaling strategy suggests a relatively straightforward implementation using multicarrier modulation...|$|R

50|$|Unlike with {{ordinary}} gear trains, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> (input shaft vs output shaft) is not reversible when using large reduction ratios, {{due to the}} greater friction involved between the worm and worm-wheel, when usually a single start (one spiral) worm is used.

40|$|The {{millimeter}} wave frequencies (roughly above 10 GHz) {{offer the}} availability of massive bandwidth to greatly increase the capacity of fifth generation (5 G) cellular wireless systems.

40|$|Previous {{research}} in wireless ad hoc networks typically assumes {{the use of}} omnidirectional antennas at all nodes. With omnidirectional antennas, while two nodes are communicating using a given channel, MAC protocols such as IEEE 802. 11 require all other nodes in the vicinity to stay silent. With directional antennas, two pairs of nodes located in each other’s vicinity may potentially communicate simultaneously, depending on the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> This can increase spatial reuse of the wireless channel. In addition, the higher gain of directional antennas allows a node to communicate with other nodes located far away, implying that messages could be delivered to the destination in fewer hops. In this paper, we propose a MAC protocol that exploits the characteristics of directional antennas. Our design focuses on using multi-hop RTSs to establish links between distant nodes, and then transmit CTS, DATA and ACK over a single hop. Results show that our directional MAC protocol can perform better than IEEE 802. 11, although {{we find that the}} performance is dependent on the topology configuration and the flow patterns in the system...|$|R

50|$|It {{can be seen}} in Simone Prodenzani's Liber Saporecti (or Il Saporetto), {{published}} 1415, {{which describes}} music and dance at an imaginary court, and from other works, that in the early 15th century the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of dance forms was from the popular folk dances of the towns and countryside to the courts of the nobility. But a new attitude appears at court which elevates dance to an art form. In the Medieval period, no writer describes dance steps or figures, it being assumed that everyone knew how to dance. By the early Renaissance the simple circle and chain dances of the earlier centuries still exist - there are references to the round dance (ridda) and dancing in circles as late as the early 16th century in Straparola's Le piacevoli notti (The Facetious Nights of Straparola). But we also find that couple dances and mimetic elements now appear and formal choreographies emerge for the first time. This new Art of the Dance can especially be seen at the major courts of Milan, Padua, Venice, Florence, Bologna, Pesaro, Urbino and Naples.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{current debate}} over {{extending}} inheritance and its evolutionary impact {{has focused on}} adding new categories of non-genetic factors to the classical <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> DNA, and on trying to redefine inheritance. Transmitted factors have been mainly characterized by their <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> (vertical, hori- zontal, or both) {{and the way they}} store variations. In this paper, we leave aside the issue of defining inheritance. We rather try to build an evolutionary conceptual framework that allows for tracing most, if not all forms <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> and makes sense of their different tempos and modes. We discuss three key distinctions that should in particular be the targets of theoretical and empirical investigation, and try to assess the interplay among them and evolutionary dynamics. We distinguish two channels <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> (channel 1 and channel 2), two measurements of the temporal dynamics <b>of</b> <b>transmission,</b> respectively across and within generations (durability and residency), and two types of transmitted factors according to their evolutionary relevance (selectively relevant and neutral stable factors). By imple- menting these three distinctions we can then map different forms <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> over a continuous space describing the combination of their varying dynamical features. While our aim is not to provide yet another model of inheritance, putting together these distinctions and crossing them, we manage to offer an inclusive conceptual framework <b>of</b> <b>transmission,</b> grounded in empirical observation, and coherent with evolutionary theory. This interestingly opens possibilities for quali- tative and quantitative analyses, and is a necessary step, we argue, in order to question the interplay between the dynamics of evolution and the dynamics of multiple forms <b>of</b> <b>transmission...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} link scheduling in a sensor network employing a TDMA MAC protocol. Our link scheduling algorithm involves two phases. In the first phase, we assign a color to each edge in the network such that no two edges incident on the same node are assigned the same color. We propose a distributed edge coloring algorithm that needs at most (δ+ 1) colors, where δ is the maximum degree of the graph. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first distributed algorithm that can edge color a graph with at most (δ + 1) colors. In the second phase, we map each color to a unique timeslot and attempt to identify a <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> along each edge such that the hidden terminal and the exposed terminal problems are avoided. Next, considering topologies for which a feasible solution does not exist, we obtain a <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> for each edge using additional timeslots, if necessary. Finally, we show that reversing the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> along every edge leads to another feasible <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> Using both the transmission assignments we obtain a TDMA MAC schedule which enables two-way communication between every pair of neighbors. For acyclic topologies, we show that at most 2 (δ + 1) timeslots are required. Through simulations we show that for sparse graphs with cycles the number of timeslots assigned is close to 2 (δ + 1) ...|$|E
