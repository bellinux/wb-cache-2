40|$|Speed in aquatic {{locomotion}} {{is determined}} by stroke distance and stroke rate, {{but it does not}} always follow that an increase instroke rate will lead to an increase in speed. Kleshnev (2006) developed a method to evaluate the relationship between speedand stroke rate during rowing- the <b>effective</b> work per <b>stroke.</b> In this case study, the <b>effective</b> work per <b>stroke</b> was determinedfor a male world-class 100 -m breaststroke swimmer for seven races in major championships and compared between: each ofthe seven races; each quarter within each race; and the best swims of this case study and seven other world-class swimmers. The <b>effective</b> work per <b>stroke</b> was related to race performance, with the fastest race having the highest effective work perstroke and lowest stroke rate, with slower races having low effectiveness and high stroke rate (R²= 0. 85). The <b>effective</b> workper <b>stroke</b> was reduced in a race as the swimmer fatigued. The within-race standard deviation of effectiveness was lower infast swims (R²= 0. 84). This analysis has identified some characteristics of fast swimming: high effectiveness, optimal strokerate, and a flat effectiveness profile. Training and racing strategies can now be devised to improve performance by increasingthe sensitivity of assessment of strengths and weaknesses in individuals...|$|R
40|$|Airway {{epithelial}} cilia {{protect the}} mammalian respiratory system from harmful inhaled materials {{by providing the}} force necessary for effective mucociliary clearance. Ciliary beating is asymmetric, composed of clearly distinguished <b>effective</b> and recovery <b>strokes.</b> Neither the importance of nor the essential components responsible for the beating asymmetry has been directly elucidated. We report here that the beating asymmetry is crucial for ciliary function and requires tubulin glutamylation, a unique posttranslational modification that is highly abundant in cilia. WT murine tracheal cilia have an axoneme-intrinsic structural curvature that points {{in the direction of}} <b>effective</b> <b>strokes.</b> The axonemal curvature was lost in tracheal cilia from mice with knockout of a tubulin glutamylation-performing enzyme, tubulin tyrosine ligase-like protein 1. Along with the loss of axonemal curvature, the axonemes and tracheal epithelial cilia from these knockout (KO) mice lost beating asymmetry. The loss of beating asymmetry resulted in a reduction of cilia-generated fluid flow in trachea from the KO mice. The KO mice displayed a significant accumulation of mucus in the nasal cavity, and also emitted frequent coughing- or sneezing-like noises. Thus, the beating asymmetry is important for airway ciliary function. Our find-ings provide evidence that tubulin glutamylation is essential for ciliary function through the regulation of beating asymmetry, and provides insight into the molecular basis underlying the beating asymmetry...|$|R

40|$|Stroke {{patients}} recover {{more effectively}} {{when they are}} rehabilitated with bimanual movement rather than with unimanual movement; however, it remains unclear why bimanual movement is more <b>effective</b> for <b>stroke</b> recovery. Using a computational model of stroke recovery, {{this study suggests that}} bimanual movement facilitates the reorganization of a damaged motor cortex because this movement induces rotations in the preferred directions (PDs) of motor cortex neurons. Although the tuning curves of these neurons differ during unimanual and bimanual movement, changes in PD, but not changes in modulation depth, facilitate such reorganization. In addition, this reorganization was facilitated only when encoding PDs are rotated, but decoding PDs are not rotated. Bimanual movement facilitates reorganization because this movement changes neural activities through inter-hemispheric inhibition without changing cortical-spinal-muscle connections. Furthermore, stronger inter-hemispheric inhibition between motor cortices results in more effective reorganization. Thus, this study suggests that bimanual movement is <b>effective</b> for <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation because this movement rotates the encoding PDs of motor cortex neurons...|$|R

5000|$|The {{critic for}} the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the play:Exemplified his Seymour's gift for finding {{subjects}} of universal potential combined with a central relevance to Australian occupations. His [...] "The One Day of the Year" [...] memorably explored the dramatic possibilities of Anac Day. [...] "The Runner" [...] promised well by taking as its central character a young Australian athlete rigorously trained to achieve fame far outdistancing his personal readiness for it. Some of the incidentals of his career (though not its particular outcome) sounded familiar enough: the combination of cross-country running and pseudo-Greek idealism, the jargon about a philosophy of running" [...] and the participation of [...] "the whole man," [...] {{not to mention the}} intervention of an American promoter waving large sums of money. Clearly there was opportunity here either for satire or for the compassionate treatment of an emotionally undernourished boy who has obediently turned himself into a running machine. But the playwright, or his producer, Brett Porter, seeme to have blurred these aims {{for the sake of a}} rather flabby compromise that was neither stingingly enjoyable nor a pathetic character study of any depth. The scenes in which Lew Luton's heavily truculent runner decided to put his career as a champion before the claims of his girlfriend, family and job, seemed wholly mechanical. The dialogue itself sounded well below the standards of naturalistic invention that Seymour might bring to it if he rewrote it now. Even Reg Lye as the long-suffering father could make little of a part that seemed to consist entirely of lines like [...] "Now, now mother," [...] and [...] "When are you going to settle down, son."

40|$|ABSTRACT The Chlamydomonas mutant vfl- 3 lacks normal {{striated}} {{fibers and}} microtubular rootlets. Although the flagella beat vigorously, the cells rarely display effective forward swimming. High speed cinephotomicrography reveals that flagellar waveform, frequency, and beat synchrony {{are similar to}} those of wild-type cells, indicating that neither striated fibers nor microtubular rootlets are required for initiation or synchronization of flagellar motion. However, in contrast to wild type, the <b>effective</b> <b>strokes</b> of the flagella of vfl- 3 may occur in virtually any direction. Although the direction of beat varies between cells, it was not observed to vary for a given flagellum during periods of filming lasting up to several thousand beat cycles, indicating that the flagella are not free to rotate in the mature cell. Structural polarity markers in the proximal portion of each flagellum show that the flagella of the mutant have an altered rotational orientation consistent with their altered direction of beat. This implies that the variable direction of beat is not due to a defect in the intrinsic polarity of the axoneme, and that in wild-type cells the striated fibers and/or associated structures are important in establishing or maintaining the correct rotational orientation of the basal bodies to ensure that the inherent functional polarity of the flagellum results in effective cellular movement. As in wil...|$|R
40|$|Death-associated {{protein kinase}} 1 (DAPK 1) is a Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent kinase 1 and plays roles in several modes of cell death in ischemic stroke. 2, 3 To define a promis-ing target {{that allows a}} delayed {{intervention}} being clinically <b>effective</b> against <b>stroke,</b> we searched for cell death signals downstream of DAPK 1. We identified a direct binding of DAPK 1 to a DNA-binding motif (DM) of the tumor suppres-sor protein p 53 (p 53 DM), which {{is known as a}} transcriptional regulator of genes that control cell necrosis and apoptosis. 4 – 7 We thus synthesized a membrane-permeable p 53 DM peptide consisting of amino acid 271 to 282 (Tat-p 53 DM) that specifi-cally blocked DAPK 1 –p 53 interaction. 3 Activation of DAPK 1 phosphorylates p 53 at serine- 23 (pS 23) in the cultured cortical neurons. 3 In the nucleus, the pS 23 induces expression of the proapoptotic genes such as Bax, whereas in the mitochondrial matrix, the pS 23 interacts with a necrotic factor of cyclophilin D. Application of Tat-p 53 DM effectively blocks these dual pathways of the pS 23 actions in the cortical cultures in vitro, 3 suggesting that Tat-p 53 DM could be clinically <b>effective</b> against <b>stroke.</b> To test this possibility, here we validated the therapeutic effects of Tat-p 53 DM in vivo in a mouse model with stroke...|$|R

Using a tagged allele, we cloned the VFL 1 gene that encodes a protein of 128 kD with five leucine-rich repeat sequences near the NH 2 terminus and a large α-helical–coiled coil domain at the COOH terminus. An epitope-tagged gene construct rescued the mutant phenotype and expressed a tagged protein (Vfl 1 p) that copurified with basal body flagellar apparatuses. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that Vfl 1 p localized with basal bodies and probasal bodies. Immunogold labeling localized Vfl 1 p inside the lumen of the basal body at the distal end.

40|$|The sensory {{channels}} in the olfactory organs of modern {{sharks and rays}} (neoselachians) are lined with fields of non-sensory cilia. Using evidence from 31 species of neoselachian, this review attempts to identify the fluid - water or mucus - propelled by these cilia. The apparently common structure of the olfactory epithelium in these 31 diverse species implies that the cilia perform the same function and that this function is therefore independent of neoselachian phylogeny, lifestyle, gross nasal anatomy and the principal means by which water is circulated through the single major olfactory channel. On balance, {{the evidence suggests that}} the cilia propel mucus. This evidence includes short cilia, the presence (or absence) of water currents in the nasal region, mucociliary interactions, poor ciliary alignment, rare or absent interciliary connections, deep ciliary anchorages and the observation of cilia performing <b>effective</b> <b>strokes.</b> The short cilia are particularly telling. Goblet cells within and {{on the edge of the}} sensory epithelium are likely to be the source of any mucus layer. If the cilia of the neoselachian olfactory epithelium do propel mucus, there are three crucial implications. First, given that ciliary function is potentially independent of neoselachian phylogeny, it is possible that cilia in all neoselachians propel mucus. Second, a large part of the neoselachian olfactory organ must be actively involved in protecting the sensory epithelium from damage. Third, flow of water through the sensory channels must be driven by flow of water through the major olfactory channel...|$|R
