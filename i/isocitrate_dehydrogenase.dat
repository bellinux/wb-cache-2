25|$|The <b>Isocitrate</b> <b>Dehydrogenase</b> (IDH) enzyme {{structure}} in Escherichia coli {{was the first}} structure to be elucidated and understood. Since then, the Escherichia coli IDH structure {{has been used by}} most researchers to make comparisons to other <b>isocitrate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> enzymes. There is much detailed knowledge about this bacterial enzyme, and it has been found that most isocitrate dehydrogenases are similar in structure and therefore also in function. This similarity of structure and function gives a {{reason to believe that the}} structures are conserved as well as the amino acids. Therefore, the active sites amongst most prokaryotic <b>isocitrate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> enzymes should be conserved as well, which is observed throughout many studies done on prokaryotic enzymes. Eukaryotic <b>isocitrate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> enzymes on the other hand, have not been fully discovered yet.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{citric acid}} cycle, isocitrate, {{produced}} from the isomerization of citrate, undergoes both oxidation and decarboxylation. Using the enzyme <b>isocitrate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> (IDH), isocitrate is held within its active site by surrounding arginine, tyrosine, asparagine, serine, threonine, and aspartic acid amino acids. The first box shows the overall <b>isocitrate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> reaction. The reactants necessary for this enzyme mechanism to work are isocitrate, NAD+/NADP+, and Mn2+ or Mg2+.

40|$|Of the two NADP-linked <b>isocitrate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> in Acinetobacter lwoffi the higher-molecular-weight form, isoenzyme-II, is {{reversibly}} stimulated sixfold by low {{concentrations of}} glyoxylate or pyruvate.

Other changes brought about by glyoxylate or pyruvate include a shift in the pH optimum for activity and an increased stability to inactivation by heat or urea. Mixtures of glyoxylate plus oxaloacetate, known to inhibit <b>isocitrate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> from other organisms, produce inhibition of both A. lowffi isoenzymes, and do not reflect the stimulatory specificity of glyoxylate for isoenzyme-II. Isoenzyme-II is also stimulated by AMP and ADP, but the activation by glyoxylate or pyruvate is shown to be quite independent of the adenylate activation. Differential desensitization of the enzyme by urea to the two types of activator further supports the view that the enzyme possesses two distinct allosteric regulatory sites.

Because the incidence of IDH1/2 mutations increases as the disease malignancy increases, these findings together suggest that IDH1/2 mutations are important drivers of progression of MDS to a more malignant disease state.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{mutations}} in the <b>isocitrate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> gene IDH1 {{have been found}} in several brain tumors including astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma multiforme, with mutations found in nearly all cases of secondary glioblastomas, which develop from lower-grade gliomas, but rarely in primary high-grade glioblastoma multiforme. Patients whose tumor had an IDH1 mutation had longer survival. Furthermore, mutations of IDH2 and IDH1 were found in up to 20% of cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations are known to produce (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate from alpha-ketoglutarate. (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates to very high concentrations which inhibits the function of enzymes that are dependent on alpha-ketoglutarate. This leads to a hypermethylated state of DNA and histones, which results in different gene expression that can activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor-suppressor genes. Ultimately, this may lead to the types of cancer described above. Somatic mosaic mutations of this gene have also been found associated to Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome.|$|E

The affinities of mitochondrial and cytosolic ICDH enzymes to substrates and inhibitors were determined on partially purified preparations in forward and reverse directions. From the kinetic data, it follows that NADP+- and NAD+-dependent <b>isocitrate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> in mitochondria represent a system strongly responding to the intramitochondrial NADPH and NADH levels. The NADPH, NADP+, NADH and NAD+ concentrations were determined by subcellular fractionation of pea leaf protoplasts using membrane filtration in mitochondria and cytosol in darkness and in the light under saturating and limiting CO 2 conditions. The cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio was about 1 and almost constant both in darkness and in the light. In mitochondria, the NADPH/NADP ratio was low in darkness (0. 2) and increased in the light, reaching 3 in limiting CO 2 conditions compared to 1 in saturating CO 2. At high reduction levels of NADP and NAD observed at limiting CO 2 in the light, i. e. when photorespiratory glycine is the main mitochondrial substrate, isocitrate oxidation in mitochondria will be suppressed and citrate will be transported to the cytosol (‘citrate valve’), where the cytosolic NADP-ICDH supplies 2 -oxoglutarate for the photorespiratory ammonia refixation...|$|R

25|$|Fatty acids {{are broken}} down to acetyl-CoA {{by means of}} beta {{oxidation}} inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, {{but also in the}} reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO2 in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by <b>isocitrate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose.|$|E
