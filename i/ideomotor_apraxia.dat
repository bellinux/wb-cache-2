We aimed to investigate the difference between AD, subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients by means of <b>ideomotor</b> limb <b>apraxia</b> frequency and severity. Ninety-six AD, 72 SVaD, and 84 MCI patients were assessed with the mini-mental status examination (MMSE), clinical dementia rating (CDR) and the apraxia screening test of TULIA (AST). Apraxia was significantly more frequent in the AD patients (32. 3 %) than in both of the SVaD (16. 7 %) and MCI (4. 8 %) patients. The frequency of apraxia was also significantly higher in SVaD patients than in MCI patients. AD patients had significantly lower apraxia scores than both SVaD and MCI patients. In addition, a significant difference was found between SVaD and MCI patients in terms of apraxia scores. These results suggest that the widespread belief of the association between apraxia and cortical dementias is not exactly correct. The significant difference between both of the dementia groups and the MCI patients suggests that the absence of apraxia can be an indicator for MCI diagnosis.

The underlying pathology varies between corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimer’s disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration sometimes {{in association with}} GRN mutations. A 61 -year-old male underwent neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, MRI, and HMPAO-SPECT at our medical centre. After his death {{at the age of}} 63, brain autopsy, genetic screening and mRNA expression analysis were performed. The patient presented with slow progressive walking disabilities, non-fluent language problems, behavioural changes and forgetfulness. His family history was negative. He had primitive reflexes, rigidity of his arms and postural instability. Later in the disease course he developed dystonia of his left leg, pathological crying, mutism and dysphagia. Neuropsychological assessment revealed prominent <b>ideomotor</b> and ideational <b>apraxia,</b> executive dysfunction, non-fluent aphasia and memory deficits. Neuroimaging showed symmetrical predominant frontoparietal atrophy and hypoperfusion. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) -TDP type 3 pathology was found at autopsy. GRN sequencing revealed a novel frameshift mutation c. 314 dup, p. Cys 105 fs and GRN mRNA levels showed a 50 % decrease. We found a novel GRN mutation in a patient with an atypical (CBS) presentation with symmetric neuroimaging findings.

5000|$|<b>Ideomotor</b> <b>Apraxia,</b> often IMA, is a {{neurological}} disorder {{characterized by the}} inability to correctly imitate hand gestures and voluntarily mime tool use, e.g. pretend to brush one's hair. The ability to spontaneously use tools, such as brushing one's hair in the morning without being instructed to do so, may remain intact, but is often lost. The general concept of apraxia and the classification of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> were developed in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries {{by the work of}} Hugo Liepmann, Adolph Kussmaul, Arnold Pick, Paul Flechsig, Hermann Munk, Carl Nothnagel, Theodor Meynert, and linguist Heymann Steinthal, among others. <b>Ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> was classified as [...] "ideo-kinetic apraxia" [...] by Liepmann due to the apparent dissociation of the idea of the action with its execution. The classifications of the various subtypes are not well defined at present, however, owing to issues of diagnosis and pathophysiology. <b>Ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> is hypothesized to result from a disruption of the system that relates stored tool use and gesture information with the state of the body to produce the proper motor output. This system is thought {{to be related to the}} areas of the brain most often seen to be damaged when <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> is present: the left parietal lobe and the premotor cortex. Little can be done at present to reverse the motor deficit seen in <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia,</b> although the extent of dysfunction it induces is not entirely clear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} cause of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> is a {{unilateral}} ischemic lesion to the brain, which is damage to one hemisphere of the brain due to a disruption of the blood supply, as in a stroke. There are a variety of brain areas where lesions have been correlated to <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> Initially it was believed that damage to the subcortical white matter tracts, the axons that extend down from the cells bodies in the cerebral cortex, was the main area responsible for this form of apraxia. Lesions to the basal ganglia may also be responsible, although there is considerable debate as to whether damage to the basal ganglia alone would be sufficient to induce apraxia. Lesions to these lower brain structures has not, however, been shown to be more prevalent in apraxic patients. In fact, these types of lesions are more common in nonapraxic patients. The lesions most associated with <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> are to the left parietal and premotor areas. Patients with lesions to the supplementary motor area have also presented with <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> [...] Lesions to the corpus callosum can also induce apraxic-like symptoms, with varying effects on the two hands, although this has not been thoroughly studied. In addition to ischemic lesions to the brain, <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> has also been seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy.|$|E
50|$|Callosal {{disconnection}} {{syndrome is}} characterized by left <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> and left-hand agraphia and/or tactile anomia, and is relatively rare.|$|E
50|$|Apraxic {{agraphia}} with <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> {{is typically}} caused by {{damage to the}} superior parietal lobe (where graphomotor plans are stored) or the premotor cortex (where the plans are converted into motor commands). Additionally, some individuals with cerebellar lesions (more typically associated with non-apraxic motor dysfunction) develop apraxic agraphia. Apraxic agraphia without <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> {{may be caused by}} damage to either of the parietal lobes, the dominant frontal lobe, or to the dominant thalamus.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{defining}} symptoms of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> is {{the inability to}} pantomime tool use. As an example, if a normal individual were handed a comb and instructed to pretend to brush his hair, he would grasp the comb properly and pass it through his hair. If this were repeated in a patient with <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia,</b> the patient may move the comb in big circles around his head, hold it upside-down, or perhaps try and brush his teeth with it. The error may also be temporal in nature, such as brushing exceedingly slowly. The other characteristic symptom of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> is the inability to imitate hand gestures, meaningless or meaningful, on request; a meaningless hand gesture is something like having someone make a ninety-degree angle with his thumb and placing it under his nose, with {{his hand in the}} plane of his face. This gesture has no meaning attached to it. In contrast, a meaningful gesture is something like saluting or waving goodbye. An important distinction here is that all of the above refer to actions that are consciously and voluntarily initiated. That is to say that a person is specifically asked to either imitate what someone else is doing or is given verbal instructions, such as [...] "wave goodbye." [...] People suffering from <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> will know what they are supposed to do, e.g. they will know to wave goodbye and what their arm and hand should do to accomplish it, but will be unable to execute the motion correctly. This voluntary type of action is distinct from spontaneous actions. <b>Ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> patients may still retain the ability to perform spontaneous motions; if someone they know leaves the room, for instance, {{they may be able to}} wave goodbye to that person, despite being unable to do so at request. The ability to perform this sort of spontaneous action is not always retained, however; some sufferers lose this capability, as well. The recognition of meaningful gestures, e.g. understanding what waving goodbye means when it is seen, seems to be unaffected by <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> It has also been shown that <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> sufferers may have some deficits in general spontaneous movements. Apraxia patients appear to be unable to tap their fingers as quickly as a control group, with a lower maximum tapping rate correlated with more severe apraxia. It has also been demonstrated that apraxic patients are slower to point at a target light when they do not have sight of their hand as compared with healthy patients under the same conditions. The two groups did not differ when they could see their hands. The speed and accuracy of grasping objects also appears unaffected by <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> Patients suffering from <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> appear to be much more reliant on visual input when conducting movements then nonapraxic individuals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> (IMA) impinges on one's {{ability to}} carry out common, {{familiar}} actions on command, such as waving goodbye. Persons with IMA exhibit a loss of {{ability to carry}} out motor movements, and may show errors in how they hold and move the tool in attempting the correct function.|$|E
50|$|An {{example is}} commissural {{disconnect}} in adults which usually results from surgical intervention, tumor, or interruption {{of the blood}} supply to the corpus callosum or the immediately adjacent structures. Callosal disconnection syndrome is characterized by left <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> and left-hand agraphia and/or tactile anomia, and is relatively rare.|$|E
50|$|There {{is no one}} {{definitive}} test for ideomotor apraxia; there are several that are used clinically to make an <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> diagnosis. The criteria for a diagnosis are not entirely conserved among clinicians, for apraxia in general or distinguishing subtypes. Almost all the tests laid out here that enable a diagnosis of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> share a common feature: assessment {{of the ability to}} imitate gestures. A test developed by Georg Goldenberg uses imitation assessment of 10 gestures. The tester demonstrates the gesture to the patient and rates him on how whether the gesture was correctly imitated. If the first attempt to imitate the gesture was unsuccessful, the gesture is presented a second time; a higher score is given for correct imitation on the first trial, then for the second, and the lowest score is for not correctly imitating the gesture. The gestures used here are all meaningless, such as placing the hand flat {{on the top of the}} head or flat outward with the fingers towards the ear. This test is specifically designed for <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> The main variation from this is in the type and number of gestures used. One test uses twenty-four movements with three trials for each and a trial-based scoring system similar to the Goldenberg protocol. The gestures here are also copied by the patient from the tester and are divided into finger movements, e.g. making a scissor movement with the forefinger and middle finger, and hand and arm movements, e.g. doing a salute. This protocol combines meaningful and meaningless gestures. Another test uses five meaningful gestures, such as waving goodbye or scratching your head and five meaningless gestures. Additional differences in this test are a verbal command to initiate the movement and it distinguishes between accurate performance and inaccurate but recognizable performance. One test utilizes tools, including a hammer and a key, with both a verbal command to use the tools and the patient copying the tester's demonstrated use of the tools. These tests have been shown to be individually unreliable, with considerable variability between the diagnoses delivered by each. If a battery of tests is used, however, the reliability and validity may be improved. It is also highly advisable to include assessments of how the patient performs activities in daily life. One of the newer tests that has been developed may provide greater reliability without relying on a multitude of tests. It combines three types of tool use with imitation of gestures. The tool use section includes having the patient pantomime use with no tool present, with visual contact with the tool, and finally with tactile contact with the tool. This test screens for ideational and <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia,</b> with the second portion aimed specifically at <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> One study showed great potential for this test, but further studies are needed to reproduce these results before this can be said with confidence. This disorder often occurs with other degenerative neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's Disease. These comorbidities can make it difficult to pick out the specific features of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> The important point in distinguishing <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> is that basic motor control is intact; it is a high level dysfunction involving tool use and gesturing. Additionally, clinicians must be careful to exclude aphasia as a possible diagnosis, as, in the tests involving verbal command, an aphasic patient could fail to perform a task properly because they do not understand what the directions are.|$|E
50|$|Buccofacial or {{orofacial}} apraxia: Non-verbal oral or buccofacial <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> {{resulting in}} difficulty carrying out {{movements of the}} face on demand. For example, an inability to lick one's lips or whistle. This is an ability to carry out any volitional movements of the tongue, cheeks, lips, pharynx, or larynx on command.|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{complexity}} of the medical problems facing <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> patients, as they are usually suffering from a multitude of other problems, it is difficult to ascertain the impact that it has on their ability to function independently. Deficits due to Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease could very well be sufficient to mask or make irrelevant difficulties arising from the apraxia. Some studies have shown <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> to independently diminish the patient's ability to function on their own. [...] The general consensus seems to be that <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> does {{have a negative impact on}} independence in that it can reduce an individual's ability to manipulate objects, as well as diminishing the capacity for mechanical problem solving, owing to the inability to access information about how familiar parts of the unfamiliar system function. A small subset of patients has been known to spontaneously recover from apraxia; this is rare, however. One possible hope is the phenomenon of hemispheric shift, where functions normally performed by one hemisphere can shift to the other in the event that the first is damaged. This seems to necessitate, however, that some portion of the function is associated with the other hemisphere to begin with. There is dispute over whether the right hemisphere of the cortex is involved at all in the praxis system, as some evidence from patients with severed corpus callosums indicates it may not be.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there is}} little {{that can be done}} to {{substantially}} reverse the effects of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia,</b> Occupational Therapy can be effective in helping patients regain some functional control. Sharing the same approach in treating ideational apraxia, this is achieved by breaking a daily task (e.g. combing hair) into separate components and teaching each distinct component individually. [...] With ample repetition, proficiency in these movements can be acquired and should eventually be combined to create a single pattern of movement.|$|E
5000|$|Apraxic {{agraphia}} is the {{impairment in}} written language production associated with {{disruption of the}} motor system. It results in distorted, slow, effortful, incomplete, and/or imprecise letter formation. Though written letters are often so poorly formed that they are almost illegible, the ability to spell aloud is often retained. This form of agraphia is caused specifically by a loss of specialized motor plans {{for the formation of}} letters and not by any dysfunction affecting the writing hand. Apraxic agraphia may present with or without <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> Paralysis, chorea, Parkinson's disease (micrographia), and dystonia (writer's cramp) are motor disorders commonly associated with agraphia.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{underlying}} cause of the disorder is damage to the brain, at present ideational apraxia is not reversible. However, Occupational or Physical Therapy {{may be able to}} slow the progression and help patients regain some functional control, with the treatment approach being {{the same as that of}} <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> [...] Some recovery may occur in younger patients after stroke, because brain plasticity may allow the functions of these damaged regions to be remapped. As patients develop new behaviors to cope with their apraxia, their brain's functioning neurons may take on some of the functions of the dead or damaged regions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prevailing}} hypothesis for the pathophysiology of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> is {{that the}} various brain lesions associated with the disorder somehow disrupt portions of the praxis system. The praxis system is the brain regions {{that are involved in}} taking processed sensory input, accessing of stored information about tools and gestures, and translating these into a motor output. Buxbaum et al. have proposed that the praxis system involves three distinct parts: stored gesture representations, stored tool knowledge, and a [...] "dynamic body schema." [...] The first two store information about the representation of gestures in the brain and the characteristic movements of tools. The body schema is a brain model of the body and its position in space. The praxis system relates the stored information about a movement type to how the dynamic, i.e. changing, body representation varies as the movement progresses. It is still not clear how this system maps out onto the brain itself, although some research has given indications to possible locations for certain portions. The dynamic body schema has been suggested to be localized in the superior posterior parietal cortex. There is also evidence that the inferior parietal lobule may be the locus for storage of the characteristic movements of a tool. This area showed inverse activation to the cerebellum in a study of tool use and tool mime. If the connections between these areas become severed, the praxis system would be disrupted, possibly resulting in the symptoms observed in <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Apraxia is {{most often}} due to a lesion located in the {{dominant}} (usually left) hemisphere of the brain, typically in the frontal and parietal lobes. Lesions {{may be due to}} stroke, acquired brain injuries, or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease. It is also possible for apraxia to be caused by lesions {{in other areas of the}} brain including the non-dominant (usually right) hemisphere. <b>Ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> is typically due to a decrease in blood flow to the dominant hemisphere of the brain and particularly the parietal and premotor areas. It is frequently seen in patients with corticobasal degeneration.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> (IMA), {{although}} clearly {{present in}} CBD, often manifests atypically {{due to the}} additional presence of bradykinesia and rigidity in those individuals exhibiting the disorders. The IMA symptom in CBD {{is characterized by the}} inability to repeat or mimic particular movements (whether significant or random) both with or without the implementation of objects. This form of IMA is present in the hands and arms, while IMA in the lower extremities may cause problems with walking. Those with CBD that exhibit IMA may appear to have trouble initiating walking, as the foot may appear to be fixed to floor. This can cause stumbling and difficulties in maintaining balance. [...] IMA is associated with deterioration in the premotor cortex, parietal association areas, connecting white matter tracts, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Some individuals with CBD exhibit limb-kinetic apraxia, which involves dysfunction of more fine motor movements often performed by the hands and fingers.|$|E
5000|$|More recently, Geschwind et al. {{described}} {{the case of}} a woman who suffered severe coronary heart disease. One week after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, she noticed that her left hand started to [...] "live a life of its own". It would unbutton her gown, try to choke her while asleep and would automatically fight with the right hand to answer the phone. She had to physically restrain the affected hand with the right hand to prevent injury, a behavior which has been termed [...] "self-restriction". The left hand also showed signs of severe <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> It was able to mimic actions but only with the help of mirror movements executed by the right hand (enabling synkinesis). Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Geschwind et al. found damage to the posterior half of the callosal body, sparing the anterior half and the splenium extending slightly into the white matter underlying the right cingulate cortex.|$|E
5000|$|We {{are capable}} of imitating movements, actions, skills, behaviors, gestures, pantomimes, mimics, vocalizations, sounds, speech, etc. {{and that we have}} {{particular}} [...] "imitation systems" [...] in the brain is old neurological knowledge dating back to Hugo Karl Liepmann. Liepmann's model 1908 [...] "Das hierarchische Modell der Handlungsplanung" [...] (the hierarchical model of action planning) is still valid. On studying the cerebral localization of function, Liepmann postulated that planned or commanded actions were prepared in the parietal lobe of the brain's dominant hemisphere, and also frontally. His most important pioneering work is when extensively studying patients with lesions in these brain areas, he discovered that the patients lost (among other things) the ability to imitate. He was the one who coined the term [...] "apraxia" [...] and differentiated between ideational and <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia.</b> In this basic and wider frame of classical neurological knowledge the discovery of the mirror neuron has to be seen. Though mirror neurons were first discovered in macaques, their discovery also relates to humans.|$|E

40|$|Although apraxia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} signs in corticobasal degeneration, the phenomenology of this disorder has not been formally examined. Hence 10 patients with corticobasal degeneration were studied with a standardised evaluation for different types of apraxia. To minimise the confounding effects of the primary motor disorder, apraxia was assessed in the least affected limb. Whereas none of the patients showed buccofacial apraxia, seven showed deficits on tests of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> and movement imitation, four on tests of sequential arm movements (all of whom had <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia),</b> and three on tests of ideational apraxia (all of whom had <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia).</b> <b>Ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> significantly correlated with deficit in both the mini mental state examination and in a task sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction (picture arrangement).

40|$|Abstract Background Evolutionary {{autonomous}} {{agents are}} robots or robot simulations whose controller is a dynamical neural network and whose evolution occurs autonomously {{under the guidance}} of a fitness function without the detailed or explicit direction of an external programmer. They are embodied agents with a simple neural network controller and as such they provide the optimal forum by which sensorimotor interactions in a specified environment can be studied without the computational assumptions inherent in standard neuroscience. Methods Evolutionary autonomous agents were evolved that were able to perform identical movements under two different contexts, one which represented an automatic movement and one which had a symbolic context. In an attempt to model the automatic-voluntary dissociation frequently seen in <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia,</b> lesions were introduced into the neural network controllers resulting in a behavioral dissociation with loss of the ability to perform the movement which had a symbolic context and preservation of the simpler, automatic movement. Results Analysis of the changes in the hierarchical organization of the networks in the apractic EAAs demonstrated consistent changes in the network dynamics across all agents with loss of longer duration time scales in the network dynamics. Conclusion The concepts of determinate motor programs and perceptual representations that are implicit in the present day understanding of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> are assumptions inherent in the computational understanding of brain function. The strength of the present study using EAAs to model one aspect of <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> is the absence of these assumptions and a grounding of all sensorimotor interactions in an embodied, autonomous agent.

40|$|Very {{few studies}} have {{investigated}} sensorimotor control in apraxia using tasks that differ in movement complexity. Nevertheless, {{there is some evidence}} to suggest that spontaneous behaviour, although relatively preserved, can be rather clumsy or awkward, and that patients with <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> may have subtle kinematic abnormalities in movements made in the laboratory. It remains unclear whether patients with <b>ideomotor</b> <b>apraxia</b> perform normally on movements such as visually guided aiming, that may not depend on higher-order, more cognitive, processes and that are relatively unguided by overlearned contexts. In this study, three different sensorimotor tasks were given to the same sample of patients with quantified apraxic disturbance. Finger tapping, goal-directed grasping and aiming with and without visual feedback were examined in these patients. A clear dissociation was found between grossly impaired gesture imitation and intact motor programming of goal-directed movements with visual feedback. Apraxic patients were, however, impaired on aiming movements without visual feedback, suggesting that apraxia is associated with an increased reliance on integration of online visual information with feedforward/feedback somatosensory and motor signals. Furthermore, patients were impaired on single finger tapping which was a surprisingly good predictor of apraxia severity...|$|E
