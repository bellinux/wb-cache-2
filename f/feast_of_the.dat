5|$|The Festa do Espirito Santo, or <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit, is a {{religious}} festival put on by Point Loma's large Portuguese community. It has been staged annually since 1910 and is San Diego's oldest ethnic tradition.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{also the}} host to the <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Nazarene, held every January 9, which draws {{millions}} of Catholic devotees.

5|$|August 12. The <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet and His Bride. This holiday commemorates the {{marriage}} of Aleister Crowley and his first wife Rose Edith Crowley. Rose was {{a key figure in}} the writing of the Book of the Law.|$|E
25|$|The phrases used on <b>the</b> Great <b>Feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord (excluding Palm Sunday and Pascha) are {{not said}} on Sundays, but are {{replaced}} with the normal Sunday phrase: May He Who rose from the dead... Furthermore, on <b>the</b> Great <b>Feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord, and from Palm Sunday through Thomas Sunday (the Sunday after Easter) neither <b>the</b> patron saint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church nor <b>the</b> saint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day are mentioned in the dismissal.|$|R
50|$|His major {{literary}} {{achievement is}} his twofold collection of Latin sermons: Sermones de tempore (sermons on <b>the</b> <b>feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liturgical year) and Sermones de sanctis (sermons on <b>feasts</b> <b>of</b> particular saints).|$|R
50|$|A solemnity is a <b>feast</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest rank in <b>the</b> liturgical {{calendar}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Rite, {{celebrating a}} mystery of faith {{such as the}} Trinity, an event in <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> Jesus, his mother Mary, or another important saint. The observance begins with the vigil on the evening before <b>the</b> actual date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feast.</b> Unlike <b>feast</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rank <b>of</b> <b>feast</b> (other than <b>feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord) or those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rank <b>of</b> memorial, solemnities replace <b>the</b> celebration <b>of</b> Sundays outside of Advent, Lent and Easter (those in Ordinary Time).|$|R
5|$|In {{a private}} {{printing}} of 1899, Provost Shadwell lists thirteen Gaudies observed by the College during the 18th century; {{by the end}} of the 19th century all but two, the <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Immaculate Conception and the Purification of the Virgin, had ceased to be celebrated.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goats {{major themes}} include {{political}} corruption, machismo, memory, and writing and power. Olga Lorenzo, reviewer for The Melbourne Age, suggests that overall Vargas Llosa's {{aim is to}} reveal the irrational forces of Latin tradition {{that give rise to}} despotism.|$|E
5|$|Another {{constant}} theme {{which runs}} throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is {{the interdependence of}} the Latin American tyrant and United States imperialism. In Mario Vargas Llosa's The <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goat, for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the CIA, previously held for over 32 years {{in light of his}} anti-communist leanings.|$|E

5|$|April 8 through April 10. The <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three Days of the Writing of the Book of the Law. These {{three days}} are {{commemorative}} {{of the three}} days in the year 1904 during which Aleister Crowley wrote the Book of the Law. One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated by reading the corresponding chapter {{on each of the}} three days, usually at noon.|$|E
5|$|Bach had an {{audience}} {{familiar with the}} text and its background. In Leipzig, a Latin Magnificat was sung on the high holidays (Christmas, Easter and Pentecost, then performed {{on two of the}} three days of celebration) and on the three Marian feasts Annunciation, Visitation and Purification. According to some scholars, further feast days included New Year's Day, Epiphany, <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ascension, Trinity Sunday, St. John's Day and St. Michael's Day, and the vespers before the feast days.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{is home to}} many festivals {{throughout}} the year. Cultural festivals such as the annual <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Assumption in the Little Italy neighborhood, the Harvest Festival in the Slavic Village neighborhood, and the more recent Cleveland Asian Festival in the Asia Town neighborhood are popular events. Vendors at the West Side Market in Ohio City offer many different ethnic foods for sale.

5|$|During {{the night}} of January22–23,1921, Mykola Leontovych was murdered by Chekist (Soviet state security) agent Afanasy Grishchenko. Leontovych was staying {{at the home of}} his parents, whom he was visiting for the Orthodox <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nativity (December 25 of the Julian calendar–which on the Gregorian calendar, adopted by the USSR only in 1918, falls in January). The {{undercover}} Chekist had also asked to stay the night at the house and shared a room with Mykola. At dawn he shot the composer (who died of blood loss a few hours later) after robbing his family.|$|E
5|$|In her {{treatment}} of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its wielder {{the ability to make}} prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is and what is not told. The government's actions in The <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as they were seen {{as a threat to the}} government's ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Rafael Trujillo, known also as The Goat, The Chief, and The Benefactor, is a fictionalized {{character}} {{based on}} the real dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961 and the official President of the Republic from 1930 to 1938 and 1943 to 1952. In The <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goat, Vargas Llosa imagines the innermost thoughts of the dictator, and retells The Goat's last hours from his own perspective.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> {{greater part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two {{collections}} consists <b>of</b> settings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Proprium Missae for <b>the</b> major <b>feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church calendar, thus supplementing the Mass Ordinary cycles which Byrd had {{published in the}} 1590s. Normally, Byrd includes the Introit, the Gradual, the Alleluia (or Tract in Lent if needed), the Offertory and Communion. The feasts covered include <b>the</b> major <b>feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary (including the votive masses for the Virgin for <b>the</b> four seasons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church year), All Saints and Corpus Christi (1605) followed by <b>the</b> <b>feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temporale (Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Ascension, Whitsun, and <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> Saints Peter and Paul (with additional items for St Peter's Chains and <b>the</b> Votive Mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Sacrament) in 1607. <b>The</b> verse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Introit is normally set as a semichoir section, returning to full choir scoring for the Gloria Patri. Similar treatment applies to the Gradual verse, which is normally attached to the opening Alleluia to form a single item. The liturgy requires repeated settings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "Alleluia", and Byrd provides {{a wide variety of}} different settings forming brilliantly conceived miniature fantasias which are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most striking features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two sets. The Alleluia verse, together with the closing Alleluia, normally form an item in themselves, while the Offertory and the Communion are set as they stand.|$|R
25|$|On Sundays, at each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord—from <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feast</b> {{until its}} apodosis (leavetaking)--on {{each day of}} Holy Week, and {{throughout}} Bright Week there are special phrases which are added at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dismissals. These are used at both the Lesser and the Greater Dismissals, and are inserted before the words: Christ our true God....|$|R
5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E

The liturgies of the churches in Belgrade and Moscow, the Hilandar (where the brotherhood had their krsna slava) and the Monastery of the Holy Archangels, mentioned Lazar. A memorial sundial {{was placed on the}} Academy of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} first {{performed}} in Leipzig in 1723. In May that year Bach assumed {{his position as}} Thomaskantor and embarked on an ambitious series of compositions. The Magnificat was sung at vesper services on feast days, and, according to recent research, Bach's setting was written for a performance on 2 July, celebrating the Marian <b>feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Visitation. For Christmas the same year, he performed it at the Nikolaikirche with the insertion of four seasonal movements.|$|E
2500|$|After the troparia and kontakia, {{the choir}} begins the Trisagion: [...] "Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal One, {{have mercy on}} us!" [...] <b>The</b> {{chanting}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trisagion at the Little Entrance {{is said to have}} been miraculously revealed to St. Proclus, Patriarch of Constantinople (434 -447). On certain Great <b>Feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church year, the Trisagion is replaced by another hymn, taken from [...] "As many as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ! Alleluia!" [...] On <b>Feasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross, the Trisagion is replaced by the hymn, [...] "Before Thy Cross, we bow down in worship, O Master, and Thy holy Resurrection we glorify!" [...] During the Trisagion, or its alternate hymn, the priest and deacon go to the High Place (seats for the bishop and priests to <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Table) to prepare for <b>the</b> reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Epistle and Gospel.|$|R
