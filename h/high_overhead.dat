5|$|Red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and {{are often}} seen flying <b>high</b> <b>overhead</b> in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. Flocks of up to 500birds are generally only seen in the north or when the birds are concentrated at some food source. Otherwise, they are generally rather shy of humans. In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, graptogyne and naso, are almost exclusively arboreal. They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, markedly different from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. They also often fly at considerable height.|$|E
5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun <b>high</b> <b>overhead,</b> much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying <b>high</b> <b>overhead.</b> When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of Shad Thames are the walkways which criss-cross the street <b>high</b> <b>overhead.</b> Most of them now connect the Butlers Wharf building and the Cardamom Building, and were originally used as bridges to roll barrels and the like between warehouses. They are now used as balconies by the adjoining flats. Photographs from the early 20th century show that at the peak of warehouse usage there were many more of these bridges than survive today.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of the DSJ Architects partnership led to immediate work in building houses of religious worship. Although Dyson’s personal office received professional awards for a remodeling of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church (1991) in Porterville, California, that integrated functional improvements with new decorative enrichment, his participation in DSJ Architects resulted designs for new facilities for four Christian churches and a Buddhist temple. Two schemes were prepared for the United Japanese Christian Church (1991/1992) in Clovis, California, which reveal a reconception of the form between the two versions unusual in Dyson work. The realized building exhibits several features that continue to develop in subsequent projects, notably the sweeping simplicity of sparingly embellished space in a light filled sanctuary and an entrance embracing from <b>high</b> <b>overhead</b> the approach of worshipers with elongated steel trellis forms. In St. Mary’s Catholic Church (1994) in Sanger, California, the extension of twelve wings in the entrance trellis work refers to the Christian apostles and forms a symbolic canopy over a monumental sixteen foot high statue of the Virgin Mary. The Huber Memorial Chapel for the First Congregational Church (1997) in Bakersfield, California, refines the entrance adornment into a single vector of joined steel spars jutting forward from the cornice in a visual reference to hands joined in prayer.|$|E
500|$|Yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and {{are often}} heard before being seen. They make long journeys by flying at a considerable height while calling to each other, and they are often seen flying <b>high</b> <b>overhead</b> in pairs, or trios comprising a pair and their young, or small groups. Outside of the breeding season in autumn or winter they may coalesce into flocks of a hundred birds or more, while family interactions between pairs or trios are maintained. They are generally wary birds, although they can be less shy in urban and suburban areas. They generally keep to trees, only coming to ground level to inspect fallen pine or banksia cones or to drink. Flight is fluid and {{has been described as}} [...] "lazy", with deep, slow wingbeats.|$|E

500|$|The Tribune's demise hastened a {{settlement}} of the strike. Discontinued as a morning paper, the Tribune name {{was added to the}} afternoon publication and on September 12, 1966, the new World Journal Tribune published its first issue. [...] "It was not a bad paper," [...] according to Tribune historian Richard Kluger, and featured many Tribune writers, including Wolfe, Breslin, Kerr and columnist Dick Schaap, and incorporated New York as its Sunday magazine. The first weeks' editions were dominated by the input of the Hearst and Scripps papers, but after a time, the [...] "Widget" [...] (as the merged publication was nicknamed) took on the appearance and style of the late-era Tribune. The World Journal Tribune reached a circulation near 700,000—fourth-largest for American evening newspapers at the time—but had <b>high</b> <b>overhead</b> costs and relatively little advertising. Whitney eventually withdrew support for the newspaper, but Scripps and Hearst continued to back it until the paper folded on May 5, 1967.|$|E
500|$|The second attack started {{just before}} 13:00. In a coordinated strike, dive bombers flew <b>high</b> <b>overhead</b> {{to begin their}} runs while torpedo bombers {{approached}} from all directions at just above sea level. Overwhelmed {{by the number of}} targets, the battleship's anti-aircraft guns were ineffective, and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack. Yamatos main guns were loaded with Beehive shells fused to explode one second after firing—a mere [...] from the ship—but these had little effect. Three or four torpedoes struck the battleship on the port side and one to starboard. Three hits, close together on the port side, are confirmed: one struck a fireroom that had already been hit, one impacted a different fireroom, and the third hit the hull adjacent to a damaged outboard engine room, increasing the water flow into that space and possibly flooding nearby locations. The fourth, unconfirmed, hit may have struck aft of the third; Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding reported in that location. This attack left Yamato in a perilous position, listing ° to port. Counterflooding of all remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to °, but further correction would have required repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms. Although the battleship was not yet in danger of sinking, the list meant that the main battery was unable to fire and her speed was limited to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Riverside Museum (2004–2011), on {{the banks}} of the River Clyde Glasgow, Scotland, houses the Glasgow Museum of Transport. Hadid {{described}} the 10,000-square metre building, with 7,000 square metres of gallery space, as [...] "a wave", [...] "folds in movement", and [...] "a shed in the form of a tunnel, open at the extreme ends, one end toward the city and the other toward the Clyde." [...] Like many of her buildings, the whole form is only perceived when viewed from above. The facades are covered with zinc plates, and the roofline has a series of peaks and angles. The interior galleries caused some controversy; visitors who came to see the collection of historic automobiles found that they are mounted on the walls, <b>high</b> <b>overhead,</b> so it is impossible to look into them. Rowan Moore of [...] The Guardian of London wrote: [...] "Obviously the space is about movement...Outside it is, typologically, a supermarket, being a big thing in a parking lot that is seeking to attract you in...It has enigma and majesty, but not friendliness." ...|$|E

2500|$|The use {{of union}} data would {{probably}} prevail regardless of assumptions, since {{the data are}} collected through voluntary surveys. Since the responses are provided voluntarily, and since the response requires {{a substantial amount of}} work to understand and complete, it {{is in the interest of}} employers with high wage workforces and <b>high</b> <b>overhead</b> to respond. By answering the request for data when employers with lower wage workforces and low overhead do not, they pull the prevailing wage determination in their favor. For smaller employers and employers who do not participate in federal contracting, it is not worth the cost to complete the surveys. Furthermore, it is in the interest of local unions to respond to the surveys, since a predetermination of wage significantly below the union wage would allow non-union employers to bid successfully on contracts. Thus, the survey responses tend to be biased upwards towards collective bargaining agreement wage levels. This source of bias was noted in the DOL Office of the Inspector General report: “A past audit observed that the methods used by WH to obtain survey data allowed bias to be introduced into wage surveys. Statistical sampling of employers was not done. Only data from employers and third parties who volunteered to participate in the surveys were considered. Consequently, data that could have influenced survey results may have been omitted. Also, employers and third parties who may have had a stake in the outcome of wage decisions were afforded an opportunity to submit erroneous data that may have influenced the survey results.” ...|$|E
