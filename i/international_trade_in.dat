5|$|Currently, common elands are not endangered. They are conserved by the United States Endangered Species Act, and {{regulated}} {{in international trade}} by the Convention on <b>International</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>in</b> Endangered Species. Using ground counts and aerial surveys, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) calculates the population density of the common eland to be between 0.05 and 1 per square kilometre with a total population estimate of 136,000. Populations are considered stable or increasing in the countries of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Malawi and possibly Tanzania.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to territorial disputes, the League {{also tried to}} intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the Nansen passport, {{which was the first}} internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.|$|E
5|$|Lontra canadensis {{is listed}} in Appendix II of the Convention on <b>International</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>in</b> Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction currently, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled.|$|E
5|$|Stationed off Haiti was the British frigate HMS Southampton under Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo, {{tasked with}} observing the {{political}} situation but with orders not to interfere in the intermittent conflict between Christophe and Pétion.

5|$|The jaguar is a near-threatened {{species and}} its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and {{fragmentation}} of habitat. While <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> jaguars or their parts is prohibited, {{the cat is}} still frequently killed by humans, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large. Given its historical distribution, the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous indigenous American cultures, {{including those of the}} Maya and Aztec.|$|E
5|$|The main {{factor in}} the {{continued}} decline of the Javan rhinoceros population has been poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they {{are believed to have}} healing properties. Historically, the rhinoceros' hide was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers, and some local tribes in Vietnam believed the hide could be used to make an antidote for snake venom. Because the rhinoceros' range encompasses many areas of poverty, it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly (otherwise) useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money. When the Convention on <b>International</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>in</b> Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora first went into effect in 1975, the Javan rhinoceros was placed under complete Appendix 1 protection; all <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> the Javan rhinoceros and products derived from it is illegal. Surveys of the rhinoceros horn black market have determined that Asian rhinoceros horn fetches a price as high as $30,000 per kg, three times the value of African rhinoceros horn.|$|E

The Dugong is listed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on Migratory Species, and the Coral Triangle Initiative.
