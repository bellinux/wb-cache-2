5|$|Although many of Ruisdael's {{works were}} on {{show in the}} Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857, and various other grand {{exhibitions}} across the world since, {{it was not until}} 1981 that an exhibition was solely dedicated to Ruisdael. Over fifty paintings and thirty-five drawings and etchings were exhibited, <b>first</b> <b>at</b> the Mauritshuis in The Hague, then, in 1982, at the Fogg Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2006, the Royal Academy in London hosted a Ruisdael Master of Landscape exhibition, displaying works from over fifty collections.|$|E
5|$|Asser recounts meeting Alfred <b>first</b> <b>at</b> {{the royal}} estate at Dean, Sussex (now East and West Dean, West Sussex). Asser {{provides}} only one datable event in his history: on St Martin's Day, 11 November 887, Alfred decided {{to learn to}} read Latin. Working backwards from this, it appears most likely that Asser was recruited by Alfred in early 885.|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{measure the}} degree and {{direction}} of errors in recall of age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex. Method: Participants were initially recruited in 1994 – 1995 (Wave I) with 3 subsequent follow-ups in: 1996 (Wave II); 2001 – 2002 (Wave III); and 2007 – 2008 (Wave IV). Participants' individual errors in recall of their age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex <b>at</b> Wave IV were estimated by the paired difference between responses given for age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex in Wave I and Wave IV (recalled age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex obtained <b>at</b> Wave IV minus the age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex obtained <b>at</b> Wave I). Results: The mean of the recall-estimation of age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex <b>at</b> Wave IV {{was found to be}} slightly increased comparing to the age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex <b>at</b> Wave I (less than 1 year). The errors in the recalled age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex tended to increase in participants who had their first sex younger or older than the average, and the recalled age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex tended to bias towards the mean (i. e. participants who had first sex younger than the average were more likely to recall an age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex that was older than the age, and vice versa). Conclusions: In this U. S. population-based sample, the average recall error for age <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sex was small. However, the accuracy of recalled information varied significantly among subgroup populations...|$|R
