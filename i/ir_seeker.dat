40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD is to {{investigate}} pre-emptive flare release compared to reactive flare release and their efficacy as a countermeasure device in the protection of fast jet and transport aircraft against the MANPAD threat. Implicit in this is to study the optimum release time of the flare decoy. Consequently, this also {{raises the question of}} whether flares of reduced payload size can be as effective as standard flares when released at this optimum time. To achieve these aims the initial step is to develop models for the different types of Man-Portable Air-Defence (MANPAD) systems and the <b>IR</b> <b>seekers</b> they utilise. This also requires the simulation of the full pre-launch process, namely the acquisition of the target to obtain lock-on then the application of lead and super elevation to give a more realistic model of the firing sequence. Two target models are also developed, a fast jet (AMX-A 1) and a transport aircraft (C 130), with realistic positions and ejection characteristics for the countermeasure (CM) dispensers. The next stage includes a counter-countermeasure (CCM) capability in the <b>IR</b> <b>seekers.</b> The first is a track angle bias with values optimised for the two aircraft models. Second is the development of a two-colour seeker with signal processors designed for both a spinscan and a conscan system. Using all MANPAD models flares are released at intervals throughout the engagements to find the optimum firing time and the simulations repeated for flares with reduced peak intensity and burn time. The results show that flare release around the time of missile launch is effective against most threats, even the more advanced MANPADs with CCMs. Also, that for reduced performance flares maintaining the burn time is perhaps more important than the peak intensity...|$|R

50|$|Technical {{difficulties}} in the development quickly made it obvious that the development would take far longer than anticipated, however, and in 1978 the program split in two: while {{the development of the}} full-capability Igla would continue, a simplified version (Igla-1) with a simpler <b>IR</b> <b>seeker</b> based on that of the earlier Strela-3 would be developed to enter service earlier than the full-capability version could be finished.|$|E
40|$|Missile {{defense systems}} {{currently}} under development rely on thermal Infrared (<b>IR)</b> <b>seekers</b> {{to detect and}} track incoming ballistic missiles. Atmospheric properties, like temperature and density, can greatly affect the amount of IRE energy that is reflected off a targeted missile. While many models to predict mean atmospheric conditions exist, there are no global models that account for the variability in these properties. This shortcoming {{makes it difficult to}} assess uncertainty due to atmospheric conditions. For this reason, a model that is adjusted for known extreme values is needed for use in describing the global behavior of atmospheric parameters. This study is in support of MSIC's development of a Bounded Earth Atmospheric Model (BEAM). This study will attempt to create such a model through statistical analyses on an existing atmospheric model. It is expected that BEAM will primarily be used by designers of IR sensors used in missile defense systems. U. S. Army (USA) autho...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are other}} {{variants}} under development. One has an upgraded motor to boost range at high altitudes {{to as much}} as 120-160 km; it is known as the RVV-AE-PD. The 'PD' stands for Povyshenoy Dalnosti, which in Russian means [...] "improved range". This variant has been test-fired and uses a solid-fuel ramjet engine. Its range puts it in the long-range class and is equivalent in range to the AIM-54 Phoenix. In another version of the R-77, a terminal infrared homing seeker is offered. This is in line with the Russian practice of attacking targets by firing pairs of missiles with different homing systems. This complicates end-game defensive actions for the target aircraft, as it needs to successfully defeat two homing systems. This method of attack may not always be available as <b>IR</b> <b>seekers</b> typically have less range and less resistance to poor weather than radar seekers, which may limit the successful use of mixed seeker attacks unless the IR missile is initially directed by radar or some other means.|$|R
40|$|Man-portable {{air defence}} systems (MANPADS) are {{short-range}} surfaceto-air missile systems 1 intended for attacking and defending against low-flying aircraft. Some are crew-served (known sometimes as CREWPADS), {{but most are}} easily handled by a single individual and are shoulder-launched. MANPADS are generally categorized according to their guidance systems: passive infrared (<b>IR)</b> <b>seekers,</b> radio command line-of-sight (CLOS), and laser-beam riders. 2 Initial models of IRseeking missiles could engage a target at altitudes of around 2, 000 – 3, 000 m and from slant ranges 3 of about 4, 000 m (Jane’s, 2006, pp. 3 – 50; 1985, pp. 132 – 37). They were often inaccurate and susceptible to basic countermeasures. Moreover, most could engage aircraft only from behind. Today’s most advanced MANPADS can effectively engage aircraft at ranges of up to 8, 000 m (5 miles) and from multiple directions (Saab, n. d.). Initial development of MANPADS began in the 1950 s. Anti-aircraft guns from the Second World War were of limited use, and consumed vast quantities of ammunition, against increasingly fast jet aircraft. The United States developed the Redeye—which got {{its name from the}} infrared homing device in its nose—over {{the better part of a}} decade, and it entered into production in the mid- 1960 s (Parsch, 2002). The Soviets fielded their own system—the Strela- 2 (also known as the SA- 7, which is used here, or Grail) —in 1968. 4 Both were ‘tail-chase’ systems effective only when fired at the target from behind. By the end of the 1960 s only these two countries produced MANPADS, although Sweden and the United Kingdom had undertaken research and development of indigenous weapons. The 1970 s saw a significant expansion of the industry. The United States began development of the Stinger missile system in 1972 (Parsch, 2002) and production began in 1979 (Jane’s, 2006, p. 43). Work on the Soviet Strela- 3 (SA- 14 Gremlin) began in 1968, and it entered service six years later in 1974 (Jane’s, 2006, p. 30). Like their predecessors, these systems were IR-seeking missiles, but they were able to engage targets from multiple directions (not just from behind). Second-generation <b>IR</b> <b>seekers</b> also achieved a greater effective range and accuracy.

50|$|In mid-1990s {{the fuel}} for HF-2 was changed, which doubled its range (80 km to 160 km). The <b>IR</b> <b>seeker</b> was also being changed to an IR imaging seeker, which greatly enhance the IRCCM ability. Also, with the IR imaging seeker, the HF-2 was then able to attack shore targets also, with pre-stored target shape inside missile's computer, but an HF-2 land attack ability was never confirmed.|$|E
5000|$|Aware of the {{advantages}} of passive IR homing, the research program started with a number of theoretical studies considering the emissions from the targets. This led to the practical discovery {{that the vast majority of}} the IR output from a piston engine aircraft was between 3 and 4.5 micrometers. The exhaust was also a strong emitter, but cooled rapidly in the air so that it did not present a false tracking target. Studies were also made on atmospheric attenuation, which demonstrated that air is generally more transparent to IR than visible light, although the presence of water vapour and carbon dioxide produced several sharp drops in transitivity. Finally they also considered the issue of background sources of IR, including reflections off clouds and similar effects, concluding this was an issue due to the way it changed very strongly across the sky. This research suggested that an <b>IR</b> <b>seeker</b> could home on a three-engine bomber at 5 km with an accuracy of about [...] degree, making an <b>IR</b> <b>seeker</b> a very desirable device.|$|E

The fuse {{is similar to that of}} QW-18. The minimum altitude is decreased to 10 m, thus further improving the capability against low-flying cruise missile and hovering helicopters that suddenly pop up from hiding.|$|R
40|$|Reticle {{systems are}} {{considered}} to be the classical approach for estimating the position of a target in a considered field of view and are widely used in <b>IR</b> <b>seekers.</b> However, the disadvantage of the reticle trackers has been overly sensitivity to man-made clutters. We show that the nonlinear coherent version of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) theory can perhaps help alleviate the problem. When the processing device is redesigned properly by a band-pass filtering, the output signals are linear convolutive of the reticle transmission functions (rtf) considered as the unknown input source si(t) signals in the context of ICA. That enables ICA neural network to be applied on the optical tracker output signals xi(t) giving on its outputs recovered rtf si(t). Position of each optical source is obtained by applying appropriate demodulation method on the recovered source signals. The contribution of this paper is demonstrating that the coherence between optical sources results in a nonlinear ICA problem that becomes linearized, when the optical fields are incoherent, or, when the proper design of the optical tracker converts the nonlinear coherent model into linear one by band-pass filtering operation. Consequently, the multisource limitation of the reticle based optical trackers can in principle be overcome for both coherent and incoherent optical sources. We therefore conclude that requirements necessary for the ICA theory to work are fulfilled for both coherent and incoherent optical sources. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{infrared}} (<b>IR)</b> <b>seekers</b> have exploited {{techniques to}} passively acquire and intercept airborne targets, by detecting their IR energy [1]. The basic principle of IR detection is the discrimination of target's IR radiance in the detector's wavelength band with the background IR radiance (atmospheric emission/solar radiation) [2]. In an aircraft, the internal sources include plume and surface emissions; and power-plant {{is the major}} and reliable source. The aircraft rear fuselage skin of a typical military aircraft is heated by the flow of hot combustion products in the embedded engine [12]. The solid angle subtended by the rear fuselage skin is {{an order of magnitude}} larger than that of the tailpipe [9]. Therefore, its contribution is significant especially in the 8 - 12 micron band; in which, IR-detection is possible also due to external sources, e. g., earthshine and skyshine reflection [19]. Unlike surfaces of solids, gases emit and absorb radiation only at discrete wavelengths associated with specific rotational and vibrational frequencies. These frequencies depend on the particular type of molecule, temperature, pressure, and molecular concentration of radiation participating species [13]. The atmosphere limits the use of the IR spectrum to specific bands called as atmospheric windows; and has a crucial role, which includes that of transmission and background radiance [8]. For reducing detection by IR-guided missiles, aircraft and helicopters use IR Signature Suppression (IRSS) techniques. A well-designed HISS system can drastically reduce IRSL by restricting the visibility of hot parts and by matching the visible radiance with the background [22]. Their effect in reducing target's susceptibility (P(H)) can be gauged by models that relate the two. Due to significant advancements in the performance of IR-detectors, modern missiles are generally constrained by their burnout range rather than their lock-on range. The 'lethal range' is a function of target's lock-on range, target's velocity, missile velocity, missile burnout range, missile's guidance logic and blast kill radius; and it is a superior estimate of P(H) [23]...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{infrared}} imaging seekers can nowadays deal with higher resolution and less noisy sensor images.

Several lengthy reports on the various systems were produced and disseminated among the western aircraft firms, while a number of the engineers joined these companies to work on various missile projects. By the late 1940s a wide variety of missile projects were underway, from huge systems like the Bell Bomi to small systems like air-to-air missiles.

The <b>IR</b> <b>seeker</b> borrowed directly and heavily from PL-2 series AAM, and adaptation of matured technology was the primary reason why its initial completion was faster than its SARH guided counterpart. Another advantage of PL-4B was that due to its IR guidance, the logistic was much simpler than PL-4A, which meant that the cost was also reduced accordingly.

40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{increasing}} terrorist SAMs threat to civil and military aircraft, the need of a high-fidelity, low-cost, IR signature scene modelling and simulation capability {{that could be used for}} development, testing and evaluation of IRCM systems cannot be overlooked. The performance evaluation, training and testing of IR missiles or other IR based weapon systems, is very expensive and is also dependent upon atmospheric factors. Whereas, the computer based non-destructive simulation can provide a cost-effective alternative to field trials. An effort has been made to model the IR scene signature using virtual reality modelling tools and integrating this model into the missile-target engagement and countermeasure simulator. The developed algorithm can simulate passive <b>IR</b> imaging <b>seeker</b> engagements with aerial targets. The presented algorithm uses the developed models for IR signature of the target, the background, the flare spectral and temporal responses and the flare ballistic trajectory. The missile guidance, auto-pilot and tracker algorithms have also been developed. The atmospheric conditions have been modelled, using LOWTRAN, as “good”, “typical” or “bad” to account for atmospheric transmittance and the sky-radiance. The results were analysed and validated through four test scenarios. The code is written in MATLAB which gives it openness for user verification/validation and also flexibility for any future modifications.

50|$|In the 1980s, a new {{training}} simulator system {{was constructed in}} Stevenage. This consisted of a 10 m radius hemispherical dome whose inside surface {{was used as a}} movie screen onto which terrain images were projected. A copper-vapour laser projected images of targets and the missiles in-flight on top of the background imagery, while a smaller helium-neon laser simulated the Rapier's tracking flare. A complete Rapier targeting unit was placed {{in the center of the}} dome, and its guidance signals were captured and sent to the simulator to update the position of the missile. The projected laser imagery was bright enough that it could be tracked by <b>IR</b> imagers and <b>seekers,</b> allowing it to be used with the updated Darkfire versions of the Rapier with their IR cameras, or other IR seeking missiles like the Stinger.

50|$|The missile's {{uncooled}} {{lead sulphide}} passive infra-red seeker head detects infrared radiation at below 2.8 μm in wavelength. It has a 1.9 degree {{field of view}} and can track at 9 degrees per second. The seeker head tracks the target with an amplitude-modulated spinning reticle (spin-scan or AM tracking), which attempts to keep the seeker constantly pointed towards the target. The spinning reticle measures the amount of incoming infrared (IR) energy. It does this by using a circular pattern that has solid portions and slats that allow the IR energy to pass through to the seeker. As the reticle spins IR energy passes through the open portions of the reticle. Based on where the IR energy falls on the reticle the amount or amplitude of IR energy allowed through to the seeker increases the closer {{to the center of}} the reticle. Therefore, the seeker is able to identify where the center of the IR energy is. If the seeker detects a decrease in the amplitude of the IR energy it steers the missile back towards where the IR energy was the strongest. The seeker's design creates a dead-space in the middle of the reticle. The center mounted reticle has no detection capability. This means that as the seeker tracks a target as soon as the seeker is dead center, (aimed directly at the IR source) there is a decrease in the amplitude of <b>IR</b> energy. The <b>seeker</b> interprets this decrease as being off target so it changes direction. This causes the missile to move off target until another decrease in IR energy is detected and the process repeats itself. This gives the missile a very noticeable wobble in flight as the seeker bounces in and out from the dead-space. This wobble becomes more pronounced as the missile closes on the target as the IR energy fills a greater portion of the reticle. These continuous course corrections effectively bleed energy from the missile reducing its range and velocity.|$|R
