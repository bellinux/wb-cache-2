5|$|The two kings made a truce, {{by which}} Brian was granted rule over the {{southern}} half of Ireland, while Máel Sechnaill retained the northern half and high kingship. In honour of this arrangement, Máel Sechnaill {{handed over to}} Brian the hostages he <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> Dublin and Leinster; and in 998, Brian handed over to Máel Sechnaill the hostages of Connacht. In the same year, Brian and Máel Sechnaill began co-operating against the Norse of Dublin for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Frazier, however, {{searches}} the bank's records and finds that {{safe deposit box}} #392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. He is then confronted by White, who informs him of Case's Nazi dealings. She attempts to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recording of an incriminating conversation that she had with him. White confronts Case who admits that the box contained diamonds and a ring that he <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> a Jewish friend whom he had betrayed to the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|Hemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror {{as being}} {{especially}} damaging. He {{claims that the}} work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several manors that were listed in Domesday Book as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims. It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 marks of gold to recover their belongings. Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included Leofric, Earl of Mercia, {{and other members of}} his family.|$|E

5|$|In 33 BC Antony met his {{coalition}} {{partner on}} the river Araxes; they agreed that Antony should support Artavasdes I against Parthia and that the Median King should help Antony against Octavian. They interchanged parts of their troops. The domain of Artavasdes I was enlarged with parts of Armenia. Antony had returned a standard that the Median king <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> Oppius Statianus in 36 BC, and also took Iotapa along with him. With {{the help of the}} Roman reinforcements Artavasdes I was initially able to repulse the Parthian attack. Before the Battle of Actium, Antony called back his Roman troops without sending back the Median reinforcements. This time Phraates IV defeated Artavasdes I who was captured in 30 BC.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, the New York Daily News {{reported}} that Bonds had {{tested positive for}} amphetamines. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players {{were not to be}} identified for a first positive test, but the New York Daily News leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> the locker of Giants teammate Mark Sweeney, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.|$|E
5|$|Soeman {{published}} another novel, Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan (Seeking a Maiden's Kidnapper), in 1932. It follows Sir Joon, a {{man whose}} betrothal to Nona was called off after her father, Gadi, was offered a higher bride price. When Nona is apparently kidnapped, Joon offers his services to help find her. He builds distrust between Gadi and Nona's would-be husband, and ultimately that betrothal too is called off. Afterwards Joon leaves the village with Nona, whom he <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> her home, and the couple lives happily in Singapore. For this novel, again published by Balai Pustaka, Soeman received 75 gulden. Over the subsequent decades, it became his most popular publication, {{and it has been}} identified as the first detective novel in the Indonesian literary canon.|$|E

5|$|Tenaya's band {{fled the}} valley and sought refuge with the Mono, his mother's tribe. In mid-1853, the Ahwahneechee {{returned}} to the valley, but they subsequently betrayed the hospitality of their former Mono hosts by stealing horses that the Mono <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> non-indigenous ranchers. In return, the Monos tracked down and killed many of the remaining Ahwahneechee, including Tenaya; Tenaya Lake is named after the fallen chief. Hostilities subsided and by the mid-1850s local European American residents started to befriend Native Americans {{still living in the}} Yosemite area.|$|E
5|$|Between 1158–1162, {{a series}} of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rûm {{resulted}} in a treaty favourable to the Empire. According to the agreement, certain frontier regions, including the city of Sivas, should be handed over to Manuel in return for some quantity of cash, while it also obliged the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II to recognize his overlordship. Kilij Arslan II used the peace with Byzantium, and the power vacuum caused by the death in 1174 of Nur ad-Din Zangi the ruler of Syria, to expel the Danishmends from their Anatolian emirates. When the Seljuk sultan refused to cede some of the territory he <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> the Danishmends to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do {{as part of his}} treaty obligations, Manuel decided {{that it was time to}} deal with the Turks once and for all. Therefore, he assembled the full imperial army and marched against the Seljuk capital, Iconium (Konya). Manuel's strategy was to prepare the advanced bases of Dorylaeum and Sublaeum, and then to use them to strike as quickly as possible at Iconium.|$|E
5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E

5|$|The two {{combined}} battalions began {{digging in}} around Isurava. A headquarters {{had been set}} {{up at the top of}} the hill, which was vital to the defence of the position. While the Australians dug themselves in, the Japanese, led by Japanese Major General Tomitarō Horii, prepared to attack. On 28 August, the Japanese launched their offensive. The Australians, who had initially been outnumbered but were now roughly equal in strength, resisted in the face of heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat. On 29 August, the Japanese broke through the right flank, pushing the Australians back with heavy fire, threatening to cut off their headquarters. The Australians began to prepare a counter-offensive, and men volunteered to join an attack party. Kingsbury, one of the few survivors of his platoon, ran down the Track with the group. Using a Bren gun he <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> wounded Corporal Lindsay Bear, Kingsbury, alongside Avery and the rest of the group, engaged the nearby Japanese. The fire was so heavy that the undergrowth was completely destroyed within five minutes. It was then that Kingsbury, firing from his hip, charged straight at the Japanese.|$|E
