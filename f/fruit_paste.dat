40|$|Fruit pieces {{prepared}} from pastes are now commonly {{added to}} breakfast cereals, snack bars and “healthy” confectionery. The {{objective was to}} determine the cell wall composition of heat-treated apple paste and apricot paste. The cell walls of apple paste and apricot paste were isolated and sequentially fractionated separately using HEPES, CDTA, Na 2 CO 3, 1 M KOH, 4 M KOH leaving a final residue. The monosaccharide composition of the fractions was consistent with the presence of cellulose, pectic polysaccharides, xyloglucans, heteroxylans and galactoglucomannans. The heat treatment during the apple paste and the apricot paste production did not change the overall amounts of neutral monosaccharides. Heat treatment resulted in the considerable solubilization of pectic polymers in water-soluble and CDTA-soluble fractions compared to Na 2 CO 3, KOH and final residue fractions of the <b>fruit</b> <b>pastes.</b> During heat treatment, tissue softening occurs due to the disruption of the constituent cell wall matrix...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "dessert" [...] {{comes from}} the Old French desservir, [...] "to clear a table", {{literally}} [...] "to un-serve", and originated during the Middle Ages. It would typically consist of dragées and mulled wine accompanied by aged cheese, and by the Late Middle Ages could also include fresh fruit covered in sugar, honey or syrup and boiled-down <b>fruit</b> <b>pastes.</b> Sugar, from its first appearance in Europe, was viewed {{as much as a}} drug as a sweetener; its long-lived medieval reputation as an exotic luxury encouraged its appearance in elite contexts accompanying meats and other dishes that to modern taste are more naturally savoury. There was a wide variety of fritters, crêpes with sugar, sweet custards and darioles, almond milk and eggs in a pastry shell that could also include fruit and sometimes even bone marrow or fish. German-speaking areas had a particular fondness for krapfen: fried pastries and dough with various sweet and savory fillings. Marzipan in many forms was well known in Italy and southern France by the 1340s and is assumed to be of Arab origin.

The English chefs also had a penchant for using flower petals such as roses, violets, and elder flowers. An early form of quiche can be found in Forme of Cury, a 14th-century recipe collection, as a Torte de Bry with a cheese and egg yolk filling.|$|R
