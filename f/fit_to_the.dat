5|$|To assess {{prospective}} {{wind power}} sites a {{probability distribution function}} is often <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> observed wind speed data. Different locations will have different wind speed distributions. The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly/ten-minute wind speeds at many locations. The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a Rayleigh distribution {{can be used as}} a less accurate, but simpler model.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10−3 times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E
5|$|When Oblivion did open, {{the area}} was re-themed {{to look like a}} {{sinister}} government facility, unlike Fantasy World's fairground theme, and renamed X-Sector. The only surviving ride from Fantasy World, the Black Hole roller coaster, was also changed; the large tent that it was situated in was repainted to blue and silver instead of green and yellow stripes. To make the new X-Sector a major ride area, Alton Towers added two old rides {{from other parts of the}} park: Energizer and Enterprise (both from Festival Park, now Dark Forest). Both rides were repainted to <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new theme.|$|E

50|$|An {{access hatch}} was {{moved from the}} {{starboard}} rear fuselage to underneath, and an extra longitudinal stiffening strake, identical <b>to</b> that already <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> starboard side of production Mosquitos, was <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> port fuselage.|$|R

5000|$|The five-cylinder {{was soon}} dropped {{as a major}} engine choice; however, a {{turbocharged}} [...] version remained. <b>The</b> engine, initially <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 200 quattro 20V of 1991, was a derivative of <b>the</b> engine <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sport Quattro. It was <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Audi Coupé, and named the S2 and also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Audi 100 body, and named the S4. These two models were {{the beginning of the}} mass-produced S series of performance cars.|$|R
25|$|Primary {{control of}} the Regulus II was {{through the use of}} elevons <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outer half of the wing {{trailing}}-edges, as the missile was not fitted with a tailplane, and a rudder <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trailing edge of the fin. Flaps were <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inner half of the trailing edge for use during takeoff. Additional stability and control in pitch was provided by small trapezoidal canard foreplanes near the nose of the fuselage.|$|R
25|$|The bayonet {{was almost}} {{identical}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bayonet issued with the Remington M1867, but was numbered on the guard as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blade itself. The available sources {{seems to indicate}} this was done because <b>the</b> bayonets were <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rifles after the blade had been hardened, while the bayonets for <b>the</b> M1867 was <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> M1867 before the blade was hardened. The {{reason for this is}} that Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk manufactured the bayonets, and shipped them to Carl Johans Vern where they were <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> individual rifles.|$|R
25|$|Cap-strap {{bindings}} are {{a recent}} modification {{that provide a}} very tight <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> toe of the boot, and seats the boot more securely in the binding. Numerous companies have adopted various versions of the cap strap.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} open reading frames and their {{relationship}} to genome size differs between eukaryotes and prokaryotes with the former showing a log-linear relationship and the latter a linear relationship. Benford's law has been used to test this observation with an excellent <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> data in both cases.|$|E
25|$|This {{censorship}} existed within all {{layers of}} the GDR. Every business and organisation was affected by it.

25|$|Such large platters {{were never}} used with {{microprocessor-based}} systems. With increasing sales of microcomputers having built in floppy-disk drives (FDDs), HDDs that would <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> FDD mountings became desirable. Thus HDD Form factors, initially followed those of 8-inch, 5.25-inch, and 3.5-inch floppy disk drives. Because {{there were no}} smaller floppy disk drives, smaller HDD form factors developed from product offerings or industry standards.|$|E

25|$|This gag has two mouthguards, {{similar to}} those worn by {{football}} and hockey players. One rests on the lower teeth of the wearer while the other is against the top. Again, like sports mouthguards, these mouthguards can be softened in boiling water to <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the wearer. The mouthguards are attached to a front faceplate, like most plug gags, and straps from the front to the back.|$|E
25|$|Variable-contour cuffs are contour cuffs {{that can}} be {{adjusted}} {{to the shape of}} the limb. They have pivoting fastening straps that allow the proximal and distal circumferences to be adjusted, allowing the cuff to conform to a variety of limb shapes, and thus be personalized to each patient. Variable-contour cuffs enhance comfort in patients with tapered limbs, decrease the risk of mechanical shearing, and can occlude blood flow at lower pressures due to the improved <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> limb.|$|E
25|$|Japanese singer Akino Arai wrote a song Sputnik (published in the Album Furu Platinum) about Istochnikov {{and his dog}} Kloka. The song {{begins with}} the {{fragment}} from the Russian poem written by Evtushenko, which was also used in the Sputnik exhibition Catalogue. The poem in this song is a back translation and doesn't <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Russian original in the book. Also, the upcoming sci-fi feature film The Cosmonaut is heavily inspired by Fontcuberta's hoax.|$|E

25|$|Within 28 {{days of a}} {{detention}} order being made, the Minister must refer the order and a statement of the grounds upon which the order was made to an advisory committee. Neither the Minister nor any other public servant is required to disclose facts which he considers to be against the public interest to disclose.

25|$|Important {{cases where}} the {{computational}} definition of R2 can yield negative values, depending on the definition used, arise where the predictions that are being compared to the corresponding outcomes have not been derived from a model-fitting procedure using those data, and where linear regression is conducted without including an intercept. Additionally, negative values of R2 may occur when fitting non-linear functions to data. In cases where negative values arise, {{the mean of the}} data provides a better <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outcomes than do the fitted function values, according to this particular criterion.|$|E
25|$|PPI deficits {{represent}} a well-described finding in schizophrenia, {{with the first}} report dating back to 1978. The abnormalities are also noted in unaffected relatives of the patients. In one study, patients failed to show increased PPI to attended prepulses. Dopamine, which {{plays a major role}} in schizophrenia, had been shown to regulate sensorimotor gating in rodent models. These findings <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. In theory, PPI disruption in schizophrenia may be related to the processes of sensory flooding and cognitive fragmentation.|$|E
