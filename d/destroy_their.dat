5|$|Most of the Strauss {{works that}} are {{performed}} today may once have existed {{in a slightly}} different form, as Eduard Strauss destroyed much of the original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna's Mariahilf district in 1907. Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact between himself and brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to <b>destroy</b> <b>their</b> works. The measure was intended to prevent the Strauss family's works from being claimed by another composer. This may also have been fueled by Strauss's rivalry with another of Vienna's popular waltz and march composers, Karl Michael Ziehrer.|$|E

5|$|The Book of Ti'ana {{takes place}} earlier than The Book of Atrus. The {{first part of}} the book focuses on life of Atrus' {{grandfather}} Aitrus with his parents Kahlis and Tasera, Aitrus' meeting with Ti'ana, and the birth of their son Gehn. The book also explains the destruction of the D'ni civilization. Two D'ni, Veovis and A'Gaeris, plot to <b>destroy</b> <b>their</b> civilization, which they believe has been corrupted. Veovis and A'Gaeris create a plague which wipes out many of the D'ni and follows them through the Ages. Veovis is murdered by A'Gaeris for refusing to write an Age where the two of them would have been worshipped as gods, and Aitrus sacrifices himself in order to lure A'Gaeris to an unstable Age, killing them both.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Judenrats {{has been}} controversial. Both Raul Hilberg and Hannah Arendt, early historians of the Holocaust, argued that {{without the help of}} the Judenrats, the Germans would have been {{hampered}} in their extermination efforts. Arendt went further and condemned those Jews who served as leaders in the ghettos for helping <b>destroy</b> <b>their</b> own people. More recent historians have recognized that the situation facing the Jewish leaders was more complex – they faced conflicting sets of goals and had essentially no power to change the demands the Germans made of them.|$|E

The Magbeni assault had several purposes: to neutralise weapons in the village which could disrupt the SAS operation, to distract the West Side Boys in Magbeni and prevent them from crossing Rokel Creek to interfere with the operation in Gberi Bana, to defeat the West Side Boys and <b>destroy</b> <b>their</b> military capabilities, and to recover the Royal Irish patrol's vehicles.|$|E
5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and <b>destroy</b> <b>their</b> faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E

5|$|Half {{the area}} of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been {{reclaimed}} in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The Environment Agency's management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness {{in the face of a}} potential sea level rise of 1.1m (3ft) by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5m (10ft) per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not <b>destroy</b> <b>their</b> effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the raid on Sind and following the 1809 monsoon season, the British authorities in India decided to make a significant show of force against the Al Qasimi, in an effort not only to <b>destroy</b> <b>their</b> larger bases and as many ships as could be found, but also to counteract French encouragement of them from their embassies in Persia and Oman. Forces were gathered at Bombay during the summer: the small HEIC warships, Mornington, Aurora, Ternate, Mercury, Nautilus, Prince of Wales, Ariel and Fury joined by the bomb ketch Stromboli and the Royal Navy frigates HMS Caroline under Charles Gordon and Chiffone under John Wainwright, who was placed in command of the entire expeditionary force with the temporary rank of commodore. The force was complemented with troops seconded from the Bombay garrison, including a battalion of the 65th Foot, soldiers from the 47th Foot and an assortment of HEIC marines, engineers, artillery men and sepoys from the 2nd Bombay Native Infantry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lionel Smith of the 65th.|$|E
