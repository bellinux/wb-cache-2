If the hospital wish {{to survive in the}} competition, they need to recount the existing <b>hospital</b> <b>tariff</b> previously, that is by using competitive tariff model calculation. Hospital of PKU Muhammadiyah Unit I Yogyakarta divides HD tariff into two parts, these are Single Use and Re Use tariff. There are cost sharing differences between HD tariff in hospital and government. In this research, the reseacher only focuses on HD tariff of Re Use in order to reduce cost sharing. All this time, the hospital has never counted different cost. It can create lose for the hospital. th s researcher interest to analyze the cost sharing of hemodialisis tariff calculation for poor in public hospital of PKU Muhammadiyah Unit I Yogyakarta. Methode: This research type is descriptive research qualitative which analyzed real expense by using real cost methode and difference which is burdened by patien toward real tariff, meanwhile opinion about cost sharing is taken by interview with superintendent finance and superintendent of hemodialisis unit using interview method. Resulth: this research show the real tariff equal to Rp. 912. 571 while tariff released by hospital equal to Rp. 575. 000, and difference between second tariff is Rp. 337. 751, while tariff given by government is Rp. 528. 067 and difference with the real tariff equal to Rp. 384. 684. Conclusion: that unit based cost tariff higher than tariff given by hospital at this time, the biggest expense is component for examines or substance used up wear. The hospital should determine the strategy to decrease the difference. Key Words: cost sharing, real cost method, tariff packet, hemodialisis, poor, societ...|$|E

The objective {{of this study is to}} perform cost analysis of therapy of patients with chronic HCV-related cirrhosis hospitalized in the University Hospital “Queen Joanna-ISUL” for 3 -year period (2012 – 2014). MethodsIt is a prospective, real life observational study of 297 patients with chronic HCV infection and cirrhosis monitored in the University Hospital “Queen Joanna-ISUL” for 3 -year period. Data on demographic, clinical characteristics, and health-care resources utilization (hospitalizations, highly specialized interventions, and pharmacotherapy) were collected. Micro-costing approach was applied to evaluate the total direct medical costs. The points of view are that of the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), hospital and the patients. Collected cost data are from the NHIF and <b>hospitals</b> <b>tariffs,</b> patients, and from the positive dug list for medicines prices. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared test, Kruskal–Wallis, and Friedman tests were used for statistical processing. Results 76 % of patients were male. 93 % were diagnosed in grade Child-Pugh A and B. 97 % reported complications, and almost all developed esophageal varices. During the 3 [*]years observational period, patients did not change the critical clinical values for Child-Pugh status and therefore the group was considered as homogenous. 847 hospitalizations were recorded for 3 [*]years period with average length of stay 17 [*]days. The mortality rate of 6. 90 % was extremely high. The total direct medical costs for the observed cohort of patients for 3 -year period accounted for 1, 290, 533 BGN (€ 659, 839) with an average cost per patient 4, 577 BGN (€ 2, 340). Statistically significant correlation was observed between the total cost per patient from the different payers’ perspective and the Child-Pugh cirrhosis score. ConclusionHCV-related cirrhosis is resource demanding and sets high direct medical costs as it is related with increased hospitalizations and complications acquiring additional treatment...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHeparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} is {{a severe}} drug adverse effect with possible dramatic consequences. The risk is 0. 1 % to 5 %. The costs of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in France were estimated using the Programme Médicalisé des Systèmes d'Information (PMSI) national discharge database. Hospitalizations with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia were identified using diagnostic codes. Costs were assessed {{from the perspective}} of the French Sickness Fund or hospitals. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia could be the reason of admission or could occur during the stay and lead to a different tariff or to additional costs associated with extra length of stay. Direct costs were also estimated from experts' opinions. A sensitivity analysis was performed from data collected in 1 center. During 2005, 445 hospitalizations with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia codes were identified. For 45 patients, the main diagnosis was heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; for the remaining 400 patients, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia occurred during the <b>hospital</b> stay. <b>Tariffs</b> and extra costs were used to estimate an overall average cost of 3230 for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. For patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia as main diagnosis, the average cost was 3400; for the patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia that occurred during the stay, 1910 was due to an increased of the tariff and 3348 to an increased length of stay. Estimated direct costs of an episode were 3350 to 3700. Different methods were used to arrive at an estimated cost of 3500 for a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia episode for inpatients. One limitation of the study is that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia tends to be underreported by physicians during hospitalization...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The English National Health Service is {{introducing}} a new activity based funding system for paying hospitals and other providers {{for the work}} they do. The key differences to previous financing arrangements are that prices are fixed nationally {{in the form of}} a <b>tariff,</b> <b>hospital</b> revenue is directly proportional to activity and activity ceilings have been relaxed. This paper draws on economic theory and empirical evidence to explore the role of incentives and information in the successful implementation of the new hospital funding system in the NHS. Methodology. Case studies in two Strategic Health Authorities comprising in-depth interviews with key stakeholders and analysis of background statistics and documentation. Findings. The structure of tariffs under Payment by Results (PbR) provides high powered incentives for providers to increase activity because they are rewarded for hospital activity, and payments for increases in activity are made at full average cost. However, there is a danger that hospitals will increase activity beyond affordable levels and possibly induce demand inappropriately. Although many interviewees were positive about PbR and some cited specific examples of how PbR had enabled them to engineer changes in services, there is a real danger that PbR could induce a range of negative responses such as increases in unplanned readmissions to hospital and a worsening in provider – commissioner relations and joint planning. Practical implications. In future, as PbR is extended, it will be important to monitor its intended and unintended effects. Such evaluation should consider the extent to which commissioners are able to live within their budgets and whether hospitals are engaging in opportunistic behaviour and gaming the new funding system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe main {{disadvantage}} of the surgical management of early onset scoliosis (EOS) using conventional growing rods {{is the need}} for iterative surgical procedures during childhood. The emergence of an innovative device using distraction-based magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGR) provides the opportunity to avoid such surgeries and therefore to improve the patient's quality of life. HypothesisDespite the high cost of MCGR and considering its potential impact in reducing hospital stays, the use of MCGR could reduce medical resource consumption in a long-term view in comparison to traditional growing rod (TGR). Materials and methodsA cost-simulation model was constructed to assess the incremental cost between the two strategies. The cost for each strategy was estimated based on probability of medical resource consumption determined from literature search as well as data from EOS patients treated in our centre. Some medical expenses were also estimated from expert interviews. The time horizon chosen was 4 years as from first surgical implantation. Costs were calculated in the perspective of the French sickness fund (using rates from year 2013) and were discounted by an annual rate of 4 %. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test model strength to various parameters. ResultsWith a time horizon of 4 years, the estimated direct costs of TGR and MCGR strategies were 49, 067 € and 42, 752 €, respectively leading to an incremental costs of 6135 € in favour of MCGR strategy. In the first case, costs were mainly represented by hospital stays expenses (83. 9 %) whereas in the other the cost of MCGR contributed to 59. 5 % of the total amount. In the univariate sensitivity analysis, the <b>tariffs</b> of <b>hospital</b> stays, the <b>tariffs</b> of the MCG, and the frequency of distraction surgeries were the parameters with the most important impact on incremental cost. DiscussionMCGR is a recent and promising innovation in the management of severe EOS. Besides improving the quality of life, its use in the treatment of severe EOS is likely to be offset by lower costs of hospital stays.

40|$|Effekter av utvidet slagbehandling og samarbeid på tvers av forvaltningsnivå. Hjerneslag er en av de hyppigste årsaker til alvorlig funksjonshemming og død i Norge, i tillegg at sykdommen medfører betydelige samfunnsmessige kostnader. Forekomsten er ca. 14 000 hjerneslag pr. år, og antallet forventes å øke betraktelig i årene fremover da antall eldre over 65 år vil øke sterkt. Det er en stor utfordring å organisere helsetjenesten slik at behandlingstilbudet for denne pasientgruppen blir best mulig. Akuttbehandling i slagenhet er i dag det best dokumenterte behandlingstiltak, men effekten av videre rehabilitering og oppfølging har vært et lite prioritert område for forskning. Hovedhensikten med denne avhandlingen har vært å framskaffe mer kunnskap om hva som kan oppnås for slagpasienter ved en systematisk organisering og samarbeid mellom sykehus og primærhelsetjeneste når det gjelder behandling og rehabilitering etter akuttbehandling i slagenhet. Studien som ligger til grunn for avhandlingen ble gjennomført ved Seksjon for hjerneslag, Medisinsk avdeling, St. Olavs Hospital i perioden 1995 - 1998. Intervensjonen var å konstruere en ny behandlingskjede for slagpasienter hvor fokus på bedre samarbeid med primærhelsetjenesten, oppfølging av et ambulerende team, tidlig utreise fra sykehus og rehabilitering med utgangspunkt i hjemmet ble sterkt vektlagt. Den konstruerte behandlingskjeden ble evaluert med tanke på helsegevinst for den enkelte og bedre ressursutnytting sammenlignet med det tradisjonelle behandlingstilbudet. Studien ble gjennomført som en klinisk randomisert kontrollert studie der 320 pasienter med akutt hjerneslag ble inkludert. 160 pasienter fikk ordinær slagenhet behandling med videre institusjonsrehabilitering og/eller oppfølging av primærhelsetjenesten, mens de øvrige 160 pasienter fikk oppfølging av et ambulerende team i henhold til den nye og konstruerte behandlingskjeden. I de fire arbeidene som inngår i avhandlingen er det sett på risiko for alvorlig funksjonshemning og død, endring i funksjonsnivå og livskvalitet, samt kostnadsanalyser og ressursforbruk av helsetjenester. Pasientene i de to gruppene ble undersøkt og sammenlignet 6 og 12 måneder etter sykdomsdebut. Resultatene av studien viste at sammenlignet med tradisjonell behandling oppnådde pasientene i intervensjonsgruppen signifikant bedre funksjonsnivå (p= 0. 017) og redusert risiko for alvorlig funksjonshemning og død (p= 0. 044) etter ett år. De viste også tendens til bedret livskvalitet samtidig som initial liggetid i institusjon ble redusert med 40 % (p= 0. 032). Det var ingen økning i totalt ressursforbruk eller kostnader i intervensjonsgruppen. Oppsummert viser avhandlingen at en slagbehandlingskjede med fokus på samarbeid på tvers av forvaltningsnivå, oppfølging av et ambulerende team og rehabilitering mens pasientene bor hjemme gir meget positiv effekt. Den kliniske betydning av disse resultater er at en oppfølging i form av en slagbehandlingskjede i tillegg til akutt behandling i slagenhet bør inngå som en integrert del av behandlingstilbudet for denne pasientgruppen.

Extended Stroke Unit Service and Early Supported Discharge. Short and Long-term Effects. Background {{and purpose}} Stroke imposes a {{considerable}} burden for patients, their caregivers {{and the society}} worldwide. It {{is a challenge to}} organise the healthcare service that can provide effective management of patients who have suffered from stroke. Several trials have shown that stroke unit care improves the outcome for stroke patients. More limited information exists about {{the most effective way to}} organise the follow-up care after the acute care in a stroke unit. Stroke patients conventionally receive a substantial part of their rehabilitation in hospital or in other institutions that offer 24 hours-stay. The primary aim of this thesis was to increase knowledge about the organising of follow-up care for stroke patients after the acute care in a stroke unit. To achieve this we performed a trial to evaluate the short and long-term effects of an extended stroke unit service (ESUS), with early supported discharge from hospital, co-operation with the primary health care, and more emphasize on rehabilitation at home as essential elements. Methods We performed a randomized controlled trial in which 320 acute stroke patients admitted to the Stroke Unit at St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital were included and allocated either to ordinary stroke unit care (OSUS) (160 patients) with further in-patient rehabilitation or follow-up from the primary healthcare service, or to stroke unit care with early supported discharge (160 patients). The ESUS consisted of a mobile team which co-ordinate early supported discharge and further rehabilitation. Included in this thesis are 4 papers based on data from this study population of acute stroke patients followed in one year after the onset of stroke. We wanted to compare the groups in relation to independency, quality of life (QoL) and resource use and costs. • Functional outcome were measured as the proportion of patients who were independent as assessed by modified Rankin Scale (RS) (RS 95 = independent in ADL) at 26 weeks and 52 weeks, the differences in final residence and analyses to identify patients who benefited most of an early supported discharge service (paper I and II). All assessments were blinded. • The outcome of QoL was measured by the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) at 52 weeks. Other outcomes measured at 52 weeks were differences between the groups according to social activity, depression, cognitive function and the burden for carers’. (paper III). • The use of all health services during the first 52 weeks was recorded prospectively in both groups; its costs were measured as service costs and represent a combination of calculated average costs and <b>tariffs.</b> <b>Hospital</b> expenses were measured as costs per inpatient day. The secondary objectives were to explore differences in costs between the groups with respect to different types of services, time of service delivery and stroke severity (paper IV). Results • Extended stroke unit service with early supported discharge and co-ordination by a mobile team improves functional outcome 6 months and 12 months after stroke. The Odds Ratio for independence at one year was 1. 56 (95 % C. I, 1. 01 -to 2. 44). It was most beneficial for patients with moderate stroke (papers I and II). • Extended stroke unit service with early supported discharge can improve long-term quality of life measured by global NHP. The ESUS group had a significant better QoL after one year than the OSUS group (p = 0. 048). There were no significant differences between the groups in the secondary outcomes social activity, depression and cognitive function. The caregivers who got their patients early at home did not report an increased burden compared to caregivers whose patients became ordinary stroke unit care (paper III). • The length of initial institutional stay (hospital and rehab. clinic) were reduced with 40 % for the patients offered extended stroke unit service (18. 6 days in the ESUS versus 31. 1 days in the OSUS) (p= 0. 032). There was also a reduction in average number of total inpatient days during the first year in favour of the ESD group (p = 0. 012) (paper IV). • The total health services costs for ESUS was equal or less than costs for ordinary care during the first year after stroke. There was a non-significant reduction in total mean service costs in the ESUS group (EUR 18937 / EUR 21824). The service seemed to be most cost effective for patients with moderate severity of stroke (23 % lower mean costs compared to OSUS). The important cost savings caused by reduced length of institutional stay did not lead to an increase in costs for home-based rehabilitation (paper IV). Conclusion An extended stroke unit service with early supported discharge improved functional outcome and reduced the length of stay in institutions compared to traditional stroke unit care. It also seems that this service can improve long-term quality of life. The costs are equal or less than costs for ordinary care. An early, well organised discharge from hospital co-ordinated by a mobile team seems to be an important contribution in the treatment of stroke patients and should be considered, in addition to organised in-patient stroke unit care, as a part of a comprehensive stroke care...|$|R
