50|$|Pitch {{is often}} defined as {{extending}} along a one-dimensional continuum from high to low, {{as can be}} experienced by sweeping one’s hand up or down a piano keyboard. This continuum is known as pitch height. However pitch also varies in a circular fashion, known as pitch class: as one plays up a keyboard in semitone steps, C, C, D, D, E, F, F, <b>G,</b> <b>G,</b> <b>A,</b> A and B sound in succession, followed by C again, but one octave higher. Because the octave is the most consonant interval after the unison, tones that stand in octave relation, and are so of the same pitch class, have a certain perceptual equivalence - all Cs sound more alike to other Cs than to any other pitch class, as do all Ds, and so on; this creates the auditory equivalent of a Barber's pole.|$|E

Using these it is possible to characterize inclusions in section 3 and to show that two spaces of this type coincide if and only if their parameters are equal. In section 4 the existence of approximate identities in these algebras is established, from which, among other consequences, the bijection between the closed ideals of these algebras and those of the corresponding Beurling algebra is derived...|$|E

Our class of homogeneous spaces also includes the open orbits of the well-known determinantal varieties and the varieties of (circular) complexes.
