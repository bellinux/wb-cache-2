5000|$|Historically in Europe, rebar is {{composed}} of mild steel material with a yield strength of approximately 250 MPa (36 ksi). Modern rebar {{is composed}} of <b>high-yield</b> <b>steel,</b> with a yield strength more typically 500 MPa (72.5 ksi). Rebar can be supplied with various grades of ductility. The more ductile steel is capable of absorbing considerably more energy when deformed - a behavior that resists earthquake forces and is used in design. These high yield strength ductile steels are usually produced using the TEMPCORE process, a method of thermomechanical processing. The manufacture of reinforcing steel by re-rolling finished products (e.g. sheets or rails) is not allowed. In contrast to structural steel, rebar steel grades are not harmonized yet across Europe, each country having their own national standards. However some standardization of specification and testing methods exist under EN 10080 and EN ISO 15630: ...|$|E

40|$|Beam-column joints of {{reinforced}} concrete structures are common exterior moment resisting fkame in buildings. Understanding the complex behavior of this joint method under repeated load is crucial {{because of their}} basic materials have limited strengths that can cause the limited force carrying capacity. This study was focus {{on the performance of}} beam column joint subjected to repeated reversed load. Three specimens of {{reinforced concrete}} (RC) exterior beam-column joint with different steel detail arrangement had been prepared and tested under repeated reversed load. All beam-column joint specimens were designed in accordance to BS 8110 and the types of joint were exterior joint. First specimen was the control specimen where no additional shear link on beam reinforcement and no anchorages of bars were tied between beam and column. Second speciment consist of additional shear link on beam reinforcement with 75 mm spacing which is closer then specimen 1 and 3. Third specimen introduced cross-bracing of reinforcement bars at the intersection of beam-column joint. In this study, failure load, beam displacement, stiffness, strain value of steel reinforcement, mode of failure had been presented. The repeated reversed loads were applied to the end of cantilever beam. The dimension for each column was 300 x 300 x 1500 mm, and the cantilever beam with dimension, 300 x 150 x 1000 rnm was located at the mid-height of column. <b>High-yield</b> <b>steel</b> was utilized for all main reinforcement with 8 T 16 bars for column rebar and 4 T 16 for cantilever RC beam. Mild steel type was used for all steel links. In addition, 30 grade of concrete was employed and the concrete design was based on JKR mix design method. The result of this study shown that the best performances of RC beam column joint is third specimen which is can be explained that cross bracing joint of the beam-column joint is the greatest type of joint among the three specimen of joint since it showed the well performance under seismic condition...|$|E

5000|$|Submarine {{pipelines}} generally vary {{in diameter}} from 3 in for gas lines, to 72 in for high capacity lines. Wall thicknesses typically range from 10 mm to 75 mm. The pipe {{can be designed}} for fluids at high temperature and pressure. The walls are made from <b>high-yield</b> strength <b>steel,</b> 350-500 MPa (50,000-70,000 psi), weldability {{being one of the}} main selection criteria. The structure is often shielded against external corrosion by coatings such as bitumastic or epoxy, supplemented by cathodic protection with sacrificial anodes. [...] Concrete or fiberglass wrapping provides further protection against abrasion. The addition of a concrete coating is also useful to compensate for the pipeline's negative buoyancy when it carries lower density substances.|$|R
40|$|Magnetoacoustic {{emission}} (MAE) is {{a phenomenon}} where acoustic noise is generated due to the motion of non- 180 magnetic domain walls in a ferromagnet with non-zero magnetostrictive constants. MAE has been studied extensively {{for many years and}} has even been applied as an NDE tool for characterizing the heat treatment of <b>high-yield</b> low carbon <b>steels.</b> A complete theory which fully accounts for the magnetoacoustic response, however, has not yet emerged. The motion of the domain walls appears to be a totally random process, however, it does exhibit features of regularity which have been identified by studying phenomena such as 1 /f flicker noise and self-organized criticality (SOC). In this paper, a probabilistic model incorporating the effects of SOC has been developed to help explain the MAE response. The model uses many simplifying assumptions yet yields good qualitative agreement with observed experimental results and also provides some insight into the possible underlying mechanisms responsible for MAE. We begin by providing a brief overview of magnetoacoustic emission and the experimental set-up used to obtain the MAE signal. We then describe a pseudo-probabilistic model used to predict the MAE response and give an example of the predicted result. Finally, the model is modified to account for SOC and the new predictions are shown and compared with experiment...|$|R

Tensile strength tests {{were carried out}} on various sizes steel and bamboo categories of reinforcement bars such as 10 mm 12 mm 16 mm 20 mm and 25 mm of both high-yield and mild-yield steel reinforcement bars were both tested along with same sizes of bamboo with 10 mm cross-sectional thickness. Results are presented in tables and graphs and show that the tensile strength of <b>high-yield</b> <b>steel</b> bars outstrips that of mild-yield and bamboo respectively. The study finds that the breaking force FB for 10 mm HY 24. 42 KN tensile strength 457. 13 Nmm 2 yield stress 379. 02 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 39. 67 mm respectively. For 12 mm HY breaking force FB 52. 14 KN tensile strength 689. 12 Nmm 2 yield stress 551. 30 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 36. 58 mm. 16 mm HY results in breaking force FB 126. 67 KN tensile strength 771. 61 Nmm 2 yield stress 494. 10 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 70. 87 mm. The same factors for 20 mm yields breaking force FB 163. 97 KN tensile strength 713. 40 Nmm 2 yield stress 614. 74 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 61. 57 mm. While the 25 mm HY produces breaking force FB 306. 17 KN tensile strength 792. 90 Nmm 2 yield stress 678. 46 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 52. 36 mm respectively. Mild Steel MY 10 mm yields breaking force FB 14. 76 KN tensile strength 290. 49 Nmm 2 yield stress 233. 17 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 78. 86 mm. 12 mm MY results in breaking force 40. 35 KN tensile strength 508. 08 Nmm 2 yield stress 376. 17 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 84. 10 mm. 16 mm MY yields breaking force FB 79. 72 KN tensile strength 508. 71 Nmm 2 yield stress 349. 10 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 111. 39 mm respectively. For 20 mm mild steel breaking force FB 83. 04 KN tensile strength 372. 98 Nmm 2 yield stress 284. 64 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 47. 40 mm. While the 25 mm MY steel bar results show breaking force FB 163. 04 KN tensile strength 701. 74 Nmm 2 yield stress 599. 77 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 56. 84 mm. On the other hand bamboo yields for the same size width and constant thickness of 10 mm the 10 mm- 25 mm bamboo sizes result as 10 mm bamboo breaking force FB - 2. 1 KN tensile strength 31. 55 Nmm 2 yield stress 0. 00 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 0. 00 mm. 12 mm width with 10 mm thickness yields breaking force FB - 1. 28 KN tensile strength 31. 07 Nmm 2 yield stress 0. 00 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 0. 00 mm. 16 mm bamboo breaking force 1. 85 KN tensile strength 68. 82 Nmm 2 yield stress 49. 45 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 30. 40 mm. For the 20 mm width size bamboo with same 10 mm thickness breaking force FB - 0. 12 KN tensile strength 62. 66 Nmm 2 yield stress 50. 23 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 18. 20 mm respectively. Finally the 25 mm bamboo size gives breaking force FB 4. 76 KN tensile strength 94. 60 Nmm 2 yield stress 50. 19 Nmm 2 and breaking elongation 21. 11 mm. The study concludes that due to the minimal breaking force FB of bamboo it cannot be employed as a main structural member in building and other engineering works but {{can be used as}} portioning wall ceiling roof and other areas of engineering construction that is not heavy load-bearing...|$|E
40|$|High-strength {{low alloy}} steels (HSLA) have been {{designed}} to replace <b>high-yield</b> (HY) strength <b>steels</b> in naval applications involving impact loading as the latter, which contain more carbon, require complicated welding processes. The critical role of HSLA- 100 steel requires achieving an accurate understanding of its behavior under dynamic loading. Accordingly, in this paper, we experimentally investigate its behavior, establish a model for its constitutive response at high-strain rates, and discuss its dynamic failure mode. The large strain and high-strain-rate mechanical constitutive behavior of high strength low alloy steel HSLA- 100 is experimentally characterized over a wide range of strain rates, ranging from 10 ^(− 3) s^(− 1) to 10 ^ 4 s^(− 1). The ability of HSLA- 100 steel to store energy of cold work in adiabatic conditions is assessed through the direct measurement of the fraction of plastic energy converted into heat. The susceptibility of HSLA- 100 steel to failure due to the formation and development of adiabatic shear bands (ASB) is investigated from two perspectives, the well-accepted failure strain criterion and the newly suggested plastic energy criterion [1]. Our experimental results show that HSLA- 100 steel has apparent strain rate sensitivity at rates exceeding 3000 s^(− 1) and has minimal ability to store energy of cold work at high deformation rate. In addition, both strain based and energy based failure criteria are effective in describing the propensity of HSLA- 100 steel to dynamic failure (adiabatic shear band). Finally, we use the experimental results to determine constants for a Johnson-Cook model describing the constitutive response of HSLA- 100. The implementation of this model in a commercial finite element code gives predictions capturing properly the observed experimental behavior.
