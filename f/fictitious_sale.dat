5|$|The day before, the Ottoman {{government}} had proposed to Wangenheim that a fictitious {{purchase of the}} German ships be arranged, so their presence would not compromise Ottoman neutrality. The next day the German Chancellor had cabled Wagenheim, rejecting the idea and demanding that the Ottomans immediately join the war. The Grand Vizier accosted Wagenheim on the premature arrival of the ships and repeated the demand for a <b>fictitious</b> <b>sale.</b> The Ottoman government subsequently declared that it had purchased both ships for 80 million German marks. On 14 August, Wagenheim advised the German government {{that it would be}} best to go along with the sale, lest they risk angering the Ottomans.|$|E

"I write, Angela, {{to ask you}} {{to marry}} me it is true (since, [...] unfortunately, my health will not allow me to ask you in person), [...] but it is a very {{different}} offer from that which I made you in the [...] lane when you so bitterly refused me. Now I am solely anxious that [...] the marriage should take place in order that I may be enabled to [...] avoid the stringent provisions of your grandfather's will, which, [...] whilst forbidding me to leave these estates back to your father or [...] his issue, fortunately does not forbid a <b>fictitious</b> <b>sale</b> and the [...] settlement of the sum, or otherwise. But I will not trouble you [...] with these legal details.|$|E

5000|$|One {{of three}} forms of manus {{marriage}} was coemptio, which, according to Gary Forsythe, {{seems to have}} existed in the mid-5th century BC and into the CE 2nd century. According to Gardner and Marcia L. Colish, coemptio was in essence a <b>fictitious</b> notional <b>sale</b> of the woman to the husband that could occur {{at any time during}} their marriage, thus, if after marriage, a <b>fictitious</b> notional <b>sale</b> of the wife to her own husband. According to du Plessis, [...] "a ceremonial resale of the wife terminated marriage by coemptio (and probably by usus, too)", as a reversal of the marriage procedure.|$|R
50|$|The company Romstrade {{entered in}} a scandal, after its administrator, Nelu Iordache, changed, without observing the legal provisions, the {{destination}} of 25,000,000 lei, money encashed {{for the design}} and execution of {{the first section of}} Arad-Nădlac motorway, work being funded at least 85% from the Cohesion Fund of the European Union. The greater part, namely 9,724,780 lei of the amount intended for motorway construction, was to be used to pay debts of companies in which he was directly concerned, payments made under contracts that are not related to performance of the contract for motorway. Another 9,861,000 lei were withdrawn in cash for the acquisition of land in the commune of Adunații-Copăceni, based on <b>fictitious</b> <b>sales</b> and purchase pre-contracts. In this way, the Bucharest Court Magistrates decided the arresting for 29 days of businessman Nelu Iordache.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I! It {{makes no}} {{difference}} to me what name I give her. Bother your sentiment! let's {{go on with the}} facts. This is what the lawyer did before the second trial came off. He told her she would be found guilty again, to a dead certainty. 'And this time,' he said, 'the public will let the law take its course. Have you got an old friend whom you can trust?' She hadn't such a thing as an old friend in the world. 'Very well, then,' says the lawyer, you must trust me. Sign this paper; and you will have executed a <b>fictitious</b> <b>sale</b> of all your property to myself. When the right time comes, I shall first carefully settle with your husband's executors; and I shall then reconvey the money to you, securing it properly (in case you ever marry again) in your own possession. The Crown, in other transactions of this kind, frequently waives its right of disputing the validity of the sale; and, if the Crown is no harder on you than on other people, when you come out of prison you will have your five thousand pounds to begin the world with again.' Neat of the lawyer, when {{she was going to be}} tried for robbing the executors, to put her up to a way of robbing the Crown, wasn't it? Ha! ha! what a world it is!" ...|$|E
6000|$|This man, {{besides his}} office of dewan to the Calcutta Committee, {{which gave him}} the whole {{management}} {{and power of the}} revenue, was, as I have stated, at the head of all the registers in the kingdom, whose duty {{it was to be a}} control upon him as dewan. As Mr. Hastings destroyed every other constitutional settlement of the country, so the office which was to be a check upon Gunga Govind Sing, namely, the register of the country, had been superseded, and revived in another shape, and given to the own son of this very man. God forbid that a son should not be under a certain and reasonable subordination! But though in this country we know a son may possibly be free from the control of his father, yet the meanest slave is not in a more abject condition of slavery than a son is in that country to his father; for it extends to the power of a Roman parent. The office of register is to take care that a full and fair rent is secured to government; and above all, it is his business to take care of the body of laws, the Rawaj-ul-Mulk, or custom of the country, of which he is the guardian as the head of the law. It was his business to secure that fundamental law of the government, and fundamental law of the country, that a zemindary cannot be split, or any portion of it separated, without the consent of the government. This man betrayed his trust, and did privately, contrary to the duty of his office, get this minor Rajah, who was but an infant, who was but nine years old at the time, to make over to him a part of his zemindary, to a large amount, under color of a fraudulent and <b>fictitious</b> <b>sale.</b> By the laws of that country, by the common laws of Nature, the act of this child was void. The act was void as against the government, by giving a zemindary without the consent of the government to the very man who ought to have prevented such an act. He has the same sacred guardianship of minors that the Chancellor of England has. This man got to himself those lands by a fraudulent, and probably forged deed,--for that is charged too; but whether it was forged or not, this miserable minor was obliged to give the lands to him: he did not dare to quarrel with him upon such an article; because he who would purchase could take. The next step was to get one of his nearest relations to seem to give a consent; because taking it of the minor was too gross. The relation, who could no more consent by the law of that country than the law of this, gave apparently his consent. And these were the very lands that Mr. Hastings speaks of as [...] "lands entirely at the disposal of government." ...|$|E
50|$|Roman {{and civil}} law {{recognized}} {{a type of}} contract called fiducia (also contractus fiduciae or fiduciary contract),involving essentially a sale to a person coupled with an agreement that the purchaser should sell the property back upon the fulfillment of certain conditions.

Under Roman law a woman could arrange a <b>fictitious</b> <b>sale</b> called a fiduciary coemption in order to change her guardian or gain legal capacity to make a will.|$|E
50|$|The matrimonial {{process of}} coemptio was in essence a <b>fictitious</b> {{notional}} <b>sale</b> {{of the woman}} to the husband. Coemptio occurred at any time throughout marriage. This was a process of mancipation. The transaction occurred with a scales-holder and {{in the presence of}} at least five witnesses, all of whom were adult male Roman citizens.|$|R
40|$|It remains {{challenging}} for information visualization novices to rapidly construct visualizations during exploratory data analysis. We conducted an exploratory laboratory {{study in which}} information visualization novices explored <b>fictitious</b> <b>sales</b> data by communicating visualization specifications to a human mediator, who rapidly constructed the visualizations using commercial visualization software. We found that three activities were central to the iterative visualization construction process: data attribute selection, visual template selection, and visual mapping specification. The major barriers faced by the participants were translating questions into data attributes, designing visual mappings, and interpreting the visualizations. Partial specification was common, and the participants used simple heuristics and preferred visualizations they were already familiar with, such as bar, line and pie charts. From our observations, we derived abstract models that describe barriers in the data exploration process and uncovered how information visualization novices think about visualization specifications. Our findings support the need for tools that suggest potential visualizations and support iterative refinement, that provide explanations and help with learning, and that are tightly integrated into tool support for the overall visual analytics process...|$|R
50|$|The ancient theatre at Delphi {{was built}} further {{up the hill}} from the Temple of Apollo giving spectators {{a view of the}} entire {{sanctuary}} and the valley below. It was originally built in the 4th century BC but was remodeled on several occasions, particularly in 160/159 B.C. at the expenses of king Eumenes II of Pergamon and in 67 A.D. on the occasion of emperor Nero's visit.The koilon (cavea) leans against the natural slope of the mountain whereas its eastern part overrides a little torrent which led the water of the fountain Cassotis right underneath the temple of Apollo. The orchestra was initially a full circle with a diameter measuring 7 meters. The rectangular scene building ended up in two arched openings, of which the foundations are preserved today. Access to the theatre was possible through the parodoi, i.e. the side corridors. On the support walls of the parodoi are engraved large numbers of manumission inscriptions recording <b>fictitious</b> <b>sales</b> of the slaves to the god.The koilon was divided horizontally in two zones via a corridor called diazoma. The lower zone had 27 rows of seats and the upper one only 8. Six radially arranged stairs divided {{the lower part of the}} koilon in seven tiers. The theatre could accommodate about 4,500 spectators.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 August, the Grand Vizier {{requested}} that the Goeben be transferred to Turkish control [...] "by means of a fictitious sale"; the government in Berlin refused. On the afternoon of 10 August, before any agreement had been reached, the German ships reached the entry of the Dardanelles, and Enver authorized their admittance into the Straits. The Vizier objected {{that the presence of}} the ships was premature and could trigger an Entente declaration of war before the necessary agreement with Bulgaria had been reached. He renewed his request for a <b>fictitious</b> <b>sale.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Stoa of the Athenians {{is built}} against the {{polygonal}} wall supporting the terrace {{of the temple}} of Apollo. The monument has been identified through the inscription of the stylobate: Ἀθεναῖοι ἀνέθεσαν τὲν στοὰν καί τὰ ℎόπλ̣α καὶ τἀκροτέρια ℎελόντες τōν πολεμίον Athenians dedicated the portico and the ropes and the figure heads of the ships that they seized from the enemies.The [...] "ropes" [...] mentioned in the inscription refer probably to those snatched from Persian ships. On a three-stepped stylobate measuring 26.5 meters long and 3.10 meters wide stand seven monolithic fluted columns of the Ionic order. They are made of Pentelic marble and their bases are made of Paros marble. They are 3.31 meters high.The distance between them is quite large, thus creating openings allowing ample light to enter the building, which was probably covered with a wooden roof. Τhe stylobate and the colonnade have been restored colonnade and are extant today in situ. On the polygonal wall {{at the back of}} the stoa, particularly on the western part of it, have been carved about six hundred manumission inscriptions, in the form of <b>fictitious</b> <b>sale</b> of slaves to the god. Most probably, the portico was constructed after the naval victories against the Persians at Mykale and Sestos in 478 B.C. [...] It was used for storing the war spoils, mainly from naval victories against the Persians. War spoils from naval battles at Mykale, Sestos, Salamis and the Hellespont were included.|$|E
60|$|Against {{this small}} {{advantage}} {{is to be}} set, in the first place, the possibility of fraudulent tampering {{with the price of}} bullion for the sake of acting on the currency, in the manner of the <b>fictitious</b> <b>sales</b> of corn, to influence the averages, so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force. But a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle, intelligible to the most untaught capacity. Everybody can understand convertibility; every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five [dollars] is worth five [dollars]. Regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea, and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations. There would be nothing like the same confidence, by the public generally, in an inconvertible currency so regulated, as in a convertible one: and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to. The grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public, opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity, and, in any circumstances of difficulty, would be likely to turn against it; while to the Government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule. There is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible, in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible, currency. The temptation to over-issue, in certain financial emergencies, is so strong, that nothing is admissible which can tend, in however slight a degree, to weaken the barriers that restrain it.|$|R
