5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age of}} two, and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the <b>juicing</b> industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
5|$|In Britain the Scottish Crop Research Institute was {{tasked with}} {{developing}} new varieties suitable for {{growing in the}} north of the country. They produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance, especially in the spring, ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance. Frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus. 'Ben Lomond' {{was the first of the}} 'Ben' varieties and was released in 1975. This was followed by several other cultivars for the <b>juicing</b> industry such as 'Ben Alder' and 'Ben Tirran'. The cultivar 'Ben Hope' was released in 1998 with increased tolerance to gall mite, and in the same year, 'Ben Gairn' became available. It shows resistance to the reversion virus. For gardeners and the pick-your-own market, 'Ben Sarek', 'Ben Connan' and 'Big Ben' were introduced and have large, sweet berries. The cultivars 'Ben Connan', 'Ben Lomond' and 'Ben Sarek' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance, disease resistance, machine harvesting, fruit quality, nutritional content and fruit flavour.|$|E
25|$|This {{is a large}} {{topic of}} study. It refers to any {{productive}} extraction and includes <b>juicing</b> {{of fruits and vegetables}} and wringing (desirable fluids) out of cloths, as the juice or water inside the fruit is considered 'desirable' for these purposes, while the pulp of the fruit would be the 'undesirable.' As such, squeezing (S'chita) is forbidden unless certain rules are applied. The wringing of undesirable water out of cloths may come under the law of Melabain (Scouring/Laundering). One could view this activity as extraction, while Borer (separation) is more akin to purification.|$|E

The iconic tunnel fountains developed by the Sparks Group were unique to the Bubbleworks at the time.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of study are determination vitamin C content in three commercial fruit <b>juices</b> (apple, guava and mango) using titration method. Beside that, comparing vitamin C content determined {{and to that}} stated on the label for each fruit <b>juice</b> sample. To relate the amount of vitamin C present {{at the time of}} consumption based on the expired date. Sample to determine vitamin C is apple <b>juice,</b> mango <b>juice</b> and guava <b>juice</b> in commercial fruit <b>juice</b> on different expiry date. From different expiry date can get different shelf life before expired days. Method to determine vitamin C in commercial fruit <b>juice</b> is titration method with iodine solution.

From the result the higher amount of vitamin C was guava <b>juice</b> about 183 g/ 100 mL for nature fruit and 20. 25 g/ 100 mL for commercial fruit <b>juice.</b> Following mango <b>juice</b> was about 28 g/ 100 mL for nature fruit and 16. 40 for commercial fruit <b>juice.</b> The lower amount of vitamin C was apple <b>juice</b> about 6 g/ 100 mL for nature fruit and 5. 33 g/ 100 mL for commercial fruit <b>juice.</b> However mango <b>juice</b> and guava <b>juice</b> were suitable to drinking compared apple <b>juices</b> because apple <b>juice</b> has lower vitamin C contained and the higher loss of vitamin C content.

5000|$|There {{are many}} methods of <b>juicing,</b> from {{squeezing}} fruit by hand to wide-scale extraction with industrial equipment. <b>Juicing</b> is generally the preferred method of consuming {{large amounts of}} produce quickly and is often completed with a household appliance called a juicer, which may {{be as simple as}} a cone upon which fruit is mashed or as sophisticated as a variable-speed, motor-driven device. It may also refer to the act of extracting and then drinking juice or those who extract the juice.Juicing is different from buying juice in the supermarket because it focuses on fresh pressed fruits and vegetables. Residential <b>juicing</b> is often practiced for dietary reasons or as a form of alternative medicine. Becoming first popular in the early 1990s, interests in <b>juicing</b> has soared in the last decade due to a number of books, videos, and claims, as well as, the quick dissemination due to the Internet.

40|$|Colour {{is one of}} {{the main}} sensory {{characteristics}} of berry <b>juice</b> and fruit products and this parameter also powerfully impacts on consumer behaviour. However, the colour of berry <b>juices</b> is unstable and degradation occurs during storage. The main objectives of the project were: to determine the mechanism by which boysenberry <b>juice</b> enhances the colour of other berry <b>juices</b> and to determine if its addition to berry <b>juices</b> will also stabilise the anthocyanin pigments and enhance copigmentation. In this study, total anthocyanin, total phenolic acids, hyperchromic and bathochromic shift and the rate of colour degradation was measured by spectrophotometric techniques. Individual anthocyanin and phenolic acid content were measured in each <b>juice</b> by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were evaluated during storage at 5, 20 and 35 ?C. Boysenberry <b>juice</b> improved the colour of blackcurrant, cranberry and pomegranate <b>juices</b> immediately after addition; however, only blackcurrant <b>juice</b> colour was stable during storage at 5 ?C. There was no influence on the stability of total anthocyanins in pomegranate or cranberry <b>juices</b> when boysenberry <b>juice</b> was added. Of the three <b>juices,</b> pomegranate had the highest rate of degradation. The total anthocyanin of blackcurrant enhanced with boysenberry <b>juice</b> was more stable than for cranberry and pomegranate <b>juices.</b> The impact of phenolic acids found in boysenberry <b>juice</b> (kaemferol, quercetin and ellagic acid) on blackcurrant <b>juice</b> colour stability was also investigated. The colour stability of blackcurrant <b>juice</b> was improved by the addition of ellagic acid at 5 ?C; however, the colour intensity of blackcurrant enhanced with kaemferol and quercetin decreased with storage. The copigmentations between anthocyanins themselves were not found to be a significant effect on colour stability of blackcurrant <b>juice.</b> Ellagic acid had the strongest colour improvement in blackcurrant <b>juice</b> compared to boysenberry <b>juice.</b> In conclusion, ellagic acid as found in boysenberry <b>juice</b> formed intermolecular copigmentation with blackcurrant <b>juice</b> anthocyanins, so this resulted in stabilised <b>juice</b> colour during storage; however, the effect was found when the <b>juice</b> was stored at 5 ?C only...|$|R
