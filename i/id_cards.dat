An electronic signature, provided by a private company, can also be stored on the chip.|$|E

5|$|In the 2005 {{session of}} the General Assembly, Daniels and Republicans, with some Democratic support, {{successfully}} enacted a voter registration law that required voters to show a government issued photo ID before they could be permitted to vote. The law {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States, and many civil rights organizations, like the ACLU, opposed the bill saying it would unfairly impact minorities, poor, and elderly voters who may be unable to afford an ID or may be physically unable to apply for an ID. To partially address those concerns, the state passed another law authorizing state license branches to offer free state photo <b>ID</b> <b>cards</b> to individuals who did not already possess another type of state ID.|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{were held}} {{six days a}} week at the Pushkin Theatre, usually from 10am to 1pm. They were {{frequently}} interrupted by air-raid sirens, and some musicians were required to undertake anti-aircraft or firefighting duties. To enable them to attend rehearsals, performers were granted orchestral <b>ID</b> <b>cards</b> to show at checkpoints. Members of the military orchestra (and some ordinary troops) were dispatched to the rehearsals to supplement the performers. Rehearsals were moved to the Philharmonia Hall in June, and in late July were increased to 5–6 hours a day. Instruments were in poor condition and few repairmen were available; one oboist was asked for a cat in exchange for a repair, as the starving repairman had already eaten several.|$|E

40|$|Datas {{which are}} stored in Indonesia National <b>ID</b> <b>Card</b> are common usually used in several {{administration}} process. In {{order to be able}} to extract the data a program which can segment the <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> area out of an image is needed. The first step of this method is to extract only the area of National <b>ID</b> <b>Card.</b> The area of National <b>ID</b> <b>Card</b> is determined using blueness level of every pixel. Then Canny Edge Detection is used to mark the edges of National <b>ID</b> <b>Card,</b> which later processed by using dilation to thicken the edges. The next step involves converting the image into binary image. By dividing each edge into twelve partitions and using lines to mark each edge. That way the area of National <b>ID</b> <b>Card</b> is extracted from the image by using certain fixed ratio. The application which is used in this paper can determine the area of National <b>ID</b> <b>Card</b> successfully regardless of skew and rotation, yet the application fails to determine the area of National <b>ID</b> <b>Card</b> when there exist an object with similar color to the National <b>ID</b> <b>Card...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the German {{electronic}} identity (<b>ID)</b> <b>card,</b> {{which is to be}} introduced in November 2010. Apart from enhancing the possibilities for identity checks by providing biometric identifiers, the new <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> will enable citizens to prove their identity to service providers and administrative authorities over the Internet. This is going to open up a variety of applications in e-Government and e-Business. While the national <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> is yet to come in Germany, similar concepts have already been realized at a smaller scale: At Technische Universität Darmstadt (TUD), a student smartcard was introduced in the 2005 / 2006 winter term. It offers the students a digital proof of identity, which can be used to access electronic resources and services provided by the university. Thus this “TUD card ” works as an electronic <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> for the university campus, which makes it a good starting point for extrapolating this scenario to a nationwide <b>ID</b> <b>card.</b> The goal of our work is to compile and analyze the potential applications of the upcoming German electronic <b>ID</b> <b>card.</b> We approach the issue by categorizing the applications according to their purpose of use. For each category, we start with examples of matching TUD card applications. Then we generalize from campus-bound use to the scenario of a nationwide <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> and describe application possibilities in e-Government as well as e-Business. As we specify potential applications for the <b>ID</b> <b>card,</b> this work is relevant to private and public service providers and may encourage them to prepare for the upcoming introduction of the <b>ID</b> <b>card.</b> Our work also aims to increase the acceptance of the <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> among the German citizens. We show how the <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> increases the usability of existing online services and how it allows for new services which have not been feasible so far...|$|R

The background of this study is: It is a must for every people in Indonesia to have an <b>ID</b> <b>card,</b> especially {{for those who have}} already 17 years old or married. This card is used as a personal identity which is valid in Indonesia. This card can be used to have a motorcycle credit. College students who come from the other places usually want to have a domicile <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> that are useful for them to get a credit facility. They get the domicile <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> by counterfeiting the card. The government and law upholder should do some actions to reduce the fabrication of <b>ID</b> <b>card.</b> The purpose of this research is to get the data about law maintenance towards the fabrication of <b>ID</b> <b>Card</b> as a method to get credit facilties. It can be concluded that the law is not efffective yet because there are still many people such as college students and motorcycle dealer who counterfeit their <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> to get a credit facility...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} of identification cards at the University of Economics, Prague. Its {{primary goal is}} to consider and evaluate {{the possibility of a}} transfer of the <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> management into the ISIS system. The thesis consists of four parts. The first one offers a complex analysis of the <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> management at the University. The second one analyses two <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> management systems: the NESA system, which is being used at the University now, and the ISIS system, which could also be used for the <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> management. The third part includes a proposal of adjustments in the ISIS system, which would make its <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> management implementation comply with the University's needs. The proposal describes general features of the system, relations to its environs and a graphical user interface. Finally the last part covers the actual state of the project and its differences from the proposal offered in the thesis. Information sources for the thesis were legal norms, University regulations and internal documents as well as the author's knowledge and experience gained through several years of the NESA system maintenance and numerous consultations with the University <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> management staff and ISIS developers. The main assets of this thesis lay in the comprehensive view of the <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> management at the University along with the proposal of the new <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> management system, which is to be integrated into ISIS...|$|R
