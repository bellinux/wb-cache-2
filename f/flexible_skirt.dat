50|$|The {{development}} of the SR.N1 had involved the development and registering {{of a number of}} patentable technologies, a portion of which being extensions of Cockerell's original concepts and patents. These patents included the craft's annular jet cushion, plenum chamber burning, compartmentation jets for stability, powered and unpowered recirculation techniques, and various configurations of <b>flexible</b> <b>skirts.</b> The supporting research for the acquisition of such patents had been typically performed by HDL, who conducted extensive experiments and built full-scale test beds as part of their activities.|$|R
50|$|Radio {{controlled}} (RC) hovercraft are model vehicles {{capable of}} moving over {{land and water}} using a cushion of air. This cushion of air is contained by an <b>flexible</b> airtight <b>skirt.</b> Several designs exist. Some models use two motors for steering and thrust, while others use one motor and a rudder. The skirt is inflated by an air pump, normally using a propeller.|$|R
50|$|In May 1990 the Cowes Express {{company began}} {{operations}} from Southampton Town Quay to Cowes with its craft, the Sant' Agata. After several weeks, service ended following mechanical problems; a year later, the company {{returned with the}} renamed Sant' Agata (Wight King) and its running mate, Wight Queen. They were Cirrus 120P surface effect ships, built in Norway by Brødrene Aa Båtbyggeri, carrying up to 330 passengers at a speed of 50 knots. A smaller backup craft, the Wight Prince, was also leased: a Dutch-built Seaswift 23 with a capacity of 99 passengers at 36 knots. These machines (and the HM2s) were catamarans with twin rigid hulls and <b>flexible</b> <b>skirts</b> fore and aft. With the lift fans of a conventional hovercraft, they were propelled by waterscrews or waterjets instead of propellers. The vehicles were quieter than conventional hovercraft, and more resistant to being pushed sideways by wind or water. Their disadvantage {{was that they were}} not amphibious, and could not leave the water.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1964, it {{had been}} {{concluded}} that, due to the improved projected performance of the craft's <b>flexible</b> <b>skirt</b> having lowered the power requirements involved, only two pairs of Proteus engines would be required instead of three. At this stage, the proposed design for the SR.N4 had a displacement of 165 tons and a payload of up to 33 cars and 116 passengers; this would not substantially differ from the final design adopted for the type.|$|E
50|$|With Arthur W. J. G. Ord-Hume {{he formed}} Phoenix Aircraft in 1958, {{working on the}} {{evolution}} of crop dusting equipment and methods, building a wind tunnel in which to test them, and a subsequent agricultural aircraft. At this time, the design of the hovercraft was at an early stage, and when Ord-Hume suggested a <b>flexible</b> <b>skirt</b> system to retain the air cushion beneath the craft, Latimer-Needham engineered a patentable design. Latimer-Needham then became a hovercraft consultant to the Saunders-Roe company.|$|E
50|$|The SR.N6 was {{powered by}} a single marinised model of the Bristol Gnome {{turboshaft}} engine; this drove both a single rear-facing 9 ft (2.74 m) diameter 4-bladed Dowty Rotol variable-pitch propeller along with a 7 ft (2.13 m) diameter centrifugal lift fan. The Gnome engine was an expensive component for operators, leading to some establishing their own internal overhaul facilities and making arrangements with other Gnome operators, including the Royal Navy, to reduce costs from relying on costly services from Rolls-Royce Limited. Around 20 per cent of the operating costs of the type {{have been attributed to}} maintenance of the 4 ft <b>flexible</b> <b>skirt,</b> which reportedly lasted for up to 500 hours, while similar cost levels have been reported for fuel.|$|E
50|$|The 1981 Argentine Grand Prix was {{the third}} motor race of the 1981 Formula One season and {{was held at the}} Buenos Aires circuit in Argentina on 12 April 1981.

Thanks to {{designer}} Gordon Murray's alternative solution to <b>flexible</b> side <b>skirts,</b> the Brabham cars of Nelson Piquet and Héctor Rebaque were dominant in this race, with Piquet (who took pole at an average speed of 130.029 mph (209.261 km/h)) taking the lead immediately from Alan Jones on the back straight and Rebaque climbing up from 5th to 2nd over 23 laps.|$|R
5|$|Frank Williams led an {{abortive}} {{protest against}} the car at the Argentine Grand Prix, objecting to {{the flexibility of the}} fixed skirts used to seal the underside of the car, which allowed them to replicate the effect of a sliding skirt. At the following race, the scrutineers rejected the <b>flexible</b> <b>skirts.</b> Brabham replaced them with stiffer material from one of the other teams for the race, which Piquet won. As the season progressed, other teams developed their own lowering systems—a front spring and cylinder were stolen from the Brabham garage in Argentina— but after a rule clarification from FISA many cars were lowered by the driver pressing a switch, a development that Murray found frustrating in light of Brabham's efforts to develop a system that he considered legal. The cars ran on Goodyear tyres again from the sixth round of the championship; motorsport author Doug Nye believes this cost the BT49s good results at several races while the American company adapted to the latest Formula One developments. Despite the virtually solid suspension now required to maintain a consistent ride height, which put components under greater strain, Piquet built a championship challenge on the back of consistent reliability: {{by the end of the}} season, his BT49Cs had finished 10 of 15 races, with only one mechanical failure. Piquet finished fifth at the final race of the season—the Caesars Palace Grand Prix—to take the title from Carlos Reutemann in a Williams FW07 by one point.|$|R
40|$|The presentarticle {{focuses on}} the {{hydrodynamic}} resistance reduction of Multipurpose Amphibious Vehicles (MAV) usingthe air lubrication layer effect. The use of air cushions to support marine vehicles, heavy floating structures and in other operation is well known. The main problem in Multi-purpose Amphibious Vehicles (MAV) {{is the amount of}} power needed in order to overcome the hydrodynamic resistance acting on the hull which is included the frictional and pressure resistances. Therefore, more power is needed to move the MAV forward. In this respect, more fuel will be required to operate the amphibious vehicles. This problem could be effectively reduced by the introduction of the air cushion concept. With the air being drawn from top of craft to the cavity below the hull will produce some cushioning effect and also help to reduce skin friction drag. In this paper, air cushion effect will be studied in rigid surface cavity instead of using <b>flexible</b> <b>skirts.</b> This would avoid the problem of high maintenance due to replacement of damaged skirts. Finally, the MAV will be supported using air cavity and bubbles generated by an air pump (compressor and air pressure vessel) to pushes the hull of multi-purpose amphibious vehicle up and reduce the frictional resistance due to draft and wetted surface reduction and layer of air between hull surface and water. This research would be done via CFD (ANSYS-CFX 14. 0) and analyzed the hydrodynami...|$|R
50|$|Testing had {{revealed}} several interesting tendencies of hovercraft, {{such as that}} there was an inevitable delay between the heading of the craft changing and the direction that it was travelling in would change to match. In addition, travelling overland posed more difficulty than traversing water {{due to the lack of}} motion attenuation generated by wave drag. Considerable skill on the part of the pilot was typically required to counter the effects of phenomenon such as cross winds and ground slopes. In 1961, the SR.N1 was outfitted with a <b>flexible</b> <b>skirt</b> which greatly improved the effective depth of the air cushion. During the following year, an aft-facing Bristol-Siddeley Viper III jet engine, mounted on the rear of the decking behind the lift fan housing, supplemented the ducted-air propulsion produced by the piston engine, increasing the craft's maximum speed from 35 to 50 knots; the Viper installation followed an earlier installation of a Blackburn/Turbomeca Marboré of approximately half the Viper's thrust. The SR.N1 was involved in tests for a total of four years prior to its retirement, having demonstrated the practicality of the concept.|$|E

40|$|The {{skirt of}} an {{artificial}} cornea must integrate the implant {{to the host}} sclera, a major failure of present devices currently used for such a purpose. Thus, it is highly desirable to encourage the metabolic activity of the cornea using more bioactive, <b>flexible</b> <b>skirt</b> materials. Here we describe attempts to increase the bioactivity of PEEK, HDPE and UHMWPE films. The effectiveness of different strength NaOH pre-treatments to initiate apatite deposition on PEEK, HDPE and UHMWPE is investigated. We find that exposure of PEEK, HDPE and UHMWPE films to NaOH solutions induces the formation of potential nuclei for apatite (calcium phosphate), from which the growth of an apatite coating is stimulated when subsequently immersing the polymer films in 1. 5 strength Simulated Body Fluid (SBF). As immersion time in SBF increases, further nucleation and growth produces a thicker and more compact apatite coating that {{can be expected to}} be highly bioactive. Interestingly, the apatite growth is found to also be dependent on both the concentration of NaOH solution and the structure of the polymer surface...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLarge flat land surfaces, where direct normal {{irradiance}} (DNI) is {{high enough}} for {{concentrating solar power}} (CSP), are scarce in Europe. Floating offshore solar power plants in the Mediterranean Sea could increase the European solar power resources significantly. In this paper a solar collector platform design is investigated, where individual platform segments are supported by several air chambers, which are formed by cylindrical <b>flexible</b> membrane <b>skirts.</b> This paper {{is focused on the}} optical performance of the collector platform which is simulated in a dynamic model. Two types of concentrators are considered: (1) Parabolic Trough Collectors and (2) Pneumatic Pre-Stressed Solar Concentrators. From experimental data gained from a 4 x 4 m physical model, we have obtained the general characteristics of the platform. Using wave data of the Mediterranean Sea, the motion of the platform in different sea states is calculated. The dependency of the concentrator system on the angle of incident, which is in this case also a function of the platform motion due to ocean waves, is obtained from ray tracing. Solar irradiance is derived from satellite data and also included in the model. Combining all these data in one dynamic model, the achievable optical performance of a floating offshore solar power plant is calculated as a function of time and location...|$|R

The main technology is the Ocean Cleanup Array which utilizes long floating barriers to capture and concentrate the plastic such {{that the system is}} a passive barrier. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is being used to study the catch efficiency debris of different sizes and densities, the transport of plastic along the containment boom, and the forces acting on it {{in order to determine the}} appropriate shape for their passive barrier concept.

40|$|This program aims at {{improving}} {{the efficiency of}} advanced natural-gas reciprocating engines (ANGRE) by reducing piston and piston ring assembly friction without major adverse effects on engine performance, such as increased oil consumption and wear. An iterative process of simulation, experimentation and analysis has been followed towards achieving the goal of demonstrating a complete optimized low-friction engine system. In this program, a detailed set of piston and piston-ring dynamic and friction models have been adapted and applied that illustrate the fundamental relationships among mechanical, surface/material and lubricant design parameters and friction losses. Demonstration of low-friction ring-pack designs in the Waukesha VGF 18 GL engine confirmed ring-pack friction reduction of 30 - 40 %, which translates to total engine FEMP (friction mean effective pressure) reduction of 7 - 10 % from the baseline configuration without significantly increasing oil consumption or blow-by flow. The study on surface textures, including roughness characteristics, cross hatch patterns, dimples and grooves have shown that even relatively small-scale changes can have a large effect on ring/liner friction, in some cases reducing FMEP {{by as much as}} 30 % from a smooth surface case. The measured FMEP reductions were in good agreement with the model predictions. The combined analysis of lubricant and surface design indicates that low-viscosity lubricants can be very effective in reducing friction, subject to component wear for extremely thin oils, which can be mitigated with further lubricant formulation and/or engineered surfaces. Hence a combined approach of lubricant design and appropriate wear reduction offers improved potential for minimum engine friction loss. Testing of low-friction lubricants showed that total engine FMEP reduced by up to {approx} 16. 5 % from the commercial reference oil without significantly increasing oil consumption or blow-by flow. Piston friction studies indicate that a flatter piston with a more <b>flexible</b> <b>skirt,</b> together with optimizing the waviness and film thickness on the piston skirt offer significant friction reduction. Combined with low-friction ring-pack, material and lubricant parameters, a total power cylinder friction reduction of 30 - 50 % is expected, translating to an engine efficiency increase of two percentage points from its current baseline towards the goal of 50 % ARES engine efficiency. The design strategies developed in this study have promising potential for application in all modern reciprocating engines as they represent simple, low-cost methods to extract significant fuel savings. The current program has possible spinoffs and applications in other industries as well, including transportation, CHP, and diesel power generation. The progress made in this program has wide engine efficiency implications, and potential deployment of low-friction engine components or lubricants in the near term is quite possible...|$|E

Methods: To repair a simulated ventral incisional hernia, two surgeries were performed by eight experienced surgeons using a live porcine model. One procedure involved traditional suture methods and a flat mesh, and the other procedure involved a mechanical fixation device and a <b>skirted</b> <b>flexible</b> composite mesh. A Surgery Task Load Index questionnaire was administered before and after the procedure to establish the surgeons’ perceived stress levels, and saliva samples were collected before, during, and after the surgical procedures to assess the biologically expressed stress (cortisol and salivary alpha amylase) levels. Results: For mechanical fixation using the Ethicon Physiomesh Open Flexible Composite Mesh Device {{in conjunction with the}} Ethicon Securestrap Open Absorbable Strap Fixation Device, surgeons reported a 46. 2 % reduction in perceived workload stress. There was also a lower physiological reactivity to the intraoperative experience and the total surgical procedure time was reduced by 60. 3 %.
