40|$|Reverse {{ballistic}} {{experiments were}} conducted using gold long rods <b>impacting</b> <b>cylinders</b> of silicon carbide {{to study the}} effect of failure kinetics in ceramic penetration. Some of the early experiments impacted off-centered due to {{the dynamics of the}} barrel and sabot. Nevertheless, the data appeared to be in good agreement with centered impact, although conventional wisdom suggested that penetration resistance should decrease due to lateral confinement effects. Numerical simulations of the experiments were conducted to investigate and to quantify the influence of lateral confinement as a function of impact velocity for the ceramic targets. Above 3. 0 km/s, close proximity to a lateral boundary results in less than a 2 % increase in the penetration velocity...|$|R
40|$|Plane strain {{thermomechanical}} deformations of {{a sandwich}} plate impact loaded by a cylinder are analyzed by the finite element method. The materials {{of the bottom}} and the top face sheets and the intervening soft core are modeled as isotropic, homogeneous, microporous and thermoelastoviscoplastic. Contact surfaces {{are assumed to be}} smooth and the material of the <b>impacting</b> <b>cylinder</b> much stiffer than that of the face sheets. Two measures of damage, namely the effective plastic strain and the porosity, are considered. Results have been computed for two impact speeds. It is found that in each case the damage stays localized in a small region surrounding the point of impact and is essentially independent of the boundary conditions at the edges. For the sandwich plate comprised of thin steel face sheets bonded to thick steel foam the maximum temperature rise equals approximately 700 K. ...|$|R

The results of water were also presented for comparison. The distortion of free surfaces is well simulated for mud and water. The evolution of free surfaces is in qualitative agreement with physical analy 2 sis.

40|$|The {{open-source}} CFD model REEF 3 D is used {{to simulate}} plunging breaking wave forces on a vertical cylinder. The numerical results are compared with data from the experiments carried out at the Large Wave Channel, Hannover, Germany to validate the model. Further, {{the location of the}} cylinder is changed so that the breaking wave <b>impacts</b> the <b>cylinder</b> at different stages of wave breaking and the resulting wave forces are evaluated. The different locations for the cylinder placement based on the breaker location are determined from the results obtained for the wave breaking process in a two-dimensional numerical wave tank. Maximum wave forces are found to occur when the breaking wave tongue <b>impacts</b> the <b>cylinder</b> just below the wave crest in all the cases simulated and the lowest wave forces are generally obtained when the wave breaks behind the cylinder. Several wave features such as the splashing on impact, the splitting and rejoining of the wave around the cylinder resulting in a chute-like jet formation are identified. The model provides a good representation of the breaking wave process and can be a useful tool to evaluate breaking wave forces on structures. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

50|$|One {{phenomenon}} {{that can affect}} water-cooled diesel engines is cylinder cavitation and erosion. This {{is due to a}} phenomenon in high-compression engines where the ignition of the fuel in the cylinder causes a high-frequency vibration that causes bubbles to form in the coolant in contact with the cylinder. When these tiny bubbles collapse, coolant <b>impacts</b> the <b>cylinder</b> wall, over time causing small holes to form in the cylinder wall. This damage is mitigated in some engines with coatings, or with a coolant additive specifically designed to prevent cavitation and erosion damage. Engines damaged in this way will require the affected cylinder to be repaired (where possible) or will be rendered unusable.|$|R
40|$|Impact {{tests of}} a sphere and several {{cylinders}} of various masses and fineness ratios, all of aluminum, fired into an aluminum double-sheet structure at velocities near 7 km/sec, {{show that a}} <b>cylinder,</b> <b>impacting</b> {{in the direction of}} its axis, is considerably more effective as a penetrator than a sphere. <b>Impacts</b> of three <b>cylinders</b> of equal mass, but different fineness ratios, produced holes through the structures' rear sheet, whereas impact of a sphere of the same mass did not. Moreover, it was found that to prevent rear-sheet penetration, the mass of the 1 / 2 -fineness-ratio cylinder had to be reduced by a factor greater than three. Further tests wherein the cylinder diameter was held constant while the cylinder length was systematically reduced showed that a cylinder with a fineness ratio of 0. 07 and a mass of only 1 / 7 that of the sphere was still capable of producing a hole in the rear sheet...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of plunging breaking waves {{with a pair}} of cylinders placed in tandem is investigated using an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The model is validated using experimental data for total wave forces and free surface elevations for breaking-wave interaction with a single cylinder. Wave interaction with tandem cylinders is investigated for four different wave impact scenarios on the first cylinder and six different distances between the cylinders in each scenario. Wave forces on the upstream cylinder are generally found to be less than the forces on a single cylinder for a particular scenario. The force on the downstream cylinder is lower than the force on the upstream cylinder when the breaker tongue <b>impacts</b> the first <b>cylinder.</b> Under conditions in which the breaker tongue <b>impacts</b> the downstream <b>cylinder</b> around the wave crest level, the wave force on the downstream cylinder is higher than the force on the upstream cylinder. The wave forces experienced by the tandem cylinders is highly influenced by the location of the breaking point with respect to the cylinders and the distance between the cylinders...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUp to now the {{research}} and development in the field of building acoustics is based mainly on measurements. In consequence the development and optimization of a new building component is a very tedious and expensive task. A considerable reduction of these costs could be achieved, if the optimization relying on measurements would be replaced-at least to some extent-by a computational prediction model. For these models it is necessary to represent not only the component and the adjacent rooms but also the excitation in a suitable way.

40|$|In the past, {{testing of}} water impact {{problems}} such as breaking waves impacting on risers, lowering of subsea structures through the splash zone and free fall lifeboat performance {{has been carried out}} either by model tests or simpli&# 64257;ed methods such as empirical formulas and potential &# 64258;ow calculations. The simpli&# 64257;ed methods generally give reasonable results for simple geometries such as wedges or two-dimensional cylinders. When more complex structures are to be analyzed model tests are required, increasing the cost and time spent signi&# 64257;cantly. In addition, scale e&# 64256;ects may also alter the results. Recent advances in computer technology and computational &# 64258;uid dynamics (CFD) have made it possible to simulate many of the problems that earlier only could be studied using model tests. This allows for more tests being performed at a lower cost compared to model tests and with higher accuracy than simpli&# 64257;ed methods. In addition, the CFD simulations are normally performed in full scale, thus avoiding scale e&# 64256;ects. This thesis explores the possibility of simulating water entry problems using the CD-adapco CFD-software STAR-CCM+ with focus on circular cylinders. The reason for choosing this shape {{is that it is a}} simple geometry while still being a realistic problem, since this is the most widely used shape for structural members in the o&# 64256;shore industry. Also, for numerical methods the initial phase of <b>impact</b> of a <b>cylinder</b> is numerically di&# 64259;cult to solve, because of the almost &# 64258;at surface on the cylinder bottom. This means that a method solving water <b>impact</b> of <b>cylinders</b> correctly is believed to also being able to simulate water entry of other geometries. Two-dimensional simulations have been performed for constant velocity and free-falling cylinders. Good agreement is found between the CFD results and empirical lines by Campbell and Weynberg (1980). The results for free-falling cylinders show fairly good agreement with experimental data by Greenhow and Lin (1983), nonlinear boundary element method results by Sun (2007), and CFD simulations by Zhu (2006). Three-dimensional simulations have been performed to analyze the water <b>impact</b> of a <b>cylinder</b> with 8 degree impact angle assuming constant velocity. The results are compared to experiments performed by Campbell and Weynberg (1980) and strip theory calculations. Good agreement is found between the methods. </p...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} coefficient {{correlations for}} tall bubble columns {{are unable to}} predict heat transfer in shallow bubble columns, which have unique geometry and fluid dynamics. In this work, the heat transfer coefficient is measured {{on the surface of}} a horizontal cylinder immersed in a shallow air–water bubble column. Superficial velocity, liquid depth, and cylinder height and horizontal position with respect to the sparger orifices are varied. The heat transfer coefficient is found to increase with height until reaching a critical height, and a dimensionless, semi-theoretical correlation is developed that incorporates superficial velocity, liquid properties, and height. Additionally, the more minor effects of flow regime, column region, and bubble impact are discussed. Notably, the heat transfer coefficient can be as high in the region of bubble coalescence as in the bulk of the column, but only if bubbles <b>impact</b> the <b>cylinder.</b> The correlation and discussion provide a framework for modeling and designing shallow, coil-cooled bubble columns.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of fragmentation {{has historically been}} linked to the weapons industry where the main goal is to optimize a bomb or to design effective blast shields. Numerical {{modeling of}} fragmentation from dynamic loading has traditionally been modeled by legacy finite element solvers that rely on element erosion to model material failure.

We propose a new approach implemented in the IMPETUS AFEA SOLVER® based on the following: New High Order Finite Elements that can easily deal with very large deformations; Stochastic distribution of initial damage that allows for a non homogeneous distribution of fragments; and a Node Splitting Algorithm that allows for material fracture without element erosion that is mesh independent.
