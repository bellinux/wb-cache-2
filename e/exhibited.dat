5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once <b>exhibited</b> by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once <b>exhibited</b> by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once <b>exhibited</b> {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E

5|$|The Triumph of Cleopatra, {{also known}} as Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia and The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia, is an oil {{painting}} by English artist William Etty. It was first <b>exhibited</b> in 1821, {{and is now in}} the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight across the River Mersey from Liverpool. During the 1810s Etty had become widely respected among staff and students at the Royal Academy of Arts, in particular for his use of colour and ability to paint realistic flesh tones. Despite having <b>exhibited</b> at every Summer Exhibition since 1811 he attracted little commercial or critical interest. In 1820 he <b>exhibited</b> The Coral Finder, which showed nude figures on a gilded boat. This painting attracted the attention of Sir Francis Freeling, who commissioned a similar painting on a more ambitious scale.|$|E

5|$|The {{unfinished}} {{painting was}} <b>exhibited</b> in Whitechapel in 1886, under the intentionally simplified title of The Sun.

As Watts did not include After the Deluge in his gift to the nation of what he considered his most significant works, it is not among his better-known paintings. However, it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists, and has been cited as an influence on numerous other painters who worked in the two decades following its initial exhibition.|$|E
