5|$|His {{marriage}} to the hot-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's intimate friend – ensured Marlborough's rise, first to the Captain-Generalcy of British forces, then to a dukedom. Becoming de facto leader of Allied forces during the War of the Spanish Succession, his victories on the fields of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709), ensured <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> as one of Europe's great generals. But his wife's stormy relationship with the Queen, and her subsequent dismissal from court, was central to his own fall. Incurring Anne's disfavour, and caught between Tory and Whig factions, Marlborough, who had brought glory and success to Anne's reign, was forced from office and went into self-imposed exile. He returned to England and to influence under the House of Hanover with the accession of GeorgeI to the British throne in 1714.|$|E

25|$|Although Strabo {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} achieving the highest offices a Roman knight could attain under Augustus and Tiberius, <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> {{has been largely}} overshadowed by the infamy of his son Sejanus. During a prefecture which lasted nearly 17 years, Sejanus introduced reforms to the Praetorians which helped shape the Guard into an integral and powerful branch of the Principate. The soldiers were transferred to a single garrison {{and the number of}} cohorts was increased from 9 to 12. Sejanus himself became a trusted advisor to Tiberius, and during the latter's withdrawal to Capri in 26 was effectually the ruler of the Roman Empire until 31. That year he suddenly fell from power amidst suspicions of Tiberius that Sejanus was secretly plotting against him. He was executed along with his three children.|$|E
25|$|La Guardia was a domineering {{leader who}} verged on authoritarian but whose reform {{politics}} were carefully tailored {{to address the}} sentiments of his diverse constituency.

He succeeded {{with the support of}} a sympathetic president. He secured <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> as a tough-minded reform mayor who helped clean out corruption, brought in gifted experts, and fixed upon the city a broad sense of responsibility for its own citizens. His administration engaged new groups that had been kept out of the political system, gave New York its modern infrastructure, and raised expectations of new levels of urban possibility.|$|E

25|$|Fawkner was keen {{to secure}} <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history.</b> He opened Melbourne's first {{hotel on the}} corner of William Street and Flinders Lane. He {{published}} the Melbourne Advertiser on 1 January 1838 which was the district's first newspaper. The Advertisers first nine or ten weekly editions were handwritten in ink. The old wooden printing press brought to Tasmania by Lt. Governor David Collins in 1803, and some worn typeface were eventually obtained from Launceston and the first printed edition appeared on 5 March 1838. It was to last for a further 17 editions when it was closed down on 23 April 1838 for want of a newspaper license from Sydney. The Port Phillip Patriot and Melbourne Advertiser was commenced on 6 February 1839 by newly licensed John Pascoe Fawkner. It was published daily commencing on 15 May 1845.|$|E

500|$|Orwell is {{best remembered}} for his {{political}} commentary as a left-wing anti-totalitarian. As he explained in the essay [...] "Why I Write" [...] (1946), [...] "Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it." [...] To that end Orwell used his fiction {{as well as his}} journalism to defend his political convictions. He first achieved widespread acclaim with his fictional novella Animal Farm and cemented <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> with the publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four shortly before his death. While fiction accounts for a small fraction of his total output, these two novels are his best-selling works, having sold almost fifty million copies in sixty-two languages by 2007—more than any other pair of books by a twentieth-century author.|$|E
500|$|Nixon saw his {{policies}} regarding Vietnam, China, and the Soviets as key to <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history.</b> George McGovern, Nixon's onetime opponent, commented in 1983, [...] "President Nixon {{probably had a}} more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II... With the exception of his inexcusable continuation {{of the war in}} Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history." [...] Political scientist Jussi Hanhimäki disagrees, saying Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment, using diplomatic rather than military means. Historian Christopher Andrew concludes that [...] "Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena. While the criminal farce of Watergate was in the making, Nixon's inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships with both Communist China and the Soviet Union." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Brook, [...] "in every age, {{a heroic}} sage struggles to rescue Benjamin from obscurity—and {{invariably}} fails." [...] Benjamin left no memoir and destroyed his personal papers, by which [...] "the task of future researchers and historians was made exceedingly difficult and laborious". [...] After his death, Benjamin was rarely written about, {{in contrast to}} Davis and other Confederate leaders. [...] Part of {{this was due to}} Benjamin depriving his potential biographers of source material, but even Davis, in his two-volume war memoir, mentions him only twice. Evans suggests that as Davis wrote the books in part to defend and memorialize <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history,</b> {{it would not have been}} characteristic of him to give much credit to Benjamin. Davis, in the midst of postwar business struggles, may have resented Benjamin's success as a barrister, or may have feared that allegations of involvement in Lincoln's assassination would again be made against the two men. Brook concurs that Benjamin's postwar success, that began as Davis lay in prison and other Confederates struggled for survival, may have soured Southerners towards the former secretary, but that anti-Semitism was also likely a factor. [...] "For the guardians of Confederate memory after Reconstruction, Benjamin became a kind of pet Jew, generally ignored, but then trotted out at opportune moments to defend the segregated South against charges of bigotry." ...|$|E

500|$|Gideon Haigh {{suggests}} that Hobbs was a [...] "spontaneous and original", trend-setting batsman {{who was not}} afraid to depart from orthodoxy. Gerald Howat notes that, aside from his batting achievements, [...] "Hobbs's biographers and obituarists could strike no discordant note. He {{was a man of}} moral probity, religious conviction, and personal commitment. And he was humble enough to see himself as an ordinary person blessed with one extraordinary talent, which he put into its proper perspective. It was an attitude of mind which tempered the sternness of his approach with an engaging humour and a delight in playing practical jokes." [...] Among his contemporaries, Hobbs was regarded as modest and kind, and never criticised other players. He avoided confrontation, although he was [...] "quietly determined", according to Wisden, and tried to avoid publicity. According to Fender, Hobbs [...] "gave stature" [...] to the profession of cricket. Modern critics have expressed some reservations: some have pointed out that his batting average, although high, has been surpassed by others, and that among his many centuries, few were as large as other players managed. However, others contend that his impact on the game, his achievement in showing that professionals could bat as freely and stylishly as amateurs, and his kindness place him among the top cricketers of all time. Wisden described him in 2000: [...] "More than anyone else, he lifted the status and dignity of the English professional cricketer." [...] In summing up <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history,</b> it said: [...] "He was not an artist, like some of his predecessors, nor yet a scientist, like some of the moderns; he was perhaps the supreme craftsman." ...|$|E
