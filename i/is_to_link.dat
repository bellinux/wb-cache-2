5|$|The Silver Line has {{two primary}} goals. The first <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>link</b> Washington, D.C. by rail to Washington Dulles International Airport and the edge cities of Tysons Corner, Reston, Herndon, and Ashburn. The second is to spur urban {{development}} in Tysons Corner and reduce overall reliance on highway {{traffic in the}} business district, Virginia's largest and the 12th-largest in the country. The district's area is comparable in size to downtown Washington, D.C., but is rather insulated from its surrounding neighborhoods and has no existing grid pattern in its streets. The Silver Line would also improve public access to the Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of National Air and Space Museum located near Dulles Airport; Virginia Regional Transit currently runs a shuttle bus {{from the airport to}} Udvar-Hazy.|$|E
25|$|The School of Architecture and Planning {{has three}} {{graduate}} programs (Architecture, Landscape Architecture, City & Regional Planning) and two undergraduate programs (Architecture and Environmental Design and Construction Management). The School prepares students {{to address the}} challenges associated with systems of the built environment and their integration with systems in the natural environment. The objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>link</b> domains of environmental (natural patterns and flows), economic (financial patterns and equity), and social (human, cultural, and spiritual) as related to the professional practices of planning, design and management. Morgan's education is directed towards a sustainable urban environment that is beautiful, humane, socially appropriate, and restorative.|$|E
25|$|Geobiochemistry {{is similar}} to biogeochemistry, but differs by placing {{emphasis}} {{on the effects of}} geology on the development of life’s biochemical processes, as distinct from the role of life on Earth’s cycles. Its primary goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>link</b> biological changes, encompassing evolutionary modifications of genes and changes in the expression of genes and proteins, to changes in the temperature, pressure, and composition of geochemical processes to understand when and how metabolism evolved. Geobiochemistry is founded on the notion that life is a planetary response because metabolic catalysis enables the release of energy trapped by a cooling planet.|$|E

[...] While artists have been exhibited intermittently on the MCA plaza since 2002, the summer 2011 plaza exhibit showcasing four works by Miami-based sculptor Mark Handforth marks a revitalization of the plaza project.|$|E
500|$|Nescopeck State Park is {{one source}} of {{recreation}} in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Nescopeck Creek flows through this state park and on it there are opportunities for trout fishing. Nescopeck Creek takes up [...] of the northwestern part in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Additionally, there are four golf courses, two community parks, and two Pennsylvania State Game Lands, and ten sites for water-based recreation, including Lake Francis in Nescopeck State Park. A tourist attraction, Eckley Miner's Village, is within the Nescopeck Creek watershed. A resort known as the Eagle Rock Resort is in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Since the late 1990s, there have been plans to convert old railroad lines in the Nescopeck Creek watershed to rail trails. One such plan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>link</b> the Hazleton area to the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor.|$|E

500|$|Der Freiwillige {{was still}} being {{published}} in the 2000s. At some point, Der Freiwillige and the Munin Verlag publishing business had {{been taken over by}} Patrick Agte, a right-wing author and publisher. Regional HIAG chapters continued to exist through the 2000s, at least one into the 2010s. These groups worked to maintain momentum through the recruitment of younger generations and through outreach to foreign veterans of the Waffen-SS, aided by the continued publication of Der Freiwillige. [...] " [...] acclaimed aim, today , <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>link</b> older and younger generations in a common cause," [...] note the historians Steffen Werther and Madeleine Hurd. The publication's predominant theme continued to be [...] "Europe against Bolshevism", with several editorials devoted to the idea that the Waffen-SS laid the foundation for the unification of Europe, expansion of NATO and [...] "freedom of Fatherlands", as stated in one of the issues.|$|E

2500|$|The final goal {{pursued by}} the Vienna Circle was unified science, that is the {{construction}} of a [...] "constitutive system" [...] in which every legitimate statement is reduced to the concepts of lower level which refer directly to the given experience. [...] "The endeavour <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>link</b> and harmonise the achievements of individual investigators in their various fields of science". From this aim follows the search for clarity, neatness, and for a symbolic language that eliminates the problems arising from the ambiguity of natural language. The Vienna Circle published a collection, called Einheitswissenschaft (Unified science), edited by Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, Otto Neurath, Joergen Joergensen (after Hahn's death) and Charles W. Morris (from 1938), whose aim was to present a unified vision of science. After the publication in Europe of seven monographs from 1933 to 1939, the collection was dismissed, because of the problems arising from the World War II. In 1938 a new series of publications started in USA. It was the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, an ambitious project never completed devoted to unified science. Only the first section Foundations of the Unity of Sciences was published; it contains two volumes for a total of twenty monographs published from 1938 to 1969. As remembered by Rudolf Carnap and Charles Morris in the Preface to the 1969 edition of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science: ...|$|E
