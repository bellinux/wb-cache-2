40|$|Specialized predators must obtain all {{required}} {{nutrients from}} a single prey species. In some species nutrient balance may be possible by selecting various body parts. We tested how different ant body parts affect the fitness of a specialized ant predator and whether the predator possesses adaptations in its feeding behaviour that allow nutrient balancing while feeding on only a single prey species. We used a formicine-specialist spider, Zodarion rubidum, reared on three diet types: an entire ant, two ant gasters and two ant <b>foreparts</b> (heads, thoraces and legs) of Lasius ants. Spiders grew faster, survived longer and developed earlier on the diet consisting of two ant <b>foreparts.</b> Spiders fed on the two ant gasters had the slowest growth, highest mortality and slowest development while spiders fed entire ants showed intermediate performance. In preference experiments, we studied the spiders' consumption of three Formicinae ant species that differ markedly in size. With small Lasius ants, spiders equally exploited the gaster and the <b>foreparts,</b> but with larger Formica and Camponotus ants, spiders fed significantly more on the <b>foreparts</b> than on the gaster. Spiders almost always fed on the gaster, suggesting that it might include beneficial nutrients. Nutritional analysis of the ant bodies of the three species revealed {{that there were more}} lipids in the gaster, while the <b>foreparts</b> contained more proteins. Our results suggest that ant-eating spiders might balance their nutritional needs by selectively consuming various body parts of their exclusive prey. 6 page(s...|$|R

25|$|The bongo {{sports a}} bright auburn or {{chestnut}} coat, with the neck, chest, and legs generally {{darker than the}} rest of the body. Coats of male bongos become darker as they age until they reach a dark mahogany-brown colour. Coats of female bongos are usually more brightly coloured than those of males. The eastern bongo is darker in color than the western and this is especially pronounced in older males which tend to be chestnut brown, especially on the <b>forepart</b> of their bodies.|$|E
25|$|Set netters – also operate gillnets. However, during fishing {{operations}} the vessel is not {{attached to the}} nets. The size of the vessels varies from open boats to large specialised drifters operating on the high seas. The wheelhouse is usually located aft, and the front deck is used for handling gear. Normally the nets are set at the stern by steaming ahead. Hauling is done over the side at the <b>forepart</b> of the deck, usually using hydraulic driven net haulers. Wet fish is packed in containers chilled with ice. Larger vessels might freeze the catch.|$|E
25|$|The ship did not {{immediately}} sink so U-96 fired again at 0805 and 0907hrs, hitting Almeda Star in the stern and again amidships. The ship had launched four lifeboats but still had people on deck when U-96 surfaced and opened fire on her with her 88mm deck gun. Between 0932 and 0948hrs the submarine fired 28 incendiary shells, about 15 of which hit Almeda Star and started small fires aboard. The fires soon went out so at 0955hrs U-96 hit the ship with a fourth torpedo, which exploded in her <b>forepart.</b> Within three minutes Almeda Star sank by her bow.|$|E

In northern Colombia, western Venezuela, and on the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica and Panama the <b>foreparts</b> are brownish or blackish grizzled with tawny or olivaceous, the mid-body is orange, and the rump is black or cream. In western Colombia and Ecuador some have tawny <b>foreparts</b> and yellowish to the rump. Agoutis from the disjunct southern population (Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina) which sometimes are treated as a separate species, Dasyprocta variegata, weigh 3 - 5.2 kg and are grizzled brown, yellowish and black, or grizzled black and orange.|$|R

25|$|Captain Thomas Wakefield {{received}} a letter of marque on 9 November 1798. On 4 December he sailed from the Downs, bound for Bombay and China. Only five days later, on 9 December, Henry Addison struck the Bembridge Ledge on the Isle of Wight, during a heavy fog. When the tide went out {{the next day she}} bilged. Five crew member drowned while trying to reach shore on a raft. Also, a block falling from the mizzen mast hit a boy on the head, killing him. By 16 December all that was left standing was the <b>forepart</b> of the vessel's upper works. Some casks were saved, but the EIC put the value of the cargo it lost at £29,222.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} {{aspects of the}} Hellenic Royal Navy's {{participation}} in World War II include {{the operations of the}} destroyer Vassilissa Olga which, until sunk in Leros on September 23, 1943, was the most successful Allied destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea; the participation of two destroyers in Operation Overlord; and the story of the destroyer Adrias, which while operating close to the coast of Kalymnos in October 1943 hit a mine, resulting in the loss of the vessel's prow, while blowing the two-gun forward turret over the bridge. After some minor repairs at Gümüşlük Bay in Turkey the Adrias managed to return to Alexandria in a 400-mile trip, even though all the <b>forepart</b> of the ship, up to the bridge, was missing. Six Greek warships participated in the Sicilian landings and in the subsequent Italian campaign.|$|E
25|$|Kingani {{was spotted}} from the shore, and Spicer-Simson's men quickly {{took to the}} water, cutting Kingani off from her base. Taken by {{surprise}} Junge ordered Kinganis speed to be increased, but as the six-pounder gun mounted in the <b>forepart</b> of Kingani could only fire forward, {{he was forced to}} circle to aim at the lead British boat, Mimi. The Germans also opened fire with rifles, as the British boats closed on Kingani. Eventually the British scored a direct hit, a three-pounder shell passing through the gunshield and killing Junge, and two petty officers, Penne and Schwarz. Several more shells hit Kingani, starting fires and flooding. With Junge dead, the chief engineer hauled down the colours and waved a white handkerchief. Mimi then approached, accidentally ramming Kingani at full speed. Toutou also came alongside, and took possession of Kingani, which was then sailed back to shore.|$|E
50|$|The Maronesa is {{traditional}} rustic cattle breed. It shows morphological similarity to the Portuguese fighting bull, the Brava de Lide, with marked sexual dimorphism: mature bulls {{are larger than}} cows, have a more heavily muscled neck, and tend to show more development in the <b>foreparts</b> compared with the rectangular body outline of cows and bullocks.|$|R
50|$|The black-tailed {{marmoset}} is {{dark brown}} with paler <b>foreparts</b> {{and a black}} tail. Unlike most of its relatives, it has a striking white or yellow-white stripe that extends down its thigh. Its ears are naked, flesh-colored and {{stand out from the}} fur. They reach a size of 18 to 28 cm and weigh from 300 to 400 g.|$|R
50|$|The Maremmana is grey; {{males are}} darker than females, {{especially}} on the <b>foreparts.</b> The muzzle, hooves, switch and {{lower part of the}} scrotum are black; the skin is black, but some depigmentation at natural openings is tolerated. As in other breeds of Podolic origin, calves are born wheat-coloured and become grey at about three months old.|$|R
25|$|Work {{on a more}} {{advanced}} armoured fighter, conceived as an armoured version of the Sopwith Snipe, began early in 1918. The forward portion of the fuselage was a 605lb (275kg) box of armour plate, forming {{an integral part of}} the aircraft structure, protecting the pilot and fuel system, with a 0.315 in (8mm) front plate, a 0.433 in (11mm) bottom plate, 0.236 in (6mm) side plates and rear armour consisting of an 11-gauge and 6-gauge plate separated by an air gap. The rear (unarmoured) section of the fuselage was a generally similar structure to the Snipe’s, but flat sided, to match the <b>forepart.</b> The two-bay wings and tailplane were identical in form to those of the Snipe, but were strengthened to cope with the extra weight, while the fin and rudder were identical to the Snipe. The new aircraft used the same Bentley BR2 rotary engine as the Snipe, covered by an unarmoured cowling – the foremost armour plate forming the firewall.|$|E
25|$|Drift nets {{are usually}} used to catch {{schooling}} forage fish such as herring and sardines, and also larger pelagic fish such as tuna, salmon and pelagic squid. Net haulers are usually {{used to set}} and haul driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the <b>forepart</b> of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern {{with this type of}} net is the bycatch of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the high seas was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.|$|E

50|$|The Romagnola was however principally a draught breed, and was bred {{for that}} purpose, with massive and {{powerful}} <b>foreparts</b> and short strong legs. Following the progressive mechanisation of {{agriculture in the}} years after the Second World War the breeding strategy changed completely, and was directed towards beef production. To this end, cross-breeding with Chianina cattle was attempted, but did not give the desired results. A herd book was established in 1963.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{mention of}} the castle dates from 1433 when the Livonian Order built a largest and strongest fortres to replace an earlier wooden {{fortress}} built by the ancient Latgalians. The Ludza stone castle had three stories, six towers, three gates and two <b>foreparts.</b> It was built as an outpost for the Livonian order, mainly to strengthen the eastern border of Livonia and guard trade routes from Russia.|$|R
50|$|Romagnola cattle are ivory-white, {{tending to}} grey on the <b>foreparts,</b> {{particularly}} in bulls; {{the skin and}} natural openings are black. The colour of the coat varies with the season, and is darker in winter. The horns are light, lyre-shaped in cows, half-moon-shaped in bulls; they are slate-grey in young animals, becoming pale at the base and dark at the tip with maturity. As with all Podolic cattle, the calves are born wheat-coloured but become white at about three months.|$|R
2500|$|From the 1530s, French and English fashions {{featured}} an open, square-necked {{gown with}} long sleeves fitted smoothly over a tight corset or pair of bodies and a farthingale. [...] With the smooth, conical {{line of the}} skirt, {{the front of the}} kirtle or petticoat was displayed, and a decorated panel called a <b>forepart,</b> heavily embroidered and sometimes jeweled, was pinned to the petticoat or directly to the farthingale.|$|E
