40|$|AbstractTranscriptional {{activity}} of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) α (subunits 1 and 2), μ (subunits 3 and 4) and π (subunit 7) gene families has been analyzed using the nuclear ‘run-on’ technique on adult rat hepatocytes maintained for 4 days in conventional culture and for 4 and 12 days in co-culture with rat liver epithelial cells. Several medium conditions are included in this study, namely with or without fetal calf serum and with nicotinamide or <b>dimethylsulphoxide.</b> Hepatocytes co-cultured for 4 days maintain approximately 30 – 70 % of the α gene family transcriptional activity, whatever the medium conditions, when compared to freshly isolated hepatocytes. A marked decrease is observed after 12 days of co-culture or when hepatocytes are maintained in conventional culture. The transcriptional {{activity of}} the μ gene family is maintained at 40 – 160 % when hepatocytes are cultured with or without fetal calf serum, and is inducible by nicotinamide (approximately 4 -fold) and <b>dimethylsulphoxide</b> (approximately 2 -fold) in conventional culture and/or in co-culture. In contrast to freshly isolated hepatocytes, GST π gene transcriptional activity is observed in conventional and co-cultured hepatocytes, irrespective of the medium conditions. <b>Dimethylsulphoxide</b> treatment however, represses the expression of GST 7 in vitro. These results demonstrate that the expression of GST α, μ and π genes in conventional and co-cultured rat hepatocytes is controlled primarily {{at the level of}} transcription.

To evaluate the effect of <b>dimethylsulphoxide</b> on cutaneous amyloidosis. Settings and Design: Data was collected from patients attending the Outpatient Department (OPD) over a period of one year.

40|$|There is a {{discrepancy}} between in vitro cholesterol dissolving efficacy of methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl propionate and cholesterol gall stone dissolution in vivo. This study investigated whether {{the presence of}} bile changes the cholesterol dissolving capacity of MTBE and ethyl propionate. The addition of <b>dimethylsulphoxide</b> to MTBE or ethyl propionate was also studied to discover if it improves the dissolving capacity for cholesterol gall stones. The presence of bile caused a 25 % decrease in cholesterol dissolving capacity of both MTBE and ethyl propionate (p < 0. 0001). This inhibitory effect of bile could be overcome {{by the addition of}} dimethyl-sulphoxide: <b>dimethylsulphoxide</b> caused an increase in cholesterol dissolving capacity of MTBE and ethyl propionate, the increase depending on the dimethyl-sulphoxide/bile ratio in the mixture. Mean dissolution time of weight, size, and patient matched cholesterol gall stones was 220 minutes in MTBE and 130 minutes in MTBE/dimethylsulphoxide (p < 0. 0001). No stones dissolved completely in ethyl propionate or ethyl propionate/dimethyl-sulphoxide within 300 minutes. In conclusion, MTBE/dimethylsulphoxide is a more potent dissolving agent for cholesterol gall stones than MTBE, giving a 40 % reduction in dissolution time. Addition of <b>dimethylsulphoxide</b> to ethyl propionate does not result in faster stone dissolution.

40|$|The {{photolysis}} of diarylphosphinic, alkylphenylphosphinic, and dialkylphosphinic azides in {{a variety}} of solvents was studied. Photolysis took place using a low pressure mercury discharge lamp fitted into a specially designed reaction vessel at 254 nm. Some small scale reactions were performed using a Rayonet reactor. Photolysis in methanol gave products resulting from the trapping, by the solvent, of monomeric metaphosphonamidates, formed by the loss of nitrogen and migration of one of the phosphorus substituents to the site of loss. Products resulting from nitrene intermediates were also observed. Photolysis reactions were also performed using benzene, <b>dimethylsulphoxide,</b> and dimethylsulphide as the solvent in an attempt to trap any nitrene intermediates produced. Benzene proved to be very unsatisfactory as a nitrene trap for these particular azides so it was used mainly as an inert diluent for the other solvents. Diphenylphosphinic and di-t-butylphosphinic azides were photolysed in dime thylsulphoxide and mixtures of <b>dimethylsulphoxide,</b> methanol, and benzene. In both cases the phosphinic and phosphonic acids were observed as products. The products were thought to be due to the attack of the oxygen of <b>dimethylsulphoxide</b> on the azide in the former case and attack on the metaphosphonamidate in the latter. Photolysis reactions in dimethylsulphide gave products resulting from the attack of the sulphur lone pair on the s-nitrene intermediates and from t-nitrene abstraction of a hydrogen from one of the dimethylsulphide methyl groups followed by combination of the two radicals produced. In mixtures of dimethylsulphide and methanol products due to rearrangement were also observed. The solvolytic reactions of the phosphinic azides with methanol were studied. In some of the photolysis reactions solvolysis was shown to be a serious competing reaction. A total of nine azides were synthesised of which five were new compounds. Many of the products found in the photolysis reaction mixtures were also new compounds and authentic samples of most of these compounds were synthesised in order to assist their identification and characterization. Trimethylammonium-N-diphenylphosphinylimine (ylid) was synthesized and photolysed under similar conditions to the phosphinic azides.
