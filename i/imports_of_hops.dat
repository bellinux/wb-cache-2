50|$|The {{reign of}} James VI (1567-1625) was most {{significant}} for its relative stability.

5000|$|The Romanian Revolution of 1989 was {{the main}} {{precursor}} <b>of</b> Romanian hip <b>hop.</b> Liberalization made the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> foreign hip <b>hop</b> tapes much more easier. An underground market of tape exchanges among teens started flourishing in the early 90s. From just listening to hip hop to making hip hop {{there was only a}} small step. The first Romanian hip hop group was Vorbire Directă (Direct Speech) founded in late 1992, their first song being released in 1993 on UniPlus Radio. However, the first hip hop album was released only in 1995 by R.A.C.L.A. and was called Rap-Sodia efectului defectului (Defect Effect Rap-sody).Names such as Parazitii, B.U.G. Mafia, M&G, Renegatii, Da Hood Justice, Delikt, Dublu Sens, Morometzii and countless others started appearing between 1993 and 1995. Some of this early groups are still active today. The first songs were about politics, the struggle of life in post-communist Romania and crimes. The first real hip hop concert in Romania was called Rap Attack and was held at [...] "Ion Creanga" [...] theatre in 1995.|$|R
500|$|By the {{declaration}} of the American Revolution, with George Washington as its military leader, a number of dietary changes had already occurred in America. Coffee was quickly becoming the normal hot drink of the colonies and a taste for whiskey had been acquired among {{many of those who}} could produce it. In fact, in 1774, the first corn was grown in Kentucky specifically for production of American Bourbon whiskey. This step may have established this American spirit in American culture, just as the country was going to war with England. [...] In addition to whiskey coming into favor, a shift began in the consumption of cider over beer. Colonists opted to grow less barley as it was easier to ferment apple cider than to brew beer. Another reason for this change would have been the lack <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> <b>hops</b> needed to brew beer.|$|R
50|$|The {{most celebrated}} English hop {{varieties}} are Fuggles and Goldings, although commercial pressures may incline brewers to use higher-yielding modern varieties. Modern brewers also sometimes {{make use of}} American or Continental hops. South-east England, particularly Kent, is the traditional hop growing area; brewers {{in the north and}} west used to economise on the cost <b>of</b> <b>importing</b> <b>hops</b> by producing beers with more of a malt character, a regional distinction that has not entirely vanished. A characteristic technique is dry hopping, where hops are added during the fermentation phase in addition to those that went into the initial boil. Worcestershire and Herefordshire has also been a major hop-growing area. The jargon of the areas is distinguished from that of Kent in certain words. Thus in Kent the drying house is known as an oast-house, in Worcestershire as a kiln, a hop-field is called a hop-garden, in Worcestershire a hop-yard.|$|R
50|$|From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a decline in}} demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The late sixteenth century was an era of economic distress, probably exacerbated by increasing taxation and the devaluation of the currency. In 1582 a pound of silver produced 640 shillings, but in 1601 it was 960 and the exchange rate with England was £6 Scots to £1 sterling in 1565, but by 1601 it had fallen to £12. Wages rose rapidly, by between {{four or five times}} between 1560 {{and the end of the}} century, but failed to keep pace with inflation. This situation was punctuated by frequent harvest failures, with almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century seeing local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was also exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584-8 and 1597-1609. There were the beginnings of industrial manufacture in this period, often utilising expertise from the continent, which included a failed attempt to use Flemings to teach new techniques in the developing cloth industry in the north-east, but more successful in bringing a Venetian to help develop a native glass blowing industry. George Bruce used German techniques to solve the drainage problems of his coal mine at Culross.

Phosphatase treatment of mouse cell extracts reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> isoforms compared to untreated extracts, providing the first direct evidence that Hop was phosphorylated in vivo. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy showed that a cdc 2 kinase phosphorylation mimic <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> had reduced affinity for Hsp 90 binding. Hop was predominantly cytoplasmic, but translocated to the nucleus in response to heat shock. A putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been identified within the Hsp 90 -binding domain <b>of</b> <b>Hop.</b> Although substitution <b>of</b> residues within the major arm of this proposed NLS abolished Hop–Hsp 90 interaction as determined by SPR, this was not sufficient to prevent the nuclear accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> under leptomycin-B treatment and heat shock conditions.
