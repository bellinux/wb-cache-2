500|$|Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, the {{executive}} {{producers of the}} Academy Award-winning film adaptation of the Broadway musical Chicago, were hired as the producers for Hairspray, and began discussing possibly casting John Travolta and Billy Crystal (or Jim Broadbent) as Edna and Wilbur Turnblad, respectively. Thomas Meehan and Mark O'Donnell, authors of the book for the stage musical, wrote {{the first draft of}} the film's screenplay, but were replaced by Leslie Dixon, screenwriter for family comedies such as Mrs. Doubtfire and Freaky Friday. After a year's deliberation on who should direct the film, Zadan and Meron finally decided to hire Adam Shankman to both direct and choreograph Hairspray. Upon learning he had been hired, Shankman arranged a meeting with John Waters, who advised him [...] "don't do what I did, don't do what the play did. You've gotta <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> thing." [...] Despite this, Shankman still noted [...] "all roads of Hairspray lead back to John Waters." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} {{members of the group}} attended the Escuela Elemental and the Escuela Secundaria of the University of Puerto Rico, an institution noted for its progressive and experimental teaching approaches. Vocalist/bassist Willy Rodriguez commented, [...] "It is a school in which you are allowed to decide a few things on your own, you have free time between classes [...] you can <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> things, {{and there is a lot}} of musical culture in the school. It tends to allow you to explore your artistic interests... There was always an air of liberation, of thinking on your own. I think that influenced a lot in what we do today musically and ideologically." [...] Group members Boris Bilbraut, Willy Rodríguez, Eliut González, Juan Costa, and Ivan Gutiérres began jamming together in 1996, bonding over a shared interest in reggae music, particularly Bob Marley. [...] These rehearsal sessions took place in El Hoyo, a neighborhood in the San Juan metropolitan area.|$|E
500|$|The album {{marked a}} {{departure}} in Fall Out Boy's sound {{in which the}} band implemented a diverse array of musical styles. As reported by Billboard, Fall Out Boy [...] "drifts further from its hardcore punk roots to write increasingly accessible pop tunes," [...] a slight departure from the group's previous more pop punk sound. Infinity on High {{has been compared to}} the work of pop punk bands such as Green Day, with Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commenting, [...] "Whatever snot and feedback courses through these songs, sweetness always triumphs, carried forth by bubblegum bass lines, snappy drums and tunes as comforting as lullabies." [...] Stump explained that the album contains a variety of different moods: [...] "It’s {{one of those things where}} you get older as a band and you <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> thing...The older Fall Out Boy elements, from the early records, are definitely there, and this album is an extension of that." ...|$|E

500|$|Tender Mercies {{includes}} no original film score, and {{the musical}} soundtrack {{is limited to}} the performances of country songs and the domestic guitar playing that occur as part of the story. A score was composed for the movie, but Beresford had it removed because he felt it was [...] "too sweet" [...] and sounded phony {{in the context of the}} film, although he acknowledged it as [...] "very skillful". Duvall sang his own songs, a right he insisted be part of his contract. He commented, [...] "What's the point if you're not going to <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> ? They're just going to dub somebody else? I mean, there's no point to that." [...] The film's financial backers were initially concerned about whether he could sing well enough for the role. Those concerns were allayed after Duvall produced a tape of himself singing a cappella [...] "On the Wings of a Dove", a Bob Ferguson country song featured in the film. Duvall collaborated with Beresford in deciding on the unusual staging of the emotional scene in which Mac sings it after reflecting on the reunion with his daughter. The song is performed with Mac looking out a window with his back to the camera, his face unseen. Horton Foote thought the choice made the scene more moving and called it [...] "an extraordinary moment" [...] in the film. Duvall wrote two of Mac's other songs, [...] "Fool's Waltz" [...] and [...] "I've Decided to Leave Here Forever". Several leading country singers, including Willie Nelson, George Jones and Merle Haggard, were believed to have inspired Mac and Duvall's portrayal of him, but Duvall insisted the character was not based on anyone in particular. Another country star, Waylon Jennings, complimented his performance, saying he had [...] "done the impossible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Duvall {{continued}} {{to appear in}} films during the 1980s, including the roles of cynical sportswriter Max Mercy in The Natural (1984) and Los Angeles police officer Bob Hodges in Colors (1988). He won an Oscar for Best Actor as country western singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies (1983). Duvall {{was said to have}} written the music, but the actor said he wrote only a few [...] "background, secondary songs." [...] Duvall did do his own singing, insisting it be added to his contract that he sing the songs himself; Duvall said, [...] "What's the point if you're not going to <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> ?

If you do a solo career, it means that you <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> work. Her stuff, that she makes, I think, is silly and very soon her career will wither away and disappear." [...] Lena responded to this interview via her YouTube Page, [...] "I saw Yulia's interview. Of course I got upset. But I want to tell everybody that I have a completely opposite attitude towards the whole situation, Yulia's project included. I believe she's a very talented person and I sincerely hope that she'll be successful in all the things she plans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound {{in a web of}} ropes, from the film Leopard Bikini Bound. Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy ever since I was a little girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E
