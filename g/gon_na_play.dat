40|$|Influenza virus {{neuraminidase}} (<b>NA)</b> <b>plays</b> {{an essential}} role in release and spread of progeny virions, following the intracellular viral replication cycle. To test whether NA could also facilitate virus entry into cell, we infected cultures of human airway epithelium with human and avian influenza viruses {{in the presence of the}} NA inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate. Twenty- to 500 -fold less cells became infected in drug-treated versus nontreated cultures (P < 0. 0001) 7 h after virus application, indicating that the drug suppressed the initiation of infection. These data demonstrate that viral <b>NA</b> <b>plays</b> a role early in infection, and they provide further rationale for the prophylactic use of NA inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the experiences of nursing assistants (NAs), {{who have worked with}} older people in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) who are in pain, to ascertain the role that <b>NAs</b> <b>play</b> in the pain management process. A descriptive, exploratory qualitative approach was used to examine NAs' experiences. Six NAs employed in three RACFs in regional Western Australia participated in the study. In-depth interviews focusing on the NAs experiences of caring for older people in pain were conducted. This study provided an understanding of the care needs of older residents in pain and illuminated the role of NAs in the pain management process. The central role that <b>NAs</b> <b>play</b> in RACFs was highlighted, as were the responsibilities associated with pain management. Nursing assistants may be responsible for initiating and implementing pain management treatments for older residents. This is outside the scope of practice for NAs; therefore, it is imperative that the preparation of NAs give them adequate knowledge to perform this role. As well, it may be timely to consider regulation of this large group of workers who are performing clinical tasks in RACFs...|$|R

50|$|Today, the Benares tabla gharana is {{well known}} for its {{powerful}} sound, though Benares players are also very capable of playing delicately and sensitively. The gharana is categorized into the Purbi (eastern) baj, which includes the Farukhabad, Lucknow, and Benares gharanas. The Benares style makes use of the more resonant strokes of tabla, such as <b>Na</b> (<b>played</b> on the lao), and Din. Benares players preferentially use the full-hand TeTe strokes, rather than the single finger alternation preferred by the Delhi style, though both stroke types are integrated into the Benares baj repertoire. Benares tabla players are successful in all forms of tabla playing, including tabla solo, instrumental, vocal, and dance accompaniment.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe minimal virus {{requirements}} for the generation of influenza virus-like particle (VLP) assembly and budding were reassessed. Using neuraminidase (NA) from the H 5 N 1 and H 1 N 1 subtypes, {{it was found that}} the expression of NA alone was sufficient to generate and release VLPs. Biochemical and functional characterization of the NA-containing VLPs demonstrated that they were morphologically similar to influenza virions. The NA oligomerization was comparable to that of the live virus, and the enzymic activity, whilst not required for the release of NA-VLPs, was preserved.

30|$|The use of {{experimentally}} derived protein structures and a hybrid computational method that combines {{the advantages of}} docking algorithms with dynamic structural information provided by molecular dynamics simulation techniques has been successfully applied {{to a number of}} systems and most recently, aid in the discovery of HER 2, H 1 N 1 and M 2 inhibitors (Yang et al. 2011; Tsai et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011 a; Lai et al. 2011; Chang et al. 2011 e; Lin et al. 2011 b). In addition, molecular dynamic simulation could also be helpful in the analysis of mechanism of drug resistance. Recently, we have identified the mechanism of oseltamivir resistance by means molecular docking and molecular dynamics approach (Karthick et al. 2012). The available literature evidences suggests that two or three Arginine residues (150 loop) surrounding the carboxylic group of <b>NA</b> inhibitors <b>play</b> a key role in orienting and stabilizing various inhibitors (Russell et al. 2006). Our computational approach also correlates well with the experimental evidences.

For the quantum confinement effect, AC NA finds use in the field of catalysis [36, 37, 38].
