This <b>delivery</b> <b>order</b> was valued at over $440 million {{and called for}} more than 1,000 vehicles, with the first vehicles rolling out in December 2010.

While it was believed the U.S. Army {{would have liked to}} continue HET A1 production through fiscal year 2017, no awards were made and in July 2016 the US Army announced that it wished to use FY16 funds to start an engineering study into an E-HET that would replace the current M1070A1 and M1000 semi-trailer. This study had previously been slated to commence in FY17. The E-HETS will comprise a tractor and semi-trailer to transport, recover, and evacuate an 80+ ton combat loaded M1 Abrams and associated M88 recovery system, which is anticipated to weigh more than 84 tons.|$|E

[...] As {{part of the original}} JLTV LRIP/FRP Base Award in August 2015, an initial 201 JLTVs for the test and evaluation phase were ordered. The 657-vehicle order is an exercised option from the program's eight option years. Overall JLTV requirements remain at 5,500 for the US Marines and 49,099 for the Army. In April 2016 it was disclosed that JLTV's Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for both services would be delayed as a result of earlier protests and associated issues. Initial USMC operating capability will be delayed by about one year to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, with 69 JLTVs for a Marine infantry battalion, with procurement by the Marines complete by FY 2022.
