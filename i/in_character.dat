5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between when a player is <b>in</b> <b>character,</b> meaning they are actively representing their character, and when the player is out-of-character, meaning they are being themselves. Some LARPs encourage players to stay consistently <b>in</b> <b>character</b> except in emergencies, while others accept players being out-of-character at times. In a LARP, it is usually assumed that players are speaking and acting <b>in</b> <b>character</b> unless otherwise noted, which {{is the opposite of}} normal practice in tabletop role-playing games. Character knowledge is usually considered to be separate from player knowledge, and acting upon information a character would not know may be viewed as cheating.|$|E
