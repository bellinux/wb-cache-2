5|$|Although {{the use of}} the {{graduated}} scale and <b>grid</b> <b>reference</b> for maps was not thoroughly described until the published work of Pei Xiu (224–271 AD), there is evidence that in the early 2nd century AD, cartographer Zhang Heng was the first to use scales and grids for maps.|$|E
5|$|Positioned at the {{national}} <b>grid</b> <b>reference</b> 35960865, Hampton Down Stone Circle {{is located on the}} southern edge of an open downland ridge at a height of 680 feet above sea level. Located 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) north-west of Portesham on private land, it is positioned on the rim of Portesham Hill and overlooks the coast. Had the vegetation levels been low {{at the time of the}} circle's creation then it would have permitted extensive panoramic views of the coastline. The site is a scheduled monument, and thus accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} life was {{improved}} with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century AD had invented the papermaking process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the <b>grid</b> <b>reference</b> for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden earthquakes with {{the invention of the}} seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or rammed earth still stand today.|$|E

25|$|Grid reference: Although {{professional}} map-making {{and use of}} {{the grid}} had existed in China before, the Chinese cartographer and geographer Pei Xiu of the Three Kingdoms period was the first to mention a plotted geometrical <b>grid</b> <b>reference</b> and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations. Historian Howard Nelson asserts that there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the idea of the <b>grid</b> <b>reference</b> from the map of Zhang Heng (78139 CE), a polymath inventor and statesman of the Eastern Han dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Pei Xiu {{outlined}} and analysed the advancements of cartography, surveying {{and mathematics}} up until his time. He criticised earlier Han dynasty maps for {{their lack of}} precision and quality when representing scale and measured distances, although 20th century archaeological excavations and findings of maps predating the third century prove otherwise. There is also evidence that Zhang Heng (78139) {{was the first to}} establish the <b>grid</b> <b>reference</b> system in Chinese cartography.|$|E

25|$|Whorlton Castle is {{a ruined}} medieval castle {{situated}} near the abandoned village of Whorlton (at <b>grid</b> <b>reference</b> NZ4802) in North Yorkshire, England. It {{was built in}} the early 12th century as a Norman motte-and-bailey associated with the nearby settlement. The castle is an unusual example of a motte-and-bailey that remained in use throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period. Built to overlook an important road on {{the western edge of the}} North York Moors, the castle fell into ruin as early as the mid-14th century. The site nonetheless continued to be inhabited until at least the early 17th century. Little now remains of the castle itself, other than the remnants of some cellars or undercrofts. The ruined shell of a 14th-century gatehouse still survives, albeit in fairly poor condition. It is a listed building and is privately owned but can be visited by the public.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 267,Pei Xiu (224271) was {{appointed}} as the Minister of Works by Emperor Wu of Jin, the first emperor of the Jin Dynasty. Pei {{is best known}} for his work in cartography. Although map making and use of the grid existed in China before him, he was the first to mention a plotted geometrical grid and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations. Pei outlined six principles that should be observed when creating maps, two of which included the rectangular grid and the graduated scale for measuring distance. Historians compare him to the Greek Ptolemy for his contributions in cartography. However, Howard Nelson states that, although the accounts of earlier cartographic works by the inventor and official Zhang Heng (78139) are somewhat vague and sketchy, there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the use of the rectangular <b>grid</b> <b>reference</b> from the maps of Zhang Heng.|$|E
25|$|Gazetteers {{are often}} {{categorized}} by the type, and scope, {{of the information}} presented. World gazetteers usually consist of an alphabetical listing of countries, with pertinent statistics for each one, with some gazetteers listing information on individual cities, towns, villages, and other settlements of varying sizes. Short-form gazetteers, often {{used in conjunction with}} computer mapping and GIS systems, may simply contain a list of place-names together with their locations in latitude and longitude or other spatial referencing systems (e.g.,British National <b>Grid</b> <b>reference).</b> Short-form gazetteers appear as a place–name index in the rear of major published atlases. Descriptive gazetteers may include lengthy textual descriptions of the places they contain, including explanation of industries, government, geography, together with historical perspectives, maps and/or photographs. Thematic gazetteers list places or geographical features by theme; for example fishing ports, nuclear power stations, or historic buildings. Their common element is that the geographical location is an important attribute of the features listed.|$|E

25|$|Aughanduff was {{probably}} first {{settled in the}} Bronze Age. No prehistoric remains of note appear {{to survive in the}} area, however, bar an undated site listed on the Northern Ireland Environment Agency's Monuments and Buildings Record. This is thought to have been an enclosure 60m in diameter, set on a localised height within the townland at Irish <b>Grid</b> <b>Reference</b> H9736023370. Photographic records show a series of earthworks and although a field inspection in 2004 failed to locate upstanding remains, it is noted that the site would have been an excellent position for a settlement. The townland lies just over a mile (2km) from An Aughnaclough mullion, where in 1815 the first, and reportedly most remarkable, megalith tomb in Ireland (subsequently destroyed) was discovered by Mr. John Bell of Newry. Several prehistoric stone structures have been found and documented in the area but many have been lost over the years. An example of such a structure was a ring fort named 'the Lis' which appears on the map of 1827 as being in the field adjacent to where the Church now stands, however this structure is no longer visible and must be presumed to have been destroyed.|$|E
