40|$|Stephen Marks {{provides}} an interesting {{exploration of the}} relation between tort and crime. He tackles a number of difficult issues and raises a variety of interesting questions. Professor Marks works within the social utilitarian tradition as he attempts to use a social utility formulation both to identify the acts a society designates as crimes and to determine the optimal enforcement of the criminal law, specifically, the probability and severity of the punishment society attaches to each crime. Marks 2 ̆ 7 s foundational observation is that the categorization decision requires a social utility function that includes the utility of criminal acts while the <b>enforcement</b> <b>decision</b> should exclude the utility generated by the criminal act. The latter point has a substantial history. It was the basis for George J. Stigler 2 ̆ 7 s fundamental criticism of the social welfare function used by Gary S.

As Marks argues, 2 ̆ 2 if both criminalization and enforcement decisions have social utilitarian explanations then these explanations must use different social utility functions. 2 ̆ 22 ̆...|$|E
40|$|By {{conducting}} sound {{research to}} understand the concepts surrounding rioting and efficient riot response tactics, professionals, especially whose main job is to ensure the tranquility in the society, will be better {{prepared to deal with}} all kinds of civil movements. The purpose of this study, consequently, is to meet the growing need for educational materials in this area and to provide riot response case studies, which demonstrate the numerous administrative challenges faced by law <b>enforcement</b> <b>decision</b> makers. In this study, seven major riots from throughout the United States are discussed including the Hay Market Riot of 1886, the Watts Riot of 1965, and Los Angeles Riots of 1992. Each riot case is studied in five different and independent stages: the setting and pre-disturbance situation, basic causes of the event, the disturbance situation, the response to the riot, and the aftermath of the incident. The study of all of these stages is intended to help police administrators acquire a general perspective on collective violence, and help them prevent future occurrences in their jurisdictions. In this thesis a special reference is given to the deficiencies of American riot policing and some recommendations were formed accordingly. Therefore, the study concludes with a list of general recommendations, which are crucially important for concerned officials to pay attention before, during, and after a riot...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{mathematical}} optimization model {{at the intersection}} of homeland security and immigration, that chooses various immigration <b>enforcement</b> <b>decision</b> variables to minimize the probability that a terrorist can successfully enter the United States across the U. S. -Mexico border. Included are a discrete choice model for the probability that a potential alien crosser will attempt to cross the U. S. -Mexico border in terms of the likelihood of success and the U. S. wage for illegal workers, a spatial model that calculates the apprehension probability {{as a function of the}} number of crossers, the number of border patrol agents, and the amount of surveillance technology on the border, a queueing model that determines the probabil-ity that an apprehended alien will be detained and removed as a function of the number of detention beds, and an equilibrium model for the illegal wage that balances the supply and demand for work and incorporates the impact of worksite enforcement. Our main result is that detention beds are the current system bottleneck (even after the large reduction in deten-tion residence times recently achieved by expedited removal), and increases in border patrol staffing or surveillance technology would not provide any improvements without a large in-crease in detention capacity. Our model also predicts that surveillance technology is more cost effective than border patrol agents, which in turn are more cost effective than worksite inspectors, but these results are not robust due to the difficulty of predicting human behavior from existing data. Overall, the probability that a terrorist can successfully enter the United States is very high, and it would be extremely costly and difficult to significantly reduce it. We also investigate the alternative objective function of minimizing the flow of illegal aliens across the U. S. -Mexico border, and obtain qualitatively similar results...|$|E

40|$|Selective {{enforcement}} of the criminal law is the practice of prosecuting 2 ̆ 2 some and not... others, when all have engaged in conduct similarly prohibited by a given criminal law, and when all have an equal chance of being convicted. 2 ̆ 2 This practice {{is an integral part}} of the American criminal justice system, which traditionally has accepted the assumption that a prosecutor is not required to treat every offender alike. As Justice Burger has stated: 2 ̆ 2 [M]yriad factors can enter into the prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s decision. Two persons may have committed what is precisely the same offense but the prosecutor is not compelled by law, duty or tradition to treat them the same as to charges. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 The prosecutor is entitled to consider the past criminal records of the offenders, the time and resources of the prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s staff, and the public 2 ̆ 7 s current attitude toward the offense. The prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s task is to weigh the relevant factors and to decide in his discretion which offenders to prosecute. The courts have been reluctant to review the prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s exercise of his discretion, because they feel that the power to enforce the law belongs to the executive branch of government. They fear that by reviewing prosecutorial decisions, they would be indirectly making enforcement decisions themselves, thus usurping the power of the executive branch and violating the separation of powers doctrine. Moreover, courts suggest that prosecutors, who make enforcement decisions on a daily basis, have greater expertise than courts in the process of weighing the relevant factors. Finally, courts assert that judicial inquiry into the <b>enforcement</b> <b>decision</b> might necessitate examination of the internal discussions and memoranda of the prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s staff.

40|$|How do {{frontline}} regulatory offices {{make sense}} of and enforce new ambiguous statutes? In {{order to understand the}} process of constructing the meaning of ambiguous law at the street-level, this dissertation focuses on horizontal interaction among frontline offices [...] - does inter-organizational interaction between frontline offices influence their interpretations and enforcement decisions, and if so, how and under what conditions?Based on a national survey and in-depth interviews with frontline regulators, Ministry of Environment, and regulated entities {{in the context of the}} Japanese environmental regulations, supplemented by a two-week period of observations on the frontline in Japan, this research shows that inter-office interaction is as important as the micro-level factors (e. g., institutional factors relating to single office and characteristics of individual regulator) for understanding how street-level interpretations and enforcement decisions develop. Faced with legal ambiguity under a decentralized legal system, frontline offices commonly contact peer offices to make sure that their legal interpretation and <b>enforcement</b> <b>decision</b> is appropriate. Such consultation behavior helps develop shared, consistent understandings of which interpretations and enforcement decisions are within the law—what is referred to as meso-level schemas in this research. Such schemas function as generators of legal meaning and sources of legitimacy under conditions of legal ambiguity. The term meso-level signifies that this justification mechanism takes place between the local, micro-level (i. e., by individual regulators and within individual offices) and the macro-level of national legal design and top-down mandates. Meso-level schemas rest on horizontal relationships developed among frontline offices that are informally connected to each other. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that frontline offices belonging to peer office meeting groups are more likely to contact peer offices, and in general, more likely to stringently enforce the statutes than those not so connected. Also, statistical analyses show that different meeting bodies have developed different levels of enforcement stringency, other relevant variables being controlled. In summary, quantitative analyses indicate that (1) the meaning of ambiguous statutes is influenced not only by individual, micro-level factors but also the inter-organizational dynamics in which street-level offices are situated, and (2) different inter-organizational bodies can develop different meaning of law. Interview analyses illuminate how inter-office interaction influences street-level enforcement, and reveal three roles of inter-office interaction in shaping the meaning of law, all of which are conducive to generating consistent enforcement across jurisdictions. First, under legal ambiguity and risk/harm uncertainty, consistent enforcement across jurisdictions can work as an endorsement, a signal showing that street-level rule application is accurate and fair. Second, inter-office interaction offers a prototype of interpretation that other offices can follow, and third, it provides a learning opportunity wherein offices can learn enforcement expertise from peer offices. By focusing on legitimacy concerns of street-level offices, interview analyses also illustrate why and under what conditions meso-level schemas are employed and why they encourage stringent enforcement. The analyses illuminate the mechanisms of how contingent power dynamics between regulatory offices and regulated entities create a strong need for offices to demonstrate enforcement legitimacy vis-à-vis regulated entities, which encourages offices to utilize meso-level schemas. In addition to the significant presence of regulated entities, scarce public scrutiny over Japanese environmental enforcement reinforces the general implementation tendency to emphasize false positive risk (overly regulating non-harmful business activity) rather than false negative risk (not regulating harmful activity). Moreover, insufficient legal expertise, little access to external sources of arguments, and insufficient internal training can hinder frontline offices from enforcing the statutes under legal ambiguity because of the fear of challenges and objections from regulated entities. Under such conditions, meso-level schemas appeal to street-level offices, especially when offices do not find adequate support for making legal arguments about enforcement that may face challenges from regulated entities. For frontline offices with little enforcement expertise and insufficient internal training, meso-level schemas are effective for eliciting compliance, countering possible challenges from regulated entities, and reinforcing their enforcement legitimacy. The dissertation concludes by joining empirical findings with theoretical arguments, discussing the conditions under which inter-office interaction can play a role in street-level enforcement in other legal contexts, and elucidating policy implications. By incorporating inter-organizational processes of constructing legal meaning into studies of street-level regulatory enforcement, this dissertation provides a fresh approach to street-level enforcement, inter-organizational dynamics, and more broadly, the dynamics of administrative legitimacy...|$|E

40|$|Annotation The {{objective}} and {{central theme of}} this paper is to compare the various methods of <b>decision</b> <b>enforcement</b> undertaken by municipal authorities in carrying out their activities in terms of frequency and success. A prerequisite for success is to identify the effectiveness of <b>decision</b> <b>enforcement</b> in terms of the form. Another condition is to compare groups of citizens against whom <b>decision</b> <b>enforcement</b> is directed in terms of social stratification, i. e. in terms of education and age ? the factors from which we assume their position in society. To find out what is the practical process of <b>decision</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The assumption is that the territorial offices of municipal authorities use mostly the pecuniary form of <b>decision</b> <b>enforcement</b> and that this form is effective in meeting the claims of beneficiaries. The primary method chosen is quantitative research; the secondary method is the analysis of data from the database of the Milevsko Municipal Authority. The target group of the research is a set of citizens,against whom the municipal authority in Milevsko carried out <b>decision</b> <b>enforcement</b> proceedings in the period of 2009 - 2010.
