40|$|The {{application}} of the Finite Element Method (FEM) to the numerical solution of electromagnetic field and force distributions inside electric machinery and transformers requires a priori knowledge {{of the distribution of}} current density. This information is typically unavailable when these devices are voltage-fed through external drive circuitry, thus making the coupling of field and circuit equations nontrivial. Methods thus far described in the literature for the solution of coupled field-circuit problems are based on either an indirect coupling approach via a set of lumped circuit parameters, or on a direct coupling methodology wherein the field and circuit equations are solved simultaneously. Direct coupling of field and circuit equations can be accomplished either via winding currents or flux linkages. The flux-linkage-based approach leads to the so-called inverse finite element problem, wherein the field equations are reformulated to accept flux linkages as inputs with currents as outputs. Thus far, all methods proposed in the literature for solving the inverse problem do so by repeatedly solving the forward problem with different values of supply current(s), each such solution being iterative if material nonlinearities exist, thus resulting in a doubly-iterative loop. While both current-based and flux-linkage-based approaches possess superior convergence properties to indirect coupling methods, the current-based approach is more widely used {{due to the lack of}} efficient methods for solving the inverse finite element problem. ^ In this thesis, a new approach to the solution of the inverse finite element problem is set forth, which permits the direct evaluation of winding currents from flux linkages, iterating only at a single layer in the presence of nonlinear materials, thus offering a definite computational advantage over previous methods. This approach permits a natural coupling of field equations to circuit equations in state-space form with flux linkages as state variables. In addition to the elimination of an iterative loop, this method produces a state model with superior eigenstructure and improved convergence properties for nonlinear systems compared with existing current-based models. This methodology has been applied to the transient simulation of a switched-reluctance machine, and to a toroidal-core inductor operated under <b>heavy</b> <b>saturation.</b> Results obtained with this method have been validated numerically against commercial FE packages and are in excellent agreement with experimentally measured data. ...|$|E

This was the first trial of the re-entry experiment as a Japanese interplanetary spacecraft. We organized an expedition to South Australia for ground-based observations, and succeeded in obtaining valuable data of various phenomena occurring at this re-entry by using 17 instruments. Our data were widely used not only for scientific analysis, but also for outreach purposes [1]. We succeeded to monitor fragmentation of {{the main body of}} HAYABUSA spacecraft at the re-entry. The fragmentation started at 13 h 52 m 5. 2 s UT at 83 – 84 km above the sea level, and the number of fragments increased with time. The maximum number is more than a few hundreds at around 13 h 52 m 20 s, and the fragments dispersed with more than 14 km in length, and 1 km in width along the re-entry trajectory. The number decreased after the maximum, and almost ended at 13 h 52 m 31. 3 s at around the height of 45 km. Under some assumptions, we derived size distribution of the fragments, which shows small power low index within a range of − 1. 2 and − 1. 4, which is similar to − 1. 5 of the intrinsic size distribution of assembled parts of the spacecraft. This strongly indicates that in the fragmentation phenomena the size distribution of the fragments reflects the internal structure of the parent bodies [2]. A low resolution spectroscopic observation of the capsule were also performed.

30|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of enhancing oil recovery from a Middle East heavy oil field via hot water injection followed by injection of a chemical surfactant and/or a biosurfactant produced by a Bacillus subtilis strain which was isolated from oil-contaminated soil. The results reveal that the biosurfactant and the chemical surfactant reduced the residual oil saturation after a hot water flood. Moreover, {{it was found that}} the performance of the biosurfactant increased by mixing it with the chemical surfactant. It is expected that the structure of the biosurfactant used in this study was changed when mixed with the chemical surfactant as a probable synergetic effect of biosurfactant-chemical surfactants was observed on enhancing oil recovery, when used as a mixture, rather than alone. This work proved that it is more feasible to inject the biosurfactant as a blend with the chemical surfactant, at the tertiary recovery stage. This might be attributed to the fact that in the secondary mode, improvement of the macroscopic sweep efficiency is important, whereas in the tertiary recovery mode, the microscopic sweep efficiency matters mainly and it is improved by the biosurfactant-chemical surfactant mixture. Also as evidenced by this study, the biosurfactant worked better than the chemical surfactant in reducing the residual <b>heavy</b> oil <b>saturation</b> after a hot water flood.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the nonlinear analysis, design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} an axial-gap magnetic induction micro machine, which is a two-phase planar motor in which the rotor is suspended above the stator via mechanical springs, or tethers. The micro motor is fabricated from thick layers of electroplated NiFe and copper, by our collaborators at Georgia Institute of Technology. The rotor and the stator cores are 4 mm in diameter each, and the entire motor is about 2 mm thick. During fabrication, SU- 8 epoxy {{is used as a}} structural mold material for the electroplated cores. The tethers are designed to be compliant in the azimuthal direction, while preventing axial deflections and maintaining a constant air gap. This enables accurate measurements of deflections within the rotor plane via a computer microvision system. The small scale of the magnetic induction micro machine, in conjunction with the good thermal contact between its electroplated stator layers, ensures an isothermal device which can be cooled very effectively. Current densities over 109 A/m 2 simultaneously through each phase is repeatedly achieved during experiments; this density is over two orders of magnitude larger than what can be achieved in conventional macro-scale machines. (cont.) More than 5 Nm of torque is obtained for an air gap of about 5 zm, making this micro motor the highest torque density micro-scale magnetic machine to date. About 0. 3 buNm for the large air gap of 70 m is also achieved in systematic tests that reveal the influence of strong eddy-currents and associated nonlinear saturation within the micro motor Eddy-current effects are modeled using a finite-difference vector potential formulation. Its results demonstrate the presence of flux crowding on the stator surface, which leads to <b>heavy</b> <b>saturation.</b> To capture saturation effects, a fully nonlinear finite-difference time-domain simulation is developed to solve Maxwell's Equations within the computational space of the micro machine. To mitigate the inherent stiffness in the partial differential equations, the speed of light is artificially reduced by five orders of magnitude, taking special care that assumptions of magnetoquasistatic behavior are still met. The results from this model are in very good agreement with experimental data from the tethered magnetic induction micro motor. by Brian Lee. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In {{the history}} of {{technological}} development, {{it is usually the}} case that the technology is available before mankind understands the full potential of its use. Thus {{it should come as no}} surprise that CTP (Computer-to Plate) technology is currently waiting for its advantages to be exploited by the graphic arts 2 ̆ 7 market. This was evidenced by the <b>heavy</b> <b>saturation</b> of platesetters presented at DRUPA 1995 (the largest printing trade show in the world), which demonstrated that CTP is no longer a research and development experiment but a marketplace reality and the topic of considerable discussion. Surprisingly, the response of the printing industry to this new age of digital prepress which CTP systems were designed to facilitate has been rather restrained. Although most printers agree that digital formatting and output are the way of the future; printers are still uneasy at the prospect of investing in CTP systems. This reluctance is certainly understandable, since anyone considering buying a platesetter (computer-to-plate system) will potentially have to reorganize and update their front end computer system and its accompanying workflow. To compound the issue, buyers need a pay back period three years or less to recoup their investment, due to the accelerated rate of computer obsolescence. And, as if this isn 2 ̆ 7 t enough to think about, probably the biggest deterrent is coming from the manufacturers themselves. As platesetters begin to carve out market share from conventional imagesetter territory, the manufacturers have now modified the existing technology to work with thermal plates while increasing their efforts to produce Direct-to Press technology. In such a climate of change, most printers would prefer to invest in a system that can prove its profitability along with its potential to upgrade rather than a system destined to be marked as a piece of transitional technology. In an effort to understand and evaluate the aforementioned problems CTP systems are creating in the marketplace, this paper has analyzed a platesetter being used in pro duction to determine the viability of cost justification proposals developed by the CTP manufacturers in order to maximize profits. Several printing companies, who specialize in different market segments, have been interviewed in the data collection process. A comparison of these organizations has demonstrated under which circumstances the investment in a CTP system is justified and which environmental factors have to be considered for an ROI calculation. Among the local participants is the Webster Division of Thomson Professional Publishing a parent company to five different publishing branches that specialize in legal publishing and book production. The Webster location has just recently installed its second CTP system. The other cooperating company is Canfield and Tack, of Rochester, New York a high quality commercial printing company that recently signed a letter of intent to purchase a CTP system. Additional interview sources will be industry consultants, printers, manufacturers and suppliers. By doing a comparison of the considerations upon which each system was evaluated by the different firms, conclusions may be drawn as to the future of CTP in the marketplace, and more significantly, where cost justification fits into this picture of fast moving technology. This thesis strives to secure the answers to three key issues: 1) Can cost justification, using the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s suggested model, provide potential buyers with enough infor mation to prove that CTP systems are a good capital investment; 2) Are the cost benefits achievable with a CTP system enough to warrant such a radical restructuring of work flow; and 3) Does the issue of equipment obsolescence and its economic impact have a determining factor in the decision to install such a system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of concentrated winding configurations and stator core structures on torque performance of fractional-slot surface-mounted PM (SPM) machines. From analyzing the separated torque components of prototype SPM machines with 12 -slots/ 10 -poles (12 S/ 10 P) combination by frozen permeability (FP) method, {{it can be found}} that the torque ripple is closely related with local saturation in fully closed slot (FCS) machines. Besides, the <b>heavier</b> local <b>saturation</b> will also jeopardize the merit of using alternate teeth wound windings, such as obtaining higher average torque than electrical machines with all teeth wound windings. The further analysis of stator tooth relative permeability variation over one electrical period demonstrates that the major reason for torque ripple difference among these electrical machines with different stator topologies is the asymmetric saturation between the adjacent teeth. Both the subharmonic due to armature reaction (determined by winding connection and current value) and the asymmetry of stator core structure contribute to such asymmetric saturation. In order to more clearly verify this, the complementary slot/pole number combination (12 S/ 14 P) is also analyzed. The conclusion is effective for electrical machines with other slot/pole number combinations as well. Experiments have been carried out to validate the predictions...|$|R

40|$|Kinesin is a microtubule-activated ATPase {{that moves}} objects toward the plus end of microtubules and makes microtubules glide along a glass surface. Here we {{investigate}} a remarkable {{effect of the}} nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, adenosine 5 '-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate (p[NH]ppA), on kinesin-driven microtubule gliding. Microtubule gliding that has been blocked by rapid replacement of ATP with p[NH]ppA requires 1 - 2 min of exposure to ATP before microtubule gliding resumes. This latency is not shortened by prolonged washing of p[NH]ppA-blocked microtubules in nucleotide-free buffer for up to 15 min, suggesting that ATP binding to a second nucleotide binding site on kinesin triggers the release of bound p[NH]ppA. To test this hypothesis, the release of [3 H]p[NH]ppA from kinesin-microtubule complexes was followed in parallel biochemical assays. In nucleotide-free buffer, the bound p[NH]ppA was released over several hours from the complexes. However, addition of ATP caused the release of p[NH]ppA from the kinesin-microtubule complexes within 2 min, which {{was similar to the}} latent period for start-up of microtubule gliding after p[NH]ppA inhibition.

40|$|Commercial heavy vehicles, unlike {{passenger}} vehicles, display huge {{variation in}} parameters such as vehicle mass. Coupled with lower actuation authorities (engine and brake capabilities), these variations can induce actuator saturation even in moderately demanding maneuvers, presenting {{challenge to the}} task of maintaining string stability in a platoon formation of heavy trucks. A new control scheme is proposed to put on-line bounds, or artificial saturation, on command signals via parameter estimation such that all members in a platoon can follow the reference commands without saturating actuators, thereby, maintaining string stability. This work also demonstrates two methods for obtaining an estimate of road grade using a Global Positioning System (GPS) system on a ground vehicle. In the first method, two antennae are used to directly measure the attitude of the vehicle in the pitch plane; in the second method, the ratio of vertical to horizontal velocity at a single antenna is used to estimate road grade. The resulting grade measurements are then used together with engine torque information to produce estimates of mass, rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag from a simple longitudinal force balance. The resulting mass estimation consistently converged to within 2 % of the true vehicle mass.

40|$|Rotor {{electromagnetic}} losses can {{be problematic}} in high speed permanent magnet synchronous machines, {{especially when the}} speed or the electrical loading are high and the slotting and winding configuration results in high magnitude asynchronous harmonics. Accurate estimation of these travelling flux harmonics in the initial design stage is essential, as small errors can result in significant errors in the estimated rotor losses, {{which could lead to}} misinformed design decisions. This Thesis makes a number of contributions to the subject of rotor losses in PM machines. It firstly investigates the accuracy of the commonly used current sheet method for estimating losses for each harmonic. In this method, the losses are calculated using a multi-layer model of the machine in which each asynchronous harmonic in the rotor frame is represented by current sheet {{on the surface of the}} bore of a slotless stator. The harmonics are calculated using double Fourier transform of flux density data on the surface of the magnet obtained from a number of magnetostatic finite element (FE) solutions at different rotor position. The losses are also calculated using 2 D transient FEA with rotor motion, with appropriate mesh refinement and time step determined based on a mesh and time step dependence study. The results show that the current sheet method accurately calculates the losses in ring magnets if the amplitudes of the harmonics are estimated accurately. Secondly, the Thesis extends 3 analytical methods that have been reported in the literature by Zhu and Howe (1993), Gieras (2004) and et al (2006) to estimate the amplitude of the no-load asynchronous travelling flux density harmonics, the magnet flux tooth ripple harmonics, in the rotor frame. The accuracy of these methods is evaluated by comparison to those calculated using non-linear finite element analysis for variants of a particular machine. The results show that (et al, 2006) complex permeance method provides the closest estimate, when the level of saturation in the machine is negligible. However, if the saturation, of the tooth tip in particular is significant, then all methods underestimate the amplitudes of the harmonics. And accordingly, the estimated rotor losses are grossly underestimated by a factor of 1 : 3 in a machine with <b>heavy</b> tooth tip <b>saturation.</b> Thirdly, the Thesis tackles the problem of losses in a loaded generator with sinusoidal currents. It is shown that the total losses in the machine are dependent on the power factor and the phase angle between the emf and current. The total loss cannot be simply calculated by adding the no-load loss due to magnet flux tooth ripple harmonics and the loss due to stator mmf asynchronous harmonics. This is due to the interaction between the stator mmf harmonics and the magnet flux tooth ripple harmonics, which need to be added vectorially. This is verified by comparing the results calculated analytically (using the most accurate ’s meth d f calculating no-load harmonics), with those obtained from transient FEA in a machine with no significant saturation. Fourthly, the Thesis investigates rotor losses in a generator with two slots per pole per phase connected to an uncontrolled diode rectifier, considering the two cases of constant current and constant voltage dc link. Two winding and rectifier configurations are considered: a 3 -phase winding with a 3 -phase, 6 pulse bridge rectifier and a double 3 -phase winding with a 3 -phase rectifier each, connected in series i. e., a 12 pulse rectifier. Both magnet flux tooth ripple and armature reaction stator mmf harmonics are considered in the calculation of rotor loss; the harmonics were added vectorially. It is shown that the machine with double 3 -phase windings and 12 pulse rectifier has considerably lower rotor losses that the machine with one single 3 -phase winding due to cancellation of high order harmonics. Finally, limited studies are performed in the Thesis for the calculation of rotor losses in PMSGs with different slot opening, number of slots per pole and airgap (with magnet thickness adjusted to keep the airgap flux density and emf constant). It is shown that increasing the airgap and reducing slot opening reduced the losses The results plotted in a normalised form of loss per unit rotor surface area are versus the ratios of gap/slot pitch and slot opening divided by pole pitch. These curves are shown to give reasonable quick estimates of rotor losses in machines with different sizes. Also, rotor losses are calculated in three PMSGs with different numbers of slots per pole and winding / rectifier configurations. The results show that the popular 1. 5 slots per pole concentrated winding configuration have considerably higher rotor losses due to the strong second harmonic than the other machines with lap windings. The work in the Thesis was based on two-dimensional calculations, assuming ring magnets. Further work is needed to evaluate the 3 D effect and magnet segmentation...|$|R
