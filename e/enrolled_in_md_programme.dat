40|$|Pakistan is a {{developing}} with 148 universities and degree awarding institutions including {{public and private}} sector. The enrolment as given in the National Educational Policy 2009 was up to 5 % only. It reflects greater demands of higher/tertiary education and calls for alternative strategic measures for addressing the issue. An innovative approach was necessary {{to address the issue}} of access. Therefore, the Islamia University of Bahawalpur –a formal mode university took an innovative initiative to become a dual mode university by establishing an Institute of Distance Education (IDE) in 2011. The institute offered along with others, an <b>M.</b> Phill <b>programme</b> <b>in</b> ten disciplines through distance education mode in semester fall 2011. More than eight hundred applications were received by potential learners against 275 seats. However, after test and interview 189 students were <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>M.</b> Phill <b>programme</b> <b>in</b> Applied Psychology, Arabic, Education, English, Media Studies, Islamic Studies, Pakistan Studies, History, Persian, and Urdu. In the beginning, the Institute organized an orientation workshop for learners to guide them studying in distance education system. The programme was offered under semester system and the semester was broke up into two halves –mid-term and final term. The respective departments provided learning materials to students whereas the IDE provided instructional booklet. Submission of two assignments was compulsory for the entire semester; one before mid-term and second before final-term workshop/ examination for each of the courses. Similarly, students’ presence in workshops for 24 hours (12 during mid-term and 12 during final-term workshop) for one 3 -credit hour course was mandatory. Students’ support services were provided through Skype conference, social media and mobile phones. Students necessarily had to give presentations and submit their assignments after checking their similarity index by using turnitin software. At the end of the course work the instructors rated performance of learners’ to be good. Learner’s appeared to be enthusiastic for continuing their studies. The experience appeared to be a milestone in promoting higher education and feasible for replication at larger scale in Pakistan. The process and procedures; achievements; and problems, issues and challenges were discussed paper to be presented during the conference. The detailed experience will be shared during the conference...|$|R

The education and professional development of foreign language teachers is a challenging endeavour – for the (student) teachers themselves, {{as well as for}} the teacher educators and institutions involved. In particular, the meaningful integration of theory and practice is central to the ongoing discussion as to how to conceptualise and implement foreign language teacher education. In this thesis, I investigate a cohort of 12 (student) teachers <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> the <b>M.</b> A. <b>programme</b> ‘E-LINGO – Teaching English to Young Learners’ in the form of a qualitative-interpretative case study with the aim to explore if, how and under what circumstances classroom action research, a core component of the programme, can foster professional development. The participants have different educational and cultural backgrounds and various levels of professional experience in the field of language teaching. Over a period of two years, I collected data from multiple sources (semi-structured group interviews, learning logs, portfolios and observation notes) and afterwards triangulated and interpreted the data to elicit indicators for professional development in the form of critical learning incidents. The data analysis was methodologically guided by the Documentary Method as developed by Bohnsack (1989). The findings suggest that classroom action research can foster professional development on different levels. On an affective level, it can lead to increased professional confidence and a growing understanding of teacher roles. On an interpersonal level, action research can enhance cooperative development through successful teamwork, commitment to the shared task and adequate support structures. On a cognitive level, it may lead to increased theoretical and methodological knowledge, depending on the quality of the input as well as on the (student) teachers’ commitment towards their learning. As the findings further indicate, these levels are closely interconnected and are strongly influenced by various socio-cultural factors of the teaching and learning context as well as the (student) teachers’ biographies.

40|$|Introduction Mother-to-Mother (M 2 M) or “Mentor Mother” {{programmes}} utilise HIV positive {{mothers to}} provide support and advice to HIV positive pregnant women and mothers of HIV exposed babies. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) supported a Mentor Mother programme in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe from 2009 to 2012; with programme beneficiaries observed to have far higher retention at 6 – 8 weeks (99 % vs 50 %, p< 0. 0005) and to have higher adherence to Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) guidelines, compared to those not opting in. In this study we explore how the M 2 M progamme {{may have contributed to}} these findings. Methods In this qualitative study we used thematic analysis of in-depth interviews (n = 79). This study was conducted in 2 urban districts of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second largest city. Results Interviews were completed by 14 mentor mothers, 10 mentor mother family members, 30 beneficiaries (women <b>enrolled</b> both <b>in</b> PMTCT and <b>M</b> 2 M), 10 beneficiary family members, 5 women <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> PMTCT but who had declined to take part <b>in</b> the <b>M</b> 2 <b>M</b> <b>programme</b> and 10 health care staff members. All beneficiaries and health care staff reported that the programme had improved retention and provided rich information on how this was achieved. Additionally respondents described how the programme had helped bring about beneficial behaviour change. Conclusions <b>M</b> 2 <b>M</b> <b>programmes</b> offer great potential to empower communities affected by HIV to catalyse positive behaviour change. Our results illustrate how M 2 M involvement may increase retention in PMTCT programmes.

30|$|Overall, I {{interacted with}} and {{collected}} data from over 20 Korean students <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>Ms.</b> Davis’s AP Biology class. I selected Melody, a senior Korean transnational girl for a close case analysis for two reasons: richness of her data and uniqueness of her case. Melody {{was one of}} the students who were open to me and willing to share their stories and thoughts. She referred to me me as eonni, which is a term used by younger women to refer to close female friends who are {{a few years older than}} themselves while other Korean students addressed me as seonsaengnim, which means teacher. In the interviews and other informal conversations, Melody told me about various experiences in school, including her feelings and struggles. In addition, I was able to interview her mother. These rich data allowed me to understand her sense-making of contexts and identity work. I present Melody as a representative case (Yin 2003) of Korean transnational students in that she was lively and talkative outside of the classroom and reported she had been even more socially active before her migration to the US, but she was reticent and not actively participatory in class in the US (Ryu 2013). She was, however, a counterexample to the prevalent notion that Asian and Korean students are academically well performing and strong in mathematics and science. In addition, Melody was a daughter of gireogi family, which is an increasing phenomenon, but is not well known among educators in the US. These unique characteristics made her case worth analyzing closely with respect to her science learning, participation, and identity work.|$|R
50|$|Born on May 13, 1753 in {{the village}} of Nolay, Côte-d'Or, Carnot was the son of local judge and royal notary, Claude Carnot and his wife, Marguerite Pothier. He was the second oldest of seven children. At the age of fourteen, Lazare and his brother were {{enrolled}} at the Collège d’Autun, in Burgundy where he focused on the study of philosophy and the classics. He held a strong belief in stoic philosophy and was deeply influenced by Roman civilization. When he turned fifteen, he left the Collège d’Autun to strengthen his philosophical knowledge and study under the Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice. During his short time with them, he studied logic, mathematics and theology under the Abbe Bison. After being impressed with Lazare’s work as a scholar, the Duke D’Aumont (Marquis de Nolay) recommended a military career for the young one and was soon sent by his father to the Aumont residence to further his education. Here, he was <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>M.</b> de Longpres pension school in 1770 until he was ready to enter one of two prestigious engineering and artillery schools in Paris. A year later, in February of 1771, he was ranked the third highest among twelve who were chosen out of his class of more than one hundred who took the entrance exams. It was at this point when he entered the Mézières School of Engineering appointed as second lieutenant. Studies at the Mézières included geometry, mechanics, geometrical designing, geography, hydraulics and material preparation. On January 1, 1773, he graduated the school ranked as first lieutenant. He was eighteen years old.|$|R

The researchers designed a translation test that consists of 20 statements which M. A students were asked to translate from Arabic into English. Each statement contained a culture-bound expression based on Newmark’s categorization of cultural terms. Proverbs, idioms, collocations and metaphors were extracted from different cultural materials, i. e., legal, historical, religious, social [...] . etc. The researchers also conducted informal open-ended interviews with experts in the field of translation to yield additional information from the experts’ point of view regarding these problems, their causes and solutions. The results of the study revealed that graduate students encounter different kinds of problems when translating cultural expressions. These problems are mostly related to: 1) unfamiliarity with cultural expressions 2) failure to achieve the equivalence in the second language, 3) ambiguity of some cultural expressions, 4) lack of knowledge of translation techniques and translation strategies. In light of these results, the researchers recommend narrowing the gap between cultures through adding more courses that deal with cultural differences, cultural knowledge, and cultural awareness, especially in the academic programs that prepare translators. </p...|$|R
