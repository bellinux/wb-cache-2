5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. They added a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by colleagues from the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill <b>End</b> <b>Group,</b> is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though sometimes a painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still lifes, which critics struggled to accommodate within their understanding of the Hill <b>End</b> <b>Group.</b> Nevertheless, several still lifes from this period are held in public collections, including Still Life with Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and Still life with wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. These images were often rendered with strong colour, which was also sometimes a feature of earlier works on which critics would remark.|$|E

40|$|The thermo-oxidative {{degradation}} of unstabilized polyamide 6 (PA- 6) was investigated {{by a number}} of novel techniques in an attempt to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms involved in the oxidative {{degradation of}} polymers. Particular attention was given to the influence of <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> on PA- 6 oxidation by studying samples that terminated predominantly in carboxylic, amine or methyl <b>end</b> <b>groups.</b> The changes occurring in the oxidative stabilities and mechanisms of PA- 6 as a result of altering the <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> of PA- 6 were investigated by a technique termed CL-DSC, which simultaneously measures the chemiluminescence (CL) and heat flow (DSC) from a sample. When amine <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> were abundant in the PA- 6 sample a chemically induced electron exchange luminescence (CIEEL) mechanism could occur directly and the CL intensity was proportional to the heat flow curve of the DSC. However, when amine <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> were absent it was the first derivative of the CL intensity that was proportional to the heat flow curve because the CIEEL mechanism could not operate until an easily oxidisable luminescent oxidation product was formed. Due to the dramatic effect <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> have on the oxidation mechanisms of PA- 6 it was hypothesized that <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> could be sites analogous to the impurities in polyolefins that lead to heterogeneous oxidation. To test this hypothesis, CL Imaging was used to map the occurrence and extent of oxidation across samples of PA- 6 to display the influence <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> have on the homogeneous or heterogeneous nature of PA- 6 oxidation. Sequences of FTIES spectra collected at specified time intervals during the in situ oxidation of PA- 6 samples terminating in the different <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> were turned into oxidation product profiles. The differences between spectra related to significant points on the oxidation profiles were compared in an attempt to elucidate the chemical or physical changes occurring in the samples during oxidation. To identify the species involved in the mechanistically different oxidation processes resulting from the different <b>end</b> <b>groups,</b> methods for the MALDI-TOF analysis of non-oxidized and oxidized PA- 6 samples were developed via trial and error. It was only possible to detect the occurrence of degradation products by MALDI-TOF MS after considerable oxidation as measured by chemiluminescence, by which time the species were the result of a number of oxidative processes. Therefore, identification of the species formed was not possible...|$|R

5000|$|Controlled radical polymerization, namely {{reversible}} addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT), is {{a common}} method for the polymerization of acrylates, methacrylates and acrylamides. Usually, a thiocarbonate is used in combination with an effective initiator for RAFT. The thiocarbonate moiety can be functionalized at the R-group for <b>end</b> <b>group</b> analysis. The <b>end</b> <b>group</b> {{is a result of}} the propagation of chain-transfer agents during the free-radical polymerization process. The end groups can subsequently be modified by the reaction of the thiocarbonylthio compounds with nucleophiles and ionic reducing agents. The method for removal of thiocarbonyl containing end groups includes reacting the polymers containing the end-groups with en excess of radicals which add to the reactive C=S bond of the <b>end</b> <b>group</b> forming an intermediate radical (shown below). The remaining radical on the polymer chain can be hydrogenated by what is referred to as a trapping group and terminate; this results in a polymer that is free of the end groups at the α and ω positions. Another method of <b>end</b> <b>group</b> removal for the thiocarbonyl containing end-groups of RAFT polymers is the addition of heat to the polymer; this is referred to as thermolysis. One method of monitoring thermolysis of RAFT polymers is by thermogravietric analysis resulting in a weight-loss of the <b>end</b> <b>group.</b> An advantage of this technique is that no additional chemicals are required to remove the end group; however, it is required that the polymer be thermally stable to high temperature and therefore may not be effective for some polymers. Depending on the polymers sensitivity to [...] ultraviolet radiation (UV) it has been reported in recent years that decomposition of end-groups can be effective, but preliminary data suggest that decomposition by UV leads to a change in the distribution of molecular weights of the polymer.|$|E

40|$|A {{family of}} {{fluorescent}} dye molecules {{has been developed}} for use in on-off fluorescence detection of specific chemicals. By themselves, these molecules do not fluoresce. However, when exposed to certain chemical analytes in liquid or vapor forms, they do fluoresce (see figure). These compounds are amenable to fixation on or {{in a variety of}} substrates for use in fluorescence-based detection devices: they can be chemically modified to anchor them to porous or non-porous solid supports or can be incorporated into polymer films. Potential applications for these compounds include detection of chemical warfare agents, sensing of acidity or alkalinity, and fluorescent tagging of proteins in pharmaceutical research and development. These molecules could also be exploited for use as two-photon materials for photodynamic therapy in the treatment of certain cancers and other diseases. A molecule in this family consists of a fluorescent core (such as an anthracene or pyrene) attached to two <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> that, when the dye is excited by absorption of light, transfer an electron to the core, thereby quenching the fluorescence. The <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> can be engineered so that they react chemically with certain analytes. Upon reaction, electrons on the <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> are no longer available for transfer to the core and, consequently, the fluorescence from the core is no longer quenched.
