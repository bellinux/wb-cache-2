40|$|Eight {{years of}} {{contemporaneous}} SST and ocean color data were statistically compared and contrasted to quantify their variations over {{a range of}} time and space scales. While it is generally accepted that chlorophyll concentrations (a proxy for primary production) on the equator are directly forced by upwelling, {{it is not clear that}} a simple correlation between SST and ocean color exists outside the equatorial wave guide or how it may depend on scale. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Missions microwave imager (TMI) and Sea View Wide Field of View sensor (SeaWiFS) sensors have been in operation simultaneously for a period of nine years. Thus, the resolution of eight full seasonal cycles, including several ENSO cycles, suggest that significant results can be obtained by statistically analyzing the correlations between these satellite observed data sets. The statistical techniques include simple correlations and empirical orthogonal functions. Of particular interest are the possible influences which tropical instability induced circulations have on the marine ecosystem and ocean color. While results presented in this study are consistent with the paradigm that equatorial upwelling causes high productivity in the cold tongue, the overall relationship between SST and CHL (chlorophyll-a) is complex, depending on both time and space scale. The dominant modes of temporal variability in both data set are shown to vary on a seasonal cycle, with an inter-annual component. In addition negative correlation is found in regions where fronts in both SST and ocean color are disturbed by the passing of tropical instabilities and mesoscale eddies. Several zones are identified where eddy forcing clearly indicates a relationship between enhanced primary production and the influx of relatively cold waters. While it is likely that the coastal regions are dominated by upwelling processes, the previously established dynamics of tropical instabilities lead us to propose that horizontal advection within instability vortices is the dominant process leading to enhanced primary production along the <b>equatorial</b> <b>fronts...</b>|$|R

In September-October 2001, negative anomalies of sea surface temperature from this event still remained in the eastern equatorial Pacific, mainly between Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands. The event allowed the incursion of the Humboldt Current farther north and of the Equatorial Undercurrent into the study area, favouring a strong <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Front</b> and upwelling processes. There was evidence of mesoscale eddies {{in the study area}} and of the presence of the South Equatorial Current going westward at about 1 °N. We identified 107 copepod species and analyzed the distribution of the 10 most abundant ones: Oncaea venusta, Subeucalanus pileatus, S. crassus, S. subtenuis, Paraeucalanus attenuatus, Pleuromamma borealis, Scolecithrix danae, Clausocalanus farrani, Temora discaudata and Calanus chilensis. Copepod distribution and abundance exhibited marked latitudinal differences related to the oceanographic conditions; abundance was highest to the southeast of the Galapagos Islands.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of the}} tropical Pacific Ocean is used to investigate the processes that cause the horizontal temperature advection of tropical instability waves (TIWs). It is found that their temperature advection cannot {{be explained by the}} processes on which the mixing length paradigm is based. Horizontal mixing of temperature across the <b>equatorial</b> SST <b>front</b> does happen, but it is small relative to the “oscillatory ” temperature advection of TIWs. The basic mechanism is that TIWs move water back and forth across a patch of large vertical entrainment. Outside this patch, the atmosphere heats the water and this heat is then transferred into the thermocline inside the patch. These patches of strong localized entrainment are due to equatorial Ekman divergence and due to thinning of the mixed layer in the TIW cyclones. The latter process is responsible for the zonal temperature advection, which is as large as the meridional temperature advection but has not yet been observed. Thus, in the previous observational literature the TIW contribu-tion to the mixed layer heat budget may have been underestimated significantly. 1...|$|R

First, {{the influence of the}} SST on the spring and summer precipitation is quantified through the analysis of the moisture flux convergence over the continent. Then, some hints of a potential feedback from the changing continental surface (under rainy conditions) over the regional atmospheric circulation are shown, likely involving the southward low-level atmospheric circulation (or Shallow Meridional Circulation), subsidence over the Gulf of Guinea and then surface southerlies again, closing an active loop of ocean-atmosphere-continent interaction...|$|R

The velocity and thermohaline {{structures of the}} vortex were mapped in three dimensions using hydrography, acoustic Doppler current measurements, drifters, and satellite infrared images. The vortex translated westward at 30 cm s 21 (0. 248 day 21), stationary relative to the mean flow, and {{less than half the}} 80 cm s 21 speed of contemporaneous meridional oscillations of the Equatorial Undercurrent and South Equatorial Current. The coherent flow pattern was restricted to above the thermocline. Convergence at the North <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Front</b> and divergence near the vortex center occurred in a dipole pattern similar to those predicted by various numerical models. The convergence and the anticyclonic vorticity were of the same magnitudes as the local inertial frequency, suggesting that the feature was a fully nonlinear, large Rossby number vortex, and may have been subject to centrifugal instability. The anticyclonic flow was {{associated with}} a thermocline depression of 30 m and a deformation of the North <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Front.</b> Northward advection of cold, saline, equatorial water and southward advection of warmer, fresher, tropical water yielded the cusplike surface temperature pattern commonly associated with tropical in-stabilities.

They are prolate, or often subprotate/prolate to spheroidal in shape, and elliptical <b>front</b> <b>equatorial</b> view, circular <b>front</b> polar view, with their germination aperture being all 3 -colporate. Based on {{the presence or absence}} of colpus membrane, two types of pollen grains can be recognized in the species Studied. In type 1, the colpus membrane is visible, and often beset with coarse granules. Four species, F. dibotrys (D. Don) Hara, F. esculentum, Moench, F. tataricum (L.) Gaertn., and F. statice (Levl.) H. Gross, have this type of pollen grains. In type 11, the colpus membrane is invisible. Six species and one variety, F. gracilipes (Hemsl.) Damm. ex Diels, F. leptopodum (Diels) Hedb., F. leptopodum var. grossii (Levl.) Lauener et Ferguson, F. urophyllum (Bur. et Franch.) H. Gross, F. caudatum (Sam). A. J. Li, F. gilesii (Hemsl.) Hedb., and F. lineare (Sam.) Harald., have this type of pollen grains. The exine ornamentation in all the species studied is finely reticulate. The exine is very thick. The sexine is thicker than the nexine. The columellae are high, usually branched, and rounded at top in cross-section. The lectum is semi-tectate. To further study the exine ultrastructure, pollen grains of F. esculentum were examined under transmission electron microscope (TEM). The exine is clearly stratified into ectexine and endexine and the ectexine possesses tectum and columellae, but no foot layer. Adaxial tepal surface of the ten,pes are recognized species and one variety was observed under SEM. Three tepal types based on the shape of epidermal cells and the surface ornamentation. In type 1, the epidermal cells are mostly rectangular to narrowly rectangular, with the anticlinal walls being straight or slightly undulating, and the cuticular layer being longitudinally and undulately striate. This tepal type is found to occur in F. statice and F. urophyllum. In type 11, the epidermal cells are elongated and irregular in shape, and strongly ridged, with the anticlinal walls being deeply or shallowly undulating, and the cuticular layer being irregularly and undulately striate. This tepal type is found to occur in F. caudatum, F. lineare, F. gracilipes and F. gilestii. In type 111, the epidermal cells are irregular in shape, and are papillose, with the anticlinal walls being straight and prominent, and the cuticular layer being densely and longitudinally striate. This type is found to occur in F. dibotrys, F. esculentum, F. tataricum and F. leptopodum. Fruit surface in the ten species and one variety was observed under SEM. Based on the surface ornamentation, the fruits can be divided into three types. In type 1, the fruit surface is striate. This type is found to occur in F. statice, F. caudatum I F. gilesii and F. lineare. In type 11, the fruit surface is warty granular, and sparsely striate among the granules. This type is found to occur in F. gracilipes, F. Leptopodum, F. leptopodum var. grossii and F. urophyllum. In type 111, the fruit surface is rugosely striate or striate-reticulate. This type is found to occur in F. dibotrys, F. esculentum and F. tataricum. Evidence from pollen morphology supports the separation of Fagopyrum from Polygonum as an independent genus. Relationships of the Fagopyrum species studied are discussed based on evidence from pollen morphology, and from tepal and fruit microcharacteristics. Brief speculation on the evolutionary trends of pollen, tepal and fruit microcharacteristics in the genus Fagopyrum is made...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} two-part study of persistent sea surface temperature (SST) fronts based on global satellite observations. Its main {{goal is to}} achieve a better description of these features at the global scale, while reducing the bias in defining them. To this end, an algorithm was developed to detect and track persistent fronts by relying on frontal probabilities. Frontal probability (or frontal frequency) {{can be defined as}} the probability to observe a front relative to the cloud cover. Long-term mean (29 years) and seasonally averaged frequency maps were produced, showing the location of over 2, 000 SST fronts for each map. The algorithm, denoted automated detection algorithm or PFDA, is based on a simple concept, which is the determination of local maxima of frontal probability by scanning the fields along lines of constant latitude and of constant longitude. The ADA agrees well with satellite observations, and performs well in detecting fronts with complex shapes or western boundary currents. This method can be applied to other types of datasets, such as chlorophyll fronts, and presents the crucial advantage to remove subjectivity in finding fronts. Frontal properties, derived from the Cayula-Cornillon algorithm were added to the geographic coordinates of the fronts. Furthermore, the bathymetry and bathymetry gradient magnitude are also part of the information provided by the PFDA at each frontal pixel. Subsequently, we applied multivariate statistical analysis tools to evaluate the presence of patterns among persistent fronts. We performed a principal component analysis, followed by a k-means clustering procedure to partition fronts into different types. Unsupervised machine learning applied to the problem of oceanic fronts resulted in nine clusters, namely four clusters corresponding to shelf and shelf-break fronts, two clusters representing the subpolar frontal system, one matching the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream extensions, and the two last ones grouping the boundary currents and upwelling fronts respectively. The partitioning was conducted based on the characteristics of the fronts, in an objective manner. Be- cause this study was performed globally, we gained significant insights on poorly- documented and newly-found SST fronts, but also on fronts that were previously studied. These results also shifts the traditional way of understanding oceanic fronts. In particular, it is interesting to see coastal and <b>equatorial</b> upwelling <b>fronts</b> in the same cluster, just at it is intriguing to observe western and eastern boundary currents being part of one unique cluster. While this study is mostly focused on the statistical description of persistent SST fronts, its findings will certainly bring a broader understanding of ocean 2 ̆ 7 s submesocale dynamics, and is expected to benefit the Oceanography community in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the ITER ECRH system {{provides}} 20 &#xa 0;MW millimeter wave power for central plasma heating and MHD stabilization. The system consists of an array of 24 gyrotrons with power supplies coupled {{to a set of}} transmission lines guiding the beams to the four upper and the <b>equatorial</b> launcher. The <b>front</b> steering upper launcher design described herein has passed successfully the preliminary design review, and it is presently in the final design stage. The launcher consists of a millimeter wave system and steering mechanism with neutron shielding integrated into an upper port plug with the plasma facing blanket shield module (in-vessel) and a set of ex-vessel waveguides connecting the launcher to the transmission lines. Part of the transmission lines are the ultra-low loss CVD torus diamond windows and a shutter valve, a miter bend section and the feedthroughs integrated in the plug closure plate. These components are connected by corrugated waveguides and form together the first confinement system (FCS). In-vessel, the millimeter-wave system includes a quasi-optical beam propagation system including four mirror sets and a front steering mirror. The millimeter wave system is integrated into a specifically optimized upper port plug providing structural stability to withstand plasma disruption forces and the high heat load from the plasma side with a dedicated blanket shield module. A recent update in the ITER interface definition has resulted in the recession of the upper port plug first wall panels, which is now integrated into the design.

A strong temperature inversion is observed throughout the cruise along 28 N, capping the planetary boundary layer (PBL) that is 1 – 1. 5 km deep. Temperature response to TIW-induced SST changes penetrates the whole depth of the PBL. In response to an SST increase, air temperature rises in the lowest kilometer and shows a strong cooling at the mean inversion height. As a result, this temperature dipole is associated with little TIW signal in the observed sea level pressure (SLP). The cruise mean vertical profiles show a speed maximum at 400 – 500 m for both zonal and meridional velocities. SST-based composite profiles of zonal wind velocity show weakened (intensified) vertical shear within the PBL that is consistent with enhanced (reduced) vertical mixing, causing surface wind to accelerate (decelerate) over warm (cold) SSTs. Taken together, the temperature and wind soundings indicate the dominance of the vertical mixing over the SLP-driving mechanism. Based on the authors’ measurements, a physical interpretation of the widely used PBL model proposed by Lindzen and Nigam is presented...|$|E
40|$|A La Nina {{took place}} in the {{equatorial}} Pacific in 1999, and strong tropical instability waves (TIWs) developed, causing large meanders of a sea surface temperature (SST) front between the equator and 3 # N. High-resolution satellite measurements are used to describe the variability of SST, surface wind velocity, column-integrated water vapor, cloud liquid water and precipitation associated with these strong TIWs in 1999. Coherent ocean-atmosphere patterns emerge in both the Pacific and Atlantic, revealing rich regional characteristics. In the far eastern Pacific, southeasterly trades strengthen (weaken) over positive (negative) SST anomalies, apparently due to enhanced (reduced) mixing with high-speed winds aloft. In the central Pacific, we find evidence that SST-induced sea level pressure changes also contribute substantially to wind fluctuations. Similar SST-wind co-variability also exists in the Southern Hemisphere along 2 # S, but the wind variability induced by unit SST anomaly is much larger than that north of the equator. In the central Pacific where the <b>equatorial</b> <b>front</b> is broad, the northern SST pattern has a large meridional scale and reaches as far north as 6 # N. Further to the north in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) where local SST anomalies are small, significant variability is found in clouds and precipitation, which is further correlated with surface wind convergence. In the Atlantic, TIW signals in SST are strongly trapped near the equator, but they induce significant remote response in the ITCZ, which takes a more southern position than its Pacific counterpart and thus more susceptible to TIW influence...|$|E
40|$|The complex deglacial to Holocene oceanographic {{development}} in the Gulf of Guayaquil (Eastern Equatorial Pacific) is reconstructed for sea surface and subsurface ocean levels from (isotope) geochemical proxies based on marine sediment cores. At sea surface, southern sourced Cold Coastal Water and tropical Equatorial Surface Water/Tropical Surface Water are intimately related. In particular since ~ 10 ka, independent sea surface temperature proxies capturing different seasons emphasize the growing seasonal contrast in the Gulf of Guayaquil, which {{is in contrast to}} ocean areas further offshore. Cold Coastal Water became rapidly present in the Gulf of Guayaquil during the austral winter season in line with the strengthening of the Southeast Trades, while coastal upwelling off Peru gradually intensified and expanded northward in response to a seasonally changing atmospheric circulation pattern affecting the core locations intensively since 4 ka BP. Equatorial Surface Water, instead, was displaced and Tropical Surface Water moved northward together with the <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Front.</b> At subsurface, the presence of Equatorial Under Current-sourced Equatorial Subsurface Water was continuously growing, prominently since ~ 10 - 8 ka B. P. During Heinrich Stadial 1 and large parts of the Bølling/Allerød, and similarly during short Holocene time intervals at ~ 5. 1 - 4 ka B. P. and ~ 1. 5 - 0. 5 ka B. P., the admixture of Equatorial Subsurface Water was reduced in response to both short-term weakening of Equatorial Under Current strength from the northwest and emplacement by tropical Equatorial Surface Water, considerably warming the uppermost ocean layers...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{objectives}} of this dissertation were {{to describe the}} complex oceanographic conditions around the Galápagos Archipelago (eastern equatorial Pacific), their seasonal variability, and their effects on patterns of cetacean occurrence. The physical and ecological factors leading to a plume of high phytoplankton biomass {{in the wake of}} the Galápagos were investigated with principal component and regression analyses of water-column climatologies and satellite-derived ocean color. The results supported the notion that this "island-mass effect" is fueled by upwelling of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) combined with natural iron enrichment from the island platform. Seasonal variability in long-term monthly fields of satellite-derived sea-surface temperature and ocean color was studied through harmonic analysis and empirical orthogonal function decomposition. Two annual cycles were identified in both variables. The intensification of the <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Front</b> and the South Equatorial Current in the second part of the year was the dominant signal in the data. A secondary cycle reaching its peak in the first part of the year was associated with the topographically induced upwelling of the EUC on the western side of the archipelago, and with advection of upwelled Panama Bight water on the eastern side. The occurrence of nine cetacean Species (including seven small and medium-sized delphinids, the sperm whale, and the Bryde's whale) in relation to environmental variability around the archipelago was described. Seasonally persistent sectors of the archipelago characterized by the presence of distinct species assemblages of stratified, upwelling, and nearshore environments were identified through cluster and indicator species analysis. The dominant pattern in species distribution, as extracted by a nonmetric multidimensional scaling procedure, was well correlated with the main environmental gradient (described by the degree of water-column stratification, chlorophyll-a concentration, and distance from the islands). The collective results of this study indicate that the ocean environment surrounding the Galápagos Archipelago is strongly influenced by equatorial flows. However, the archipelago also introduces a disturbance to these flows, creating localized and persistent conditions that favor the establishment of distinct biological communities around the islands...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays reorganizations of {{tropical}} Pacific convection and wind variability {{respond to the}} zonal distribution of sea surface temperatures and {{have a profound effect}} on the Pacific Ocean s upwelling, thermocline depth, productivity, dust fertilization, riverine sediment loads, and continental dryness of the non-convective regions. Though much progress has been made in the understanding of the present dynamical interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, many uncertainties remain concerning tropical reorganizations of convection under different climatic scenarios, such as future global warming and ice ages. The subject of this thesis is to gain deeper insights into the deposition of windblown and fluvially transported terrigenous material in deep-sea sediments of the easternmost tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean and its relationship to the evolution of the eastern tropical Pacific background state and the continental climate of the west coast of South America over Plio-Pleistocene time. Part of this study is based on a set of surface sediment samples of the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific (10 °N - 25 °S, 100 °W - 70 °W) retrieved from water depths between 192 and 4, 622 m. b. s. I, mostly on the Cocos and Carnegie ridges. Down-core analyses were performed on ODP Sites 1239 (drilled approximately 120 km off the coast of Ecuador, close to the eastern crest of Carnegie Ridge at a water depth of 1, 414 m), 1237 (located ~ 140 km off the southern Peruvian coast on the easternmost flank of Nazca Ridge at a water depth of 3, 212 m), 1229 (located on the Lima Basin, Peruvian shelf, at 150 m water depth), and core MD 02 - 2529 (collected off the Costa Rican margin in the Panama Basin at a water depth of 1619 m). In Chapter 4 a set of surface sediment samples was analyzed to define the location of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>front</b> in the Pacific, based on foraminifer s census and stable isotope data. The sample material was obtained by means of multi-corers, box-corers, gravity or piston corers. We propose that the ratio between G. menardii cultrata and N dutertrei abundances (Rc/d) as well as the oxygen isotopic difference between G. ruber and G. tumida (&# 61508;&# 61540; 18 OG. tumida-G. ruber) and between P. oliquiloculata and G. tumida (&# 61508;&# 61540; 18 OG. tumida-P. obliquiloculata) are useful paleoceanographic tools for reconstructing the latitudinal position of the eastern Pacific <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Front</b> in an area delimited by the Cocos and Carnegie ridges. In our core top dataset, high Rc/d values (> 0. 3) as well as high &# 61508;&# 61540; 18 OG. tumida-G. ruber values are related to warm, low salinity TSW north of the EF, whereas cool, nutrient-rich ESW south of the front are characterized by lower Rc/d values and &# 61508;&# 61540; 18 OG. tumida-G. ruber. Although we are currently not able to explain the latitudinal difference between modern EF position and the observed changes in &# 61508;&# 61540; 18 OG. tumida-G. ruber, the application of the &# 61508;&# 61540; 18 OG. tumida-G. ruberto a down-core record located south of the EF indicates nevertheless a potential value of this proxy. Chapter 5 provides a combined analysis of proxy data that allude to paleoceanographic changes in the EEP and concomitant continental paleoclimate variations onshore during the past 500 kyr. The proxy profiles are derived from samples obtained from sediment cores off the coast of Ecuador (ODP Site 1239) and in the Panama Basin (core MD 02 - 2529). We find prominent glacial-interglacial changes of fluvial sediment input that reflects more humid conditions along the Ecuadorian coast during interglacials. A warmer interglacial EEP cold tongue and a southward shift of the EF-ITCZ system likely control these humid interglacial conditions. Conversely, reduced fluvial input during glacials suggests more arid conditions coinciding with larger tropical Pacific SST gradients and a more northward location of the EF-ITCZ system. The glacial-interglacial latitudinal shifts of the EF-ITCZ system suggested by our data may be restricted to the EEP and the coastal area of northwest South America. Glacial cooling is particularly pronounced in the Southeast Pacific, which suggests a possibility that ITCZ migration in the region may be controlled by the northward advection of cold waters with the Humboldt Current system. Over the South American continent, away from the coast, the Andes and Amazon Basin impact atmospheric circulation patterns, allowing larger southward migrations of the ITCZ during glacial periods...|$|E
40|$|Tuna-dolphin-bird feeding assemblages {{are unique}} to the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP). These {{multiple}} species groups are believed to forage together {{in response to the}} physical properties of the near surface ocean as these constrain the distribution of prey. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR), intra-annual and interannual changes affect the properties of the water column, inducing mesoscale and fine scale temporal variability. Four three-week oceanographic surveys took place, in September 2008, April 2009, October 2009, and September 2010, between the coast of Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands and one small boat survey took place in June 2010 within the GMR. Marine mammal surveys were conducted during daylight hours and Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) sensor casts were taken throughout the survey. Data were analyzed to determine the types of water masses present and the strength and depth of the thermocline layer. These data were compared with the sightings of marine mammals, bird feeding groups, and tuna-dolphin-bird assemblages. Additionally, these data were used to predict where tuna would be likely to associate with dolphin groups. Results show Equatorial Surface Water was the dominant water mass throughout the archipelago, regardless of season or ENSO index. High salinity, cold water west of Isla Isabela indicated topographic upwelling of the Equatorial Undercurrent. Tropical Surface Waters from the Panama Current were detected north of the <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Front</b> to the east of the islands. Obvious changes in the water column properties were observed between El Ni?o and La Ni?a events in the GMR. Most mixed groups were sighted west and south of Isla Isabela during the four oceanographic surveys, as well as north and west of Isla San Cristobal in June 2010. Most sightings were in cool, high salinity waters, and high chlorophyll concentrations. There were a greater number of sightings during the April 2009 survey (ENSO-neutral conditions) than during any of the three fall surveys. Additionally, tuna-dolphin-bird groups {{were more likely to be}} seen near Isla Isabela, with the majority of them sighted during the April 2009 survey and a few sighted in each of the September 2008 and October 2009 surveys. No tuna-dolphin-bird groups were sighted during the September 2010 surveys. Results show that the presence and location of these multi-species groups may be controlled by the inter-annual cycles, the intra-annual cycles, or a combination of both types of changes seen within the Galapagos...|$|E
