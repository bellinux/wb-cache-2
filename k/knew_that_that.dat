In 1993, he remarked that [...] "when I left BTL, I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{was the end of}} my scientific career. When I retire from here, in another sense, it's really the end." [...] And so it proved. He became Professor Emeritus in June 1997, and delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before his death from a heart attack on January 7, 1998. He was survived by his wife Wanda.|$|E
500|$|Citroën was {{confident}} the C4 would be successful yet concerned {{as to whether}} it would beat the , which had won the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers title in 2006 for the BP-Ford World Rally Team. The Focus, in addition had undergone its own developments during the winter break. The tarmac testing of the C4 showed it to be faster than the outgoing Xsara, but Loeb <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> performance might not show itself in the race. [...] "The car has been good in testing. But what about the rally?" [...] he asked. [...] "I don't know." [...] Marcus Grönholm, the Ford team's number 1 driver, was wary, however. [...] "It's got thousands of k's on the clock. It was running when the Focus WRC 06 was still on the board." [...] Meanwhile, the Subaru World Rally Team were waiting for the [...] to be ready for the 2007 Rally Mexico in March. The team knew that the 2006 version, which had performed poorly the previous season, would be no match for the Focus or C4. Added {{to the fact that the}} cars were equipped with unfamiliar [...] tyres after Pirelli decided not to supply any teams in 2007, and they were hoping that Petter Solberg and Chris Atkinson could just earn some points from the race.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) Gardner {{states that he}} first heard the term Wica while being {{initiated}} into the New Forest coven in September 1939, stating that [...] "I realised I had stumbled on something interesting; but I was half-initiated before the word Wica which they used hit me like a thunderbolt, and I knew where I was, and that the Old Religion still existed." [...] This account was repeated in his biography, Gerald Gardner: Witch (1960), written by Idries Shah but attributed to Jack L. Bracelin, {{in which he is}} quoted as saying that [...] "it was halfway through when the word Wica was first mentioned; and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> which I had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived." [...] If Gardner's account was accurate and the New Forest coven had really existed, then the fact that Gardner spelled the word as Wica would not necessarily indicate that the coven members had spelled it the same way. As he relates, from Gardner's account, [...] "it seems that he had heard rather than read the word {{in the midst of his}} initiatory rite" [...] and that, [...] "suffering from a poor grasp of spelling, punctuation, and grammar, something caused by the fact that he was self-educated and possibly also influenced by dyslexia", he would have therefore spelled the word phonetically as Wica.|$|E

Because we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he always went flying light in the matter of baggage. When we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we always ask who those parties are. We do this because we humbly wish to learn." ...|$|R

2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, {{who does}} not appear on the {{recording}}, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band, stating: [...] "They did that while I {{was on the road}} touring for my solo record. [...] I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was the ending because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me. That {{was one of the last}} straws for me, because nobody had said anything to me, and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands. It was pretty clear I'm a big Rolling Stones fan, and they recorded the song without me. So I knew that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gilby Clarke's {{contract}} was not renewed {{and he was}} gone from the band by 1995. Slash stated in his book that Rose fired Clarke without consulting anyone, claiming he was only a [...] "hired hand". Clarke was not involved in the recording of 'Sympathy for the Devil', stating [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was the ending [...] because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me". Clarke also mentioned that before the final show of the Use Your Illusion Tour, Rose came up to him and told him [...] "Hey, enjoy your last show". Clarke later sued the band over the use of his likeness in Guns N' Roses Pinball.|$|E
2500|$|The avenues {{from which}} teams {{acquired}} marquée talent started to close and DeWitt, recognizing {{that he needed}} to change his club's approach to stay competitive, went about [...] "abandoning a philosophy of chasing big names" [...] that had netted such stars as McGwire, Edmonds, Kile, Édgar Rentería and Rolen. [...] Said DeWitt, [...] "We had great teams in that era, but I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> wasn’t sustainable because as that group aged, we would need younger players. [...] With the new labor agreement that was coming in, teams were holding on to their players." [...] He added, [...] "we were opportunistic prior to that by getting players from other clubs, but we made a conscious decision back in the ’03 and ’04 time frame {{that we were going to}} throw a lot of resources and make every effort to build from within ... Rather than giving up draft choices, we tried to accumulate draft choices." [...] To avert continual reliance on signing free agents and trading for stars already in their prime, DeWitt sought to place the expertise of people like Jeff Luhnow to create an efficient player development system utilizing the entire organization. [...] DeWitt hired him in 2003 to become the vice president of baseball development. [...] As Luhnow lacked a baseball background, his hire was seen as unconventional, but DeWitt saw potential in the Northwestern graduate with an MBA because of his business background and analytical ability.|$|E
