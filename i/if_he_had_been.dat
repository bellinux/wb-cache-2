5|$|In spring 1243, an {{uprising}} ousted Vladislav; Stefan Uroš I, his third brother, {{was put on}} the throne. Scholars have argued that Bulgarian influence had been strong and unpopular, causing opposition that led to Vladislav's deposition after the death of Asen. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> alive, Asen might have prevented the coup.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell’'s successor, Oliver Bulleid, {{oversaw the}} {{building}} of twenty {{members of the class}} at Eastleigh railway works between January 1938 and September 1939. Bulleid is reported to have found the Q Class uninspiring, having been manufactured to traditional Victorian principles of locomotive design, and is said to have stated that the order for the Q Class would have been cancelled <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> appointed CME earlier. However, Bulleid had ample opportunity either to cancel the order or to build and test a single prototype, without incurring the expense of building twenty members of the class, if this was the case.|$|E

5|$|No-one had {{questioned}} Calvert's conformity at the time, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> secretly Catholic, he {{had hidden}} it well. It seems more likely Calvert converted in late 1624. At the time, Simon Stock, a Discalced Carmelite priest {{reported to the}} Congregation Propaganda Fide in Rome on 15 November that he had converted two Privy Councillors to Catholicism, one of whom historians are certain was Calvert. Calvert, who had probably met Stock at the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on {{a plan for a}} Catholic mission in his new first Newfoundland Colony (off modern Canada).|$|E
5|$|Section 2 {{gives the}} third party various protections {{once they have}} chosen to enforce the act - the parties cannot alter or end the {{contract}} if the third party has told them that he wishes to enforce the contract or relied on the contract (and the promisor knows this or {{could be expected to}} have known this). If the contract is breached, the third party has all the rights that he would have <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a party to the initial contract.|$|E
5|$|According to the Constitution of 1831, the Belgian {{government}} {{was allowed to}} override {{the wishes of the}} King <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> declared incompetent to reign. On 28 May 1940, under pressure from the French government, the Pierlot government in France declared the King to be under the power of the invaders and unfit to reign according to article 82, providing strong legal foundations and making itself the only official source of government. The government, however, refused to declare a republic. Although the King technically remained the only person able to receive diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able to do both during the war independently.|$|E

5|$|Of noble birth, Cuthbert {{is first}} {{recorded}} as the Abbot of Lyminge, {{from where he}} was elevated to the See of Hereford in 736. The identification of the Cuthbert who was Bishop of Hereford with the Cuthbert who became archbishop, however, comes from Florence of Worcester and other post-Conquest sources. The contemporary record in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that Cuthbert was consecrated archbishop, where <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Bishop of Hereford, he would have been translated. No consecration is needed when a bishop is translated from one see to another. Given the nature of the sources, the identification of the bishop of Hereford with the archbishop of Canterbury, while likely, must not be regarded as proven.|$|E
5|$|The journey's beginning, on 9 July 1763, was inauspicious; on {{the first}} day a {{carriage}} wheel broke, requiring a 24-hour pause while repairs were carried out. Leopold turned this delay to advantage by taking Wolfgang to the nearby church at Wasserburg, where according to Leopold the boy played on the organ pedalboard as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> studying it for months. In Munich, on successive evenings, the children played before Elector Maximilian III, earning from these engagements the equivalent of half of Leopold's annual salary of 354 gulden or florins. The next stop was Augsburg, where Leopold's estranged mother refused to attend any of the three concerts given there. The family then moved on to Schwetzingen and the Mannheim court, where the children's performance apparently amazed Elector Palatine Karl Theodor and his Electress.|$|E
5|$|To Brodie, Jefferson’s {{ambiguous}} posturings on slavery {{could be}} explained by his personal life. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> conducting a 28-year affair with a slave, then he could not free his slaves because once they were freed, Virginia law would force them from the state, unless he gained permission from the legislature for them to stay. He could continue his liaison with Hemings only if his slaves remained slaves. Two of the most prominent Jefferson biographers of the twentieth century, Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson, had relied on Jefferson family testimony by two Randolph grandchildren who named his Carr nephews as fathers. They discounted other evidence about this alleged sexual relationship, including by Madison Hemings in 1873, who identified Jefferson as his father. The relationship was first reported in 1802 by the journalist James T. Callender when Jefferson was President, after Callender failed to win an appointment by the president.|$|E

5|$|At St Peter's School, Crawford {{combined}} {{his teaching}} role with supervision of sports, including acting as {{coach for the}} cricket team. On several occasions, he had to request leave from the headmaster to play first-class cricket. After arriving in Australia in December 1909, he was playing district cricket for East Torrens within a week, and played in South Australia's last three matches in the Sheffield Shield competition; the team {{went on to win}} the trophy for the first time since 1893–94. Crawford played a large part in this success. There was some controversy over his eligibility to play; New South Wales initially protested, but there was a precedent for ignoring the requirement of a three-month qualification period, and the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) Executive Committee accepted this in the case of Crawford, to the displeasure of the full NSWCA. Over four seasons, Crawford played 22 matches for South Australia, scoring 1,512 runs at an average of 40.86 and taking 120 wickets at 23.86. Green suggests that such a performance would have earned him Test selection <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Australian, and Wisden noted that his record in Australia was impressive.|$|E
5|$|Before his NBA rookie year, Russell was {{the captain}} of the U.S. {{national}} basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and thus was no longer an amateur, but Russell prevailed. He had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics. He later commented that he would have participated in the high jump <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> snubbed by the basketball team. Under coach Gerald Tucker, Russell helped the national team win the gold medal in Melbourne, defeating the Soviet Union 89–55 in the final game. The United States dominated the tournament, winning by an average of 53.5 points per game. Russell led the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game for the competition. His former USF and future Celtics teammate K. C. Jones joined him on the Olympic squad and contributed 10.9 points per game.|$|E
5|$|The third Confederate brigade in line, under Ambrose Wright, crushed two regiments {{posted on}} the Emmitsburg Road north of the Codori farm, {{captured}} the guns of two batteries, and advanced toward {{a gap in the}} Union line just south of the Copse of Trees. (For a time, the only Union soldiers {{in this part of the}} line were Gen. Meade and some of his staff officers.) Wright's Georgia brigade may have reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge and beyond. Many historians have been skeptical of Wright's claims in his after-action report, which, if correct, would mean he passed the crest of the ridge and got as far as the Widow Leister's house before being struck in the flank and repulsed by Union reinforcements (Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard's Vermont brigade). Others believe his account was plausible because he accurately described the masses of Union troops on the Baltimore Pike that would have been invisible to him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stopped earlier. Furthermore, his conversations with General Lee that evening lend support to his claim. It is possible that Lee derived some false confidence from Wright about the ability of his men to reach Cemetery Ridge the following day in Pickett's Charge.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
