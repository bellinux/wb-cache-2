500|$|Sandra Harding {{says that}} the [...] "moral and {{political}} insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds." [...] Some feminists, such as Ruth Hubbard and Evelyn Fox Keller, criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective. A part of the feminist research agenda is {{the examination of the}} ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions. Physicist Lisa Randall, appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president Lawrence Summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don't have to come up anymore." ...|$|E

500|$|Tali's unmasked {{face and}} its {{potential}} appearance {{have been subject to}} discussion by both critics and fans. Casey Hudson, in an interview, acknowledged depictions of Tali's face as the most common fan art. Jordan Boughman, writing for GamesRadar, highlighted a piece of fan art that he enjoyed and which a BioWare developer had retweeted. Before the face was revealed, IGN's Scott Nichols ran an article about the possibility of revealing the face, concluding that fans did not <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her face but also [...] "the expressions it can make, adding yet another level of emotional depth and complexity to a fan favorite character". GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz listed it as one of the 12 gaming mysteries he wanted solved in 2011, and hoped that it would be something unusual-looking; this sentiment was echoed by fellow GamesRadar writer Tyler Nagata, who felt that the face should be ugly. PC Gamer's Tom Francis also included the face in their list of 15 things he wanted to see in Mass Effect 3.|$|E
500|$|Nash, {{whose father}} {{was born in the}} Tottenham {{district}} of London, is a lifelong Tottenham Hotspur supporter, and has expressed interest in owning a minority stake in the club. [...] "I'd like to be an owner. It's something I could do {{for the rest of my}} life after my little window of popularity dies", he said in an interview with The New York Times. Nash added, [...] "I've been a passionate supporter all my life. My parents are from north London and so it's not like I'm some Yank who wants to make a profit out of football. I don't care about making money. I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Spurs succeed and, if I can help, that's great." [...] However, he said any participation in Spurs would come after his basketball career is over, and he has had only [...] "casual contact" [...] with chairman Daniel Levy and former director of football Damien Comolli. Nash is also a fan of Spain's FC Barcelona, and Brazilian team Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, which his former Suns teammate Leandro Barbosa supports. When Barbosa visited Corinthians in 2007, the club gave him a shirt with Nash's name and jersey number.|$|E

Originally Morrissey was to record the album with producer Jeff Saltzman; however, he could not undertake the project.

During a 15-month period ending in April 2011, Foley logged more than 550 hours talking to victims online.

2500|$|The {{prospective}} partners either date {{each other}} or in stricter communities {{they go to a}} [...] "bashow" [...] or sit in. A typical bashow scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her house to see if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in the living room to speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people. The number of bashows prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many bashows while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes.|$|E
