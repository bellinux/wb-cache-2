5000|$|Fast Close by One (FCbO)can {{be seen as}} an {{extended}} version of Close by One which involves improved canonicity test that significantly reduces the number of formal concepts computed multiple times.

5000|$|According to Bishop Thomas J. Paprocki, [...] "excommunication {{does not}} expel the {{person from the}} Catholic Church, but simply forbids the excommunicated person from {{engaging}} in certain activities..." [...] These activities are listed in Canon 1331 §1, and prohibit the individual from any ministerial participation in celebrating the sacrifice of the Eucharist or any other ceremonies of worship; celebrating or receiving the sacraments; or exercising any ecclesiastical offices, ministries, or functions. If the excommunication is, in the formal legal sense, publicly known - that is, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> a [...] "declared" [...] latae sententia excommunication (judged upon by the responsible Church court) and in any ferendae sententia excommunication (always imposed by the Church court), any acts of ecclesiastical governance by the excommunicated person are not only illicit but also invalid, e.g., a thus excommunicated bishop cannot validly invest a priest as pastor of a vacant parish. However, as the sacramental character itself is unaffected by the excommunication, this {{does not apply to}} acts of sanctification, even if regularly connected with an act of governance such as ordination: an ordination by an excommunicated bishop would be valid but illicit.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{influence}} of temperature, mixing ratio and holding time of NaOH & KOH intercalations on the surface area, micropore volume and micropore width of pre-baked clay samples. Pore size & surface area analyzer was used to measure the surface area, micropore volume and average pore width using Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) method. A meaning full effect was observed when the temperature was increased from ambient up to 150 °C <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> intercalating agents. Increasing temperature beyond 150 °C caused a decline in surface area generation even up to 750 °C. The results also show that mixing ratio has a positive effect on the porosity and the micropore surface area inereases as the mixing ratio inereases <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> intercalating agents. The influence of holding time shows two different trends. In case of NaOH, the porosity inereases as the time inereases while in case of KOH, the porosity decreases as the time inereases. SEM, EDX and XRD studies were also performed. The results show effective insertion of the sodium and potassium into the clay matrix thereby causing generation of porosity...|$|E

40|$|Leaders play a {{noteworthy}} role in edifying high-performing teams {{who have}} great levels {{of job satisfaction}} and organizational dedication. As businesses persistently progress and grow, the responsibility of a leader becomes more challenging and imperative. Effective leadership leads to competitive advantage {{for any kind of}} organization (Lado et al., 1992; Rowe, 2001; Zhu et al., 2005). In fact, a leader is responsible for not only leading but also providing followers with a sense of direction needed to accomplish organizational goals. The present study was conducted to study the leadership behavior of private and public sector bank managers. It attempted to understand managers ’ perception about their own leadership behavior with the perception of subordinates regarding the managers ’ behavior of leadership and its impact on branch performance and job satisfaction. Correlation and regression analysis were used in the empirical study. The findings reflected that the ‘Leader Effectiveness ’ has a high and significant positive co-relation with ‘Branch Performance ’ <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> public as well as private sector banks.
