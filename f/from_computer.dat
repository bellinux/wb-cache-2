5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive {{so it would}} be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo <b>from</b> <b>Computer</b> Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E

At the Source For Sports Shoot Out, visitors take shots using real pucks at a computer simulation of goaltender Ed Belfour. Its counterpart, Lay's Shut Out, has visitors playing goaltender, blocking shots <b>from</b> <b>computer</b> simulations of players Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier.

5|$|Mobile device {{forensics}} is a sub-branch {{of digital}} forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or {{data from a}} mobile device. It differs <b>from</b> <b>Computer</b> forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data. SMS data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba {{in the murder of}} Meredith Kercher.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental {{to our understanding of}} the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and <b>from</b> <b>computer</b> simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E

40|$|Improvements in image {{understanding}} technologies {{are making it}} possible for computers to pass traditional CAPTCHA tests with high probability. This suggests the need for new kinds of tasks that are easy to accomplish for humans but remain difficult for computers. In this paper, we introduce Fluency CAPTCHA (FluTCHA), a novel method to distinguish humans <b>from</b> <b>computers</b> using the fact that humans are better than machines at improving the fluency of sentences. We propose a way to let users work on FluTCHA tests and simultaneously complete useful linguistic tasks. Evaluation studies demonstrate the feasibility of using FluTCHA to distinguish humans <b>from</b> <b>computers...</b>|$|R
25|$|Computer {{simulations}} vary <b>from</b> <b>computer</b> {{programs that}} run a few minutes, to network-based groups of computers running for hours, to ongoing simulations that run for months. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using the traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling: over 10 years ago, a desert-battle simulation, of one force invading another, involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around Kuwait, using multiple supercomputers in the DoD High Performance Computer Modernization Program.|$|E
25|$|E-mail {{was first}} invented for CTSS and similar time sharing {{systems of the}} era in the mid-1960s.

Multics also pioneered instant messaging between computer users in the mid-1970s. With the growth of the Internet, e-mail began to be possible between any two computers with access to the Internet.|$|E
