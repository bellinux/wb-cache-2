Electrical treeing is observed to originate at points where impurities, gas voids, mechanical defects, or conducting projections cause excessive electrical <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> within small regions of the dielectric. This can ionize gases within voids inside the bulk dielectric, creating small electrical discharges between the walls of the void. An impurity or defect may even result in the partial breakdown of the solid dielectric itself. Ultraviolet light and ozone from these partial discharges (PD) then react with the nearby dielectric, decomposing and further degrading its insulating capability. Gases are often liberated as the dielectric degrades, creating new voids and cracks. These defects further weaken the dielectric strength of the material, enhance the electrical stress, and accelerate the PD process.|$|E

The obliquity along plate boundaries is controlled by (i) lateral rheological variations within the lithosphere and (ii) consistency with the global plate circuit. Indeed, plate tectonics and magmatism drive rheological changes within the lithosphere and consequently influence strain localization. Geodynamical evolution controls large-scale mantle convection and plate formation, consumption, and re-organization, thus triggering plate kinematics variations, and the adjustment and re-orientation of far <b>field</b> <b>stresses.</b> These geological processes may thus result in plate boundaries that are not perpendicular but oblique to the direction of far <b>field</b> <b>stresses.</b> This paper reviews the global patterns of obliquity along plate boundaries.

50|$|Rocks {{and other}} {{geological}} materials experience strain according three distinct modes, elastic, plastic, and brittle {{depending on the}} properties of the material and the magnitude of the stress <b>field.</b> <b>Stress</b> is defined as the average force per unit area exerted on each part of the rock. Pressure is the part of stress that changes the volume of a solid; shear stress changes the shape. If there is no shear, the fluid is in hydrostatic equilibrium. Since, over long periods, rocks readily deform under pressure, the Earth is in hydrostatic equilibrium to a good approximation. The pressure on rock depends only on the weight of the rock above, and this depends on gravity and the density of the rock. In a body like the Moon, the density is almost constant, so a pressure profile is readily calculated. In the Earth, the compression of rocks with depth is significant, and an equation of state is needed to calculate changes in density of rock even when it is of uniform composition.|$|E

Insulators are among the important devices of the electric power transmission systems. They are used to support and separate conductors at high voltage. Different insulator shapes have been obtained by varying several parameters, which defines the shape of the post insulator. For each insulator shape, the maximum electric <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> occurring on the insulator surface has been determined under clean and dry environment. The COMSOL Multiphysics software has been employed to investigate the electric <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> along the insulator’s surface. The full detailed model of a dry and clean ceramic 132 kV post insulator with 25 sheds has been developed for the base model calculation. The maximum value of electric <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> was found to be at the junction between the porcelain and the end fitting. End fittings with round edges tend to reduce the electric <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> along the insulator’s surface. With smaller first shed’s outer corner radius, the electric <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> slightly decreases. The electric <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> of the 25 th shed near the top end fitting tends to reduce as the shed’s inclination angle is increased. Furthermore, as the shed’s diameter increases, the electric <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> increases except at the shed’s outer corner where the electric <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> decreases. With greater distance between the first shed and the bottom end fitting, the electric <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> becomes lower.

If the electric <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> is high enough, water drop corona is occurring between water drops forming on the hydrophobic surface.

Onset background fields for water drop corona are lower for tangential <b>field</b> <b>stress</b> than for perpendicular <b>field</b> <b>stress.</b> In both cases the field is locally intensified by the droplets.
