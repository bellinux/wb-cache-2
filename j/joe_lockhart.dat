5000|$|Some {{critics of}} CBS and Dan Rather argued that by {{proceeding}} {{with the story}} when the documents had not been authenticated, CBS was exhibiting liberal bias and attempting to influence {{the outcome of the}} 2004 U.S. Presidential Election.

50|$|After {{the report}} was aired, it was {{immediately}} the subject of harsh criticism, especially when a key document could not be authenticated. As {{a result of the}} controversy over the use of the documents, CBS ordered an independent internal investigation. The panel in charge of investigation was composed of Dick Thornburgh, former governor of Pennsylvania and United States Attorney General, and Louis Boccardi, retired president and CEO of the Associated Press. The Thornburgh-Boccardi report said that some of Bush's former instructors or colleagues had told Mapes that Bush told them {{he wanted to go to}} Vietnam, but that he could not go because there were others ahead of him with more seniority. Mapes was criticized for failing to air them in the 60 Minutes report to balance the allegation that Bush had applied for service in the Guard to avoid serving in Vietnam. Mapes was also faulted for calling <b>Joe</b> <b>Lockhart,</b> a senior official in the John Kerry campaign, prior to the airing of the piece, and offering to put her source, Bill Burkett, in touch with him. However, Mapes stated that Burkett had asked her to give his phone number to someone in the Kerry camp to discuss the Swift Boat campaign, for which she had asked permission. She has said, in retrospect, she would not have done it. Lockhart and Burkett also stated that the conversation had nothing to do with CBS's report or the documents, but to do with the Swift Boat campaign.|$|E
