500|$|The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines general {{aviation}} (GA) as [...] "an aircraft operation {{other than a}} commercial air transport operation or an aerial work operation." [...] It defines commercial air transport (CAT) as [...] "an aircraft operation involving the transport of passengers, cargo or mail <b>for</b> <b>remuneration</b> or hire", and aerial work as [...] "an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, construction, photography, surveying, observation and patrol, search and rescue, aerial advertisement, etc." ...|$|E
500|$|Organisations in the United Kingdom (UK) {{describe}} GA in {{less restrictive}} terms that include elements of commercial aviation. The British Business and General Aviation Association interprets {{it to be}} [...] "all aeroplane and helicopter flying except that performed by the major airlines and the Armed Services". The General Aviation Awareness Council applies the description [...] "all Civil Aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non-scheduled air transport operations <b>for</b> <b>remuneration</b> or hire". For the purposes of a strategic review of GA in the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) defined the scope of GA as [...] "a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule", and considered it necessary to depart from the ICAO definition and include aerial work and minor CAT operations.|$|E

500|$|Many of Strom's policy {{initiatives}} revolved around education and youth. [...] He created the Alberta Service Corps, which allowed young Albertans to work summers on public services and environmental projects <b>for</b> <b>remuneration,</b> {{and which was}} one of several models for the federal government's later Katimavik program. [...] In response to increasing use of illicit drugs by Alberta youth, his government, led by Education Minister Bob Clark, inserted anti-narcotics messages into the province's school curriculum. [...] Strom implemented trial kindergarten programs in Edmonton and Calgary—the Calgary program, provided jointly by an inner-city community association and the Mount Royal College, has been called one of Canada's first public-private partnerships. [...] His interest in educational matters was perhaps best exemplified by his government's Commission on Educational Planning, which travelled the province to solicit Albertans' views and whose final report, A Choice of Futures, was credited by Barr as setting [...] "the tone and direction for education in Alberta for the next generation". [...] The Strom government also made substantial reforms to Alberta's post-secondary education system, expanding distance learning through the creation of Athabasca University and laying the foundation's for ACCESS television, and effectively creating the province's College (as distinct from University) system. [...] This latter move {{led to the creation of}} Grant MacEwan College.|$|E

2500|$|The PV Act (2013) {{came into}} force {{retrospectively}} on 1April 2012. [...] The tariff cuts {{were up to}} 30%, with the tariff cuts scheduled in the EEG (2012) for 1July 2012 advanced and tightened from their original 15%. [...] The system size categories were changed, now up to 10, 40, 1000, and kWp. [...] A new category of 10–40kWp was introduced, while free-standing systems were limited to 10MWp. [...] The regular standard degression was set to 1% per month, equal to 11.4% per year, and replacing the previous six-monthly adjustment. [...] The flexible cap for the deployment corridor remained unchanged at 2500 to 3500MWp per year. [...] If new additions exceed this corridor, the degression rises by 1.0% up to 2.8%. [...] A hard cap on the total photovoltaic capacity was introduced, set at 52GWp. [...] The self-consumption privilege was removed for new installations, as grid parity was already met: the feed-in tariff for roof systems at 19.5¢/kWh was now lower than the average electricity price for households at 23¢/kWh. [...] Changes to the market integration model reduced the eligibility <b>for</b> <b>remuneration</b> of systems between 10 and 1000kWp to 90% of their electricity production from 2014 onwards. [...] The residual electricity could either be self-consumed or sold on the electricity market.|$|E

6000|$|This {{letter was}} {{addressed}} to Nicholas Broune, Esq., {{the editor of the}} 'Morning Breakfast Table,' a daily newspaper of high character; and, as it was the longest, so was it considered {{to be the most important}} of the three. Mr Broune was a man powerful in his profession,--and he was fond of ladies. Lady Carbury in her letter had called herself an old woman, but she was satisfied to do so by a conviction that no one else regarded her in that light. Her age shall be no secret to the reader, though to her most intimate friends, even to Mr Broune, it had never been divulged. She was forty-three, but carried her years so well, and had received such gifts from nature, that it was impossible to deny that she was still a beautiful woman. And she used her beauty not only to increase her influence,--as is natural to women who are well-favoured,--but also with a well-considered calculation that she could obtain material assistance in the procuring of bread and cheese, which was very necessary to Her, by a prudent adaptation to her purposes of the good things with which providence had endowed her. She did not fall in love, she did not wilfully flirt, she did not commit herself; but she smiled and whispered, and made confidences, and looked out of her own eyes into men's eyes as though there might be some mysterious bond between her and them--if only mysterious circumstances would permit it. But the end of all was to induce some one to do something which would cause a publisher to give her good payment for indifferent writing, or an editor to be lenient when, upon the merits of the case, he should have been severe. Among all her literary friends, Mr Broune was the one in whom she most trusted; and Mr Broune was fond of handsome women. It may be as well to give a short record of a scene which had taken place between Lady Carbury and her friend about a month before the writing of this letter which has been produced. She had wanted him to take a series of papers for the 'Morning Breakfast Table,' and to have them paid for at rate No. 1, whereas she suspected that he was rather doubtful as to their merit, and knew that, without special favour, she could not hope <b>for</b> <b>remuneration</b> above rate No. 2, or possibly even No. 3. So she had looked into his eyes, and had left her soft, plump hand for a moment in his. A man in such circumstances is so often awkward, not knowing with any accuracy when to do one thing and when another! Mr Broune, in a moment of enthusiasm, had put his arm round Lady Carbury's waist and had kissed her. To say that Lady Carbury was angry, as most women would be angry if so treated, would be to give an unjust idea of her character. It was a little accident which really carried with it no injury, unless it should be the injury of leading to a rupture between herself and a valuable ally. No feeling of delicacy was shocked. What did it matter? No unpardonable insult had been offered; no harm had been done, if only the dear susceptible old donkey could be made at once to understand that that wasn't the way to go on! ...|$|E
