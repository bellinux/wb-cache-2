40|$|Purpose. The work is {{intended}} to investigate the electromagnetic processes in <b>impedance</b> <b>bond</b> {{in order to improve}} noise immunity of track circuits (TC) for safe railway operation. Methodology. To achieve this purpose the methods of scientific analysis, mathematical modelling, experimental study, a large-scale simulation were used. Findings. The work examined the interference affecting the normal performance of track circuits. To a large extent, part of track circuit damages account for failures in track circuit equipment. Track circuit equipment is connected directly to the track line susceptible to traction current interference, which causes changes in its electrical characteristics and electromagnetic properties. Normal operability, performance of the main operating modes of the track circuit is determined by previous calculation of its performance and compilation of regulatory tables. The classical method for determination of track circuit parameters was analysed. The classical calculation method assumes representation of individual sections of the electrical track circuit using the quadripole network with known coefficients, usually in the A-form. Determining the coefficients of linear element circuit creates no metrological or mathematical difficulties. However, in circuits containing nonlinear ferromagnets (FM), obtaining the coefficients on the entire induction change range in the cores is quite a difficult task because the classical methods of idling (I) and short circuit (SC) are not acceptable. This leads to complicated methods for determining both the module and the arguments of quadripole network coefficients. Instead of the classical method, the work proposed the method for calculating the track circuit dependent on nonlinear properties of ferromagnets. Originality. The article examines a new approach to the calculation of TC taking into account the losses in ferromagnets (FM), without determination of equivalent circuit quadripole network coefficients. When building the FM reversal model in parallel magnetic fields, the most accurate methods are the approximation ones that take into account not only the changes in values and over time, but also their derivatives. The development of computer hardware and software makes real the mathematical methods for calculating TC with significant change in ferromagnetic inductance, including the saturation areas. Herewith, it is important to search for approximating analytical expression that describes the dynamic limit hysteresis loop (HL). Practical value. The changes in the electrical parameters of the same TC were analysed using the classical and the new calculation methods, the difference made less than 10 %. The work introduced some measures to increase operational noise immunity of TC...|$|E

Originality. The proposed method for calculating the propagation of potentials and currents in the rail network of DC traction line is characterized by the representation of the common ladder circuit of each rail as a series of T-shaped four-poles connected in cascade, taking into account the grounding of the contact-line supports on the nearer rail. It has allowed estimating the levels of asymmetry currents that branch into the equipment of track circuits and have a negative impact on their operation. Practicalvalue.

On AC railway system, because of long distance, 40 [km] or above, between two railway substations, a fault location technique is very important.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringThe {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop an algorithm (based on mathematical function menus) to improve the {{signal to noise ratio}} between constituents of similar acoustic <b>impedance</b> in <b>bonded</b> out-of-autoclave carbon fiber reinforced polymer assemblies. In particular, peel ply, a release fabric that may be trapped between the adhesive and the substrate during the manufacturing process. The assemblies consist of a pre-cured resin infused out-of-autoclave 3 D woven fabric preform bonded to a pre-cured out-of-autoclave prepreg fabric substrate. Conventional ultrasonic nondestructive testing techniques and analysis software cannot consistently achieve signal to noise ratios that meet quantifiable rejection thresholds of accurately sized peel ply inserts at the bonded interface (i. e. bondline) of the aforementioned assemblies. To demonstrate the approach, ultrasonic pulse echo with full waveform capture was used to inspect a reference standard (i. e. representation of configuration and complexity of the part to be inspected) with peel ply inserts (sized according to minimum detectable requirements) placed between the film adhesive and the 3 D woven fabric preform. The ultrasonic signal was produced by a 64 element array transducer with a central frequency of 2. 8 Megahertz, utilizing a customary shoe and water bubbler. Waveform post-acquisition analysis with post processing software was used to analyze and enhance the signal response between the peel ply and the bondline resulting in the final algorithm. To verify the results, the signal to noise ratio of each insert was calculated for both the raw and processed data. As the measure of detectability, the method relies on principles of statistical measurement to provide an industry standard of 3 : 1 as the signal to noise response...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an ultrasonic wire-bond quality monitoring technique which involves {{the detection of}} changes in the mechanical <b>impedance</b> of the <b>bond</b> zone during bond formation by monitoring the changes in the ultrasonic vibrations of an ultrasonic wire-bonding transducer system. A lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramic having properties similar to the commercial PZT- 5 A has been selected as the sensor material. A PZT piezoelectric sensor is installed on an appropriate location on the transducer in order to measure the ultrasonic amplitude and bonding time during the bonding process. This sensor has dimensions 1 mm × 1 mm × 0. 245 mm to avoid excessive loading on the transducer and to obtain a flat frequency response. A bond quality monitoring system has been developed to process and record the non-linear signal detected by the sensor. More significant changes are observed at the higher-frequency harmonics (second harmonic) of the ultrasonic signal. Good correlation is found between the change in the second harmonic and the bond quality. Bonding process drift towards unacceptable bond quality can be identified. This technique will be used to develop a multiparameter-based automatic process-control system for wire bonding. Department of Applied Physic...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHydrogenated barium {{titanate}} films (a-BaTiO 3 :H) were grown by rf magnetron sputtering under hydrogen containing atmospheres. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared analyses {{were carried out}} {{in order to get}} insight on composition and chemical <b>bonds.</b> <b>Impedance</b> spectroscopy was used to investigate the dielectric behavior at low-temperature range. The strong O-H stretch band (at around 3500 cm− 1) evidenced in the infrared spectrum clearly manifests the presence of protons in the hydrogenated material. The incorporation of protons during the deposition of a-BaTiO 3 :H films hugely modifies their electrical properties. These films exhibit large capacitance that is hundred times higher than the one measured when the film is grown without hydrogen. On the other hand, the presence of positively charged protons can contribute to the conduction process by introducing two main features. The first is related to a significant migration of proton between adjacent oxygen sites with an activation energy of 0. 37 eV. This behavior might be responsible for the high protonic conductivity depicted in our material at temperature higher than − 30 °C. Furthermore, protons were shown to engender hydrogen bonds in the structure. As a result, the dielectric relaxation observed at temperature below − 30 °C could be ascribed to the dissociation of the hydrogen bonds. Activation energy for this process is around 0. 26 eV...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper basically explores and compares the different modeling and analysis techniques and than it also explores the model order reduction approach and significance. The traditional {{modeling and simulation}} techniques for dynamic systems are generally adequate for single-domain systems only, but the Bond Graph technique provides new strategies for reliable solutions of multi-domain system. They are also used for analyzing linear and non linear dynamic production system, artificial intelligence, image processing, robotics and industrial automation. This paper describes a unique technique of generating the Genetic design from the tree structured transfer function obtained from Bond Graph. This research work combines bond graphs for model representation with Genetic programming for exploring different ideas on design space tree structured transfer function result from replacing typical bond graph element with their impedance equivalent specifying <b>impedance</b> lows for <b>Bond</b> Graph multiport. This tree structured form thus obtained from Bond Graph is applied for generating the Genetic Tree. Application studies will identify key issues and importance for advancing this approach towards becoming on effective and efficient design tool for synthesizing design for Electrical system. In the first phase, the system is modeled using Bond Graph technique. Its system response and transfer function with conventional and Bond Graph method is analyzed and then a approach towards model order reduction is observed. The suggested algorithm and other known modern model order reduction techniques are applied to a 11 th order high pass filter [1], with different approach. The model order reduction technique developed in this paper has least reduction errors and secondly the final model retains structural information. The system response and the stability analysis of the system transfer function taken by conventional and by Bond Graph method is compared and analyzed.

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of stress and}} induced damage in concrete on the electro-mechanical (EM) <b>impedance</b> response of <b>bonded</b> PZT patches is evaluated for applied compressive loading. Full field displacements obtained from digital image correlation are {{used to evaluate the}} level of stress-induced damage in concrete. Stress in the substrate produces an imposed strain on the PZT. A change in the imposed strain produces a rightward frequency shift and an increase in the amplitude of the resonant peak in the EM conductance spectrum of the PZT. An increase in the substrate compliance produces a decrease in the resonant frequency and an increase in the amplitude of the resonant peak. Changes in the resonant peak in the conductance spectrum induced by increasing substrate stress are of a significant magnitude when compared with the changes induced by damage. In the early stages of damage associated with distributed microcracking, the counteracting influences of increasing level of damage and increasing stress on the resonant peak result in no shift in frequency for measurements under applied load. There is however an increase in the amplitude of the resonance peak. When the applied stress is removed, there is a net decrease in frequency resulting from damage in the form of distributed microcracks. Measures of changes in the resonant peak based on root mean square deviation (RMSD), do not show any observable change when measurements are performed under applied loading. There is a consistent increase in RMSD values and frequency shift with increasing damage when the applied stress is removed. The centroidal measure of the normalized frequency spectrum reflects changes in substrate stress. At higher applied stress levels, there is a nonlinear increase in damage, leading to localization and cracking. The {{influence of}} damage is dominant in this region and significant changes are obtained in the RMSD values in both loaded and unloaded conditions...|$|R
40|$|Port-based {{modeling}} of dynamic systems is {{the topic of}} the first chapter of the book that {{will be one of the}} main results of the European project ‘Geometric Network Modeling and Control of Complex Physical Systems’ (GEOPLEX, IST- 2001 - 34166, Key Action, Action line KAIV: Essential Technologies and Infrastructures, Action Line IV. 4. 2. 1). In this chapter the reader is introduced to the concepts needed for port-based modeling, design and reasoning in order to prepare and motivate for the geometrical formulations of the port-based approach in the remainder of the book. After some general remarks about the modeling process, this is done from a historic perspective, which immediately relates the port concept to its original notation, the bond graph. Bond graph notation is discussed as well as the concept of causality, which allows one to combine physical and computational structure into one notation and provides important feedback on modeling decisions in the tradeoff between conceptual and computational complexity. Several simple examples of its use are presented and the details of many bond graph related transformations and analysis techniques are discussed in a series of appendices: conversion of an IPM into a bond graph, conversion of causal bond graphs into block diagrams, generation of a set of mixed algebraic and differential equations, direct linear analysis, <b>impedance</b> analysis using <b>bond</b> graphs, nonlinear mechanical systems (mechanisms), homogeneous functions and Euler’s theorem, homogeneous energy functions, Legendre transformations, co-energy functions, relations for co-energy functions, Legendre transforms in simple thermodynamics, Legendre transforms and causality, Maxwell reciprocity of constitutive relations. As it is impossible to fit all this material in this short contribution, two examples of the content are given that are more or less self-supporting/independent, viz. the Glossary, which provides a kind of bird’s eye view of the material, and the first Appendix that discusses basic model transformations. However, first the most important basis for the work on port-Hamiltonian systems, viz. the generalization of the bond graph representation into generalized bond graphs, is discussed shortly first. ...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion bonding is an {{attractive}} solid-state welding technique that promises weight reduction and improved performance in the aerospace industry. However, its adoption in fracture critical titanium components has been limited by the complications that macroscopic anisotropy introduces to typical ultrasonic NDE. Two strands of ultrasonic NDE, linear and non-linear acoustics, have been studied {{with the aim of}} overcoming these complications. A promising linear technique that uses the phase of reflected diffusion-bond signals to extract otherwise hidden interface information was selected for further development. The principal parameters that affect the phase analysis of ultrasonic signals were investigated and their optimisation resulted in up to an order of magnitude improvement in phase measurement reliability, even at low signal-to-noise ratios. The application of these optimised parameters without a priori knowledge of the signal arrival time was illustrated, and the sensitivity of the approach to ambient temperature and annealing effects was also explored. The original technique was susceptible to measurement error and proved impractical for typical aerospace component geometries, but these shortcomings have been overcome by the improvements and adaptations proposed here. However, it was shown that the efficacy of the technique depends on the relative acoustic <b>impedances</b> of the <b>bonded</b> media and, coupled with the sensitivity limit intrinsic to linear acoustic methods, this dependence acted to curtail the benefits of the approach and prompted the exploration of alternative techniques. Non-linear ultrasonic methods are significantly more sensitive than their linear counterparts to the imperfections likely to be present at diffusion-bonded interfaces, but suppressing extraneous contributions to the non-linear response of the interface is not trivial. An approach that succeeds in suppressing such contributions was studied and developed here. The technique, which is based on the non-collinear mixing of ultrasonic waves to generate a spectrally, modally and spatially dissociable third wave, was used to reliably characterise a set of samples whose bond quality was indeterminable using linear ultrasonic methods. Application of the technique to diffusion-bonded titanium aerospace components has been demonstrated and a significant improvement in ultrasonic NDE capability was achieved. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Ever growing {{demands for}} {{portability}} and functionality have always governed the electronic technology innovations. IC downscaling with Moore s law at IC level and system miniaturization with System-On-Package (SOP) paradigm at system level, have resulted {{and will continue}} to result in ultraminiaturized systems with unprecedented functionality at reduced cost. However, system miniaturization poses several electrical and thermal challenges that demand innovative solutions including advanced materials, bonding and assembly techniques. Heterogeneous material and device integration for thermal structures and IC assembly are limited by the bonding technology and the electrical and thermal <b>impedance</b> of the <b>bonding</b> interfaces. Solder - based bonding technology that is prevalent today is a major limitation to future systems. The trend towards miniaturized systems is expected to drive downscaling of IC I/O pad pitches from 40 µm to 1 - 5 µm in future. Solder technology imposes several pitch, processability and cost restrictions at such fine pitches. Furthermore, according to International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS- 2006), the supply current in high performance microprocessors is expected to increase to 220 A by 2012. At such supply current, the current density will exceed the maximum allowable current density of solders. The intrinsic delay and electromigration in solders are other daunting issues that become critical at nanometer sized technology nodes. In addition, formation of intermetallics is also a bottleneck that poses significant mechanical issues. Similarly, thermal power dissipation is growing to unprecedented high with a projected power of 198 W by 2008 (ITRS 2006). Present thermal interfaces are not adequate for such high heat dissipation. Recently, copper based thin film bonding has become a promising approach to address the abovementioned challenges. However, copper-copper direct bonding without using solders has not been studied thoroughly. Typically, bonding is carried out at 400 oC for 30 min followed by annealing for 30 min. High thermal budget in such process makes it less attractive for integrated systems because of the associated process incompatibilities. Hence, {{there is a need to}} develop a novel low temperature copper to copper bonding process. In the present study, nanomaterials - based copper-to-copper bonding is explored and developed as an alternative to solder-based bonding. To demonstrate fine pitch bonding, the patterning of these nanoparticles is crucial. Therefore, two novel self-patterning techniques based on: 1.) Selective wetting and 2.) Selective nanoparticle deposition, are developed to address this challenge. Nanoparticle active layer facilitates diffusion and, thus, a reliable bond can be achieved using less thermal budget. Quantitative characterization of the bonding revealed good metallurgical bonding with very high bond strength. This has been confirmed by several morphological and structural characterizations. A 30 -micron pitch IC assembly test vehicle is used to demonstrate fine pitch patternability and bonding. In conclusion, novel nanoparticle synthesis and patterning techniques were developed and demonstrated for low-impedance and low-cost electrical and thermal interfaces. M. S. Committee Chair: Rao R.
