40|$|We {{studied the}} acute antiproteinuric and renal hemodynamic effect of {{dipyridamole}} 30 – 60 mg intravenously in 13 salt-depleted {{patients with the}} nephrotic syndrome of different etiology. Whereas mean arterial pressure did not change, a small <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> glomerular filtration rate with a concomitant <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> filtration fraction {{and a decrease in}} urinary protein loss occurred. The <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> filtration fraction was positively correlated with the <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> proteinuria. This suggests that the antiproteinuric effect of dipyridamole is at least partly due to an efferent vasodilation with a <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> intraglomerular capillary pressure...|$|R
