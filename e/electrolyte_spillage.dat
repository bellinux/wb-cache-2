5000|$|FMVSS No. 305: Electric-powered vehicles: <b>Electrolyte</b> <b>spillage</b> and {{electrical}} shock protection ...|$|E
50|$|Cruickshank solved {{this problem}} by laying the battery on its side in a {{rectangular}} box. The inside of this box was lined with shellac for insulation, and pairs of welded-together zinc and copper plates were laid out in this box, evenly spaced. The spaces between the plates (the troughs) were filled with dilute sulfuric acid. So long as the box was not knocked about, there was no risk of <b>electrolyte</b> <b>spillage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A modern {{gel battery}} (also {{known as a}} [...] "gel cell") is a VRLA battery with a gelified electrolyte; the sulfuric acid is mixed with fumed silica, which makes the {{resulting}} mass gel-like and immobile. Unlike a flooded wet-cell lead-acid battery, these batteries {{do not need to}} be kept upright. Gel batteries reduce the <b>electrolyte</b> evaporation, <b>spillage</b> (and subsequent corrosion problems) common to the wet-cell battery, and boast greater resistance to shock and vibration. Chemically they are almost the same as wet (non-sealed) batteries except that the antimony in the lead plates is replaced by calcium, and gas recombination can take place.|$|R
