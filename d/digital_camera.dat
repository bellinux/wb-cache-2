5|$|Among Denmark's most {{successful}} contemporary photographers are Jacob Aue Sobol, who gained recognition for captivating portraits of his Greenlandic girlfriend, and Per Bak Jensen, who {{introduced a new}} perspective to modern landscape photography. Press photography has prospered too under award-winning contributors such as Jan Grarup and Claus Bjørn Larsen, who have covered wars and conflicts of global importance over the past 20 years. Photography is an interesting hobby {{for most of the}} people in the world. In 1944, I took a photo of a car from my <b>digital</b> <b>camera</b> and yesterday, I found that photo. Travelling back in time, photography wasn’t as simple as ‘smile and click’ as we see today. Back in 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! Technology is great, isn’t it? The first every <b>digital</b> <b>camera</b> to be created was in December 1975. It was developed by an engineer in Kodak Company and took 23 seconds to create first photograph. The camera only recorded black and white photographs of 0.1 mega pixels. The camera weighed 8 pounds.|$|E
5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of methods to {{approach}} missions. For instance, players can utilize stealth to evade enemies and complete objectives without being noticed, or they also have the option to assault enemies with firearms and vehicles. The player-character is equipped with a <b>digital</b> <b>camera,</b> which allows him to mark and highlight all visible enemies, animals, and loots. Players are also able to ride on elephants, which serve as tank-like offensive weapons. Players can throw bait towards enemies, which attracts nearby wildlife that is hostile to both the player and enemies. Players can also hunt and skin animals.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The use of <b>digital</b> video <b>cameras</b> and <b>digital</b> still <b>cameras</b> is {{becoming}} widespread. <b>Digital</b> video <b>cameras</b> differ from <b>digital</b> still <b>cameras</b> {{in a number}} of respects. <b>Digital</b> video <b>cameras</b> capture approximately thirty frames per second and are optimized to capture a large amount of moving images, but sacrifice image quality. Still <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> are less expensive because they have far less processing power and memory capacity than <b>digital</b> video <b>cameras.</b> Even with these limitations, some still <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> are also capable of capturing sequential images, such as a burst image. Accordingly, what is needed is a method and system for interactively creating a VIDEO from one or more still images...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Dakota Digital, a number of similar single-use <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> have appeared. Most single-use <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> are nearly identical to the original Dakota Digital in specifications and function, though a few include superior specifications and more advanced functions (such as higher image resolutions and LCD screens). Most, if not all these single-use <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> cost less than $20 (USD), not including processing. However, the huge demand for complex <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> at competitive prices has often caused manufacturing shortcuts, evidenced by a large increase in customer complaints over camera malfunctions, high parts prices, and short service life. Some <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> offer only a 90-day warranty.|$|R
50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>cameras</b> {{become widely}} {{popular due to}} rapid {{decreases}} in size and cost while photo resolution steadily increases. As a result, the <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> largely supplanted the analog cameras and the integration into mobile phones increase greatly. Since 2007, <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> started being manufactured with the face recognition feature built in.|$|R
5|$|The first Guardian {{video was}} shot on a <b>digital</b> <b>camera</b> by an {{investment}} fund manager from New York {{who was in}} London on business, and who attended the protests out of curiosity. On his way to Heathrow airport, {{he realized that the}} man he had filmed being assaulted was the man who had reportedly died of a heart attack. At that point, 2 am on 7 April, he passed his footage to The Guardian, which published it on its website that afternoon. The newspaper passed a copy to the IPCC, which opened a criminal inquiry.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one <b>digital</b> <b>camera.</b> The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed to come in the next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E
5|$|An eighth {{installment}} was planned, but {{the decrease}} in the box office performance for Saw VI compared to previous installments led to Saw 3D being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for Saw VIII being incorporated into Saw 3D. Saw V director David Hackl was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming Lionsgate announced that Greutert, who directed the sixth film, would direct. Principal photography took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D <b>digital</b> <b>camera</b> system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in post-production.|$|E

5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly {{over the years and}} residents didn't want the murder to be re-created in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution <b>digital</b> <b>camera,</b> allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E
5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition <b>digital</b> <b>camera</b> captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E
5|$|Superman Returns {{was shot}} using Panavision's Genesis <b>digital</b> <b>camera.</b> Production {{designer}} Guy Hendrix Dyas {{was influenced by}} Frank Lloyd Wright's Johnson Wax Headquarters {{for the design of}} the Daily Planet. ESC Entertainment was originally set to design the visual effects sequences, but Warner Bros. replaced them with the hiring of Mark Stetson from Sony Pictures Imageworks as the visual effects supervisor. A total of 1,400 visual effects shots were created. The script required a scene of Superman safely delivering a Boeing 777 in a baseball park where computer-generated imagery was used as it would have been impossible to assemble the number of extras for the shots. A second unit crew traveled to Dodger Stadium to photograph elements that were composited into the final images. The scenes of Metropolis was actually {{a modified version of the}} skyline of Manhattan. Using footage from the original Superman (1978) film as a reference point, Marlon Brando was re-created by Rhythm & Hues using CGI. The opening credits for Superman Returns are presented in an intended recreation of the style used for Superman, again to the accompaniment of John Williams's theme music.|$|E

5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or <b>digital</b> <b>camera)</b> is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E
25|$|The <b>digital</b> <b>camera</b> is {{a camera}} that takes video or still photographs, {{digitally}} by recording images via an electronic image sensor. Steven Sasson {{as an engineer}} at Eastman Kodak invented and built the first <b>digital</b> <b>camera</b> using a CCD image sensor in 1975.|$|E

40|$|Consumer grade <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> {{are widely}} used for close range photogrammetric {{applications}} because of the convenience of digital images and the low cost of capture and reproduction. Since the introduction of <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> in the 1980 s, {{there has been a}} strong divide between relatively inexpensive, low resolution, compact <b>digital</b> <b>cameras,</b> and relatively expensive, high resolution, professional <b>digital</b> <b>cameras.</b> In recent years, the improved affordability of SLR (Single Lens Reflex) style <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> has increased the use of this class of camera, to some degree displacing professional <b>cameras.</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>cameras</b> are quite often bundled with a consumer grade zoom lens that is designed for the quality of the image, rather than the geometric stability of the calibration. When these cameras are used for photogrammetric applications, it is common practice that a high quality, fixed focal length lens is purchased and used in preference to the zoom lens. Calibration tests were conducted on a range of different <b>digital</b> <b>cameras,</b> all within the SLR class, to ascertain the differences between zoom and fixed lenses when used with these cameras. Analyses are presented that indicate {{the differences between the two}} lens types in terms of accuracy, precision and stability and suggest that although acceptable results can be obtained using zoom lenses, a fixed lens provides superior results. 1...|$|R
