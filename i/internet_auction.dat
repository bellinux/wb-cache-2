25|$|With this in mind, {{mindful of}} the {{mounting}} issues in Hartford and growing opposition to the deal, {{in the spring of}} 1999, Kraft announced that he was abandoning the Hartford stadium project. Kraft, preferring to keep the team where it was, eventually reached a mutually acceptable deal with the Massachusetts legislature for the necessary infrastructure improvements. The final hurdle the stadium needed to clear was approval by the citizens of Foxborough on six separate measures. Despite some initial hesitation regarding a proposed dedicated access road for premium ticket holders, the Patriots won approval on each measure by an over 90% majority. This cleared the way for what was originally known as CMGi Field to be built adjacent to the old stadium in Foxboro. The naming rights to the stadium were originally purchased by CMGi, an e-commerce company based in nearby Waltham, Massachusetts, which, at the time, was parent company to <b>internet</b> <b>auction</b> site uBid.|$|E

" The popularity of <b>Internet</b> <b>auctions,</b> such as eBay, has made timing issues in auctions particularly salient. Traditional auction houses, such as Christie's, require bidders or their representatives to assemble at a specific place and time, and therefore auctions must be conducted fairly quickly (often lasting less than an hour). In contrast, <b>Internet</b> <b>auctions</b> allow geographically dispersed bidders to participate, making it possible to conduct auctions that last many days. One disadvantage of long <b>Internet</b> <b>auctions</b> is that they may impose high monitoring costs on the bidders, affecting the strategy of the bidders and the revenues of the auctioneer...|$|R

2500|$|The Virgin Mary {{accounts}} for {{a substantial number of}} sightings of this type. A typical example is the [...] "Clearwater Virgin", where an image of Mary was reported to have appeared in the glass façade of a finance building in Clearwater, Florida, and attracted widespread media attention. The building drew an estimated one million visitors {{over the next several years}} and was purchased by an Ohio Catholic revivalism group. A local chemist examined the windows and suggested the stain was produced by water deposits combined with weathering, yielding a chemical reaction like that often seen on old bottles, perhaps due to the action of the water sprinkler. On March 1, 2004, the three uppermost panes of the window were broken by a vandal. Other examples of Marian apparitions of this type that have received substantial press coverage include a fence in Coogee, Australia in 2003; a hospital in Milton, Massachusetts in June 2003; and a felled tree in Passaic, New Jersey in 2003. Images of the Virgin have also been reported on a rock in Ghana, an underpass in Chicago, a lump of firewood in Janesville, Wisconsin; a chocolate factory in Fountain Valley, California; and a pizza pan in Houston, Texas. A grilled cheese sandwich, a pretzel and a pebble said to resemble images of the Virgin Mary have been offered for sale on <b>internet</b> <b>auction</b> sites, the former being purchased by Internet casino GoldenPalace.com, which is known for its publicity stunts.|$|E

That explains why Stefan's murder was as horrific as it was. If these games influence kids to go out and kill, then we do not want them in the shops."
