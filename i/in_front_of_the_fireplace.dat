25|$|What is {{consistent}} {{in the stories}} of Lowe are accounts of his insatiable appetite for learning. He could not read enough material, and he had questions beyond the answering of his father or teachers. Lowe was also limited {{in the amount of}} time he had for school. His farm chores only allowed him the three winter months to attend Common School at Jefferson Mills, two miles away. The school had no books, but like Abraham Lincoln Thad would spend his evenings <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> reading books loaned from his teacher’s personal library.|$|E
25|$|Floo powder can be {{used with}} any {{fireplace}} connected to the Floo Network. To transport from one to another, the fire at the point of departure must first be lit. The traveler throws a handful of Floo powder into the flames, turning them emerald green, then steps into the fireplace and states the intended destination in a clear and purposeful voice. Floo powder can also be used for communication; a wizard or witch can kneel <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> and stick their head into the fire, which will then appear in the fire of the destination fireplace, leaving the witch or wizard free to talk. It is also known that other body parts may be transported via Floo Powder, as Umbridge almost catches Sirius the second time he converses with Harry through the Floo network. Voices can also be transmitted through the Floo Network, as seen in the Prisoner of Azkaban by Snape, who summons Lupin through his office's fireplace while interrogating Harry about the Marauder's Map.|$|E
2500|$|On June 12, 1806, Hanks married Thomas Lincoln at {{the home}} of Richard Berry in Beechland by Reverend Jesse Head. Nancy was brought to the home to work as a {{seamstress}} by her friend Polly Ewing Berry, the wife of Richard Berry Jr. since October 10, 1794. Polly was a friend of Nancy's from Mercer County, Kentucky and Richard Berry, Jr. was a good friend of Thomas Lincoln.

60|$|He got up, and, {{wrapping}} his dressing-gown {{about his}} long legs, {{took up a}} stand <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> From this position he surveyed the room, his shoulders against the mantelpiece, his calves pressing the club fender. It was a cheerful oasis in a chill and foggy world, a typical London bachelor's breakfast-room. The walls were a restful grey, and the table, set for two, a comfortable arrangement in white and silver.|$|E

60|$|Dr. Horace Wilkinson {{followed}} Sir John up the broad, thick-carpeted staircase, {{and into}} the darkened sick room. In {{a quarter of an}} hour he had sounded and sifted the case to the uttermost, and descended with the husband once more to the drawing-room. <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> were standing two gentlemen, the one a very typical, clean-shaven, general practitioner, the other a striking-looking man of middle age, with pale blue eyes and a long red beard.|$|E
60|$|The {{rooms to}} which the butler {{conducted}} me consisted of a sitting-room with an adjoining bedroom, both of them fitted with antique wainscoting against which a faded tapestry fluttered. There was a candle burning {{on the table in}} the sitting-room, but its insufficient light only rendered the surroundings the more dismal. Horrod bent down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> and endeavoured to light a fire there. But the wood was evidently damp and the fire flickered feebly on the hearth.|$|E

50|$|Until 1950 {{it was a}} {{practice}} to swear <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord after following a set of rituals.

Then he would be required to ring 2 pramana bells near the main entrance, stand <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garbha gudi, light 6 lamps, swear <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord and blow out the lamps and repeat these 2 more times.|$|R

60|$|I {{followed}} her into the drawing-room. The blinds were partly drawn to darken the room, and Mrs. Strickland was sitting {{with her back to the}} light. Her brother-in-law, Colonel MacAndrew, stood <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> warming his back at an unlit fire. To myself my entrance seemed excessively awkward. I imagined that my arrival had taken them by surprise, and Mrs. Strickland had let me come in only because she had forgotten to put me off. I fancied that the Colonel resented the interruption.|$|E
60|$|He {{closed the}} door behind them, and the other door into the darkened dining room. He even took a precautionary glance out of the window of the porch. And these movements, which ordinarily might have aroused her curiosity, if not her alarm, she watched with a {{profound}} indifference. He took a stand before the Japanese screen <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> thrust his hands in his pockets, cleared his throat, and surveyed her from her white shoulders to the gold-embroidered tips of her slippers.|$|E
60|$|Mr Verloc, {{against his}} usual practice, had thrown off his overcoat. It {{was lying on}} the sofa. His hat, which he must also have thrown off, rested {{overturned}} under the edge of the sofa. He had dragged a chair <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> and his feet planted inside the fender, his head held between his hands, he was hanging low over the glowing grate. His teeth rattled with an ungovernable violence, causing his whole enormous back to tremble at the same rate. Mrs Verloc was startled.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Durrant knew him; and {{therefore}} blushed slightly, and said, awkwardly, {{something about being}} sure--looking at Mr. Plumer and hitching the right leg of his trouser as he spoke. Mr. Plumer got up and stood <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> Mrs. Plumer laughed like a straightforward friendly fellow. In short, anything more horrible than the scene, the setting, the prospect, even the May garden being afflicted with chill sterility and a cloud choosing that moment to cross the sun, cannot be imagined. There was the garden, of course. Every one {{at the same moment}} looked at it. Owing to the cloud, the leaves ruffled grey, and the sparrows--there were two sparrows.|$|E
60|$|It {{was even}} as the {{daughter}} had said, a room in which literature and the odor of fragrant cigars alone suggested a modern epoch. The decorations, if such they could be called, were all Indian. Rare tribe blankets covered the floor and couches, serving not only for portières, but {{in parts of the}} room for wall hangings. Against these blankets were displayed an unrivaled collection of rich old baskets. Upon one wall was stretched a gorgeous Indian genealogy, the handiwork of a gifted squaw, while the skin of a mammoth grizzly, the huge head still intact, reposed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> From chimney shelf to ceiling hung weapons and finery pertaining to the aboriginal chase.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the first}} {{suggestion}} that anything untoward had happened. I took no notice, and {{did my best to}} engage Mrs. Strickland in talk. The Colonel, still standing <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> uttered no word. I wondered how soon I could decently take my leave, and I asked myself why on earth Mrs. Strickland had allowed me to come. There were no flowers, and various knick-knacks, put away during the summer, had not been replaced; there was something cheerless and stiff about the room which had always seemed so friendly; it gave you an odd feeling, as though someone were lying dead {{on the other side of}} the wall. I finished tea.|$|E
