50|$|A crystal {{dendrite}} is {{a crystal}} that develops with a typical multi-branching tree-like form. <b>Dendritic</b> <b>crystal</b> growth {{is very common}} and illustrated by snowflake formation and frost patterns on a window. Dendritic crystallization forms a natural fractal pattern. Dendritic crystals can grow into a supercooled pure liquid or form from growth instabilities that occur when the growth rate {{is limited by the}} rate of diffusion of solute atoms to the interface. In the latter case, there must be a concentration gradient from the supersaturated value in the solution to the concentration in equilibrium with the crystal at the surface. Any protuberance that develops is accompanied by a steeper concentration gradients at its tip. This increases the diffusion rate to the tip. In opposition to this is the action of the surface tension tending to flatten the protuberance and setting up a flux of solute atoms from the protuberance out to the sides. However, overall, the protuberance becomes amplified. This process occurs again and again until a dendrite is produced.|$|E

This is a gray contour map of the phase value ranging from φ = 0 (solid phase, black) to φ = 1 (liquid phase, white). The transition layer between the solid and liquid is too thin to distinguish in this map, meaning that the solid-liquid interface is very sharp. At the beginning, there is a tiny seed crystal on the right hand side at the droplet surface (panel (a)). At 0.02 s after seeding, a <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystal</b> grows from the seed crystal (panel (b)). The temperature distribution is shown by isothermal lines in terms of T − TM. Crystal growth is accompanied by release of the latent heat of crystallization, so the temperature around the <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystal</b> increases up to almost the melting point. On the other hand, the supercooling far from the <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystal</b> is still large, resulting in a steep temperature gradient ahead of the growing dendrite tips. The <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystal</b> is spreading into the entire region inside the droplet (panel (c)). Around 0.06 s after seeding, the rapid <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystal</b> growth {{comes to a stop}} because the temperature inside the droplet increases to the melting point (panel (d)). It is found that a liquid phase still remains at the gap between dendrite tips. Finally, the remaining liquid solidifies completely as the latent heat of crystallization is removed by the surface cooling. It took 0.42 s to solidify completely. The luminosity of the droplet increases rapidly from panel (a) to (d), and then decreases gradually (Miura et al., 2010).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} a high {{magnetic}} field on the precipitation behaviour of the primary Al 3 Zr phase are investigated. With and without the field, the primary Al 3 Zr crystals possess three morphologies - small tabular crystals in the deposit layer, long bars and <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystals.</b> The <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystals</b> are probably those surviving from the initial material. The tabular crystals in the deposit layer are those surviving from the heating stage, whereas the long bars are those formed during cooling. With the field, the tabular crystals in the deposit layer and the long bars tend to orient with the direction parallel to the field direction, but {{the orientation of the}} <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystals</b> is less affected. The orientation of the crystals in the deposit layer arises from their magnetocrystalline anisotropy, but that of the long bars and <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystals</b> is disturbed by gravity and the formation of compound twins, respectively. Increased Zr content raises the precipitation amount of the primary Al 3 Zr crystals but weakens the alignment tendency of the tabular ones in the deposit layer.

30|$|At {{the first}} stage, the <b>dendritic</b> AgCl <b>crystal</b> {{structures}} are composed when the reagent concentration is very high.

Besides, AgCl crystals have preferential overgrowth along < 111 > and then < 110 > direction based on the previous work [2]. Hence for AgCl crystal, when the reactants’ concentration are below a certain value, the [111] face would finally disappear and leave [110] face presented, thus forming cubic-faceted crystals; however, if the concentration were above the critical value, crystals would grow along [111] face, therefore forming <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystals.</b> This {{is the reason that}} dendritic structures {{are more likely to be}} generated during the early period while cubic structures are preferred in the subsequent period.

At the beginning, {{one can see}} {{concentric}} isothermal lines of T 0 − TM = − 250 K and − 200 K (panel (a)), meaning {{that there is a}} large temperature difference between the center and surface of the droplet. The temperature difference calculated by Eq. (4) is δTc−s, 0 = 125 K, so the temperature at the droplet center (T 0 − TM = − 175 K) is 175 K below the melting point. At 0.008 s after seeding, a <b>dendritic</b> <b>crystal</b> grows from a seed crystal as well, as shown in Fig. 2 (b) (panel (b)).
