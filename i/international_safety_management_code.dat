40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implementation}} of the <b>International</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Management</b> (ISM) <b>Code</b> in the Chinese chemical shipping industry. In particular, it examines the tension between management focus on speedy production and seafarers’ participation in safety related decision making and analyses how this tension is managed. It shows that while on paper companies have policies stating safety commitment in compliance with the ISM Code, in practice shore management tends to prioritise efficient production. When Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and ship’s sailing schedules are in conflict, managers implicitly request shipmasters to prioritise the ‘core interest’ of the company. Although the ISM Code endows shipmasters with overriding authorities in relation to shipboard <b>safety</b> <b>management,</b> they tend to read between the lines and tacitly follow managers’ intentions. The study suggests that if the ISM implementation makes a difference, it is the practice that managers become more subtle in giving orders to exert their dominance. The study further reveals that the management’s practice is not only irresponsive to seafarers’ safety concerns but also makes rather limited contributions to promote OHS Management...|$|R

Work on this model continues the development of an earlier model which applied risk assessment methodologies from the nuclear power industry to quantify the impact of human error on the probability of tanker grounding. This approach is extended to consider the effect of management and organizational factors on human performance shaping factors, and ultimately on human error. This effect is examined and quantified using expert opinion and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP).

The purpose of the ISM Code is to provide an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. Recognizing that no two shipping companies are the same, and that ships operate under {{a wide range of}} different conditions, the code is based on general principles and objectives allowing the shipping companies to develop their own methods of achieving the set goals. The ISM Code is based on management systems principles and the shipping companies are required to perform internal audits to verify compliance with the <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> system. Compliance with the ISM Code is subject to audits carried out by flag state administrations and organizations, such as classification societies, who are authorised to perform audits on their behalf. This purpose of this thesis is to identify areas where the ISM audit procedure can be improved and suggest potential improvements. The methods used are literature studies, audit participating and primarily meetings with key persons, professionals working with ISM audits both at auditing and audited organizations. The investigation resulted in the identification of several areas where the audit procedure can be improved including auditor uniformity, supporting documentation, audit preparations, usage of drills and audit reporting quality. The quality of some of the master´s and management reviews could and should be improved. Several potential improvements are identified. More auditor uniformity could be achieved with a computerized audit tool, improved experience exchange seminars and increased use of two auditors. More thorough preparations should be beneficial for the effectiveness of the audits. Feedback to auditors could identify areas where more training of the auditors is needed and highlight auditor differences that might need measures...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of the <b>International</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Management</b> (ISM) <b>Code</b> on the <b>management</b> of {{occupational}} health and safety in the global maritime industry. The Code - which introduced regulated self-regulation to the industry in 1998 - is seen as a major instrument to safeguard seafarers from workplace hazards and a mechanism to counter the consequence of economic globalisation on the regulation in the maritime industry. However, its effectiveness has been widely debated. A case study approach is used in this study to examine the operation of the Code in two shipping organisations involving ethnographic fieldwork onboard ships and at company offices using semi-structured interview, observation and documentary analysis as the research techniques. The study specifically looked into the factors that influenced the perceptions of the managers and seafarers on the operation of three central elements of the ISM Code: risk assessment, incident reporting and audit and review. My findings showed significant differences in the experiences of operation of the Code of the managers and seafarers in the organisations studied and revealed that although the two organisations implemented the ISM Code in theory there was a considerable gap between its purpose and what it achieved in practice. Significantly it indicated that seafarers' fear of job security, low-trust work environment and lack of organisational support were some of the main impeding factors for seafarers' participation in the management of occupational health and safety. Further analysis revealed that the organisational context and the employment relations affecting seafarers, as well as their social relations onboard ships and between the managers and seafarers in the companies studied were not conducive to a participatory style of management of occupational health and safety. The thesis argues that to be effective self-regulation of occupational health and <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> - such as envisaged by the ISM Code - requires a participatory approach. However, the thesis demonstrates that the preconditions that {{have been shown to be}} necessary to achieve this in land-based workplaces are much reduced or absent from the maritime situation which undermines the potential for the effective operation of the ISM Code...|$|R

The thesis has been written during the spring {{semester}} of 2016. Safety is a large part of maritime operations and all tools to improve safety and reliability is considered. Even in these days when economy in the oil related industry is worse than ever. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) ensures that all suppliers and contractors are obliged to follow rules and regulations in order to ensure a safe workplace for all members the industry and protection of the environment all over the globe. One of those regulations is the International Code for Safe Operations of Ships and Pollution Prevention (<b>International</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Management</b> (ISM) <b>Code)</b> paragraph 10. 3 : “The company should identify equipment and technical systems the sudden operational failure of which may result in hazardous situations. The SMS should provide for specific measures aimed at promoting the reliability of such equipment or systems. These measures should include the regular testing of stand-by arrangements and equipment or technical systems that are not in continuous use. “ The subject of the thesis is “Analysis of potential critical equipment and technical systems on a modern PSV- Recommending a method for Troms Offshore Management AS”. The thesis will look at several methods that may be used to comply with the ISM Code 10. 3. These methods is tested on an equipment or technical system that is used on a vessel in the Troms Offshore fleet, whereas those tests was presented to two expert panels in order to obtain information on how these methods are interpreted and found usable in practice.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{shipping}} {{industry is}} {{in a way}} the first global industry. It is the link between nations and continents. The establishment of international co-operation and conventions has therefore a long history in the shipping industry. The public, as well as others who use shipping services have the right to expect that the ship they board or which carries their cargo is safe and {{within the context of the}} voyage, seaworthy and otherwise fit for the purpose. Seafarers too have the right to expect that their ship is safe and they will not be exposed to danger or unacceptably high levels of risk. There are many stakeholders in marine transportation safety. The industry is highly regulated with prescriptive requirements to ensure well-designed and constructed ships. Many operational procedures and training or certification requirements have been researched and mandated to ensure safe operations. It has always been recognised that the best way of improving safety at sea is by developing international regulations that are followed by all shipping nations and from the mid 19 th century onwards a number of such treaties were adopted. In 1948 United Nations established the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The first task was to adopt a new version of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the most important of all treaties dealing with maritime safety. This was achieved in 1960 and IMO then turned its attention to such matters as facilitation of maritime traffic, load lines, and the carriage of dangerous goods. But although safety was and remains IMO's most important responsibility, a new problem was emerging - pollution. Pollution prevention was part of IMO's original mandate but in the late 1960 ´s a number of tanker accidents resulted in further action being taken. As an example, recent changes to the convention will make it necessary for all new tankers to be fitted with double-hulls or a design that provides equivalent cargo protection in the event of a collision or grounding. These changes are also applied to existing tankers when they reach 25 years of age. For certain maritime segments, the <b>International</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Management</b> (ISM) <b>Code</b> has just come into force. For others it will enter into force soon and further insure quality of operations. State agencies i. e. Maritime Directorates, mariners, pilots, those involved with maritime control or advisement systems, as ISSUE 1 2000 VOL 42 well as operating companies, classification societies, and many others have interests in developing a practical system that contributes to better working environment and safer operations. The shipping industry has shown that free market forces can provide efficient cheap transport and it does this through a complex web of contracts and agreements. However, as ships increase in size, cargoes become more complex and ferries run even faster, the risk of disruption following an incident become correspondingly greater. QC 2011070...|$|R

However, many studies around the world show that incidents and near misses are reported poorly in the shipping industry.

The aim is to analyze reporting systems in order to find best practices for near miss reporting and to improve utilization of reporting in shipping...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} focuses {{attention on}} safety challenges within the Norwegian shipping industry. A status {{picture of the}} shipboard safety culture and the interrelationships with <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> and organizational factors is given. Three research questions are explored: (1) What characterizes safety culture and <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> within the shipping industry? (2) What {{is the relationship between}} safety culture and safety performance within the shipping industry? (3) What characterizes shipping companies’ application of the <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> concept? In order to explore these research questions, four aims were defined to guide this work: (1) to outline and discuss the application of safety culture and <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> within merchant shipping; (2) to outline and discuss relevant theories of safety culture and <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> and analyze the relationship between safety culture and safety management; (3) to support the use of a methodological framework for the assessment of safety culture in relation to safety management; and (4) to assess safety culture within merchant shipping and analyze the relationship with <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> and actual performance. The research questions are further examined and specified in six journal articles. The thesis is divided into two main parts. Part I includes the overall framework in relation to research aims. Part II presents the six journal articles. In part I, chapter 1, a general introduction and a status picture of risk, <b>safety</b> <b>management,</b> and <b>safety</b> culture within the shipping industry are presented, which gives reason for the research aims and questions introduced in the chapter. Chapter 2 outlines the safety responsibilities within the industry at the international, national, and company levels. Emphasis is placed on the vi <b>International</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Management</b> (ISM) <b>Code,</b> which provides the minimum standards and guidelines for operational <b>safety</b> <b>management.</b> Chapter 3 provides theoretical clarification and framing with regard to safety culture and <b>safety</b> <b>management.</b> This chapter also introduces a general working model used in the studies of safety culture and <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> in this thesis. Chapter 4 presents the methodological approach. The thesis builds upon a mixed method approach where both qualitative and quantitative techniques are used. The main results are briefly summarized in Chapter 5, followed by a discussion in Chapter 6 and concluding remarks in Chapter 7. The concluding remarks concern study limitations, implications, and suggestions for future research. The thesis draws upon theory from both the socio-anthropological and organizational psychological directions. In accordance with the organizational psychological perspective, a survey was carried out. A safety culture questionnaire developed by Studio Apertura, a constituent centre of The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), in collaboration with the Norwegian DNV and the research institution SINTEF was used. In total, 1, 574 questionnaires were distributed to 83 tanker and bulk/dry cargo carriers, with 1, 262 being returned from 76 of the vessels. The vessels were initially randomly selected from the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association member list, but as participation was voluntary, some withdrawal occurred. Statistical analysis involves descriptive statistics, factor analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling. The statistical survey results were complemented by qualitative data obtained through document studies, case studies including two tanker companies and two bulk/dry cargo companies, vii interviews, participating observations and field studies at sea, and participation in other maritime forums. The study results indicate several deficiencies in all parts of a traditional <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> system defined as: (1) the reporting and collection of experience data from the vessel; (2) data processing, summarizing, and analysis; (3) the development of safety measures; and (4) implementation. The underreporting of experience data is found to be a problem, resulting in limitations related to the data-processing process. Regarding the development of safety measures, it is found that the industry emphasizes the development of standardized safety measures in the form of procedures and checklists. Organizational root causes related to company policies (e. g., crewing policy) is to a lesser degree identified and addressed. The most prominently identified organizational influential factors are the shipping companies crewing policy, which includes rotation systems, crew stability, and contract conditions, and shipboard management. The companies’ orientation toward local management, which includes leadership training, educational, and other managerial support, are also essential. The shore part of the organization is identified as the driving force for development and change in the shipboard safety culture. Thus, safety campaigns should to a larger degree include and be directed toward shore personnel...|$|R

The shore part of the organization is identified as the driving force for development and change in the shipboard safety culture. Thus, safety campaigns should to a larger degree include and be directed toward shore personnel...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC, 2006), {{which will}} {{enter into force}} in 2012 or 2013, focuses on seafarers’ rights, safety and health {{in order to promote}} a better {{shipping}} environment. A Declaration of Maritime Labour Compliance Part II (DMLC II) is required to state the measures taken to ensure the quality of seafarers’ living and working conditions on-board a ship. It is a challenge for ship owners to establish such a document and fit it into the existing safety management systems, <b>International</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Code</b> (ISM). This paper proposes four possible documentation models of the ship owners’ management system to cover the DMLC II with pros and cons. An appropriate documentation model not only benefits owners with regard to enforcement of the MLC, 2006, but also helps the flag and port state administrations to perform effective and efficient inspections...|$|E
40|$|Human {{errors are}} {{considered}} {{the most important reason}} for maritime accidents. The <b>international</b> <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> <b>code</b> (the ISM Code) has been established to clarify the responsibilities of safety on vessels and to cut down the occurrence of human errors by creating a safety-oriented organizational culture for the maritime industry. The ISM Code came into operation in worldwide shipping in 1998. The {{purpose of this study is}} to recognize whether the safety culture has improved due to the ISM Code and evaluate the impacts of the ISM Code on maritime safety in Finland. The ISM Code provides the indicators for recognizing whether the safety culture exists in the maritime industry. These indicators are: • an established and actively working process of continuous improvement • commitment from the top management of the company • motivated and encouraged personnel onboard to actively initiate safety improvements (personnel empowerment) The research project consists of literature study and in-depth interviews which wer...|$|E
40|$|Maritime Safety {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} issues dealt with by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). With the aim at improving maritime safety and pollution prevention, in 1994 SOLAS 1974 was amended and Chapter IX entitled "Management for the Safe Operation of Ships" was added, giving in this way existence to the <b>International</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Code.</b> This amendment took place through the tacit acceptance procedure implemented by IMO, thus it has a mandatory character for SOLAS Contracting States. The Code was established to have effect in two stages, the first stage took place on July 1 1998, and the second stage will take place on July 1 2002. The ISM Code establishes requirements, which, although not completely new to the maritime industry, will have great incidence in the way maritime activities are carried out to date. Shipping Companies will suffer alterations on their management structure and certain principles in maritime law will probably be changed with the introduction of the Code, however, the precise effects of the ISM Code cannot be outlined before its full implementation takes place in 2002...|$|E
