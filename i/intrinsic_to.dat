5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits <b>intrinsic</b> <b>to</b> the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|Speciation {{requires}} {{a degree of}} reproductive isolation—that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is <b>intrinsic</b> <b>to</b> {{the concept of a}} species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution of reproductive isolation, a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in allopatric speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. E. B. Poulton realized in 1903 that reproductive isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create reproductive isolation, leading to the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{defends the}} view that <b>intrinsic</b> benefit <b>to</b> a human being {{consists}} exclusively in survival. It takes as its point of departure the neo-Aristotelian view that inquiry into <b>intrinsic</b> benefit <b>to</b> a human being should take place within a wider theory of <b>intrinsic</b> benefit <b>to</b> living things, generally. The paper first argues that the neo-Aristotelian view that <b>intrinsic</b> benefit <b>to</b> a living thing consists in flourishing {{as a member of}} its species, is mistaken. Rather, <b>intrinsic</b> benefit <b>to</b> a living thing consists in survival, and not survival as a member of its species, but survival simpliciter. A refined understanding of survival is developed in the paper. The paper then applies this Survivalist account of <b>intrinsic</b> benefit <b>to</b> human beings: The things we take to be good for human beings—e. g., pleasure, desire-fulfillment, etc. —are good to the extent and because they promote the one intrinsic benefit of survival...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature and}} {{operation}} of <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> learn was examined in the present research. <b>Intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> learn was defined as an enduring personality disposition that differentiates out of general intrinsic motivation as an individual develops. In its operation <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> learn was hypothesized to be characterized by the factors of affect, competence, curiosity, persistence, and self-determination. ^ Two studies were conducted with college students to examine {{the nature of the}} relationship between <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> learn and individual differences in subjective experiences during cognitive tasks. In Study 1, subjects studied a favorite subject and in Study 2, subjects were required to solve problems. In both studies subjective experiences were examined in terms of self-reported affect. Motivational indices, persistence, performance indices, and intelligence also were examined. It was found in both Study 1 and Study 2 that people at higher levels of <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> learn experienced more positive affect than people at lower levels of <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> learn. People at higher levels of <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> learn also experienced less negative affect while studying a favorite subject than people at lower levels of <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> learn. In Study 1, additional group differences were found on persistence and on all motivational indices except perceptions of ability and task difficulty. In Study 2, group differences were found in persistence and one of the motivational indices: Level of interest in the task. Significant group differences were also found on total SAT scores and verbal SAT scores. ^ The results of the present research indicate that there are differences in the subjective experiences of people at different levels of <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> learn during their interaction with cognitive tasks. However, some of these differences are contingent upon the nature of the task. It is suggested that the results of the current research provide some support for the validity of the present conceptualization of <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> learn. ...|$|R
5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is <b>intrinsic</b> <b>to</b> americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E

40|$|Motivation {{has long}} been {{associated}} with sports engagement. However, to date no research has been performed to understand the domain of motivation among ten-pin bowlers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate different types of motivation (i. e., intrinsic vs. extrinsic) based on self-determination theory from the perspective of gender and the bowler type (competitive vs. casual). A total of 240 bowlers (104 male, 136 female; 152 competitive, 88 casual) with a mean age of 16. 61 ± 0. 78 years were recruited in Kuala Lumpur. The Sport Motivation Scale, a 28 -item self-report questionnaire measuring seven subscales (i. e., <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> know, <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> accomplish, <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> experience stimulation, extrinsic motivation to identify regulation, extrinsic motivation for introjection regulation, extrinsic motivation to external regulation, and amotivation) was administered. Results showed significant differences (t= 10. 43, df= 239, p= 0. 01) between total scores of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation among tenpin bowlers. There were significant gender differences with respect <b>to</b> <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> know, <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> accomplish, <b>intrinsic</b> motivation <b>to</b> experience stimulation, and extrinsic motivation to identify regulation. However, no significant bowler type differences were found for either the intrinsic (t=- 1. 15, df= 238, p= 0. 25) or extrinsic (t=- 0. 51, df= 238, p= 0. 61) motivation dimensions. In conclusion, our study demonstrated substantial intrinsic motivation for gender effects, but no bowler type effects among adolescent ten-pin bowlers...|$|R
