50|$|On Saturday 1 June 1974 at 16:53 Flixborough was at {{the centre}} of the UK's worst {{industrial}} accident when the Nypro Works chemical plant was devastated by an explosion, known as the Flixborough disaster. The plant manufactured Caprolactam. Escaping cyclohexane formed a <b>flammable</b> <b>vapour</b> cloud and ignited.

50|$|A spark {{is created}} by {{striking}} metal against a flint, or by pressing a button that compresses a piezoelectric crystal (piezo ignition), generating an electric arc.

It virtually demolished the site. Since the accident took place at a weekend there were relatively few people on site: of those on-site at the time, 28 were killed and 36 injured.

50|$|On {{the day of}} the explosion, {{operations}} appeared normal {{until after}} the steam was turned off and the polymer initiating solution was pumped into the reactor. The operator in charge noted that initially the reaction did not proceed as vigorously as expected, but later the solvent evaporated and the condensed solvent flow returning to the reactor appeared within normal range. A few minutes later, the operator heard a loud hissing and saw vapor venting from the reactor manway. The irritating vapor forced him out of the building. Three other employees also left the building because of the vapors. The operator reentered the building wearing a respirator and started emergency cooling water flow to the reactor. The building exploded less than 30 seconds after he exited the second time. The US Chemical Safety Board (CSB) stated that the solvent vapor leaked from the overheated and over-pressurised process reactor, forming a <b>flammable</b> <b>vapour</b> cloud inside the building that ignited.|$|E

40|$|Looking at the German and Dutch statistics, the {{percentage}} of dust explosions in all industries dealing with explosible dust-air mixtures which have been ignited by electrostatic discharges is about 8 - 10 %. However, in the plastics industry this value is much higher: 25 %. In particular {{in the last few}} years some rather large industrial incidents probably have been caused by electrostatic charges. To understand why accidents may happen due to static electricity the several dangerous electrostatic discharges will be discussed briefly in connection with dust explosion hazards. In particular the propagating brush discharge and the cone or " Maurer " discharge are important. Ignitions are caused mainly in the case of easily ignitable powders or hybrid mixtures (powders in combination with <b>flammable</b> <b>vapours)</b> due to isolated conductors and non-conducting materials as the product itself or such process parts as flexible hoses, internally coated silos and ducts.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a methodology {{for the assessment}} of hazards due to the formation of flammable mixtures in edible oil refineries, with particular focus on storage tanks. Safety issues in these plants are due to the presence of residual volatile flammable solvents deriving from the extraction processes, which may accumulate in the storage tanks and generate <b>flammable</b> <b>vapour</b> mixtures. The methodology, based on the application of a thermodynamic model for the estimation of vapour phase composition in oil storage tanks as a function of operating conditions (i. e. temperature and residual solvent content), allows the identification of potential hazards due to formation of flammable mixtures inside the tanks. The model was first validated using available experimental data and then extended to case-studies representative of state-of-the-art industrial storage applications. The results of the case-studies were then used to calculate specific hazard indexes, providing a quick tool for preliminary assessment of hazards due to the formation of flammable mixtures in edible oil storage plants.

Existing empirical methods are used to calculate the overpressures generated by a BLEVE and the heat radiated by a fire ball and a jet fire.

40|$|Evaporating liquid cascades {{resulting}} from gasoline and {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) tanks overfilling or rupture of elevated pipes create a source of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapour</b> cloud. Such phenomena {{were responsible for the}} formation of the large fuel vapour cloud, the ignition of which resulted in the large scale explosion, in Buncefield [1] on 11 December 2005 at the Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal, an oil storage facility located by Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, England. Despite its significance, there lacks adequate models treating the underlying physics of this phenomenon. The present study numerically analyses fuel cascades which are considered as a droplet-laden system. Consideration is given to vapour production inside the cascade due to droplets evaporation and breakup. The solver used here is a modification of the sprayFoam solver which is present in the open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) toolbox OpenFOAM® [2]. The fuel droplets evaporate during their motion and create a cloud of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapour.</b> In order to capture the characteristics of the hazardous phenomena, the CFD model needs to address the underlying physics with adequate sub-models. In the present study, the multi-phase flow is simulated with a combined Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The governing equations of the gas phase represent the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy including the source terms arising from the interaction with the droplets. The Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation approach was used for its computational efficiency. The Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) would be more robust in handling the interaction of the droplets with the flow but it would be require more computational resource. The particulate phase is simulated through a Lagrangian deterministic or stochastic tracking models to provide particle trajectories and particle concentration. Particular emphasis is given to the effect of impingement of droplets to account for the effect of splashing in the impact region. The study involves developing robust and accurate modelling approaches for the instabilities and aerodynamic breakup in the cascade which contribute to the formation of the cloud, air entrainment and fuel impingement on deflector plates. Suitable sub-models have been implemented in OpenFOAM® to facilitate the study. The predictions are compared with the experimental measurements and CFD predictions previously conducted by Atkinson and Coldrick [3] from the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL), an agency of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The present predictions are found to better capture the interaction between the droplets and the gas phase. Improved agreement with the experimental measurements in the gasoline fuel cascades has also been achieved...|$|E

40|$|The {{flash point}} is {{considered}} as a determinant parameter to classify the flammable liquids, regarding the European CLP regulation, {{as well as the}} transport of dangerous goods regulation. In the case of some low concentrated flammable liquid aqueous solutions, the existence of a flash point is not very well defined, and their flammability is not precisely known. The experimental measurements of flash points are described in numerous national or international standards, which differ by their range of validity and by the specified experimental conditions. The flash point of ethanol, acetone, acetic acid and formic acid aqueous solutions was measured using Abel and Pensky-Martens in close cup methods, chosen regarding predicted values of flash point. Results obtained show that, for the most flammable products, such as acetone or ethanol, weakly concentrated aqueous solutions still remains flammable. In the case of acetic or formic acid aqueous solutions, a threshold concentration can be determined under which the solutions are considered as non flammable, regarding the European CLP regulation and the transport of dangerous goods regulation. 1.

40|$|Natural {{hazards and}} {{disasters}} can cause major accidents in chemical and process installations. These so-called Natech accidents {{can result in}} hazardous-materials releases due to damage to process and storage units, or pipes. In {{order to understand the}} dynamics of Natech events, accidents triggered by earthquakes, floods and lightning recorded in industrial-accident databases were analysed. This allowed the identification of the most vulnerable equipment types, their modes of failure under natural-event loading, and the final accident scenarios. Moreover, lessons learned for future accident prevention and mitigation were derived. The analysis showed that pipes and storage tanks are the most vulnerable equipment for earthquakes, floods and lightning, calling for more research of equipment behaviour under natural-event loading. The damage modes and states are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the impacting natural event. Toxic dispersion, fires and/or explosions were observed as a consequence of all three types of natural event analysed. In the case of floods two additional scenarios were identified. These are water contamination and the formation of toxic and/or <b>flammable</b> <b>vapours</b> upon reaction of the released chemicals with the floodwaters.

40|$|Gas explosions inside tubes {{have been}} studied from long times ago. Most of these {{studies were carried out}} for {{industrial}} safety and with a desire to describe general mechanisms of flame propagation. Therefore, most of these works concern understanding the flame acceleration (FA) phenomena and transition from deflagration to detonation (DDT) in tubes. Nowadays, in industry, transportation of hazardous materials using pipelines is a routine practice. The combustible mixtures are subject to risks such as presence of ignition sources or the pressure and temperature rising above the self-ignition condition. One of the main hazards in Hydrogen industry is the formation of <b>flammable</b> <b>vapour</b> clouds which can propagate to kilometres with the possibly of igniting and resulting in fire and explosions. Explosions in homogeneous reactive mixtures have been widely studied both experimentally and numerically.

40|$|The model {{building}} and fire codes in Canada permit prescriptive-based design and performance-based design approaches. Within this regulatory framework, prescriptive-based designs are attributed objective and functional statements to qualify {{the level of}} fire protection and life safety required. Performance-based designs, or alternative solutions to prescriptive-based designs, must be demonstrated to achieve at least an equivalent level of performance as the prescriptive requirement based on evaluation of each associated objective and functional statement. Due to the qualitative performance descriptions available, the current system for developing and reviewing alternative solutions is vulnerable to the acceptance of over-designed or under-designed life safety and fire protection measures in buildings. The objective of this thesis {{is to establish a}} method to compare the performance of alternative solutions with prescriptive design requirements on a quantitative basis. This thesis generates eight objectives for a fire risk analysis tool to address the challenges identified in the building regulatory industry. Based on review of existing techniques, a new fire risk analysis framework is developed. The Quantitative Design Decision (QDD) method, integrates risk analysis with quantitative decision assessment techniques to facilitate application-specific quantification of performance objectives and to aid evaluation of performance-based designs. The method utilizes an iterative three-stage structure. To demonstrate the application of the QDD method, a case-study simulation has been conducted. The case-study provides an evaluation of alternative designs to the prescriptive requirements for explosion-relief ventilation in rooms housing <b>flammable</b> <b>vapour</b> producing operations. The case study supports the conclusion that QDD achieves the eight objectives set out in this thesis. For validation, the QDD method must be applied to a wider variety of practical design challenges and it is recommended that the results be considered in conjunction with live fire test data to verify key aspects of the performance decisions generated. Future work should include evaluation of Delphi technique application in the Design Decision Stage of the QDD method. It is proposed that the method developed can be extended for use as a general performance-based design tool...|$|E

The literature models applicable to the simulation of flash fires differ for the hypothesis made and the complexity. The majority of models assume homogenous clouds, usually at stoichiometric concentration. However the dispersion of the substances released in accidental events frequently results in non-homogeneous stratified clouds. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models have limited applicability due to the large scale of the scenario, yielding extremely high computational burdens. Integral models based on empirical parameters are necessary for routine quantitative risk assessment practice, and more generally, for prevention and mitigation of the scenario.
