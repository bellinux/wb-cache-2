5000|$|Construction of {{the station}} began in 1950 and was {{completed}} in April 1952. The Army Transportation Corps undertook the project, which was originally named Takotna after the mountain on which it was built. The radar station site was located on the summit at 3500 ft of <b>elevation</b> (<b>top</b> camp), with a ground support station in a valley at the base at 1200 ft, at [...] Access to the radars was initially by a road built {{up the side of}} the mountain, and later a cable tramway was built. The tramway cables constantly broke because of high winds and ice, and fog and the extreme cold made repairs hazardous. Ice 16 inches thick built up on the cables in winter.|$|E

Ms. Mercur designed a four square <b>elevation</b> <b>topped</b> by dome which rose 90 feet from the floor. The exterior presented a grand stair and ornamental friezes, cornices; and balustrades encircling the roof, and statues on ornamental pedestals [...] "symbolic of woman and her power." [...] The dome above the roof was surmounted by a statue of [...] "Immortality."

50|$|The Goff and Gamble Merchandise Store is a {{historic}} retail establishment {{in the center of}} Gillham, Arkansas, just north of the railroad tracks. Built in stages between 1900 and 1911, {{it is one of the}} few surviving structures in the community dating to its boom years in the early 20th century. The first section of the building, built 1900, has a wooden storefront topped by a metal cornice, and is the westernmost part of the building. The central section, built out of concrete blocks in 1906, has an entrance facing north, with that <b>elevation</b> <b>topped</b> by a parapet.

40|$|Kruglovskiy {{field is}} a quite simple {{geological}} structure of small thickness of productive layers, {{and includes a}} small amount of karstic and off-grade rocks. We analyzed the spatial distribution of the following parameters and indicators of deposit: thickness of gypsum strata, the average content of gypsum in the well, thickness of overburden, the thickness of karst intervals, thickness of the substandard grade rock, elevation of surface relief, and <b>elevation</b> of the <b>top</b> of gypsum and the top of anhydrite layers. There was observed close and very close correlation between the pairs of indicators. Positive correlation was established between the elevations of relief and top of gypsum layer, <b>elevation</b> of the <b>top</b> of gypsum and the top of anhydrite, and elevation of relief and the top of anhydrite layer. Negative correlation was revealed between overburden thickness and <b>elevation</b> of the <b>top</b> of gypsum layer, overburden thickness and <b>elevation</b> of the <b>top</b> of anhydrite layer, and between overburden thickness and thickness of gypsum stratum. The correlation results indicated that gypsum deposit has, in general, sheet-like shape, a groundwater table elevation changed in the process of hydration of anhydrite relative to the earth's surface, the big thickness of overburden brought a negative effect on the formation of deposit, and its total thickness of gypsum strata was relatively small...|$|R

25|$|A {{driveway}} {{from the}} intersection provides parking {{between the house}} and a former barn to the south, now used as a garage. The house itself is a one-and-a-half-story, five-by-three-bay wood frame structure on a fieldstone foundation. It is sided in clapboard on all but the north (rear) <b>elevation</b> and <b>topped</b> with a gambrel roof shingled in wood. Brick chimneys pierce it at either end.|$|R
50|$|The {{house has}} been {{according}} to a design by Friedrich Meyer. One can notice the pilasters {{as part of the}} avant-corps, as a reference to Roman architecture. The facade lower levels display Doric style, higher ones follow Corinthian style. Friezes delineate the facade, additionally decorated with floral motifs. The whole <b>elevation</b> is <b>topped</b> with a triangular Pediment with a tondo displaying a figure of a baby's head.|$|R

It stands above the village of Glenridding and on the western shore of Ullswater. Although small and not of great <b>elevation,</b> its <b>top</b> is a fine viewpoint for Ullswater and for the fells clustered round the valleys above Patterdale.|$|R
5000|$|The three-story, three bay, brick {{building}} {{was built on}} a stone foundation. In its present situation the building combines several architectural styles. [...] The façade is dominated by a two-story polygonal oriel window that is ornamented with fleur-de-lis. The post and lintel entrance {{is on the left}} side of the east elevation, which is capped by a projecting cornice. The west <b>elevation</b> is <b>topped</b> with a half-hipped roof.|$|R
50|$|The former ES&A Bank {{building}} {{was built on}} the corner of Elizabeth and Franklin Street Melbourne in 1959-60 by Melbourne architects Chancellor and Patrick. Originally intended to be a 12-storey office tower, only the base banking chamber section was built at the time. The most distinctive features of the building are the massive rock-faced random coursed Dromana granite pier/wall sections, dominating the side <b>elevation,</b> <b>topped</b> by a thin floating slab roof projecting over the recessed front elevation. The space between the stone piers on the Franklin Street elevation is filled with a patterned, vertical ribbed concrete screen. The building is considered to display influences from International modernism, and the organic sensibilities of Frank Lloyd Wright as well as the Griffins. The extra floors were added in 2004, but as an apartment building with regular glass balconies, rather than the originally proposed solid masonry balconies projecting every second floor, and various changes to the original base section have infilled openings in the front facade, and undermined the floating qualities of the original roof.|$|R

50|$|Tea chests {{arriving}} at Top Station from the Kundalai Valley were transported by a ropeway from Top Station 5 km down {{hill to the}} south to Kottagudi, Tamil Nadu.
