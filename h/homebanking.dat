40|$|This paper {{describes}} an implementation of an agent-based <b>homebanking</b> service for a mobile network. Agents offer the prospect for revolutionising {{the provision of}} services in telecommunications networks by allowing dynamic distribution of service related data and processing across networks and terminals. At Ericsson Eurolab, Germany, an agent-based solution has been implemented for "services on demand". 1 Keywords: Agent Technology, CAMELEON, Mobile Agents, Voyager, Service on Demand, <b>Homebanking,</b> HBCI. 1. I ntroduction From the scientific disciplines Artificial Intelligence (AI), Distributed Systems and Object Orientation (OO) a new scientific working field called Agent Technology has been established. Currently agents {{are seen as a}} key to the issue of service provisioning within future telecommunication environments.

40|$|<b>HomeBank</b> is {{introduced}} here. It is a public, permanent, extensible, online database of daylong audio recorded in naturalistic environments. <b>HomeBank</b> serves two primary purposes. First, it is a repository for raw audio and associated files: one database requires special permissions, and another redacted database allows unrestricted public access. Associated files include metadata such as participant demographics and clinical diagnostics, automated annotations, and human-generated transcriptions and annotations. Many recordings use the child-perspective LENA recorders (LENA Research Foundation, Boulder, Colorado, United States), but various recordings and metadata can be accommodated. The <b>HomeBank</b> database can have both vetted and unvetted recordings, with {{different levels of}} accessibility. Additionally, <b>HomeBank</b> is an open repository for processing and analysis tools for <b>HomeBank</b> or similar data sets. <b>HomeBank</b> is flexible for users and contributors, making primary data available to researchers, especially those in child development, linguistics, and audio engineering. <b>HomeBank</b> facilitates researchers' access to large-scale data and tools, linking the acoustic, auditory, and linguistic characteristics of children's environments {{with a variety of}} variables including socioeconomic status, family characteristics, language trajectories, and disorders. Automated processing applied to daylong home audio recordings is now becoming widely used in early intervention initiatives, helping parents to provide richer speech input to at-risk children...|$|R

40|$|For some time, {{financial}} and commercial services over the Internet have gained remarkable and increasing attention. As this trend develops {{the range of}} services available to both businesses and individuals will grow. With the broader application field {{the need to provide}} simple but secure access to such services will get more and more momentum. Thereby access to the payment systems should be personalised and available to the users at all times and independent of network and terminal technology. The Flexible Financial Service (FFS) of the European ACTS research project CAMELEON will provide such a service building on the inherent autonomy of mobile agents. 1 Keywords: Agent Technology, CAMELEON, Mobile Agents, Voyager, Service on Demand, <b>Homebanking,</b> HBCI. 1.

40|$|For {{almost all}} {{applications}} within the telecommunication area speed {{and quality of}} data transfer {{is a very important}} factor. A main reason for using mobile agents in the telecommunication world {{is that there is a}} potential for better performance. In particular for mobile telecommunication networks like GSM, mobile agent technology can have considerable advantages. This is based on the fact that a GSM user has a relatively narrow bandwidth at his disposal, and that the connections are not always reliable. This is the case when the application does not need a permanent connection and the amount of data is relatively small. In order to verify these statements, an analytical performance model for mobile agents was derived. In order to test the performance model on a real application, measurements on an HBCI-based <b>homebanking</b> service for mobile agents [1] were carried out. In addition an optimisation strategy was defined and evaluated for an information retrieval service [2]...|$|E
50|$|From 1984 until 2000, CLAN {{was used}} {{exclusively}} {{for the analysis of}} child language data. However, beginning with the funding of the TalkBank system by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2000, the scope of CLAN has broadened. CLAN is now being used to create and analyze a wide variety of corpora in the context of these databanks: CHILDES for child language, AphasiaBank for aphasia, PhonBank for phonology, FluencyBank for fluency disorders, <b>HomeBank</b> for daylong recordings in the home, and SLABank for second language acquisition. The TalkBank website also provides data for seven other spoken language banks dealing with CA (Conversation Analysis), RHD (right hemisphere damage), TBI (traumatic brain injury), LangBank (classical languages), ClassBank (classroom interactions), SamtaleBank (Danish), and BilingBank (bilingualism).|$|R
50|$|Bambanwala Riya Branch Link Canal (BRB Canal), {{better known}} as Ichhogil Canal, is synonymous with the 1965 Indo-Pak war and the Lahore sector of the war. This canal ran 8 km. inside Pakistan and {{proved to be a}} {{formidable}} defensive structure. The <b>homebank</b> of the canal (on the Lahore side) was lined with concrete pill-boxes with over-lapping arcs of fire. From an army’ stand-point, defensive structures like water canals offer two important advantages - (a) economy of forces (b) delaying the advance of the enemy and limiting his ability to maneuver. In case (a), home bank of the canal can be lined with fortified and concrete defensive positions in a mutually supporting manner. Given the protection offered by these structures, the manpower required is relatively less as compared to say, defending over an open ground. The manpower and other assets like tanks / mechanized infantry can be reserved for counter-attacks on the enemy using these canal based defenses as a firm base. The other benefit is that it forces the enemy into expending resources in first securing its home bank, creating a bridgehead and then securing the bridgehead. Creating and securing bridgeheads is never an easy task against an entrenched enemy and are prone to counter-attacks from the enemy reserves in the areas.|$|R
40|$|Conferência realizada em Madrid de 20 - 23 de Junho de 2012 Having the {{information}} at our fingertips we can consider {{that we live}} in a digital age. In fact, images, sounds, videos and information in general are shared every minute all around the world by people connected to the Internet. We live with all the benefits, speed and efficiency that the Internet brings to us, but we must be aware of the inherent risks to data and equipment security. The future of the banking system is definitely dependent on the online services it can provide. Therefore, it is vital to know deeply all the types of cybercrimes that can affect this industry in order to defend those who use the banking online services. This research explores the theme computer security, specifically concerning the <b>homebanking</b> activity, so that (1) we can identify the risks involved in the use of this service and (2) understand if the users are aware of them...|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the OpenTC project, many opinions on Trusted Computing (TC) gathered on the Internet in discussion fora and articles were critical of the technology. Some people believed that TC would be used for tracking citizens ’ activities, locking computers into proprietary configurations, enforcing unfair business models for content or software provision, and even automatically deleting emails and documents without the user’s approval. In this context, the project’s work package on requirement analysis (WP 02) found that a prototype showing TC's potential to protect users could be used to make TC more attractive, as opposed to an application protecting "only " organisations like employers or content providers. Such a prototype would make it possible to demonstrate to the public the broad range of purposes for which TC can be used. A particularly suitable use-case in our opinion is one that demonstrates how TC can be used to protect individuals against financial risks, e. g., security threats in <b>homebanking</b> or online auctions. Given that computer criminals frequently produce malware software to fool users into giving them their security credentials, so-called phishing, strong protection against such attacks would be the objective of a suitable use-case implementation. On the basis of the OpenTC architecture, the design of the prototype woul...|$|E
