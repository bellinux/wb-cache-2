5|$|In 1518 Sigismund I married Bona Sforza d'Aragona, a young, strong-minded Italian princess. Bona's {{sway over}} {{the king and}} the magnates, <b>her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> {{strengthen}} the monarch's political position, financial situation, and especially the measures she took to advance her personal and dynastic interests, including the forced royal election of the minor Sigismund Augustus in 1529 and his premature coronation in 1530, increased the discontent among szlachta activists.|$|E
5|$|In her {{biography}} of McCracken, The Girl Who Fell Down, dance critic Mary Jo Sagolla says that McCracken is little remembered today, and not widely appreciated for her influence on Fosse, and for <b>her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> {{encourage him to}} move from dance to choreography. Though her career went into {{a sharp decline in}} the 1950s due to her diabetes, she directly influenced the career of MacLaine, as well as Fosse, and was a pioneer in combining comedy and dance.|$|E

A brass plaque {{on the floor of}} Great St Mary's marks the original location of Bucer's grave.|$|E
5|$|A plot by {{some members}} of the {{imperial}} government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and the conspirators mutilated and publicly humiliated. Stephen died at Methymna on Easter Sunday, 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of <b>her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> protect the rights to the throne of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, by eliminating other possible claimants to the throne. It should, however, be noted that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources, usually by poison.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to regain her {{position}} in the national squad, Kydd attended the extended squad's first training camp in September 2005, but {{was one of several}} players forced out after succumbing to a virus. She was subsequently left out of the team for a practice tour of Jamaica and New Zealand in the lead-up to the 2006 Commonwealth Games, but continued <b>her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> make the team for the Games. Finally, on 10 December 2005, she voluntarily withdrew her name from selection, noting ongoing complications from the earlier concussion (team doctors stated that she had probably attempted to return too quickly) and low motivation.|$|E
5|$|In <b>her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> be {{the perfect}} wife, she was often given an eye for trying too hard, {{but at the same}} time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
5|$|Kirill {{suffered}} {{a nervous breakdown}} in 1923 and Victoria nursed him back to health. She encouraged his dreams of restoring the monarchy in Russia and becoming Tsar. At Saint-Briac Kirill, aware of the murders of Tsar Nicholas II and his only son, officially declared himself the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Victoria went {{on a trip to}} the United States in 1924, hoping to raise American support for restoration of the monarchy. Her efforts evoked little response, due to the isolationism prevalent in the United States during the 1920s. She continued in <b>her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> help Kirill restore the monarchy and also sold her artwork {{to raise money for the}} household.|$|E

5|$|The Shelleys {{moved to}} Windsor {{in the summer}} of 1815. Hogg visited them there when his {{workload}} permitted. They left England for Continental Europe again in May 1816, and Hogg resumed his visits after their return, but he was no longer as close to them as he had been. This was in part due to his awkwardness with Mary, who was preoccupied with <b>her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> finish writing Frankenstein. Percy and Hogg were nonetheless able to convince Mary to attend the opera with them on a few occasions.|$|E

5|$|At the palace, Nero tells Agrippina of his {{troubles}} {{and decides to}} renounce love for political ambition ("Come nube che fugge dal vento"). But Pallas and Narcissus have by now revealed Agrippina's original plot to Claudius, so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield the throne to Nero, he accuses her of treachery. She then claims that <b>her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> secure the throne for Nero had all along been a ruse to safeguard the throne for Claudius ("Se vuoi pace"). Claudius believes her; nevertheless, when Poppaea, Otho, and Nero arrive, Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry, and that Otho shall have the throne. No one is satisfied with this arrangement, as their desires have all changed, so Claudius {{in a spirit of}} reconciliation reverses his judgement, giving Poppaea to Otho and the throne to Nero. He then summons the goddess Juno, who descends to pronounce a general blessing ("V'accendano le tede i raggi delle stelle").|$|E
25|$|Ensler {{has also}} been honored by such {{organizations}} as Planned Parenthood (2004, 2006), The Women's Prison Association (2004), Sahkti (2004), and several LGBT centers (2004, 2006) for <b>her</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> end violence against women and girls.|$|R

5|$|Following her husband's {{death in}} 1461, Catherine's role receded {{to that of}} queen dowager at the court of her stepson, King Stephen Tomašević. Two years later, forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Mehmed the Conqueror invaded Bosnia {{and put an end}} to the {{independent}} kingdom. Catherine's stepson was executed, while Sigismund and Catherine, her son and daughter by Thomas, were captured and taken to Constantinople, where they converted to Islam. Queen Catherine escaped, taking refuge in Dubrovnik and eventually settling in Rome, where she received a pension from the papacy. From Rome she strove to be reunited with her children. <b>Her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> negotiate and offer a ransom proved futile. She died a Franciscan tertiary in Rome, having named the papacy guardians of Bosnia and her children heirs to the throne, should they ever return to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In {{this stage}} of the myth, Horus is a {{vulnerable}} child beset by dangers. The magical texts that use Horus's childhood as the basis for their healing spells give him different ailments, from scorpion stings to simple stomachaches, adapting the tradition to fit the malady that each spell was intended to treat. Most commonly, the child god has been bitten by a snake, reflecting the Egyptians' fear of snakebite and the resulting poison. Some texts indicate that these hostile creatures are agents of Set. Isis may use her own magical powers to save her child, or she may plead with or threaten deities such as Ra or Geb, so they will cure him. As she is the archetypal mourner in the first portion of the story, so during Horus's childhood she is the ideal devoted mother. Through the magical healing texts, <b>her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> heal her son are extended to cure any patient.|$|E
5|$|Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; {{this caused}} her {{popularity}} in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite <b>her</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government {{took an interest in}} her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While {{she and her husband were}} travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.|$|E
60|$|Some people, nowadays, seem to {{have hit}} upon a new moralization of the moth and the candle. They would lock up the light of Truth, lest poor Psyche should put it out in <b>her</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> draw nigh, to it.|$|R
50|$|Her {{early studies}} {{included}} social structure and feminism, but more recently she {{is known for}} <b>her</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> explain the classical aspects of psychoanalysis using object relations, relational psychoanalysis, and feminist thought.

60|$|She {{was talking}} at random, partly to conceal her anxiety, and partly with the {{charitable}} purpose of giving her companion time {{to approach the}} subject that must be mentioned; but she rather overdid <b>her</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> appear at ease. Agatha looked at her sharply.|$|R
