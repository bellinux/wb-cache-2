50|$|The MC/MR was {{designed}} {{from the beginning}} to be available in right-hand drive as well as left-hand drive. This allowed Mack to market the truck in the United Kingdom without costly conversions, and also opened the trash truck market at home. The right-hand drive models also have the exhaust relocated to the left, while the turbocharger is mounted behind the engine so as to provide more space and less heat soak. Export models are coded MCE and MRE respectively. The low profile cab is of steel, while the doors are fibreglass. The engine intrudes considerably into the low cab. The cab tilts through a full 90 degrees, allowing for the radiator to be removed without first removing the cab. The dashboard is lit from a single source through <b>fibreoptics,</b> this being a very early example of such an application.|$|E
5000|$|Of the 3 {{most famous}} {{residents}} of Helensburgh, {{the only one}} to have been born in the town was John Logie Baird (1888-1946). He was the first man in the world ever to transmit proper television pictures and in his day he was recognised as the inventor of television. His success was acknowledged in The Radio News of America in September 1926: [...] "Mr Baird has definitely and indisputably given a demonstration of real television. It {{is the first time in}} history that this has been done in any part of the world." [...] So this was 7 months before AT&T made their first transmission within the United States which was erroneously claimed in one American headline as [...] "Television at Last". He also made the world's first video recordings (on 78 rpm gramophone records) and produced an infrared night sight which incorporated a major development in the field of <b>fibreoptics.</b>|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope in the late 1960 s there have been relatively few technological advances for three decades, aside from the development of a white light video bronchoscope with a miniature charge-coupled device built in its tip replacing the <b>fibreoptics.</b> White light flexible videobronchoscopy with its ancillary devices (forceps biopsy, bronchial brushing, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washings and transbronchial needle aspiration) has long been the only established diagnostic bronchoscopic technique. With the advances in microtechnology over the past two decades, recent technical developments such as autofluorescence bronchoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound allow better evaluation of endobronchial, mediastinal and parenchymal lesions. © ERS 2010.

40|$|Fibreoptic {{and video}} {{technologies}} {{are widely used}} for airway management. <b>Fibreoptics</b> {{have been used in}} most airway intubation devices, including rigid laryngoscopes and in the tracheal tube wall itself. 10 22 Optical stylets, which incorporate ¯exible ®breoptic imaging elements in an intubation stylet, have now also become available. More than 10 new optical stylet devices have been introduced since 1995, which shows that combining view-ing capability with the familiar handling of a stylet is an appealing concept (Table 1). But are these useful tools? Are their clinical performances similar or is one best? We survey the evolution of optical stylets, describe their properties, summarize their clinical performance and describe an ideal system...|$|E

40|$|The {{fiber optic}} arthroscopies {{generally}} {{consist of a}} rod lens system surrounded by multiple light conducting glass fibrils; enclosed in a specially treated rigid metal sheet. Most important optical characteristics of arthroscope are direction of view of an arthroscope & a line connecting the tip of arthroscope & the center of its field of view. The viewing angle refers to the field encompassed by the lens. Arthroscope consist of an optical lens system, light conducting <b>fibreoptics</b> and surrounding sheath; they vary in diameter Fiber Light sources The fiberoptic cable consists of a bundle of specially prepared glass fibers encased in a protective sheath for routine general diagnostics inspection in patient. 150 watt tungston bulbs are usually sufficient.

40|$|Applying the Barabasi’s {{network model}} to Internet Infrastructure My {{research}} question is: How to explain internet infrastructure? To {{have a general}} overview on the internet infrastructure all over Europe we will take into account only fibre-optic backbone cables, those that connect cities among them, excluding direct user access from home (the so-called Fibre To The Home system). To understand the current topology of the fibre-optic network in Europe {{the purpose is to}} observe the growth and the development in time and space of the entire system. The history of fibre-optic technology can go far away in time, but only in the last 15 years <b>fibreoptics</b> have been applied as communication tools. The first users of this type of technology were academic research centres, with the aim to have constant and fast communication among them. Figure 1.

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study is presented and the achieved key design milestones towards the first application of Chemical Species Tomography by Near-IR Absorption Tomography on a heavy duty, large-bore marine engine to visualise relative mixture strength are described. The engine {{is equipped with}} pre-chamber ignition and operates using Liquefied Natural Gas with > 88. 9 % methane content. Operation of the engine under maximum-load conditions is a key design requirement, with peak cylinder pressure and mean temperature exceeding 127, 510 Torr (170 bar) and 850 K respectively. The near-IR spectroscopic behaviour of methane is examined for suitable absorption and reference regions for the above application. In particular, the spectroscopic absorption around the 2 ν 3 transition region near 1, 666 nm is approximated by simulation {{using data from the}} HITRAN database under worst-case conditions. The simulation results are compared with methane spectra experimentally acquired at high temperature and ambient pressure. Interference from other chemical species as well as measurement linearity is also investigated. A 31 -laser beam tomographic imaging array is proposed, which has been optimised to achieve higher spatial resolution performance {{in the vicinity of the}} pre-chamber’s orifices. To enable optical access, a novel, minimally-intrusive method is presented, utilising standard <b>fibreoptics</b> and collimator...|$|E
40|$|Background. The LMA CTrachTM ‡ {{system has}} {{integrated}} <b>fibreoptics</b> to enable viewing of the glottis to aid tracheal intubation via a laryngeal mask conduit. Earlier evaluations {{of this system}} had shown high success rates of insertion, ventilation and tracheal intubation, but frequent difficulty or failure to view the glottis. Method. We evaluated CTrach views in 100 patients. In 69 patients with partial or no views of the glottis, we evaluated the causes {{with the aid of}} an Olympus LF-DP fibreoptic laryngoscope passed through the CTrach. In those with poor views, we tested the effectiveness of simple corrective measures to improve the views and optimize CTrach placement. These included pushing the CTrach deeper in, partial withdrawal by 6 cm and reinsertion to correct epiglottic downfolding, withdrawal by 1 cm and applying forward lift to correct obstruction by the aryte-noids, and complete removal to clean the fibreoptic ports followed by reinsertion when secre-tions were the problem. Results. Downfolding of the epiglottis caused poor views in 57 patients, which was correctable in 51. Obstruction of the view by the arytenoids occurred in seven patients and by secretions in five, all of which were correctable. With the Ctrach, we were able to ventilate the lungs in all patients...|$|E
40|$|There was an {{era when}} bark of {{mandrake}} plant, boiled in wine was used to administer anesthesia. Ether, after reigning the kingdom of anaesthesiology {{for more than a}} century, came to be superseded by newer and newer agents. Anaesthesiology has witnessed tremendous developments since infancy. The introduction of advanced airway adjuncts, labour analgesia, patient controlled analgesia, <b>fibreoptics,</b> Bispectral Index monitors, workstations, simulators and robotic surgeries are only to name a further few. Anaesthesia for robotic surgery received much impetus and is still a dream to come true in many countries. But then, the rapid spin in technology and fast sophistication of medical field has even surpassed this. The next event to venture is entry of robots into human body made possible by a culmination of intricate medicine and fine technology that is Nanotechnology. This article briefly introduces the field of nanotechnology in relation to its potential benefits to the field of anaesthesiology. As with any new tecnique or application, nanotechnology as applied to anaesthesiology has tremendous potential for research and exploration. This article therefore orients the reader′s mind towards the immense potential and benefits that can be tapped by carrying out further studies and experimentations. The literature was searched using databases, peer reviewed journals and books for over a period of one year (till December 2011). The search was carried out using keywords as nanotechnology, robotics, anesthesiology etc. Initially a master database was formed including human as well as animal studies. Later on the broad topic area was narrowed down to developments in nanotechnology as applied to anesthesiology. Further filtering of search results were done based on selection of researches and developments relating to local, regional and general anesthesia as well as critical care and pain and palliative care...|$|E
40|$|Indirect laryngoscopy, in {{the form}} of {{flexible}} fibreoscopy, is the established ‘gold standard’ for the management of the predicted difficult airway. 1 Rigid indirect laryngoscopy (RIL) is not new. The Bullard laryngoscope, for example, has been used by a small number of airway enthusiasts for around 20 yr. The prac-tice of RIL has markedly increased in recent years, with availability and use of devices appearing to be greater than any robust evi-dence of their efficacy. 2, 3 In light of this rela-tive lack of evidence, direct laryngoscopy (DL) remains the technique most taught and prac-tised for the management of the unpredicted difficult intubation (DI). This is despite a 1 in 75 failure rate. 3 In time, it may be that RIL will ‘fill the gap ’ between DL and flexible fibreoscopy and perhaps even replace one or both of them. These new devices use modern technology to look around the anatomical ‘corners ’ of the upper airway to provide a view of the glottis, the visual axis being closer to 608, rather than the direct line of sight of MacIntosh laryngoscopy. In general, devices are categorized in relation to the method of image transmission back to the viewfinder. For some, this is based on reflection, involving prisms, mirrors, or most commonly, <b>fibreoptics.</b> In others, digital images are transmitted electron-ically from a distal tip video camera back to a monitor screen. However, the classification out-lined below is based on the method of passing the tracheal tube (TT) through the glottis. Classification (i) Non-guided devices—provide an indirect view of the larynx, but require direction of the TT towards the larynx. (ii) Guided devices—provide an indirect view of the larynx and a conduit for passage of the TT. (iii) Optical stylets—provide an indirect view via a rigid or semi-rigid stylet, with a ‘loaded ’ TT for railroading. These devices are usually inserted in the mid-line, without deviation of the tongue, with exception of the optical stylets where a retro-molar approach may provide better intubating conditions. Knowledge and practice of the specific insertion techniques are essential. Several of the key features of the more recently released and commonly used instruments are highlighted in Table 1...|$|E
