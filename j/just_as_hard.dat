500|$|Murray's speech, [...] "Jim Crow and Jane Crow", {{was given}} during Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency. It {{primarily}} addresses {{an audience of}} African-American women. [...] Pauli Murray acknowledges the fact that African-American women always {{have contributed to the}} progress of the Civil Rights Movement. She asserted that African-American women have worked <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> as, if not harder than, African-American men to achieve equal rights among black people and white people. According to Murray, [...] "Not only have they stood...with Negro men in every phase of the battle, but they have also continued to stand when their men were destroyed by it." [...] The black women decided to [...] "...continue......" [...] for their freedom and liberty even when [...] "...their men..." [...] began to experience exhaustion from a long struggle for civil rights. These women were unafraid to stand up for what they believed in and refused to back down from the long and tedious [...] "battle". [...] Murray continued her praise for black women when she stated that [...] "...one cannot help asking: would the Negro struggle have come this far without the indomitable determination of its women?" [...] The [...] "Negro struggle" [...] was able to progress partly because of [...] "...the indomitable determination of its women." [...] African-American women were vital to the Civil Rights Movement and pushed it forward with their own might. They were just as important to the black struggle for racial justice as their male counterparts. Their work ethic and persistence defined African-American women as important to a long fight against racism in America.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the glass ceiling, which already is stopping women from climbing higher in success in the workplace, a parallel phenomenon called the [...] "glass escalator" [...] is occurring. This {{can be defined as}} how more men are joining fields that were previously occupied mainly by women, such as nursing and teaching, and within these job fields, the men are riding right past women and going straight to the top, similarly to if they were on an escalator and a woman was taking stairs. Men are being offered more promotions than women and even though women have worked <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard,</b> they are still not being offered the same chances as men are in some circumstances. The chart from Carolyn K. Broner, Ph.D. shows an example of the glass escalator in favor of men for female-dominant occupations in schools.

2500|$|My first {{innings in}} Test cricket was, {{as you might}} expect, a trying experience, but proved {{to be one of}} the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 to join [...] "Redders", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of our partnership. [...] "Snowy" [...] {{concentrated}} his attack short of a length on [...] "Redders" [...] off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at [...] "Snowy". It may not have looked all that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made me feel that if it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then I had better make sure I try <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and our partnership put us into a sound position, but from my point of view I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Gould {{was widely}} {{known for his}} unusual habits. He usually hummed while he played the piano, and his {{recording}} engineers had mixed results in how successfully they could exclude his voice from recordings. Gould claimed that his singing was unconscious and increased proportionately with {{the inability of the}} piano in question to realize the music as he intended. It is likely that this habit originated in Gould's having been taught by his mother to [...] "sing everything that he played", as Kevin Bazzana puts it. This became [...] "an unbreakable (and notorious) habit". Some of Gould's recordings were severely criticised because of the background [...] "vocalising". For example, a reviewer of his 1981 re-recording of the Goldberg Variations opined that many listeners would [...] "find the groans and croons intolerable". Gould was renowned for his peculiar body movements while playing and for his insistence on absolute control over every aspect of his playing environment. The temperature of the recording studio had to be exactly regulated. He invariably insisted {{that it had to be}} extremely warm. According to Friedrich, the air conditioning engineer had to work <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> as the recording engineers. The piano had to be set at a certain height and would be raised on wooden blocks if necessary. A small rug would sometimes be required for his feet underneath the piano. He had to sit fourteen inches above the floor and would play concerts only while sitting on the old chair his father had made. He continued to use this chair even when the seat was completely worn through. His chair is so closely identified with him that it is shown in a place of honour in a glass case at the National Library of Canada.|$|E

While running close to the lead and leading a couple laps, Edwards tangled with Kasey Kahne with less than 20 laps to go. Edwards — while moving under Kahne —knocked Kahne into the SAFER barrier. In an apparent act of retaliation, Kahne forced Edwards out of the draft, wrecking Edwards and himself. Despite the payback, Edwards took responsibility for the collision stating: [...] "I was <b>just</b> racing <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> I can. It's completely my fault, Kasey did a good job.

50|$|Turning {{tools are}} {{generally}} made {{from three different}} types of steel; carbon steel, high speed steel (HSS), and more recently powdered metal. Comparing the three types, high speed steel tools maintain their edge longer, requiring less frequent sharpening than carbon steel, but {{not as long as}} powdered metal tools. The harder the type of high speed steel used, the longer the edge will maintain sharpness. Powdered steel is even harder than HSS, but takes more effort to obtain an edge as sharp <b>as</b> HSS, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> HSS is <b>harder</b> to get <b>as</b> sharp as carbon steel.|$|R

40|$|What {{determines the}} {{perceived}} {{productivity of the}} older worker and how does this perception compare to {{the perception of the}} productivity of the younger worker? In this study we present evidence based on data from Dutch employers and employees. Productivity perceptions are affected by one's age and one's position in the hierarchy. The young favor the young, the old favor the old, and employers value the productivity of workers less than employees do. However, there are also remarkable similarities across employers and employees. By distinguishing the various dimensions that underlie the productivity of younger and older workers, we tested whether soft qualities and abilities-e. g., reliability and commitment-are <b>just</b> <b>as</b> important <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> qualities-cognitive and physically based skills-in the eyes of both employers and employees. It appears that both employers and employees, young and old, view <b>hard</b> skills <b>as</b> far more important than soft skills. Copyright (c) 2010 The Population Council, Inc [...] ...|$|R
