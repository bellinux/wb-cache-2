25|$|The decisive battle soon followed. Unlike most {{battles of}} the Second Punic War, the Romans had superiority in cavalry and the Carthaginians had superiority in infantry. The Roman army was {{generally}} better armed and trained than the Carthaginians. Hannibal had refused to lead this army into battle, {{because he did not}} <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to perform. There had been very bitter arguments between him and the oligarchy. His co-general, Hasdrubal Gisco, was forced to commit suicide by a violent mob after he spoke in support of Hannibal's view that such troops should not be led into battle. Before the battle, Hannibal gave no speech to his new troops, only to his veterans.|$|E

Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, {{and he is}} running for a championship. But he knows {{just as well as}} I do that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E
500|$|Both Dozier and Yuricon {{president}} Erica Friedman {{wrote about}} the sexual nature of Honey, including the lesbian desire of the Jewel Princess (one of Honey's enemies) {{for her in the}} second episode. Friedman—who had looked for such [...] "implied yuri" [...] in Cutie Honey manga—called the Princess's appearance [...] "*just* what I was hoping for", and praised Honey's change to her S Queen form in response. Ross said about the series: [...] "It's seemingly exploitative, it's incredibly sexist, and the female members of my household - you'd <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> indignant, but, no, they were laughing their butts off because it was so blatant, and yet Honey was actually never objectified in the whole series." [...] He further writes, [...] "Honey Kisaragi is an extremely strong character who is no damsel in distress. If anyone needs help in this series, it's the guys!" [...] Toole said that Jessica Calvello [...] "gives the character a growling, tough-girl charm that was conspicuously absent from the original version", while Dozier said that Calvello captured [...] "the combination of innocence and bravado [...] that is both so confusing and yet so appropriate". Beveridge said the [...] "fight sequences are pretty well done and provide some fun moments watching Honey battle the various demonic forms", but concluded that Honey main goal is to showcase the lead heroine's changes: [...] "Oh, lets face it. it's all about the half to completely naked transformation sequences. They're grrreat!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{take the}} view that the two peoples are identical. Apart from the similarity in names, the Anatolian Hittites were a powerful political entity in the region before the collapse of their empire in the 14th-12th centuries BC, so one would <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mentioned in the Bible, just {{in the way that the}} ḤTY post-Exodus are. [...] A stone lion relief found at Beth Shan, near the Sea of Galilee (now at the Israel Museum), dated to about 1700 BC, has been interpreted by professor Bill Humble as confirming this identification, since lions are often pictured in Hittite art. Moreover, in the account of the conquest of Canaan, the Hittites are said to dwell [...] "in the mountains" [...] and [...] "towards the north" [...] of Canaan [...] a description that matches the general direction and geography of the original Hittite empire, which had been influential in the region prior to the Battle of Kadesh.|$|E

2500|$|According to data {{provided}} by the Palestinian International Middle East Media Center, 79.7% of the Palestinians killed in Gaza were male, with the majority between 16 and 35 (fighting-age). In contrast, a New York Times analysis states that males of ages that {{are most likely to}} be militants form 9% of the population but 34% of the casualties, while women and children under 15, who are least likely to be legitimate targets, form 71% of the general population and 33% of the casualties. Israel has pointed to the relatively small numbers of fatalities among women, children and men over 60, and to instances of Hamas fighters being counted as civilians (perhaps due to the broad definition of [...] "civilian" [...] used by the Gaza Health Ministry), to support its view that the number of the dead who were militants is 40–50%. The IDF calculates that 5% of Gaza's military forces were killed in the war. Jana Krause, from the war studies department at King's College London, stated that [...] "a potential explanation other than combatant roles" [...] for the tendency of the dead to be young men [...] "could be that families <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first ones to leave shelters in order to care for hurt relatives, gather information, look after abandoned family homes or arrange food and water." [...] ITIC reported instances in which children and teenagers served as militants, as well as cases where the ages of casualties reported by GHM were allegedly falsified, with child militants listed as adults and adults listed as children.|$|E

They are seldom mentioned by his Christian characters with respect, probably realistically reflecting the sentiments of the classes he wrote about. Some of his greatest villains in his later novels--Melmotte in The Way We Live Now (1875) and Lopez in The Prime Minister (1876)--are rumored to be Jewish, but Trollope never unequivocally identifies them as Jewish.
