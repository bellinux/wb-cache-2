5|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for The Simpsons ninth season, writer Donick Cary {{stated that}} {{the inspiration for the}} idea of an episode about stand-up comedy came out of comedy festivals at the time. Executive producer Mike Scully said that the writers had difficulty getting Krusty's offensive bad jokes through the network censors. The stereotypical jokes were allowed because the writers convinced the network censors that viewers would understand <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> emphasizing Krusty's dated comedic material.|$|E
5|$|The account ledgers of Tallinn {{city council}} contain entries about the Kõpu {{lighthouse}} from 1507 to 1533, showing money {{was spent on}} the beacon of Hiiumaa from 13 May 1514 until 12 October 1532. The amounts show {{the majority of the}} work took place from 1514 to 1519; later there are only a couple of bigger expenditures on the beacon. A fire was first lit in the autumn of 1531; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> a bonfire on top of the tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{alternative}} {{train of}} thought is that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> not advantageous to be large until {{the appearance of the}} Ediacarans: the environment favoured the small over the large. Examples of such scenarios today include plankton, whose small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal blooms. But for large size never to be favourable, the environment would have to be very different indeed.|$|E

5|$|The laconic Act is {{the legal}} basis for the {{existence}} of modern Lithuania, both during the interwar period and since 1990. The Act formulated the basic constitutional principles that were and still are followed by all Constitutions of Lithuania. The Act itself was a key element in the foundation of Lithuania's re-establishment of independence in 1990. Lithuania, breaking away from the Soviet Union, stressed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> re-establishing the independent state that existed between the world wars and that the Act never lost its legal power.|$|E
5|$|The six {{enter the}} Department of Mysteries where they reveal a bottled prophecy, the object Voldemort was after. However, they are ambushed by Death Eaters, {{including}} Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw {{a dream of}} Sirius being tortured; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> a ruse to lure Harry into the Death Eaters' grasp. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, and a battle between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters ensues. The Death Eaters take everyone except Harry as hostages, threatening to kill them unless he surrenders the prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia {{ran across}} England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears {{to show that}} it was a defended border, with large earthworks set back from the frontier. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.|$|E

5|$|The route {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} in the modern history of the race, with substantial criticism that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> too hard for a three-week-long race. Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at Grossglockner in Austria, the exceptionally steep Monte Zoncolan, and a tall and steep peak near the Fascia Valley in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the Nevegal. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the mid-1350s that {{military}} operations on the Continent were resumed on a large scale. In 1356, Edward's eldest son, Edward, the Black Prince, won an important victory in the Battle of Poitiers. The greatly outnumbered English forces not only routed the French, but captured the French king, John II and his youngest son, Philip. After a succession of victories, the English held great possessions in France, the French king was in English custody, and the French central government had almost totally collapsed. There has been a historical debate as to whether Edward's claim to the French crown originally was genuine, or if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> a political ploy meant to put pressure on the French government. Regardless of the original intent, the stated claim now seemed to be within reach. Yet a campaign in 1359, meant to complete the undertaking, was inconclusive. In 1360, therefore, Edward accepted the Treaty of Brétigny, whereby he renounced his claims to the French throne, but secured his extended French possessions in full sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|William H. Jackson did, in fact, own the {{property}} {{on the opposite}} side of Dearing Street from the tree. That plot included the present-day 226 Dearing Street, but in the early 19th century <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> designated Lot #14. The tree, however, is located on a portion of what had been Lot #15. Jackson and his wife Mildred, along with a J. A. Cobb, sold their property to a Dr. Malthus Ward in 1832, the same year cited on a plaque as being the date of the tree's deed. The Clarke County real estate indices contain no indication of when or from whom Jackson originally purchased {{the property}}, although much of the land in that area is reported to have belonged to a Major James Meriwether. Even though Jackson may have lived near the tree as an adult, his childhood was actually spent in Jefferson County, not in Athens, making it less likely that he had experienced idyllic childhood summers playing beneath the tree's branches.|$|E

25|$|The Republican base in Virginia {{consists}} of the state's traditional Republican heartland in the Blue Ridge Mountains, social conservatives in the Shenandoah Valley and suburbanites in the east. McCain closely matched George W. Bush's numbers among the first group and only did slightly worse than Bush amongst the second group. However, in 2008, suburbanites in Northern Virginia and in the Richmond/Hampton Roads areas abandoned the Republican Party in droves, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> impossible for McCain to win the state without their support.|$|E

25|$|According to Jan Nattier, {{the term}} Mahāyāna ("Great Vehicle") was {{originally}} an honorary synonym for Bodhisattvayāna ("Bodhisattva Vehicle")— the vehicle of a bodhisattva seeking buddhahood {{for the benefit}} of all sentient beings. The term Mahāyāna was therefore formed independently at an early date as a synonym for the path and the teachings of the bodhisattvas. Since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> an honorary term for Bodhisattvayāna, the creation of the term Mahāyāna and its application to Bodhisattvayāna did not represent a significant turning point {{in the development of a}} Mahāyāna tradition.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} of neuropteran phylogeny has vastly improved since the mid-1990s, {{not the least}} courtesy of the ever-growing fossil record.
