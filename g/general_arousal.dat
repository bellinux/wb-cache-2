2500|$|In 2005, Alice Flaherty {{presented}} a three-factor {{model of the}} creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and dopamine from the limbic system. The frontal lobes {{can be seen as}} responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition, and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas. [...] A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other default mode network functions.|$|E

5000|$|Bem {{proposes a}} theory on the {{relationship}} between childhood gender non-conformity, which he refers to as the [...] "exotic become erotic." [...] Bem argues that biological factors, such as prenatal hormones, genes and neuroanatomy, predispose children to behave in ways that do not conform to their sex assigned at birth. Gender nonconforming children will often prefer opposite-sex playmates and activities. These become alienated from their same-sex peer group. As children enter adolescence [...] "the exotic becomes erotic" [...] where dissimilar and unfamiliar same-sex peers produces arousal, and the <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> become eroticized over time. Bem's theory does not seem to fit female homosexuality. Perhaps, males who demonstrate gender nonconformity experience more alienation and separation from same-sex peers, because cultural constructions of masculinity are generally more rigid than femininity.|$|E

40|$|QEEG {{characteristics}} and spectrum weighted frequency for children diagnosed as autistic spectrum disorder Nada Pop-Jordanova *, Tatjana Zorcec, Aneta Demerdzieva, Zoran Gucev Background: Autistic spectrum disorders are {{a group of}} neurological and developmental disorders associated with social, communication, sensory, behavioral and cognitive impairments, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, activities, or interests. The {{aim of this study}} was a) to analyze QEEG findings of autistic patients and to compare the results with data base; and b) to introduce the calculation of spectrum weighted frequency (brain rate) as an indicator of <b>general</b> mental <b>arousal</b> in these patients. Results: Results for Q-EEG shows generally increased delta-theta activity in frontal region of the brain. Changes in QEEG pattern appeared to be in a non-linear correlation with maturational processes. Brain rate measured in CZ shows slow brain activity (5. 86) which is significantly lower than normal and corresponds to low <b>general</b> mental <b>arousal...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Previous {{models of}} a {{structure}} of temperament did not distinguish among the traits regulating behaviour in different areas of activity. They consider, for example, energetic capacities in motor and social activities (extraversion or Strength of the nervous system) as based on a nonspecific <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> of the nervous system. Many models of temperament and personality follow a so-called [...] "general arousal" [...] approach, considering only one general trait related to the energetic component of behaviour: [...] "strength of excitation" [...] (Pavlov, Jan Strelau) [...] "liveliness", “vigilance” (Cattell), extraversion (Eysenck, Five-Factor model in personality), [...] "activity" [...] (Heymans, Buss & Plomin, 1984; Rothbart, et al., 2000), approach behavioural system (Gray), drive persistence (Telegen, 1985) or just [...] "arousal""(Mehrabian, 1996).

40|$|International audienceThe present {{research}} {{was designed to}} examine whether viewing a subtle threat cue, the color red, prior to a simple motor task influences strength output. Thirty-nine participants performed a maximal voluntary contraction of the thigh, viewed red or a chromatic or achromatic control color, and then repeated the maximal voluntary contraction. Participants also reported their <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> and mood, {{and were asked to}} guess the purpose of the experiment. Results indicated that viewing red (relative to a control color) inhibited the rate of force development, but did not influence the peak amplitude of force production. Null findings for <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> and mood indicated that the observed effect on rate of force development could not be accounted for by these self-report variables; no participant correctly guessed the purpose of the experiment.

50|$|Pupil {{dilation}} and constriction {{can determine}} the valence of surprise from the action to {{the reaction of the}} individual. Positive valence to surprise is shown through a dilation or expansion of the pupil, where as negative valence in surprise is associated with pupil constriction.

40|$|Disgust, a {{negative}} emotion which evokes strong behavioral avoidance tendencies, {{has been associated}} with sexual dysfunction. Recently, it was postulated that healthy sexual functioning requires a balance between excitatory (increased sexual arousal) and inhibitory processes (lowered disgust levels). This suggests that amplification of excitatory processes (like sexual arousal) could be a valuable addition to treatments for affect-based sexual dysfunctions. The major aim {{of the present study was}} to establish whether up-regulation could effectively enhance arousal levels during sexual stimuli, and whether such a training would simultaneously reduce disgust. Students (N = 163, mean age= 20. 73 years, SD = 2. 35) were trained in up-regulation of affect using either a sexual arousal film (i. e., female-friendly erotic movie) or a threat arousal film clip (i. e., horror movie), while control groups viewed the films without training instructions. Following this, participants viewed and rated state emotions during a series of pictures (sexual, disgusting, or neutral). Up-regulation of mood successfully enhanced <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> in both groups, yet these arousal levels were not paralleled by reductions in disgust. Overall, the findings indicate that emotion regulation training by maximizing positive affect and <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> could be an effective instrument to facilitate affect-related disturbances in sexual dysfunctions...|$|E
50|$|Based on discoveries {{made through}} neural mapping of the limbic system, the neurobiological {{explanation}} of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state {{organized in the}} limbic system of the mammalian brain.

Emotions can likely be mediated by pheromones (see fear).|$|R

50|$|He is most {{known for}} the Schachter-Singer theory that he and Stanley Schachter {{developed}} in 1962. This was a new theory in emotion research that took into account cognitive factors, something {{that had not been}} considered until the resurgence of cognitive psychology a few years before. The two devised a model of emotional experience using cognitive terminology. The model showed stimulation leading to perception and interpretation. This would create <b>general</b> autonomic <b>arousal</b> and coupled with the context a particular emotion would be experienced by the individual.

40|$|Mimicry of others' postures and {{behaviours}} {{forms an}} implicit yet indispensable component of social interactions. However, whereas numerous behavioural studies {{have investigated the}} occurrence of mimicry and its social sensitivity, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation {{was used to measure}} corticospinal facilitation during a naturalistic behaviour observation task adapted from the behavioural mimicry literature. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in participants' right hands were measured as they observed stimulus videos of a confederate describing photographs. MEPs were recorded while confederates were and were not carrying out hand and leg behaviours that also differed in spatial extent (i. e. large behaviours: face rubbing and leg crossing; small behaviours: finger tapping and foot bouncing). However, the cover task instructions did not refer to the confederate's behaviour but instead required participants to focus on the confederates' photograph descriptions in order to later perform a recognition test. A <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> effect was found, with higher MEPs during stimulus video observation than during a fixation-cross baseline, {{regardless of whether or not}} the confederate was carrying out a behaviour at the time of the pulse. When controlling for this <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> effect, results showed that MEPs during observation of the larger two behaviours were significantly higher than the smaller two behaviours, irrespective of effector. Thus, by using a controlled yet naturalistic paradigm, this study suggests that general sensorimotor arousal during social interactions could play a role in implicit behavioural mimicry...|$|E

50|$|The first basic {{principle}} of MPR is arousal. Arousal {{refers to the}} activation of behavior by the presentation of incentives. An increase in activity level following repeated presentations of incentives is a fundamental aspect of conditioning. Killeen, Hanson, and Osborne (1978) proposed that adjunctive (or schedule induced) behaviors are normally occurring parts of an organism's repertoire. Delivery of incentives increases the rate of adjunctive behaviors by generating a heightened level of <b>general</b> activity, or <b>arousal,</b> in organisms.|$|R
50|$|Cognitive {{processing}} {{is subject}} to global modulatory parameters, which adjust the cognitive resources of the system to the environmental and internal situation.

40|$|Many {{cost-benefit}} decisions {{reduce to}} simple choices between approach or avoidance (or active disregard) to salient stimuli. Physiologically, critical factors in such decisions are modulators of the homeostatic neural networks that bias decision processes from moment to moment. For the predatory sea-slug Pleurobranchaea, serotonin (5 -HT) is an intrinsic modulatory promoter of <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> and feeding. We correlated 5 -HT actions on appetitive state with {{its effects on}} the approach-avoidance decision in Pleurobranchaea. 5 -HT and its precursor 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP) augmented <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> state and reduced feeding thresholds in intact animals. Moreover, 5 -HT switched the turn response to chemosensory stimulation from avoidance to orienting in many animals. In isolated CNSs, bath application of 5 -HT both stimulated activity in the feeding motor network and switched the fictive turn response to unilateral sensory nerve stimulation from avoidance to orienting. Previously, it was shown that increasing excitation state of the feeding network reversibly switched the turn motor network response from avoidance to orienting, and that 5 -HT levels vary inversely with nutritional state. A simple model posits a critical role for 5 -HT {{in control of the}} turn network response by corollary output of the feeding network. In it, 5 -HT acts as an intrinsic neuromodulatory factor coupled to nutritional status and regulates approach-avoidance via the excitation state of the feeding network. Thus, the neuromodulator is a key organizing element in behavioral choice of approach or avoidance through its actions in promoting appetitive state, in large part via th...|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} proposed Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) system defines psychopathologies as {{phenomena of}} multilevel neurobiological existence and assigns them to 5 behavioural domains characterizing a brain in action. We performed {{an analysis on}} this contemporary concept of psychopathologies in respect to a brain phylogeny and biological substrates of psychiatric diseases. We found that the RDoC system uses biological determinism to explain the pathogenesis of distinct psychiatric symptoms and emphasises exploration of endophenotypes but not of complex diseases. Therefore, as a possible framework for experimental studies it allows one to evade a major challenge of translational studies of strict disease-to-model correspondence. The system conforms {{with the concept of}} a normality and pathology continuum, therefore, supports basic studies. The units of analysis of the RDoC system appear as a novel matrix for model validation. The <b>general</b> regulation and <b>arousal,</b> positive valence, negative valence, and social interactions behavioural domains of the RDoC system show basic construct, network, and phenomenological homologies between human and experimental animals. The nature and complexity of the cognitive behavioural domain of the RDoC system deserve further clarification.

40|$|International audienceSexual {{activity}} involves excitement {{with high}} arousal and pleasure as typical features of emotions. Brain activations specifically related to erotic feelings and {{those related to}} general emotional processing are therefore hard to disentangle. Using fMRI in 21 healthy subjects (11 males and 10 females), we investigated regions that show activations specifically related to the viewing of sexually intense pictures while controlling for <b>general</b> emotional <b>arousal</b> (GEA) or pleasure. Activations in the ventral striatum and hypothalamus {{were found to be}} modulated by the stimulus' specific sexual intensity (SSI) while activations in the anterior cingulate cortex were associated with an interaction between sexual intensity and emotional valence. In contrast, activation in other regions like the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the mediodorsal thalamus and the amygdala was associated only with a general emotional component during sexual arousal. No differences were found in these effects when comparing females and males.

40|$|The present {{work was}} {{concerned}} with changes in subjective interval timing in conditions of elevated temperature and physical exercise. It has been proven by previous studies that subjective time perception is prone to acceleration when exposed to these conditions, but that a process of acclimatization may mitigate this effect. In light of this, an experimental study consisting of two capacity tests and an eight-day acclimation training program was conducted, in which test subjects went through treadmill exercise in a controlled climate chamber. The objective {{of the study was}} to find out which of the parameters of the training were adequate predictors of the adaption of subjective time perception and whether <b>general</b> mood <b>arousal</b> has an influence on the acceleration effect. The results of the study also demonstrated the adaption effect. From the training parameters, heart rate was most associated with adaption.

40|$|The {{organization}} of the brain serotonergic system {{appears to have been}} highly conserved across the vertebrate subphylum. In fish as well as in other vertebrates, brain serotonin (5 -HT), mainly acts as a neuromodulator with complex effects on multiple functions. It is becoming increasingly clear that acute and chronic increase in brain 5 -HT neurotransmission have very different effects. An acute 5 -HT activation, which is seen in both winners and losers of agonistic interactions, could be related to a <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> effect, whereas the chronic activation observed in subordinate fish is clearly linked to the behavioral inhibition displayed by these individuals. Fish displaying divergent stress coping styles (proactive vs. reactive) differ in 5 -HT functions. In teleost fish, brain monoaminergic function is also related to life history traits...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} make rapid and {{accurate}} decisions based on limited sensory information is {{a critical component of}} visual cognition. Available evidence suggests that simple perceptual discriminations are based on the accumulation and integration of sensory evidence over time. However, the memory system(s) mediating this accumulation are unclear. One candidate system is working memory (WM), which enables the temporary maintenance of information in a readily accessible state. Here, we show that individual variability in WM capacity is strongly correlated with the speed of evidence accumulation in speeded two-alternative forced choice tasks. This relationship generalized across different decision-making tasks, and could not be easily explained by variability in <b>general</b> <b>arousal</b> or vigilance. Moreover, we show that performing a difficult discrimination task while maintaining a concurrent memory load has a deleterious effect on the latter, suggesting that WM storage and decision making are directly linked...|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The escape {{swimming}} {{pattern generator}} of the notaspid opisthobranch Pleurobranchaea drives a high threshold, override behavior. The pattern generator is integrated with neural networks of other behaviors {{so as to}} coordinate unitary behavioral expression and to promote <b>general</b> behavioral <b>arousal.</b> These functions are separately produced by different swim network elements. One set of swim premotor neurons, the A 1 /A 10 ensemble, A 3 and IVS, generate the swim pattern and, through corollary activity, suppress potentially conflicting feeding behavior by exerting broad inhibition at major feeding network interneurons. A second set of swim neurons, the serotonergic As 1 – 4 neurons, provides intrinsic neuromodu-latory excitation to the swim pattern generator that sustains the escape swim ep-isode through multiple cycles. The As 1 – 4 also provide neuromodulatory excitation to important modulatory, serotonergic cells in the feeding motor network and lo-comotor network, and may have a general regulatory role in the distributed se-rotonergic arousal network of the mollusk. The As 1 – 4 appear to be also necessary to both avoidance and orienting turning, and are therefore likely to be critical...|$|R
