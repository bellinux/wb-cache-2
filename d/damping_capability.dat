The optimized power point tracking (OPPT) controller, which shifts the turbine operating point from the {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT) curve to the virtual inertia control (VIC) curves according to the frequency deviation, is proposed to release the “hidden” kinetic energy and provide dynamic frequency support to the grid.

Compared to the conventional supplementary derivative regulator-based inertia control, the proposed control scheme can not only provide fast inertial response, but also increase the system <b>damping</b> <b>capability</b> during transient events. Thus, inertial response and power oscillation damping function can be obtained in a single controller by the proposed OPPT control.

Over the recent years, damping of mechanical vibrations is becoming increasing important to improve the reliability and performance of the aircraft systems and also increase the safety of passengers. As a response to these issues, much effort has been expended in the development and exploitation of damping materials. Among the various damping materials, piezoelectric particulate polymer composite have shown great potential towards damping due to the specialised damping mechanism based on the unique energy transferring effect between the viscoelastic polymer matrix and piezoelectric ceramic filler. As a results, the main objective of the master thesis is to develop a highly flexible and highly voltage sensitive vibration damper with piezoelectric particular composite. Lead free system with sodium potassium niobate (KNN) ceramics doped with lithium is identified has the suitable ceramic filler system applicable for this purpose. Hence, the effect of lithium dopant on dielectric and piezoelectric properties on the structured and random KNN/Epoxy composites is explored in order to identify the optimal ceramic filler composition with the highest dielectric and piezoelectric properties.
