500|$|Poe's {{characterization}} as an uncontrollable alcoholic is disputed. His drinking companion for a time, Thomas Mayne Reid, {{admitted that}} the two engaged in wild [...] "frolics" [...] but that Poe [...] "never went beyond the innocent mirth in which we all indulge... While acknowledging this as one of Poe's failings, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>speak</b> truly of its not being habitual". Some believe Poe had a severe susceptibility to alcohol and became drunk after one glass of wine. He only drank during difficult periods {{of his life and}} sometimes went several months at a time without alcohol. Adding further confusion about the frequency of Poe's use of alcohol was his membership in the Sons of Temperance {{at the time of his}} death. William Glenn, who administered Poe's pledge, wrote years later that the temperance community had no reason to believe Poe had violated his pledge while in Richmond. Suggestions of a drug overdose have also been proven to be untrue, though it is still often reported. Thomas Dunn English, an admitted enemy of Poe and a trained doctor, insisted that Poe was not a drug user. He wrote: [...] "Had Poe the opium habit when I knew him (before 1846) I should both as a physician and a man of observation, have discovered it during his frequent visits to my rooms, my visits at his house, and our meetings elsewhere – I saw no signs of it and believe the charge to be a baseless slander." ...|$|E

They say – a foreigner – he can't even speak English properly. [...] Also I boast! An Englishman he says often, [...] "A fellow who thinks as much of himself as that cannot be worth much." [...] And so, you see, I put people off their guard.|$|E

2500|$|In the George Ryder Stakes at Rosehill on 19 March, she again won at short odds, beating Kermadec {{by one and}} a half lengths. On 2 April, the filly started odds-on {{favourite}} for the A$3 million Doncaster Mile at Randwick despite carrying top {{weight in}} a fifteen-runner field on unsuitably soft ground. She looked unlikely to obtain a clear run in the straight but broke through in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Happy Clapper. Waller commented, [...] "I'll call her a champion while <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>speak.</b> I thought she was beaten at the half-mile. She must have an amazing will to win." ...|$|E

The same thing happens with all these {{people who come to}} see me, and take so much trouble over their efforts to describe themselves to me with strict accuracy; inevitably I form an image of them which derives as much from myself as from them. [...] If they go and see one of my colleagues he will certainly not see them exactly as I do. And they for their part will not show themselves to him in the same way they show themselves to me.|$|E
2500|$|The New Switzerland {{plantation}} was torched {{a second}} time during the Second Seminole War, which began in 1835. In 1836, Fatio moved to St. Augustine. The city was filled with military personnel and refugees from the war, and she found work managing boarding houses with her sister Eliza. Fatio's reputation for fine food and accommodations grew. First-hand accounts, such as Charles Lanman's Adventures in the Wilds of the United States, note her reputation as a hostess: [...] "From personal experience <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>speak</b> of one…of these establishments kept by Miss Fatio, a most estimable and popular lady; and if the others are as home-like and comfortable as this, the ancient city may well be proud of her houses for the accommodation of travelers and invalids." ...|$|E

2500|$|Edmund Burke, an English {{political}} thinker, {{was impressed}} by the work of Barruel in uncovering a connection between the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. Burke wrote a letter to Barruel and expressed his admiration. He wrote, [...] "I cannot easily express to you how much I am instructed and delighted by the first volume of your History of Jacobinism." [...] He praised [...] "the whole of the wonderful narrative" [...] for being supported by documents and proofs with [...] "the most judicial regularity and exactness." [...] At the end of the letter Burke added: [...] "I forgot to say, that I have known myself, personally, five of your principal conspirators; and I can undertake to say from my own certain knowledge, that {{as far back as the}} year 1773, they were busy in the plot you have so well described, and in the manner, and on the principle you have so truly represented. To this <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>speak</b> as a witness." [...] Burkes own works were also filled with references to the philosophe sect and a dislike for their fanaticism, atheism and perversion of public morals.|$|E
