And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E

[...] When I told George and Ringo I'd agreed to that they were going, [...] "What? What if we love it?" [...] It didn't come to that, luckily. I said to Yoko, [...] "Don't impose too many conditions on us, it's really difficult to do this, spiritually. We don't know, we may hate each other after two hours in the studio and just walk out. So don't put any conditions, it's tough enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> 'There are characters for all of you to play.'

Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'" [...] The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse.|$|E

500|$|Producer Kevin Shirley {{was brought}} in {{on the advice of}} Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. [...] As Rich explained, [...] "We really wanted to work with someone who can come in and say, 'That's not good.'... If Kevin says {{something}} I disagree with, he'll {{be the first one to}} say, 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'" [...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them...</b> 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E
2500|$|A puppet {{version of}} Garofalo {{appeared}} (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, {{she was more}} upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. [...] "I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America bothered me, the fact they didn't send me my puppet, that bothered me even more." ...|$|E

2500|$|I learned quite a {{lot from}} him, I must say. I learned that {{you have got to}} work at it. You have to rehearse. When I came back and I got the band (Earth) back together, I made sure that {{everybody}} was up {{early in the morning and}} rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked.

2500|$|The {{group were}} {{supposed}} to meet with producer Eliot Kennedy the week after they left their former managers, but the meeting was arranged by the Herberts weeks before their departure. But without access to Herbert's address book, they knew nothing of Kennedy's whereabouts other than he lived in Sheffield. Brown and Halliwell drove to Sheffield {{the day after the}} departure from Heart Management and looked for the first phone book they came across; Eliot was the third Kennedy that they called. That evening they went to his house and persuaded him to work with them. The rest of the girls travelled to Sheffield the next day. Kennedy commented about the session: [...] "None of them played instruments, so I was left to do the music and get that vibe together. What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. Then they were throwing lines at us. 10 minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process." [...] Two tracks of the album were composed in that session: [...] "Love Thing" [...] and [...] "Say You'll Be There". In the following months the group continued to meet with producers, wrote new songs, prepared demos and searched for a new manager. They met again with the writers Stannard and Rowe. They had previously worked with the girls in January 1995 before their departure from Heart Management; that was the group's first professional songwriting session, held at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, east London.|$|E
5000|$|Being {{recalled}} to Paris, I {{dared to}} call upon Robespierre from the tribune, to make good his accusation. He caused me to be expelled from the Jacobins, of whom he was the high-priest; this was for me equivalent to a decree of proscription. I did not trifle in contending for my head, nor in long and secret deliberations with such of my colleagues as were threatened with my own fate. <b>I</b> merely <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them...</b> 'You are on the list, {{you are on the}} list as well as myself; I am certain of it!' ...|$|R

6000|$|The soldier-spirit in Joan was {{offended}} at this puerility. She drew herself up, and said {{with dignity and}} fire: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> was, 'Ride those English down!' and I did it myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{divorced}} this woman," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> [...] "She is a withered tree, a {{worn out}} old hag, and now I take her {{with me to}} send her to the country of the Swazis, whence she came.

5000|$|... "It's {{important}} for you to hear this... When I grew up, everyone was okay with being in a bubble. They were cool in their circle. That's fine. But no one should discourage someone if they have a dream, if they want something more ...This song was difficult for me to write the lyrics to because it's about my mother and my father, and about the day <b>I</b> <b>said</b> goodbye <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> because <b>I</b> had to go try, and I'm still trying, every day, to become a man.

"I {{have been}} keeping you here, Father, because I doubt not that my mother has been {{breaking}} the news to the girls, of their mother's slaughter. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nought <b>to</b> <b>them</b> about it. They knew the hold was burnt, and I told them that Allan was wounded; but I thought that, if I gave them {{the worst part of}} the news, it would throw them into such deep grief as <b>to</b> unfit <b>them</b> for the journey. It might not have been discovered till two hours after we had started that they had escaped, and in that case we should have been mounted before the Bairds overtook us, {{and it would have been}} a ride for life, and the girls would have needed all their strength and courage <b>to</b> keep <b>them</b> up." ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Gator Flop", {{the play}} allowed the Gators {{to get the}} ball back so Reaves could break the record. On the next drive Reaves would find Carlos Alvarez for a 15-yard gain to break the record, and after the game the entire Gators team jumped into the {{fountain}} at Miami Orange Bowl that was formerly used for the Miami Dolphins' live mascot. Hurricanes coach Fran Curci refused to shake the hand of Gators coach Doug Dickey after the game for pulling [...] "a bush league stunt", though Dickey denied knowledge the flop was coming. Dickey later blamed it on a punt that was ran back earlier in the game. In a 2010 interview, Dickey tried to safe face [...] "I didn't say to lay down, but <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> let <b>'em</b> score." [...] and later told players [...] "But at least try to block the extra point.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All day we held our position, killing great numbers, but losing {{many men}} ourselves. By night, our water was exhausted.

6000|$|... "Yes, such English as I do; {{but that}} is not as the white sahibs speak it. We who have learned it speak the right word, but not in the right way. I have seen young white ladies, when they first came out here, and came to the house of your mother, {{sometimes}} smile and scarcely understand what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> It is not like that that you must talk English--good enough for an ayah, not good enough for a sahib--so we have decided, Sufder, Ramdass and I, that you must go down to Bombay, and learn to talk proper English.|$|E
6000|$|The news of Lodovico's advance threw consternation {{into the}} town, and when cartloads of {{provisions}} were brought in, and the fortifications worked at day and night, the brave citizens began to quake and tremble.

As I walked through the streets, I noticed that the whole populace was distinctly paler....

6000|$|In a word, they {{concluded}} all, by my advice, that our business was to cruise for anything we could see.

I am insisting on the normal character of these phenomena. Whatever happens to-night, Mrs. Miller, please do not be alarmed. There is nothing inherently uncanny or unwholesome in these phenomena. No one knows better than your husband the essential mystery of the simplest fact. Materialization, for example, is unusual; but if it happens it cannot be supernatural. Nothing is supernatural.

6000|$|... "My friends," [...] he said, [...] "you know me. I put the {{interests}} of Kentucky before my own. Last year when I left to represent her at Williamsburg there were some who said I would desert her.

60|$|I was so wet when I {{got back}} to Mitchell's towards the evening, that I had simply to divest myself of my shoes, socks, and trousers, and leave them behind {{for the benefit of}} New York city.
