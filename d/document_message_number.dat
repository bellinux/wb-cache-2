40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWe constructed an Intelligent Computer Assisted Instruction (ICAI) program to tutor {{the usage of}} the TOPS 20 -MM, an electronic mail facility available on the Defense Data Network (DDN). Learning by experience {{is one of the}} best ways to learn something. The main strategy of tutoring in this thesis was to provide an environment simulating the actual facility that guides the student while he/she tries to perform given tasks. Means-ends analysis, a classic technique for solving search problems in Artificial Intelligence, has been used to figure out the right command to perform a given task. Basic commands, e. g. a command for viewing a <b>message</b> <b>number</b> 7, will be taught first, then the tasks like "Send a message to the people mentioned in <b>message</b> <b>number</b> 3 " will be issued.

30|$|The {{semantic}} of {{the group}} insight in this context can be emphasized by mapping the intentions and external pressure in formalized models of the experience (which could be a database or a knowledge base). Projection semantics (formal semantics interpretation) can be expressed by mapping unformalized concepts (phenomenon or events) into mathematical constructions (for example, logic, programs, or sets). The concepts must be mapped into the mathematical constructions or sets of objects (i.e., <b>documents,</b> <b>messages,</b> or comments) for each modeling method. This is particularly true in cognitive modeling, where the model consists of unformalized concepts and their connections.|$|R
50|$|Service {{granularity}} is both {{an application}} domain concern (business granularity), {{as well as a}} software interface design issue (technical granularity); it is a property of the service contract exposed by a service provider. It pertains to the semantics and syntax of the in (request) and out (response) message content, which can be viewed as instances of two general Enterprise Integration Patterns, Command <b>Message</b> and <b>Document</b> <b>Message.</b> By definition a coarse-grained service operation has broader scope than a fine-grained service, although the terms are relative. The former typically requires increased design complexity but can reduce the number of calls required to complete a task.|$|R
