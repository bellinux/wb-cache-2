As late as the 1880s, a fruit bunch of seven or more hands was considered a 'first,' meaning that it received the highest going market price. Bunches with six or fewer hands were second or third grade fruit for which growers generally received less money. By the 1890s, shippers such as the Boston Fruit Company were raising the standard 'bunch count' to eight and nine hands, a shift that favored varieties such as the Gros Michel that tended to produce high bunch counts when grown under favorable agroecological conditions. Increasingly, fruit graders discounted and/or rejected seven- and six-hand bunches particularly during seasonal lulls in demand.

40|$|Processing tomato {{crops are}} {{mechanically}} harvested {{from a single}} destructive harvest. The timing of this harvest {{to coincide with the}} maximum yield of factory <b>grade</b> <b>fruit</b> is of considerable importance to the efficiency of the field operation. There is a lack of information regarding where the factory <b>grade</b> <b>fruit</b> is produced on the plant and for how long the yield of factory <b>grade</b> <b>fruit</b> is maintained at its maximum level in the field. Two experiments were carried out in the Manawatu using the processing cultivars Castlehye 1204 Improved and UC 82 B. The first experiment determined the time of flowering of all the flowers on the plant, the trusses in which these flowers were to be found and the position of these trusses on the plant. 132 days after planting all the plants were harvested and the number and position on the plant of the flowers which set fruit was determined. A normal distribution was found to satisfactorily describe the relationship between the number of flowers reaching anthesis and time. Plants on average carried up to 37 trusses. 65 % of the yield was carried on the first 10 trusses to flower with 95 % of the yield carried on the first 20 trusses to flower. The efficiency of trusses in producing fruit varied from 66 % with the earlier flowering trusses down to negligible levels. Plants had up to 8 main order laterals and together with their attached sub laterals each carried from 4 - 5 trusses. The efficiency of flowering decreased with the position of the truss up the lateral. It was suggested that the competition between trusses for assimilates is far more important within laterals than between laterals. These results have implications for both crop management and plant breeding programmes. In the second experiment 9 successional destructive harvests were carried out commencing {{at the first sign of}} coloured fruit. Ethryl was not applied to the crop. The yield of red and factory <b>grade</b> <b>fruit</b> was found to peak sharply over time. The normal distribution curve was found to satisfactorily describe the relationship between time and the yield of both red and factory <b>grade</b> <b>fruit</b> and fruit numbers of these <b>grades</b> of <b>fruit.</b> Harvesting one week earlier or one week later than the optimum harvest date resulted in a loss of factory <b>grade</b> <b>fruit</b> of from 10 - 15 tonnes per hectare. The major cause for this rapid fall in yield from the optimum was due to an increase in the yield of red rotten fruit. In fact over half of the total number of fruit had rotted by 136 days after planting. This included a significant number of green fruit. The magnitude of this loss was only apparent because successional harvests were carried out. The total yield of <b>fruit</b> (all <b>grades)</b> was maintained over a considerable period as the loss in fruit numbers was balanced by the increase in mean fruit weight of the crop. The mean fruit weight of fruit did not increase once they had coloured. The percent soluble solids of red fruit decreased the week following any significant amount of rainfall. In the light of this research the effect of ethryl on the maturity characteristics of processing tomato crops needs to be re-examined by the use of successional harvests. Reliable techniques also need to be developed to predict the time of optimum harvest as these results suggest that it is much shorter than is commonly thought. The importance of fruit rots in reducing yields and thus effecting the length of the optimum harvest period is also apparent and is another area of research which requires further study. In the first experiment, the Normal Distribution Curve was found to describe the frequency of flower anthesis versus time relationship in two processing tomato cultivars; Castlehye 1204 Improved and UC 82 B. Early fruit setting flowers acted as a strong sink as 90 % of the final yield was carried on the first 18 trusses. Yield contributing trusses followed a pattern of increasing distance from the root system the later they flowered. Competition for photosynthate was mainly within laterals but also there was some between lateral competition. Flower trusses exhibited decreasing efficiencies in producing red fruit the later first flower anthesis occurred on the flower truss. In the second experiment, the yield of Factory <b>Grade</b> tomato <b>fruit</b> from the same two processing tomato cultivars peaked sharply over time. Harvesting one week earlier or later than the optimum harvest date resulted in a Factory Grade yield loss of up to 10 - 15 t ha- 1 for both cultivars. The Normal Distribution Curve was found to describe the relationship between Factory <b>Grade</b> <b>fruit</b> weight and number over time for both cultivars. Both red and coloured fruit weight were also found to follow the Normal Distribution. Over half of the total number of fruit rotted by 136 days after planting.

Total US sale of organic food was about $ 13. 8 billion for 2005, and is growing at near 20 % annually (OTA, 2006). Fresh fruits and vegetables are the largest category of organic food sales (Dimitri and Greene, 2002). The state of Washington is the leading state in organic apple production, accounting for about 38 % of total US organic apple acres. Certified Washington State organic apple acreage increased from well below 500 total acres in the late 1980 s to 7, 642 acres in 2006 with an additional 4, 100 acres in the transition process. Pear is another major fruit grown in Washington, occupying about one third of national acreage. Certified organic pear acreage is 1, 251 acres with 276 acres in transition (Granatstein, Kirby and Feise, 2007). Due to the reasons we have discussed in the last report (Wang and Ge, 2006), the organic apple and pear certified acreages dropped since their peaks in 2002 and with {{a slight increase in}} 2006 for apples (Granatstein and Kirby, 2006).

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} the Karapoti brown sandy loam soil during the 1995 - 96 season on the Horticultural Field Plots at the Plant Growth Unit, Massey University. The objective of the research was to study the effect of black plastic mulch with fertigation and fabric row covers on crop growth, yield, quality and maturity of processing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Cleo). The rowcover (RC) treatment advanced by 2 days both the date of first flowering and 50 % flower opening compared with no RC. There were no RC effects on growth during the first 8 weeks in the field. RC reduced the yield and number of factory <b>grade</b> <b>fruit</b> at optimum harvest. Thus the treatment was detrimental. These results suggested that the use of floating covers during early summer in New Zealand will cause fruit setting to be reduced by high temperatures (> 30 °C). Bad weather delayed planting and resulted in relatively short use of the RC. If planting had taken place three weeks earlier, as planned, then RC may have improved earliness and not had a detrimental effect on yield. These results confirmed that the timing of rowcover application is critical for its successful use. The nutrient concentrations in leaves of mulched plants maintained higher levels of N P K during establishment. During the period of the fruit swelling (28 - 91 days after transplanting) the nutrient levels in the leaves fell markedly. The leaf analysis data in this experiment suggests that N and P had an important role in improving early growth and fruit set and as a result increased fruit number and yield. The results of this study showed that black plastic mulch plus fertigation provided for improvements in the early growth (relative growth rate) and development (number of flower clusters) and yield of total, red and factory <b>grade</b> <b>fruit</b> for the processing tomato cv Cleo. The optimum harvest time occurred 114 days after transplanting. Fertigation made a major contribution to the increase in yield. With cultivar Cleo the number and yield of factory <b>grade</b> and red <b>fruit</b> followed a normal distribution curve. This showed that advancing or delaying harvest by one week significantly reduced yield and it is suggested that the timing of harvest of processing tomatoes is more crucial than is commonly believed.

These valuable data was inserted into Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) through Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). This method was the most suitable for forecasting the model data. The result shows that the classification result from the system achieved 85 % accuracy. The grading system using these method can be applied to grade accurately varieties of fruits for domestic and export market...|$|R
