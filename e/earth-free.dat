40|$|When {{using the}} {{conventional}} diathermy generator in surgery failure {{to apply the}} plate electrode can always present a serious risk of a thermoelectrical burn at any point where the patient makes contact with an earthed object on the operating table. The recent introduction of the <b>earth-free</b> (isolated circuit) diathermy should, under most conditions, provide complete protection against such risks. However, there are still certain circumstances under which even the isolated circuit may {{give rise to a}} thermoelectrical burn. Two such hypothetical examples are described; the sequences of events for these are fairly frequent occurrence...|$|E
40|$|Australia has an {{electricity}} {{mains supply}} that differs {{from those of}} most countries. Safety standards relating to both the mains supply and mains-powered apparatus also differ. This paper describes the mechanism of electric shock and methods of shock protection — core-balance relays, protected <b>earth-free</b> supplies and equipotential earthing are considered. Australian safety standards as applied to earthed mains-powered apparatus are summarized. Particular attention is given to class A and B treatment areas and electromedical apparatus having a patient circuit. Class A, B and Z patient circuits are described...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{there has}} been no {{evidence}} for the macroscopic structural phase transition to the low temperature tetragonal structure (LTT) with a space group P 42 /ncm in high-TC cuprate of rare <b>earth-free</b> La 2 -xSrxCuO 4 (LSCO). By investigating Cu-NMR on single crystals, we have found that spatially incoherent LTT structure emerges below 50 K in the sample with x= 0. 12. This incoherent structure is considered to play a key role for the slight depression of the superconductivity around x= 1 / 8. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures, proceeding of LEHTSC 2007, to appear in J. Phys. : Conf. Serie...|$|E
40|$|An {{in-house}} {{finite element}} modelling package {{is used to}} simulate the electrical response of core–shell microstructures of BaTiO 3 -based (BT) dielectric materials as a design strategy for multilayer ceramic capacitors. By combining this method with experimental material properties, both the temperature coefficient of capacitance (TCC) and the volume ratio of undoped BT ceramic (core phase) to chemically doped BT ceramic (shell phase) to optimise temperature stability can be predicted. This is a faster, more reliable and efficient design strategy than current techniques {{which are based on}} iterative experimental protocols. This methodology is illustrated using rare <b>earth-free</b> NaNbO 3 -doped BT (NNBT) ceramics as an example for which we predict and experimentally confirm an optimised volume fraction ratio of 0. 66 undoped BT core to 0. 34 of a 2. 5 % NNBT shell...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} worldwide {{energy consumption}} {{calls for the}} design of more efficient energy systems. Thermoelectrics could be used to convert waste heat back to useful electric energy if only more efficient materials were available. The ideal thermoelectric material combines high electrical conductivity and thermopower with low thermal conductivity. In this regard, the intermetallic type-I clathrates show promise with their exceedingly low lattice thermal conductivities [1]. Here we report the successful incorporation of cerium as guest atom into the clathrate crystal structure. In many simpler intermetallic compounds, this rare earth element is known to lead, via the Kondo interaction, to strong correlation phenomena including the ocurrence of giant thermopowers at low temperatures [2]. Indeed, we observe a 50 % enhancement of the thermopower compared to a rare <b>earth-free</b> reference material. Importantly, this enhancement occurs at high temperatures and we suggest that a `rattling' enhanced Kondo interaction [3] underlies this effect. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the growing}} rate of global wind power and overall {{benefits}} of the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbines, the future demand for high-performing NdFeB magnet and its constituent elements is likely to increase. Future deployment of wind power generation may be affected by potential disruptions in supply and price rises of critical rare earth elements. By evaluating the substitution options for the rare earths permanent magnet-based wind turbines at the material and component levels, this paper shows that substitution has a real potential to alleviate {{the pressure on the}} supply of rare earths in the wind industry. Rare <b>earth-free</b> turbines with good efficiency levels were already developed and could be further adopted. Alternatively, the future demand for rare earths, in particular for dysprosium, could be reduced by improving material efficiency. The future market share of rare earth-based wind turbines will most likely depend on the evolution of the price of rare earths and the techno-economic advantages of PMSG in comparison to alternative technologies that use no rare earths elements.

40|$|The nanoanalytical high {{resolution}} TEM/STEM {{investigation of the}} intergranular grain boundary phase of anisotropic sintered and rapidly quenched heavy rare <b>earth-free</b> Nd-Fe-B magnet materials revealed a difference in composition for grain boundaries parallel (large Fe-content) and perpendicular (low Fe content) to the alignment direction. This behaviour vanishes in magnets {{with a high degree}} of misorientation. The numerical finite element micromagnetic simulations are based on the anisotropic compositional behaviour of GBs and show a decrease of the coercive field with an increasing thickness of the grain boundary layer. The magnetization reversal and expansion of reversed magnetic domains primarily start as Bloch domain wall at grain boundaries parallel to the c-axis and secondly as Néel domain wall perpendicular to the c-axis into the adjacent hard magnetic grains. The increasing misalignment of grains leads to the loss of the anisotropic compositional behaviour and therefore to an averaged value of the grain boundary composition. In this case the simulations show an increase of the coercive field compared to the anisotropic magnet. The calculated coercive field values of the investigated magnet samples are in the order of μ 0 HcJ= 1. 8 [*]T– 2. 1 [*]T for a mean grain boundary thickness of 4 [*]nm, which agrees perfectly with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Population {{regulation}} {{results from}} an interplay of numerous intrinsic and external factors, {{and for many}} insects cannibalism is such a factor. This study confirms a previously-reported observation that sublethal exposure to the fossilized remains of diatoms (i. e. diatomaceous earth) increases net fecundity (eggs produced minus eggs destroyed/day) of flour beetles, Tribolium confusum. The aim was to experimentally test two non-mutually-exclusive ecological mechanisms potentially responsible for the increased net fecundity: higher egg production and lower egg cannibalism. Adult T. confusum were maintained at low or high density in medium containing sublethal (0 - 4 %) diatomaceous earth. Net fecundity increased up to 2. 1 × control values during diatomaceous earth exposure, and returned to control levels following removal from diatomaceous earth. Cannibalism assays on adults showed that diatomaceous earth {{reduced the number of}} eggs produced to 0. 7 × control values at low density and to 0. 8 × controls at high density, and also reduced egg cannibalism rates of adults to as little as 0. 4 × control values, but at high density only. Diatomaceous earth also reduced cannibalism by larvae on eggs to 0. 3 × control values. So, while the presence of diatomaceous earth reduced egg production, net fecundity increased as a result of strong suppression of the normal egg cannibalism by adults and larvae that occurs at high beetle density. Undisturbed cultures containing sublethal diatomaceous earth concentrations reached higher population densities than diatomaceous <b>earth-free</b> controls. Cohort studies on survival from egg to adult indicated that this population increase was due largely to decreased egg cannibalism by adult females. This is the first report of inhibition of egg cannibalism by diatomaceous earth on larval or adult insects. The ability of diatomaceous earth to alter cannibalism behavior without causing mortality makes it an ideal investigative tool for cannibalism studies...|$|E
40|$|Typical {{lighting}} {{systems such as}} incandescent and fluorescent bulbs are common in homes but are rather inefficient compared to the newer light emitting diodes (LEDs). LED-based lamps can be constructed to generate white light by combining a red, green, and blue LED, or by using an LED light source (typically with a low wavelength) with a complimentary phosphor coating to produce white light. The latter, known as phosphor-conversion (PC) LEDs, is {{the primary focus of}} this research, looking specifically at rare <b>earth-free</b> options for these phosphor coatings. Anti-perovskites are a potential lattice type for this type of conversion, in particular the A 3 MO 4 F (A= Sr, Ba, Ca; M= Al, Ga) tetragonal structure. Photoluminescence has been observed in the Sr 3 AlO 4 F system upon doping with various lanthanides, but rare earth metals are expensive, scarce due to increased use in new technologies, and their mining process introduces toxins into the environment. Focusing on doping without rare earth metals will prove beneficial as people are becoming more conscientious of their carbon footprint and new dopants will lower the cost for the consumer. Isovalent and aliovalent doping on the Sr 3 AlO 4 F lattice has been demonstrated on the A site (Sr), and this proven technique has introduced many rare earth trivalent cation ions as successful dopants. Doping on the M site (Al) is less studied but various non-rare earth (RE) cations such as Ga 3 +, Si 4 +, and In 3 + have been incorporated on this site, making this site the primary focus of this thesis. The specific cations investigated are P 5 +, Y 3 +, and Hf 4 + to expand the range of isovalent dopants and determine if aliovalent doping can be achieved on this site. High temperature synthesis was used to synthesize the novel products Sr 2. 5 -xBa 0. 5 Al 1 -xPxO 4 F, Sr 3 -xAl 1 -xYxO 4 F, andSr_(2. 5 -x/ 2) Ba_ 0. 5 Al_(1 -x) Hf_x O_ 4 F. The structures of these oxyfluorides were analyzed via powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD), and their photoluminescent properties were analyzed through spectrofluorimetry before and after being treated under reducing conditions...|$|E
