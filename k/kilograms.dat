5|$|The {{total biomass}} of wild trout in Scotch Run in its upper reaches is 2.98 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare. 2.93 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare come from brook trout (2.42 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare {{of which are}} less than 175 {{millimeters}} long and 0.51 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare of which are more than 175 millimeters long). The remaining 0.05 <b>kilograms</b> per hectare come from brown trout, {{all of which are}} less than 175 millimeters long. This segment of the stream contains 66 brook trout less than 175 millimeters long and 3 brook trout more than 175 millimeters long per kilometer. It contains only three brown trout per kilometer, all less than 175 millimeters long. There are 174 brook trout per hectare, 166 of which are less than 175 millimeters long and eight brown trout per hectare, all of which are less than 175 millimeters long.|$|E
5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI base unit that {{relied on a}} specific physical artefact, the international prototype of the kilogram (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard <b>kilograms</b> with the IPK. After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype <b>kilograms</b> was observed.|$|E

5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in <b>kilograms</b> is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in <b>kilograms,</b> using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E

He also holds a South Australian record for a 31.2 <b>kilogram</b> mulloway caught on 6 <b>kilogram</b> line in 1986.

50|$|The {{watt-hour}} per <b>kilogram</b> (SI abbreviation: W⋅h/kg) is a unit {{of specific}} energy commonly {{used to measure the}} density of energy in batteries and capacitors. One watt-hour per <b>kilogram</b> is equal to 3600 joules per <b>kilogram.</b>|$|R
5|$|Einsteinium has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission that results in a low {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 <b>kilograms</b> for a bare sphere of 254Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel neutron reflector, or even to 2.26 <b>kilograms</b> with a 20cm thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare 254Es isotope.|$|E
5|$|Key {{protein sources}} include birds and tenrecs. Mikea adults and {{children}} of both sexes use clubs to kill the small tenrec (tambotrika, 0.4 <b>kilograms),</b> which is widespread year round, and the larger one (tandraka, 2-3 <b>kilograms),</b> which is mainly caught during the rainy season. To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E
5|$|Mature bulls {{can weigh}} up to 800 <b>kilograms</b> (1,800pounds) and cows can weigh up to 500 <b>kilograms</b> (1,100pounds). Cows {{typically}} have {{a height of}} 90–106centimeters (3–3.5ft), and bulls are typically {{in the range of}} 106–120centimeters (3.5–4ft). Mating occurs throughout the year with a gestation period of approximately 277–290 days. Most commonly a single calf is born, but twins are not unknown. Sexual maturity is reached at about eighteen months. Highland cattle also have a longer expected lifespan than most other breeds of cattle, up to 20 years.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{by-products}} at Rjukan was {{the production}} of heavy water—a key component in nuclear weapons, and necessary for the Germany designs as a moderator. The hydrogen plant at Vemork was the first mass producer of heavy water, and in 1939 IG Farben, who owned 25% of Norsk Hydro at the time, asked to import five liters of heavy water, but was denied {{due to lack of}} an export license. In 1939–40 production at Vemork was 20 <b>kilograms,</b> by 1942 production had increased to five <b>kilograms</b> per day.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} prototype metre and kilogram {{were both}} {{made from a}} 90%platinum, 10%iridium alloy which is exceptionally hard and which has good electrical and thermal conductivity properties. The prototype had a special X-shaped (Tresca) cross section to minimise the effects of torsional strain during length comparisons. and the prototype <b>kilograms</b> were cylindrical in shape. The London firm Johnson Matthey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype <b>kilograms.</b> At {{the first meeting of}} the CGPM in 1889 bar No.6 and cylinder No.X were accepted as the international prototypes. The remainder were either kept as BIPM working copies or distributed to member states as national prototypes.|$|E
5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} was {{the only}} SI base unit that relied on a specific artefact. After the 1996–1998 recalibrations a clear divergence between the international and various national prototype <b>kilograms</b> was observed.|$|E

5|$|When {{the scale}} of the {{divergence}} between the IPK and national <b>kilogram</b> prototypes was reported in 2005, a debate arose on how best to redefine the <b>kilogram</b> – should the <b>kilogram</b> be defined in terms of the mass of the silicon-28 atom or should it be determined using the watt balance? The mass of a silicon atom could be determined using the Avogadro project and using Avogadro's number be linked directly to the <b>kilogram.</b>|$|R

5|$|Charles Ssekyaaya participated on Uganda's behalf in the men's 62 {{kilogram}} weightlifting discipline. He was 18 {{years old}} and had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Ssekyaaya qualified for the Games after receiving a wildcard from the International Weightlifting Federation after achieving a 28th-place finish in the Africa Olympic Qualifiers. His event took place on 31 July, and included 14 athletes in total. During the event's snatch phase, Ssekyaaya was given three attempts. He successfully attempted to lift over 90 <b>kilograms</b> of weight in his first two attempts, but did not achieve this objective on the third attempt. Ssekyaaya then attempted 130 <b>kilograms</b> during the clean and jerk phrase of the event, successfully lifting it on his first attempt. He did not succeed in lifting 135 <b>kilograms</b> on his second attempt, or 140 on his third. Overall, the combination of Ssekyaaya's highest scores in snatch (105) and clean and jerk (130) yielded a score of 235 points. He ranked 13th in the event, ahead of Stevick Patris from Palau (234 points) and behind Tuau Lapua Lapua of Tuvalu (243 points). Ssekyaaya was 92 points behind the gold medallist Kim Un-guk from North Korea.|$|E
