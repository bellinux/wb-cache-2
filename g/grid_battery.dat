In our setting, PV generated electricity {{is used to}} supply the demand from loads: on the one hand, if there is surplus PV generation, it is stored in a battery (as long as the battery is not fully charged), which has a fixed maximum charging/discharging rate; on the other hand, if the PV generation and battery discharging cannot meet the demand, electricity is purchased from the grid. Our objective is to choose an appropriate battery size while minimizing the electricity purchase cost from the grid. More specifically, {{we want to find}} a unique critical value (denoted as E c max) of the battery size such that the cost of electricity purchase remains the same if the battery size is larger than or equal to E c max, and the cost is strictly larger otherwise. We propose an upper bound on E c max, and show that the upper bound is achievable for certain scenarios. For the case with ideal PV generation and constant loads, we characterize the exact value of E c max, and also show how the storage size changes as the constant load changes; these results are validated via simulations.

The PV can simultaneously feed-in the excess power to the grid and supply the loads. The battery is used as storage of cheaper-to-buy off peak grid energy dependent on the time-of-use (TOU) electricity tariff whilst the DG is a backup power source. The objective function of model is to minimize energy and fuel cost while maximizing PV energy trade-off for incentives. The TOU is an important control parameter in the model. The power flows from each source are the control variables.

Next, an in depth cost analysis is done for each technology, so they can be compared on a total cost of ownership (#/kWh cycled) basis.

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} {{we are facing}} the power cut {{problems}} due to increasing demand of electricity, due {{to the development of}} industrial automation that requires huge power. Multinational companies (MNCs) also need certain Mega Watt (MW) interruption free power supply. This means that we may experience power cut much more than 60 % in the short future. To compensate this power demand, power production through hybrid energy harvesting from piezoelectric material, rotational solar panel(sun tracking) and vertical axis wind turbine methods are used. These concepts can be used separately or combined depending upon electric power requirement. This project is used to power up the domestic houses and to power up the street lights in two-way roads. Piezoelectric materials are integrated and placed beneath the road for a particular distance from the street light. Due to mechanical stress produced by the vehicle, piezoelectric material produces electrical energy which is then it is stored in <b>grid</b> <b>battery.</b> In Rotational solar panel method, pendulum concept is used to rotate the solar panel to track the sun. The aim of this is to get the maximum energy with little use of solar panel. This model has an escapement wheel and a pendulum. A hanging weight transfers energy to an escapement wheel, which is released periodically by a swinging pendulum. So that the panel attached to shaft tracks the sun. Power produced from this is also stored in the same battery through charge controller. Vertical axis wind turbine is placed between the two way roads. Opposite motion of vehicle on two ways road induces a rotational force on the turbine which in turn produces an electric power. This power is also stored in the same battery. The battery is then discharged to power up the street lights. Same set up is built on the roof top of the houses, so that hybrid energy produced from these is used to power the domestic houses. This idea makes the domestic houses and street light to be independent of Electricity Board power supply...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{processes of}} forming the active materials in a lead-acid storage battery have been thoroughly examined. However, {{the mechanism of}} formation is not clear as yet. Based on observations of the electrochemical polarization in a cylindrical mass of litharge, one of the present authors (1) clearly showed that the polarization was largely dependent on the potential gradient produced in the mass. Thus, it was shown that negative polarization began to develop from a region near the positive end of the cylindrical mass, while positive polarization began to develop from {{the interior of the}} mass. Simon and Jones (2, 3) have studied the structural changes oc-curring during the electrochemical formation of posi-tive active material, and they showed that the micro-structure depended on the condition under which the active materials were formed.

The battery places {{an important role in}} storing renewable energy and power purchased from the grid markets, for green and cost-effective energy consumption. There is a lack of study in the existing literature on quantifying the role and cost tradeoff of rightsizing the battery for energy store in a cloud datacenter. In this paper, our goal is to obtain a thorough understanding on the tradeoffs between battery’s contribution in energy storage and its provisioning cost, in order to gain useful insights for battery rightsizing in cloud datacenters with arbitrary energy demand and time-varying renewable energy generation. We further consider different pricing schemes of the smart grids, including constant pricing, dynamic real-time pricing and two-timescale pricing. Under each pricing scheme, we formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization model that minimizes the long-run operational cost of a datacenter, and derive adaptive, optimal control policies that guide power purchase from the smart <b>grid</b> and <b>battery</b> charge/discharge efficiently.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{implementation of}} intermittent {{renewable energy sources}} into the power system brings challenges in terms of grid stability, power quality and security of supply. Traditionally, rotating reserves and thermal power plants based on fossil fuels {{have been used to}} provide balancing services in the grid, but due to an increased focus on sustainable solutions and increasingly demanding climate goals, more environmental friendly solutions must be considered. The main objective of this thesis is to study how battery energy storage can be used to provide the ancillary services of primary and secondary reserves to the grid, in order to help stabilize the grid and support integration of large scale offshore wind power. The system studied in this project consists of an offshore wind farm connected to the grid onshore via a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system. Battery energy storage is connected through a DC/DC converter to the DC-link of the HVDC system. The main focus of the work is related to the battery and the DC/DC converter. A number of battery technologies and DC/DC converter topologies have been studied. It is found that for the application in this project the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery is the optimal choice of battery storage technology. The optimal DC/DC converter is found to be a galvanically bidirectional converter consisting of a modular multilevel converter (MMC) on the high voltage side and a two-level voltage source converter (2 L-VSC) on the low voltage side of the medium frequency coupling transformer, which provides the galvanic isolation. The scope of the thesis consists of two main parts; a design part and a simulation part. In the design part, the design of the different components of the system are discussed in terms of voltage levels, power ratings, number of components, type of components, size and cost. The battery is designed based on ABB's EssPro <b>Grid</b> <b>battery</b> modules and an optimal design for the application in this project in terms of series and parallel connections of battery modules, is proposed. In terms of semiconductor devices for the DC/DC converter, it is found that the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) press-pack devices are preferred over the integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT) for both the MMC and the 2 L-VSC for the converter design in this project. It is also found that for the galvanic isolation of the DC/DC converter, the optimal choice is to have a medium frequency transformer with a frequency of 300 Hz and a turns ratio of 1 : 3. In the simulation part of the scope simulation models of the different parts of the system are developed. The models are implemented in MATLAB and Simulink. The different parts are modeled and verified separately before the final system is created by connecting the different parts. Two simulation cases are performed. In the first case a simulation of the DC/DC converter and the battery is performed. The power flow is controlled to be both positive and negative to verify that the converter provides bidirectional power flow so that the battery can be charged and discharged, depending on the state of charge (SOC). A battery SOC model has been included in the 2 L-VSC model in order to verify that the battery is charging and discharging. The results show that the battery can be charged and discharged and that the proposed DC/DC converter provides bidirectional power flow. The second simulation case also includes the simulation model of the HVDC transmission system, the offshore wind farm and the grid onshore. In this case the power flow of the HVDC system and the DC/DC converter is controlled so that when the wind power generation increases above the constant power consumption onshore of 0. 82 pu, the battery system will charge, and when the wind power generation decreases below 0. 82 pu, the battery system will discharge, in order to provide a constant power flow of 0. 82 pu to the grid onshore. This is simulated to verify that the battery storage can provide balancing services in order to stabilize the grid and support integration of offshore wind power into the power system. The results show that the battery helps stabilize the grid by providing constant power flow to the onshore grid by charging in times when the wind power generation is higher than the power consumption onshore, and by discharging in times when the wind power generation is lower than the power consumption. At the end of the thesis the results of the second simulation case is compared to the same simulation case of a similar system, where the battery storage is connected to the onshore AC-side through an MMC and a transformer. The results show that both DC-side and AC-side connection of the battery storage are possible, and in both cases the battery storage can stabilize the grid and support integration of offshore wind power into the power system...|$|E
