25|$|Merman {{returned}} to Broadway for another Porter musical, {{but despite the}} presence of Jimmy Durante and Bob Hope in the cast, Red, Hot and Blue closed after less than six months. Back in Hollywood, Merman was featured in Happy Landing, one of the top ten box-office hits of 1938 comedy with Sonja Henie, Cesar Romero and Don Ameche; another the box office hit Alexander's Ragtime Band, a pastiche of Irving Berlin songs interpolated into a plot that vaguely paralleled the composer's life; and Straight, Place or Show, a critical and commercial flop starring the Ritz Brothers. She {{returned to}} the stage in Stars <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes,</b> which struggled to survive while the public flocked to the 1939 New York World's Fair instead, and finally closed short of four months. Merman followed this with two more Porter musicals. DuBarry Was a Lady, with Bert Lahr and Betty Grable, ran for a year, and Panama Hattie, with Betty Hutton (whose musical numbers were cut out of the show on opening night at Merman's insistence), June Allyson, and Arthur Treacher, fared even better, lasting slightly more than 14 months.|$|E

The song begins with the lyrics [...] "I got a body full of liquor and a cocaine kicker", during the song [...] "a slew of f-bombs" [...] can be heard, and varied graphic descriptions such as: [...] "You got your legs {{up in the sky}} with the devil <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> / Let me hear you say you want it all" [...] and the chorus [...] "You and me, baby, making love like gorillas!". Overall, the lyrics portray the subject of having a [...] "romantic evening" [...] of making love like wild animals (gorillas), despite being high from cocaine and drunk from liquor. On September 11, 2013, The Daily Telegraph reported that Dannielle Miller, co-founder of Enlighten Education, decided to appeal to mainstream radio in order to ban [...] "Gorilla", due to its sexual and violent lyrics towards women.|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Post {{noted that}} while Doughty's [...] "endearingly anxious inner {{workings}} {{take up a}} large part" [...] of the book, there are also portraits of her three eccentric coworkers at Pacific Interment, who each teach lessons she carries after leaving to attend mortuary school. [...] "What holds Smoke Gets <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> together," [...] the Post said, is Doughty's overarching goal to increase the reader's awareness of their own mortality and face their fear of death, and the book's effective use of humor keeps it from being too sorrowful or gruesome, {{in spite of its}} graphic descriptions. The Boston Globes review of Smoke Gets <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> said that, [...] "If at times Doughty's voice is a bit too breezy ... her observations are solid." [...] The Fredericksburg, Virginia Free Lance-Star said the book was engrossing and [...] "fulfills all its pre-pub hype, jacket blurbs and positive advance reviews". Natalie Kusz wrote in The New York Times Book Review that, [...] "the book is more consequential than its spin potential, [...] more cultural critique than exposé," [...] using Doughty's personal narrative to lead the public to a new relationship with death.|$|E

[...] "I thought, 'No, no, no!'" [...] Ullman praised the BBC for agreeing not to pixelate the character's nipples. [...] "t was very tough to wear those prosthetic breasts and talk to the crew.
