50|$|A T-slot bolt is {{generally}} stronger than a T-slot nut and <b>hex-head</b> cap screw.|$|E
5000|$|Specialized's [...] "S-Works" [...] {{top-level}} racing {{mountain bike}} cranksets use a Hirth joint with a center <b>hex-head</b> threaded rod {{to secure the}} crank halves together.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{telephone}} network connection point with spark-gap overvoltage suppressors. The two brass <b>hex-head</b> objects {{on the left}} cover the suppressors, which act to short overvoltage on the tip or ring lines to ground.|$|E
5000|$|One change {{resulting}} from {{the addition of the}} safety equipment was that the lift-off hardtop on the Bronco was no longer removable from a legal standpoint (as it contained rear-seat seatbelts and the center brake light); to discourage the practice (which was still physically possible), Ford removed all literature in the Bronco owner's manual explaining how to remove the hardtop. To further discourage its removal, the bolts securing the hardtop in place were changed to Torx [...] "tamper proof" [...] bolts, requiring special tools, in place of standard <b>hex-head</b> bolts.|$|E
50|$|A {{climbing}} hold is a shaped grip that {{is usually}} attached to a climbing wall so climbers can grab or step on it. On most walls, climbing holds are arranged in paths, called routes, by specially trained route setters. Climbing holds come in a large array of sizes and shapes to provide different levels of challenge to a climber. Climbing holds are either bolted to a wall via <b>hex-head</b> bolts and existing t-nuts or they are screwed on with several small screws. In extreme cases, concrete anchors may be used (if putting holds {{on the underside of}} a bridge, for example).|$|E
5000|$|Explained by the {{geographical}} and commercial {{history of the}} drive type's development, the term [...] "hex key“ {{is best known as}} Allen in the USA (The “Allen” name is a registered trademark, originated by the Allen Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut circa 1910, and currently owned by Apex Tool Group, LLC), INBUS in Germany (The term “INBUS” is a registered trademark, originated by the German company Bauer & Schaurte in 1934 and currently owned by INBUS IP GmbH, Breckerfeld, Germany) and Unbrako key or wrench in Scandinavia. The synonym zeta key or wrench refers to the sixth letter of the Greek alphabet. The term <b>hex-head</b> is sometimes used to refer to this type of drive, but this use is not consistent with its more conventional use referring to external-wrenching hexagons.|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} forging process {{applied to}} carbon steel {{to form a}} <b>hex-head</b> plug fitting used in thermo-hydraulic applications was studied by means of experimental tests and numerical simulations. The variations of forging parameters necessary to adapt the process to AISI 304 L and DSS 2205 were also investigated. The microstructural evolution of steels before and after deformation was analyzed by means of optical microscope (OM) and Field-Emission Gun Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (FEG-ESEM) equipped with Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD). Numerical and experimental results were found in good agreement and {{provided the basis for}} the industrial production of a new stainless steel forged component...|$|E
