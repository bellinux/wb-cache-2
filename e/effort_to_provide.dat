5|$|Since reunification, Germany {{has taken}} {{a more active role}} in the European Union. Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E

5|$|Under the new Royalist regime, the Champollion {{brothers}} invested much {{of their}} time and efforts in establishing Lancaster schools, in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the general population with education. This was considered a revolutionary undertaking by the Ultra-royalists, who did not believe that education should be made accessible for the lower classes. In 1821 Champollion even led an uprising, in which he and a band of Grenobleans stormed the citadel and hoisted the tricolore instead of the Bourbon Royalist flag. He was charged with treason and went into hiding, but was eventually pardoned.|$|E

5|$|Although 1 ATF {{was well}} placed {{to deny the}} communists the use of its AO, it was {{increasingly}} obvious {{that there was little}} role for the SAS. Indeed, the heavy presence of Viet Cong prevented them from operating normally, and the first attempt to insert a patrol was called off due to the presence of hostile forces {{in the vicinity of the}} landing zone; two Viet Cong were subsequently killed and the patrol was extracted after only 30 minutes. A second attempt lasted only fifteen minutes longer, and they were also extracted following a brief contact. Finally, two patrols were joined together in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> more protection, and on 29 January they patrolled out from 7 RAR battalion headquarters. After only 30 minutes the Australians encountered a small party of Viet Cong; however, they tried again two hours later but were detected. The following day they tried for a third time and were contacted. Unable to operate effectively, the SAS patrols were withdrawn and returned to Nui Dat on 1 February.|$|E

Australian personnel also form part of peacekeeping missions in Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Sudan. The ADF has a further 400 personnel based in the Middle East to support operations in the region.|$|E
