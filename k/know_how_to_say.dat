500|$|Stone's self-titled {{debut album}} was {{released}} in 1990 with Johnson as producer. Mac McAnally, Mark O'Connor, Paul Franklin, Brent Rowan, and Willie Weeks were among the session musicians on it. Contributing songwriters included David Lee Murphy, Larry Boone, Randy Boudreaux, A.L. [...] "Doodle" [...] Owens, and Keith Palmer, who would later chart two singles for Epic in 1991. Its first single, [...] "I'd Be Better Off (In a Pine Box)," [...] spent twenty-five weeks on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts and peaked at No.4. In addition, the single {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award for Best Country Song, and the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for U.S. shipments of one million copies. The album's next two singles were both Top Ten singles as well: [...] "Fourteen Minutes Old" [...] at No.6 and [...] "These Lips Don't <b>Know</b> <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say</b> Goodbye" [...] at No.5. Following these songs was [...] "In a Different Light", co-written by Dickey Lee, which became Stone's first number 1 on Billboard. Stone received three music award nominations in 1991: the Horizon Award (now New Artist Award) from the Country Music Association, Star of Tomorrow from Music City News, and Top New Male Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music.|$|E
2500|$|Former Rangers {{teammate}} José Canseco identified Palmeiro as {{a fellow}} steroid user in his 2005 book, , and claimed he personally injected Palmeiro with steroids. On March 17, 2005, Palmeiro appeared at a Congressional hearing about steroids in baseball and, while under oath, denied ever using steroids and stated, [...] "Let me start by telling you this: I have never used steroids, period. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it any more clearly than that. Never." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pettyfer {{has seven}} tattoos, {{including}} a Celtic cross on his chest, Tibetan script {{on the inside}} of his right arm, the words [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around" [...] on his right shoulder, a Katakana script on his lower waist, and the letters [...] "ER," [...] the initials of ex-girlfriend Emma Roberts inside interlinking hearts on his right wrist. When Contactmusic asked him about the [...] "ER" [...] tattoo he said [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, she's a lovely, lovely girl, we had a spell of something that is over now, but we're on good terms. She's beautiful, she's great; we're really good friends." [...] The actor had Roberts' name tattooed on his wrist while the two were dating. [...] "I'm going to get asked about this, aren't I? I thought it was just between me and her," [...] he said when asked about the tattoo.|$|E
6000|$|But Mr. Wharton {{had still}} {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> though he hardly <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. [...] "You must {{come and see}} us in the Square after a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By degrees {{you might}} love me,--a little." [...] She had said {{all that she}} <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and again shook her head. [...] "It is that accursed Colonel," [...] he exclaimed, forgetting himself as {{he thought of his}} rival.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suspected}} you {{of knowing}} so much, that you <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{just what was}} most cutting. You said--I dare say you don't remember it as I do--that the relation of my sketch to nature was quite hidden from you. At least, you implied that." [...] Will could laugh now as well as smile.|$|R
2500|$|As Debussy's {{popularity}} increased, he {{was often}} engaged as a conductor throughout Europe during this period, most often performing Pelléas, La Mer, and Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. He was also an occasional music critic, to supplement his conducting fees and piano lessons, writing under the pseudonym [...] "Monsieur Croche". He avoided analytical dissection and attempts to force images from music, saying [...] "Let us at all costs preserve this magic peculiar to music, since of all the arts it is most susceptible to magic." [...] He could be caustic and witty, sometimes sloppy and ill-informed. He was {{for the most part}} enthusiastic about Richard Strauss and Stravinsky, and worshipful of Chopin and Bach, the latter being acknowledged as [...] "the one great master." [...] His relationship to Beethoven was a complex one; he was said to refer to him as [...] "le vieux sourd" [...] (the old deaf one) and adjured one young pupil never to play Beethoven's music for [...] "it is like somebody dancing on my grave." [...] It was said that [...] "Debussy liked Mozart, and he believed that Beethoven had terrifically profound things to say, but that he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> them, because he was imprisoned in a web of incessant restatement and of German aggressiveness." [...] He also admired the works of Charles-Valentin Alkan. Schubert and Mendelssohn fared much worse, the latter being described as a [...] "facile and elegant notary".|$|E

6000|$|... "Because I am not {{the best}} person, Florence. There is another who can do it better; one whom he admires, who stands in a {{position}} which would forbid his feeling angry; a person, cousin, whom I have heard in gayer moments <b>say</b> that she <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> any thing she pleased without offending any body." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Clarence," [...] he said, [...] "is more likable {{when you}} first meet him than George used to be; a {{handsome}} man who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the right thing. Makes friends readily, but somehow he never keeps the best of them. He's {{one of the people}} who seem able to get whatever they want without having to struggle for it and who rarely land in any difficulty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, there's a {{great deal}} to be said for the Florentine Arrabiati, {{as well as for the}} English Malignants, though the Puritans in neither case would have <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. Savonarola perished because he was excessive. I am {{studying}} him in this aspect; it is fresh ground. It is very interesting to inquire just at what point a man's virtues become mischievous and intolerable." ...|$|R
60|$|After all, Kipps {{thought there}} might be {{something}} to say for the milder project.... But he had gone so far that now he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Ricardo emphatically. The candle {{from the}} other side of the room threw his monstrous black shadow on the wall. [...] "He--I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it--he isn't hearty-like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no; it isn't that," [...] said Miss Tita, {{turning on}} me a {{somewhat}} troubled face. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it: it's {{on account of}} something--ages ago, before I was born--in her life." ...|$|E
50|$|Everyone {{knows of}} Ha Neul as Ha Jo's very young sister {{but the truth}} is that Ha Neul is the {{daughter}} that was born between Ha Jo and Lady Min and is the older paternal half-sister of Soo Bin and Gyo Bin. She has the capacity of only a ten-year-old but sometimes <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the right thing at the right time. Her character provides comic relief.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> sweetheart?" [...] She had much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> if she only <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it; {{but she was}} silent. [...] "Do you love me, Anna?" [...] Still she was silent. [...] "If you have ceased to love me, pray tell me so,--in all honesty." [...] But yet she was silent. [...] "If you are true to me,--as I am to you, with all my heart,--will you not tell me so?" ...|$|R
60|$|But, on {{the other}} hand, you may remark that St. Paul, in his Epistles, speaks of night in a very {{different}} tone. He is always opposing night to day, and darkness to light; as if darkness was evil in itself, and a pattern of all evil in men's souls. And St. Paul knew what he was <b>saying,</b> and <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it; for he spoke by the Holy Spirit of God.|$|R
6000|$|She was now {{clinging}} {{to him in}} very truth. [...] "Oh, my love!" [...] she said. [...] "I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it again. It is of you that I am thinking;--of you, of you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it curious?" [...] she remarked. [...] "When {{two people}} have {{something}} particular {{to say to}} each other, and nothing to hinder them, they never seem to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. You are the oldest, sir. Why don't you begin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but don't {{you think}} you had better speak to him before you quite make up your mind? He is your son, you know; and an {{uncommon}} clever fellow too. He'll <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> all this much better than I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's my dead child," [...] says Jenny, {{walking up}} and down as she nurses, [...] "that makes me love this child so dear, and it's my dead child that makes her love it so dear too, as even to think of its being taken away from her now. While she thinks that, I think what fortune would I give to have my darling back. But we mean the same thing, if we <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, us two mothers does in our poor hearts!" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{readers will}} guess from what I have written that I myself {{do not like}} Mr. Slope, but I am {{constrained}} {{to admit that he}} is a man of parts. He <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a soft word in the proper place; he <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> adapt his flattery to the ears of his hearers; he knows the wiles of the serpent, and he uses them. Could Mr. Slope have adapted his manners to men as well as to women, could he ever have learnt the ways of a gentleman, he might have risen to great things.|$|R
60|$|Wonder may be {{expressed}} {{at a man}} in the position of a teacher of languages knowing all this with such definiteness. A novelist says this and that of his personages, and if only he <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it earnestly enough he may not be questioned upon the inventions of his brain in which his own belief is made sufficiently manifest by a telling phrase, a poetic image, the accent of emotion. Art is great! But I have no art, and not having invented Madame de S--, I feel bound <b>to</b> explain <b>how</b> I came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> so much about her.|$|R
6000|$|... "O darling Eve, I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{how sorry}} I am, so terribly sorry I've started things going! It is my fault. But can't you see I've {{got to stop}} it before it's too late, just for that reason? Let's be chums again." ...|$|E
6000|$|She faltered, however, indeed. [...] "Oh I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it." [...] She fairly {{coloured}} {{with the}} attempt. [...] "One must let {{the sense of}} all that I speak of--well, all come. One must rather like it. I don't know--but I suppose one must rather grovel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't {{believe that}} at all. A simple schoolgirl like that!" [...] Mrs. Bowen's sense of humour had not the {{national}} acuteness.

5000|$|The Mark of the Christian, as Schaeffer {{says the}} Bible defines it, is Christian Love. It {{is not a}} mushy, gooey, romantic love, but one that is {{practical}} and that a watching (sinful) world can see. This love is one that <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I’m sorry," [...] and that <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> openly forgive. This love should also not be equated to organizational unity. In contrast to that it means unity stemming from the common bond of caring for each other. Schaeffer sites the Catholic Church as one that has organizational unity. Yet it is cutting itself to ribbons from within. Many Protestant denominations could fall into this same type of unity.|$|R
5000|$|Despite Lauren's blatant {{disregard}} for authority, and chav-like demeanor, she sometimes shows surprising intelligence. She is well-versed in the Periodic table, she apparently <b>knows</b> Shakespeare, <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Am I bovvered?? in British Sign Language, and she even speaks French, once surprising her French teacher by asking her [...] "Regardez mon visage. Suis-je bovvered? Est-ce que vous appelez ma mère une pikey? Est-ce que vous appelez mon père un gypo?" [...] ("Look at my face. Am I bovvered? Are you calling my mum a pikey?

6000|$|... "That word {{delicacy}} is {{a charming}} cover-all {{in all these}} cases, Florence. Now, here is a fine, noble-spirited young man, away from his mother and sisters, away from any family friend who might care for him, tempted, betrayed, almost to ruin, and a few words from you, said as a woman <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> them, might be his salvation. But you will coldly look on and see him go to destruction, because you have too much delicacy to make the effort--like the man that would not help his neighbor {{out of the water}} because he had never had the honor of an introduction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{cried the}} girl impetuously; [...] "don't go." [...] Mrs. Bowen stopped. [...] "I wish {{to speak with}} you--with you and Mr. Colville together.

5000|$|Petrucciani's trip to Paris {{garnered}} mixed experiences but {{was undoubtedly}} musically and personally transforming. He reports, [...] "It was mostly {{to do with}} drugs and weird women, but I was lucky and got out safe." [...] His attitude during his time in France was largely immature and insecure, despite his considerable talent. He wore a yachtsman's cap and frequently acted pushy and tough, referring to people as 'baby'. [...] "He acted tough and pushy, and his playing was tough and pushy. He <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'motherfucker' in French," [...] said Michael Zwerin, who met Petrucciani when the pianist was fifteen. Petrucciani played in a trio with Kenny Clarke during his time in Paris and rose to stardom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you must}} {{know as well as}} the rest of us that there was {{something}} queer about that gentleman--something that gave a man a turn--I don't <b>know</b> rightly <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your marrow kind of cold and thin." ...|$|R
40|$|January 2004 {{marked the}} tenth {{anniversary of the}} {{uprising}} of the Ejercito Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN) in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Proclaiming {{the need for a}} global campaign against neoliberalism, and rapidly repudiating the charge that its intellectual authors were foreigners, the EZLN rebellion brought together an already organized indigenous grassroots leadership and leftist insurgents whose outlooks were transformed by their experience in the Selva Lacandona. The global impact of the movement was undeniable. For a new generation of anti-globalization activists in Europe and North America, the new Zapatismo suggested “a new way to do politics”. In the words of one European solidarity activist, it “created a new language that <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this world is shit, but <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it with humor, joy, candor, without authoritarianism ” (Hernández, 2004 : 4). 2 Its national impact was also significant, not only because the rebellion reanimated a broader range of movements opposed to the neoliberal turn of the Mexican State, but also because a meeting of the Commission on the Application of the Norms of the International Labour Organization, meeting in June 1995, declared Mexico to be violating international standards with regard to the rights of rural workers and indigenous peoples and called for a rectification of the country’s indigenous policy (ibid. : 2). Nevertheless, ten years on the continuing significance of the Zapatista movement needs to be debated. The low-intensity war that followed the failure of Carlos Salinas de Gortari’s initial efforts to annihilate the EZLN made a clear contribution to a sapping of its grassroots support in Chiapas outside the inner core of the insurgen...|$|R
