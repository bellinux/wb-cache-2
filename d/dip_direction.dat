In particular, looking at the position of the maxima of the horizontal derivative of the continued field, we can observe that they will be laterally shifted toward the <b>dipping</b> <b>direction</b> of the discontinuity, in a way proportional to the continuation height.

40|$|Bedding dips in the CRP- 2 A drillhole were {{determined}} {{in two ways}} (1) analysis of a dipmeter log, and (2) identification of bed boundaries on digital images of the outer core surface. The two methods document the downhole increase in structural dip, {{to a maximum of}} 15 ° in the lowest 150 m of the hole. Dipmeter data, which are azimuthally oriented, indicate a 75 ° azimuth for structural tilting, in agreement with seismic reflection profiles. Core and log dips indicate that structural dip increases by 5 - 7 ° between 325 and 480 mbsf. Both, however, also exhibit high dip inhomogeneity because of depositional (e. g., cross bedding) and post-depositional (e. g., softsediment deformation) processes.

ABSTRACT [Maximum 200 woras) Multilayer polyimide(PI) filmsswere successfully fabricated using the Langmuir-Blodgett(LB) technique. These films were studied in several ways relevant to their use as liquid crystal alignment layers. (1) The influence of dipping speed and creep time on the orientational order of PI-LB films was investigated by means of birefringence measurements. (2) For comparison,; we measured the pretilt angles and polar anchoring strengths of liquid crystal(LC) cells assembled with PI-LB films and rubbed PI-LB films as alignment layers. (3) The anchoring directin of the liquid crystal {{was found to be}} solely determined by the <b>dipping</b> <b>direction</b> of uppermost PI-LB layer, regardless of the <b>dipping</b> <b>direction</b> of deeper layers. (4) Combining results of the above studies with measurements of pretransitional birefringence(above the isotropic to nematic(I-*N) transition) and observations of the growth of the augment texture just below the nematic-isotropic transition, we draw the conclusion that the range of interaction between the PI-LB film and LC molecules is quite shorts 4. 5 A) and that the alignmen...|$|R

In {{the last two years}} our group has been involved in applying new surveying methods to determine the <b>dip</b> and <b>dip</b> <b>directions</b> of discontinuities in rock faces; knowledge of these parameters, that can be computed from an high resolution DSM of the rock, allows for a stability analysis to be carried out. In this paper we describe an automated approach to extract from a dense DSM of a rock face, obtained by photogrammetry or by laser scanning, the discontinuity planes of the rock and compute their parameters. A multi-resolution DSM pyramid is generated from the original DSM; in a hierarchical scheme, the DSM is segmented in planes at each level of the pyramid, using RANSAC with topological constraints. Two clustering steps are also executed, to balance the fragmentation of the planes and the accuracy of the surface approximation. Finally, <b>dip</b> and <b>dip</b> <b>directions</b> are computed from the normal vector to each plane.
