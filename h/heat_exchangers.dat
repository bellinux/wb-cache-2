The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency.

40|$|Abstract — The triple {{concentric}} pipes <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is {{an improved}} version of double pipe <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Most {{of the previous}} study on the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is confined to two fluids and few of many possible flow arrangements. The present study involves the sizing of triple concentric pipes <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> where in two cold water streams flow through the central tube and outer annular space at same mass flow rates and same inlet temperatures in co-current direction while hot water flows through inner annular space in counter-current direction. This paper proposes a basic procedure for calculating overall heat transfer coefficients and length of triple concentric pipes <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Length of triple pipe <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is computed for a required temperature drop of hot water with available dimensions of three pipes by LMTD method. Overall heat transfer coefficient and length of the equivalent double pipe <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> are {{compared with that of}} the triple pipe <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The theoretical analysis shows that introducing an intermediate pipe to the double pipe <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> reduces effective length of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> which results in savings in material and space. The triple concentric pipes <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> provides large <b>heat</b> transfer area per unit <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> length and better heat transfer efficiencies compared to double pipe <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger...</b>|$|R
