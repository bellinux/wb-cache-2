5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous,</b> but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E
25|$|Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, {{a former}} President of France, {{has said that}} it <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous</b> to sing about {{drenching}} French fields with impure Prussian blood as a German Chancellor takes the salute in Paris. A 1992 campaign to change the words of the song involving more than 100 prominent French citizens, including Danielle Mitterrand, wife of then-President François Mitterrand, was unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|Dawkins {{has said}} that the title The Root of All Evil? was not his {{preferred}} choice, but that Channel 4 had insisted on it to create controversy. The sole concession from the producers on the title was the addition of the question mark. Dawkins has stated that the notion of anything being the root of all evil <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> Dawkins' book The God Delusion, released in September 2006, goes on to examine the topics raised in the documentary in greater detail. The documentary was rebroadcast on the More4 channel on 25 August 2010 under the title of The God Delusion.|$|E

[...] "Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth," [...] he wrote in 1928.

It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them." ...|$|E

The idea of the [...] "liberty" [...] of this country [...] "enlightening the world," [...] or even Patagonia, <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous</b> in the extreme.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the season, Blaine's musical {{performances}} leading the Warblers became so prevalent that he was called out for it on-screen. Criss offered the insight: [...] "Blaine definitely had his moment in the sun. I think it's time to focus back on the characters that fans of the show really know and love. Completely objectively from watching the show, I was like, 'Why does Blaine get all these songs? This <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> I want to hear other people doing stuff.' I think we're focusing a little more back on New Directions and taking {{a little bit of a}} break from the Warblers." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were divided}} about Rick Grimes' return to Atlanta, {{as well as}} his stand off with Guillermo and his gang. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic {{compared}} Grimes to Mad Men Don Draper, and questioned his character development: [...] "So far, every decision Rick has made has been both within his code and consequence-free," [...] he said. Pierce opined: [...] "Dramatically, this whole sequence plays out pretty hokily. Guillermo's dialogue <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous,</b> and the entire storyline plays like something out of an episodic social-lesson-of-the-week show. Since nothing ends up coming of it from a plot standpoint , it's hard not {{to think of it as}} one of those comics where two [...] have a big fight scene that turns out to be mistaken identity." ...|$|E

Martha and Jack {{were included in}} Virgin Media's feature on the [...] "Soaps' sexiest couples". She later said that [...] "Martha forms an attachment with anything". In February 2010, Stephen commented on Martha's brief romance with Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead). She said that Martha wastes no time in recovering from her personal tragedies, as she asks Liam {{to move in with}} her after he works on some fencing. Stephen added [...] "It’s lucky women like Martha weren’t around when the Great Wall of China was being built. They’d still be on phase one".

500|$|With Brosnan, the Bond writers {{knew that}} because of the changes in public attitudes, he could not be as overtly sexual and {{dominant}} over women as Connery's Bond, and was denounced by M in Goldeneye to be a [...] "sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War". Brosnan was seen by many as the quintessential James Bond in appearance and manner; displaying an air of coolness, elegance and a grace which made him believable as an international playboy, if not purely as an assassin. John G. Stackhouse for instance argues that it is preposterous that any man as strikingly handsome as Brosnan and Connery could be a secret agent, saying, [...] "When Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan enters a room, everyone notices. Thus it <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous</b> to suppose that James Bond, looking like that, could be a secret agent for longer than about two seconds".|$|E
500|$|Speaking of Sarah's {{death and}} Zoe's false imprisonment, Lister stated: [...] "She's {{in a very}} {{difficult}} place. She's lost her best friend and there's so much history there and she's finished her degree — well she didn't even finish her degree, she failed that — so she's in a limbo land anyway. She's working silly jobs and she's not in a very good place at all in any aspect of her life. Oh, and she's in prison on suspicion of murder..." [...] When asked during another interview with Digital Spy about how the character is coping with being in prison, Lister stated: [...] "Not very well! It's all completely overwhelming for her. She can't get her head around the fact that her best friend's dead and the fact that she's being accused of murdering her <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> She's worried that because it's got this far its ludicrous, so who's to say that she won't be sent down?" ...|$|E
500|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Yukito Kunisaki, the protagonist of Air. He lives a poor life going {{from town to town}} with little money, {{trying to make a living}} off his show with a puppet. By being an {{adolescent}} or young adult, Yukito sometimes acts childishly if provoked. Yukito tends to be helpful to those around him while trying to earn any money at the same time, and does his best to look after Misuzu in the Dream arc. Misuzu Kamio, the main heroine of Air, makes Yukito quite mistrustful at first by being too friendly, but eventually earns his affection. She is a cheerful but introverted, slightly clumsy and simplistic high school girl, and often utters the pseudo-dinosauric phrase gao when she feels troubled, a habit she retained from childhood. Misuzu has a great love of dinosaurs, finding the story of their glory and extinction [...] "romantic". As a child, her fascination with dinosaurs stemmed from thinking chicks would grow into them; her adoptive mother Haruko Kamio thinks it <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous.</b>|$|E

500|$|Never {{afraid to}} speak his mind, in July 1991 in an {{interview}} by The Straits Times Woon commented: [...] "We effectively don't have a Constitution. We have a law {{that can be easily}} changed by Parliament, and by the party in power because the party is Parliament. The changes themselves might not be controversial, but it is unsettling how flexible the Constitution is, unlike, say, in the United States." [...] In reply, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pointed out that past changes to the Constitution had been made only with a two-thirds parliamentary majority and not done lightheartedly, as the intensive discussions and the two-year gestation period of the Elected President Bill proved. He affirmed that the Constitution had to evolve to reflect the changing needs of the people, and that it could not be assumed that the Constitution, drafted in 1965, would be the best Constitution for always and should be frozen in time. [...] "So to say that because the Government in power changes the Constitution there is no Constitution <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous,</b> to put it mildly." ...|$|E
500|$|Cyrus first {{performed}} [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] live on May 18, 2010 on Dancing With the Stars. Donning {{the black}} leotard and accessories {{used in the}} music video, Cyrus appeared in a human-sized cage and then performed throughout the stage with many costumed backup dancers; Cyrus' dancing was minimal. Her first performance of the song outside the United States was at the Rock in Rio concert in Lisbon, Portugal on May 29, 2010. Cyrus appeared on June 1, 2010 at the Paris, France nightclub 1515 Club and on June 3, 2010 on Britain's Got Talents semifinals to perform [...] "Can't Be Tamed". On the latter, Cyrus wore hot pants, fishnets and boots as she performed. Midway through the performance, Cyrus grabbed a female backup dancer, dipping her low, and simulated a kiss. The performance was met with negative reactions from the media and caused her to release a statement in which Cyrus promised she did not kiss the backup dancer. Cyrus wrote, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous</b> that two entertainers can’t even rock out with each other without the media making it some type of story. I really hope my fans are not ...|$|E
500|$|Planet of the Titans was {{expected}} to be filmed in the United Kingdom in order to keep production costs low. In July 1976, Jerry Isenberg was assigned to be executive producer of the new film and British writers Bryant and Scott were hired in September. The duo had no science fiction writing experience, but had written the films Don't Look Now (1973) and Joseph Andrews (1977). Roddenberry defended the hiring of the pair, saying [...] "I'm very excited about some of the ideas they've come up with. The concept that only a science fiction writer can write science fiction motion pictures <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> Look at me. I came up with Star Trek, and I was a dramatic writer. I wrote for TV." [...] Bryant believed he earned the screenwriting assignment because his view of Kirk resembled what Roddenberry modeled him on; [...] "one of Horatio Nelson's captains in the South Pacific, six months away from home and three months away by communication". Their 20-page treatment was submitted the following month. It was entitled Planet of the Titans and was received favourably by Diller and fellow executive Michael Eisner. The writers were told by Paramount to proceed to script on October 6.|$|E

500|$|A {{few weeks}} after {{becoming}} [...] "Dr." [...] Hubbard, he wrote to Helen O'Brien—who {{had taken over the}} day-to-day management of Scientology in the United States—proposing that Scientology should be transformed into a religion. As membership declined and finances grew tighter, Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in Dianetics. His letter to O'Brien discussed the legal and financial benefits of religious status. The idea may not have been new; Hubbard has been quoted as telling a science fiction convention in 1948: [...] "Writing for a penny a word <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion." [...] Scholar J. Gordon Melton notes, [...] "There is no record of Hubbard having ever made this statement, though several of his science fiction colleagues have noted the broaching of the subject on one of their informal conversations." [...] The Church of Scientology has denied that Hubbard said this and insists that it is a misattributed quote that was said instead by George Orwell. Hubbard outlined plans for setting up a chain of [...] "Spiritual Guidance Centers" [...] charging customers $500 for twenty-four hours of auditing ("That is real money... Charge enough and we'd be swamped."). He wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal had {{finished}} the previous season as runners-up in the Premier League, overhauled by Manchester United in the final ten weeks of the season. The club did, however, retain the FA Cup, with a 1–0 win against Southampton. Such was Arsenal's effective start to the 2002–03 campaign, manager Arsène Wenger suggested his team could remain the whole season undefeated in all competitions: [...] "It's not impossible as A.C. Milan once did it but I can't see why it's so shocking to say it. Do you think Manchester United, Liverpool or Chelsea don't dream that as well? They're exactly the same. They just don't say it because they're scared to look ridiculous, but nobody <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous</b> in this job as we know anything can happen." [...] The team lost to Everton a month after Wenger's proclamation; teenager Wayne Rooney scored the match winner, which ended a run of 30 league games without defeat. By February 2003, Arsenal moved five points clear of Manchester United {{at the top of}} the league table, but injuries to key players, not least captain Patrick Vieira, had destabilised the team. Draws in April, coupled with a defeat to Leeds United at home, mathematically ended Arsenal's chances of retaining the title. Wenger refuted opinions from the media that their season was a failure and said: ...|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 11, 1910. The film was originally planned to be released on November 4, but it was delayed and some advertisements and later listings for the film give the erroneous date. The film received negative reviews in trade publications from even those which typically praised even the weaker productions. Though it was not well-received, the production was not criticized as sharply as Avenged had been. Walton of The Moving Picture News stated that the film was [...] " [...] very feeble echo on Anthony Hope. The throne room staging <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous</b> {{and so is the}} resolution. The flag-waving business is feebly melodramatic. Princes, etc. don't sit on that sort of chair. I'm an admirer of Thanhouser, but this thing is straight, plain punk. In Europe it will be received as a Yankee joke." [...] The reviewer for The Moving Picture World was decidedly neutral, highlighting only the novelty of the plot and refraining from any criticism or praise of the merits of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror was negative, but not scathing. The reviewer stated, [...] "The narrative is very entertaining - or could be made so, if the producer had cared to trouble himself about details. In its present crude form, its wild impossibility rather grates upon a spectator, because every scene in the film has some inconsistency. At least, it was worth doing well. Unfortunately, neither the acting nor the mounting has any particular merit." ...|$|E
