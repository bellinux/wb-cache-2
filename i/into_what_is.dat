5|$|In the 13th century, the Pagan Empire, {{along with}} the Khmer Empire, {{was one of the}} two main empires in {{mainland}} Southeast Asia. For much of its history, Pagan's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent Dali Kingdom and its predecessor Nanzhao, both with Dali as their capital city. Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself.|$|E

William Herbert made a claim over {{part of the}} Orroral Valley at some point between 1826 and 1836, while during the 1830s Garrett Cotter {{inhabited}} what would later be named the Cotter River Valley, in his honour. From the late 1830s, the Boboyan Homestead and station were established. Gudgenby was settled in the early 1840s and the Gudgenby Homestead was erected around this time. By 1848 {{most of the major}} valleys of the Namadgi area had been settled.|$|E
5|$|Southwark {{was settled}} by the Romans around 43 CE. It {{served as an}} entry point into London from {{southern}} England, particularly along Watling Street, the Roman road from Canterbury; this ran <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Southwark's Borough High Street and from there north to old London Bridge. The area became known for its travellers and inns, including Geoffrey Chaucer's Tabard Inn. The itinerant population brought with it poverty, prostitutes, bear baiting, theatres (including Shakespeare's Globe) and prisons. In 1796 there were five prisons in Southwark—the Clink, King's Bench, Borough Compter, White Lion and the Marshalsea—compared to 18 in London as a whole.|$|E

The Syilx participated in trade fairs held at Kettle Falls and {{at the mouth of}} the Fraser River. Trading networks strengthened after the acquisition of horses in the mid-18th century.|$|E
5|$|The Saxons conquered Bath {{following}} the Battle of Deorham in 577, and the border was probably established {{along the line}} of the Wansdyke {{to the north of the}} Mendip Hills. Then Cenwalh of Wessex broke through at Bradford-on-Avon in 652, and the Battle of Peonnum possibly at Penselwood in 658, advancing west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett.

5|$|From about 71 CE the Romans began {{military}} expeditions <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Scotland, building forts, {{like that}} at Trimontium, and probably pushing north {{as far as the}} River Tay where they created more fortifications, like those at Inchtuthil. These were soon abandoned, and the Romans settled for the occupation of the Southern Uplands {{by the end of the}} first century, below a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. This resulted in more fortifications and the building of Hadrian's Wall across what is now northern England. Around 141 CE they moved up to construct a new limes, a -covered wall made of turf known as the Antonine Wall, the largest Roman structure in modern Scotland. They soon retreated to Hadrian's Wall, with occasional expeditions that involved the building and reoccupation of forts, until the collapse of Roman power in the early fifth century.|$|E
5|$|In 1611, Henry Hudson {{was one of}} {{the first}} Europeans to sail <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now known as Hudson Bay, where he was {{abandoned}} by his crew. The first European to reach present-day central and southern Manitoba was Sir Thomas Button, who travelled upstream along the Nelson River to Lake Winnipeg in 1612 in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue Hudson. When the British ship Nonsuch sailed into Hudson Bay in 1668–1669, she became the first trading vessel to reach the area; that voyage led to the formation of the Hudson's Bay Company, to which the British government gave absolute control of the entire Hudson Bay watershed. This watershed was named Rupert's Land, after Prince Rupert, who helped to subsidize the Hudson's Bay Company. York Factory was founded in 1684 after the original fort of the Hudson's Bay Company, Fort Nelson (built in 1682), was destroyed by rival French traders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} century, St. Aidan (died 651) went from Iona {{to found a}} church at Lindisfarne off {{the east coast of}} Northumbria. The {{influence}} of Lindisfarne would spread through the kingdom of Northumbria <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now south-east Scotland. However, {{in the second half of}} the century, the Northumbrian church was increasingly influenced by the Roman form of Christianity. The careers of St. Wilfred (active from the 660s until his death in 709), abbot of the monastery at Ripon and Bishop of Northumbria, and Benedict Biscop (c. 628–690), founder of the monasteries of Jarrow and Wearmouth, intensified ties with Rome. A bishopric established at Abercorn in the region of West Lothian, is presumed to have adopted Roman forms of Christianity after the Synod of Whitby in 664, at which King Oswiu of Northumbria accepted the arguments for Roman authority and practices. However, the Pictish victory at the Battle of Dunnichen in 685 ended the Northumbrian dominance of the region and the bishop and his followers were ejected.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, logging {{began in}} the Pinkham area. After almost total {{deforestation}} of the White Mountain region, the White Mountain National Forest was created in 1911, and the Mount Washington area {{was added to the}} national forest in 1914. With the preservation of the area, emphasis shifted from logging to recreation. The Appalachian Mountain Club converted a logging camp near the height-of-land <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center in 1921. The Appalachian Trail was built through the visitor center, making it an important trailhead for ascents of Mount Washington. Meanwhile, ski trails began to be constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps on Wildcat Mountain, and the ski resort was opened in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The Romans began {{military}} expeditions <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Scotland {{from about}} 71 CE, building {{a series of}} forts, but by 87 the occupation {{was limited to the}} Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from coast to coast. Around 141 CE they undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new limes between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde, where they built the fortification known as the Antonine Wall. The wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160 and the Romans withdrew back to the line of Hadrian's Wall, until Roman authority collapsed in the early fifth century.|$|E
5|$|Various {{institutions}} around Bulgaria {{have been}} named after Petar Parchevich, including streets in the capital Sofia and Shumen. A Catholic football club known as SK Parchevich was founded in Plovdiv in 1923 and later merged <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> today PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv. One of the neighbourhoods of the mostly Catholic-populated town of Rakovski in Plovdiv Province {{is also known as}} Parchevich. In addition, three schools, in Plovdiv, Rakovski and Chiprovtsi, are named after him, as is a community centre (chitalishte) in the Banat Bulgarian village of Asenovo, Pleven Province. Parchevich Ridge in the Breznik Heights on Greenwich Island of the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, also bears his name thanks to the efforts of the Antarctic Place-names Commission of Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|Gradually, the {{hydrogen}} {{burning in the}} shell around the solar core will increase {{the mass of the}} core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770K. The Sun will become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> known as an asymptotic giant. Here the luminosity of the Sun will increase again, reaching about 2,090 present luminosities, and it will cool to about 3500K. This phase lasts about 30million years, after which, {{over the course of a}} further 100,000years, the Sun's remaining outer layers will fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a planetary nebula. The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.|$|E
5|$|Óláfr's {{marriage}} to the daughter of one of Alexander the King of Scots' most trusted northern lords, and the lord's assistance rendered to Óláfr and Páll, may suggest that Óláfr had gained Alexander's approval against Rögnvaldr. In the summer following the defeat of Guðrøðr on Skye, the chronicle states that Óláfr took hostages from the Hebridean portion of the kingdom and, with a fleet of 32 ships, landed on Mann and confronted Rögnvaldr directly. It was then agreed that the kingdom would be split between the two—with Rögnvaldr keeping Mann itself along with the title of king, and Óláfr retaining the Hebridean portions. In the 1220s Alexander began to extend Scottish royal authority <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> today the western coast Scotland, making several expeditions into Argyll. A this time Ruaidrí may have been forced from his lands in Kintyre and replaced by Alexander, installing Domnall mac Ragnaill, a more palatable member of Clann Somairle, in his place. Óláfr's control of Lewis and Skye, bordering the domains of Clann Somairle, may have made him appear as a potentially valuable ally to Alexander's eyes, who wished {{to rein in the}} more dangerous members of Clann Somairle.|$|E
