He saves {{the life of}} his future wife Bithiah when he stops her from running to interpose herself between {{the people and the}} <b>charging</b> <b>chariots</b> - which would {{certainly}} have resulted in her death. When the Egyptian army drowns in the returning sea, Mered comforts Bithiah in her grief.|$|R

60|$|They looked, and, sure enough, {{it seemed}} as though two great hosts were there embattled. They could discern the legions, the wind-blown standards, the <b>charging</b> <b>chariots,</b> and the squadrons of impetuous horse. The {{firmament}} had become a battle-ground, and lo! it was red as with the blood of the fallen, while the air was full of strange and dreadful sounds, bred, perhaps, of wind and distant thunder, that came to them like the wail of the vanquished and the dull roar of triumphant armies. So terrified were they at the sight, that they crouched upon the ground and hid their faces in their hands. Only old Benoni standing up, his white beard and robes stained red by the ominous light, cried out that this celestial scene foretold the destruction of the enemies of God.|$|R
50|$|Chariot burials {{continue}} {{well into}} the La Tène period, suggesting their continued importance in warfare. The La Tène chariot was a light, two-wheeled vehicle, unlike the heavier chariot of earlier times. The arrangement of the chariot poles in a reconstruction of the Wetwang Chariot suggests they were drawn by small ponies only 11 or 12 hands high and thus seem unlikely {{to be used in}} a frontal <b>charge.</b> Because <b>chariot</b> burials were never practised in Ireland, the nature or existence of chariot warfare in that country remains unclear.|$|R
5000|$|Uranium <b>ingots</b> were <b>charged</b> into an {{automated}} ingot preheat furnace {{where they were}} lowered into a Li2CO3-K2CO3 molten salt to be heated to 1,150-1,200 °F before being discharged singly to the mill table. The ingot was passed {{back and forth through}} the blooming mill until it was reduced to an oval billet approximately 2" [...] to 2½". The ends of the billet were then cut off by a cropping shear before it was pushed into an equalizing furnace. The billet was reheated to 1,150-1,200 °F in the equalizing furnace and was then discharged into the finishing mill. The finishing mill consists of six stands that reduce the rod to the final diameter of 1.43" [...] for Hanford rods, and 1.12" [...] for Savannah River rods.|$|R
5000|$|The Zhou {{troops were}} much better trained, and their morale was high. In {{one of the}} <b>chariot</b> <b>charges,</b> King Wu broke through the Shang's defense line. Di Xin was forced to flee to his palace, and the {{remaining}} Shang troops fell into further chaos. The Zhou were victorious and showed little mercy to the defeated Shang, shedding enough blood [...] "to float a log".|$|R
50|$|The group {{began as}} the Italian American Anti-Defamation League on April 30, 1970, when {{approximately}} 30 Italian-Americans, led by mobster Joseph Colombo, picketed the Manhattan {{headquarters of the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation. They were there to protest the recent arrest of Colombo's son, Joseph Colombo Jr., {{on a charge of}} conspiracy to melt down old U.S. silver coins (the mintage of which had ceased five years earlier) into <b>ingots.</b> (The <b>charge</b> was later dismissed when the chief witness against the junior Colombo admitted to having committed perjury). Prior to this, the senior Colombo had complained of unfair harassment of him and his family by various federal law-enforcement authorities, who alleged that Colombo was the boss of one of New York City's five Mafia families — a charge he repeatedly denied.|$|R
50|$|King You {{ordered his}} men to light the beacon tower, and put his {{minister}} Guo Shifu in charge of his infantry and Guogong in <b>charge</b> of his <b>chariots</b> and sent them ahead to hold on the enemy. Seeing his numerical disadvantage, Guo Shifu ordered Guogong to tease the enemies and ordered his own regiment to run back to the capital. Guogong was left alone and desperately led his 200 chariots {{to try to stop}} the attack, but failed and was killed.|$|R
6000|$|Secretly the Central European {{power had}} {{gathered}} his flying machines together, {{and now he}} threw them as a giant might fling a handful of ten thousand knives over the low country. And amidst that swarming flight were five that drove headlong for the sea walls of Holland, carrying atomic bombs. From north and west and south, the allied aeroplanes rose in response and swept down upon this sudden attack. So it was that war in the air began. Men rode upon the whirlwind that night and slew and fell like archangels. The sky rained heroes upon the astonished earth. Surely the last fights of mankind were the best. What was the heavy pounding of your Homeric swordsmen, what was the creaking <b>charge</b> of <b>chariots,</b> beside this swift rush, this crash, this giddy triumph, this headlong swoop to death? ...|$|R
25|$|Murena {{assisted}} {{by the force}} of natives from Chaeronea cautiously launched an attack against the right flank, the flank having been attacked from above is forced down the hill with disastrous consequences and possibly up to 3,000 casualties there. In exchange the <b>chariots</b> <b>charged</b> forth against Gabinius who was in the centre, Gabinius withdrew his troops behind defensive stakes thus forcing the chariots to retreat. As the chariots retreated they were met by a barrage of Roman javelins and arrows causing confusion and rendering Archelaus' main infantry line of phalanx vulnerable to attack.|$|R
60|$|For instance, in {{his time}} the Greeks had fought in clan regiments, and the princely men had never {{dismounted}} in battle, but had fought in squadrons of chariots, but now the owners of chariots fought on foot, each man for himself, while his squire kept the chariot near him to escape on {{if he had to}} retreat. Nestor wished {{to go back to the}} good old way of <b>chariot</b> <b>charges</b> against the crowds of foot soldiers of the enemy. In short, he was a fine example of the old-fashioned soldier.|$|R

[...] "On a plain footmen cannot withstand a <b>chariot</b> <b>charge.</b> As it is, many will doubtless fall; {{but they will}} scatter {{to the right and}} left, numbers will reach the hills in safety, some will take refuge in woods and jungles, while many will outrun the chariots. The new causeway is narrow, and a few only can cross abreast, and thus, though many of our men will be overtaken and killed, I trust that the greater part will escape." ...|$|R

50|$|Although chariots {{have been}} {{compared}} to modern-day tanks in the role they played on the battlefield, i.e., shock attacks, this is disputed with scholars pointing out that chariots were vulnerable and fragile, required a level terrain while tanks are all-terrain vehicles, and thus not suitable {{for use in the}} way modern tanks have been used as a physical shock force. The chief advantage of the chariot was the tactical mobility they provided to bowmen. Because tightly packed infantry were the formation of choice, in order for ancient generals to maintain command and control during the battle as well as for mutual protection, a force of chariots could stand off at long range and rain arrows down on the infantrymen's heads. Because of their speed, any attempts to <b>charge</b> the <b>chariots</b> could be easily evaded. If, on the other hand, an infantry unit spread out to minimize the damage from arrows, they would lose the benefit of mutual protection and the charioteers could easily overrun them.|$|R
5000|$|The revolt {{caused the}} {{destruction}} and looting of Camulodunum (Colchester), Londinium (London), and Verulamium (St Albans) before finally being defeated by Suetonius Paulinus and his legions. Although the Britons outnumbered the Romans greatly, they lacked the superior discipline and tactics {{that won the}} Romans a decisive victory. The battle took place at an unknown location, probably in the West Midlands somewhere along Watling Street. Today, a large statue of Boudica wielding a sword and <b>charging</b> upon a <b>chariot,</b> called [...] "Boadicea and Her Daughters", {{can be seen in}} London on the north bank of the Thames by Westminster Bridge.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of evaluation of the metallurgical quality of master heat ingots and of the identification of non-metallic inclusions (oxides of Al., Zr, Hf, Cr, etc.), which have been found in the shrinkage cavities formed in these ingots. The inclusions penetrate into the liquid alloy, and on pouring of mould are transferred to the casting, especially when the filtering system is not sufficiently effective. The specific nature of the melting process of nickel and cobalt alloys, carried out in vacuum induction furnaces, excludes the possibility of alloy refining and slag removal from the melt surface. Therefore, {{to improve the quality of}} castings (parts of aircraft engines), it is so important to evaluate the quality of <b>ingots</b> before <b>charging</b> them into the crucible of an induction furnace. It has been proved that one of the methods for rapid quality evaluation is an ATD analysis of the sample solidification process, where samples are taken from different areas of the master heat ingot. The evaluation is based on a set of parameters plotted on the graph of the dT/dt derivative curve during the last stage of the solidification process in a range from TEut to Tsol...|$|R
50|$|Phaethon, {{challenged}} by his playmates, sought assurance {{from his mother}} {{that his father was}} the sun god Helios. She gave him the requested assurance and told him to turn to his father for confirmation. He asked his father for some proof that would demonstrate his relationship with the sun. When the god promised to grant him whatever he wanted, he insisted on being allowed to drive the sun chariot for a day. Placed in <b>charge</b> of the <b>chariot,</b> he was unable to control the horses. The Earth was in danger of being burnt up and, to prevent this disaster, Zeus was forced to strike down the chariot with a thunderbolt and kill Phaethon in the process.|$|R
60|$|In 331 B.C. Alexander marched out of Egypt upon Babylon as Thothmes and Rameses and Necho {{had done}} before him. But he marched by way of Tyre. At Arbela near the ruins of Nineveh, {148} which was already a {{forgotten}} city, he met Darius and fought the decisive battle of the war. The Persian <b>chariot</b> <b>charge</b> failed, a Macedonian cavalry charge broke up the great composite host and the phalanx completed the victory. Darius led the retreat. He made no further attempt to resist the invader but fled northward into the country of the Medes. Alexander marched on to Babylon, still prosperous and important, and then to Susa and Persepolis. There after a drunken festival he burnt down the palace of Darius, the king of kings.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the charge mix on the yield and efficiency of a stack furnace has been analysed. The process yield has been calculated as the ratio between {{the weight of the}} tapped metal and the weight of the charge, while the efficiency has been assessed as the consumption of methane. The charge consisted of different amount of ingots and new scraps coming from the foundry process. The volume of slag produced through the melting process has been also considered. The results reveal that the addition of <b>ingots</b> in the <b>charge</b> decreases the amount of oxides and impurities in the molten metal and this brings many benefits. The yield and the metal quality increase while the amount of slag decreases. From the energetic point of view, the heat dispersion and the insulating effect of the oxide diminish, thus the methane consumption reduces...|$|R
40|$|Model {{predictions}} of the thermal and stress evolution in steel ingots, combined with a metallurgical study, have confirmed the mechanism of formation of off-comer panel cracks. The cracks are gener-ated initially in the subsurface of the ingot {{during the early stages}} of reheating in the soaking pit. The volume change associated with ~/-c ~ transformation {{plays a major role in}} the generation of the tensile stresses as in the case of the mid-face panel cracks. Early in the reheating, a subsurface two-phase zone of c ~ and 3 /contracts within a surrounding field of austenite and is placed in tension. Crack formation is enhanced by the precipitation of AIN which embrittles the steel. The subsurface cracks subsequently may penetrate to the surface of the ingot immediately upon its withdrawal from the soaking pit owing to the generation of surface tensile stresses caused by rapid cooling of the in-got surface. Measures to minimize formation of off-corner panel cracks, therefore, include reducing air cooling time (prior to <b>charging</b> <b>ingots</b> to the soaking pit) to prevent 3 ~-c ~ transformation, reheating the ingots slowly in an initially cold soaking pit to reduce the tensile stresses, increasing the air cooling time substantially to force the cracks farther from the surface, and minimizing soaking times and temperatures.

50|$|The scythed chariot {{was pulled}} {{by a team}} of four horses and manned by a crew of up to three men, one driver and two warriors. Theoretically the scythed chariot would plow through {{infantry}} lines, cutting combatants in half or at least opening gaps in the line which could be exploited. It was difficult to get horses to charge into the tight phalanx formation of the Greek/Macedonian hoplites (infantry). The scythed chariot avoided this inherent problem for cavalry, by the scythe cutting into the formation, even when the horses avoided the men. A disciplined army could diverge as the chariot approached, and then re-form quickly behind it, allowing the chariot to pass without causing many casualties. War chariots had limited military capabilities. They were strictly an offensive weapon and were best suited against infantry in open flat country where the charioteers had room to maneuver. At a time when cavalry were without stirrups, and probably had neither spurs nor an effective saddle, though they certainly had saddle blankets, scythed chariots added weight to a cavalry attack on infantry. Historical sources come from the infantry side of such engagements i.e. the Greek and Roman side. Here is one recorded encounter where scythed chariots were on the winning side:The soldiers had got into the habit of collecting their supplies carelessly and without taking precautions. There was one occasion when Pharnabazus, with 2 scythed chariots and about 400 cavalry, came on them when they were scattered all over the plain. When the Greeks saw him bearing down on them, they ran to join up with each other, about 700 altogether; but Pharnabazus did not waste time. Putting the chariots in front, and following behind them himself with the cavalry, he ordered a <b>charge.</b> The <b>chariots</b> dashing into the Greek ranks, broke up their close formation, and the cavalry soon cut down about a hundred men. The rest fled and took refuge with Agesilaus, who happened to be close at hand with the hoplites.|$|R
50|$|Lord Vishnu {{could not}} let his devotee - Daksha be mortified by Virabhadra. He {{therefore}} got astride his Garuda, armed as he was with Conch, Discus and Bow and Arrows, and rushed out to give battle to Veerabhadra to the great joy of all the scared assembly of victims. He immediately rained powerful arrows at his foe from all directions. Angered all the more by this quite unexpected attack, Veerabhadra also climbed a chariot and retaliated by sending fiery arrows {{in the direction of}} Vishnu. Thus started, they went on exchanging many a mighty astra and sastra as though two wild and mad elephants were at war; and the three worlds trembled with their movements; their mutual shouts of anger and wrath raised a thunderous din that filled the directions with rolling echoes. Both used celestial weapons - one upon the other; but none of them was affected in the least though they struck awe into the hearts of the onlookers and shook the three worlds. Both were equally matched and both were adept and quick with their hands and weapons in offensive and defensive. Keenly watching the fierce duel and thinking that Veerabhadra might come out victorious, Brahma decided to become the charioteer of Veerabhadra. Taking <b>charge</b> of the <b>chariot</b> instantly, he steered it ever so skillfully that Veerabhadra, though angry at first, soon became reconciled and even appreciative on beholding the expert manner in which Brahma conducted the many intricate manoeuvres of the chariot. Continuing the duel, Veerabhadra showered multiple weapons of tremendous power at Vishnu who retaliated with equal might. Thus proceeded a long-drawn-out battle between Hari and a manifestation of Hara, filling the three worlds with amazement; causing earth-quakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, landslides and storms and outbreaks of fire. The firmament reverberated with thunder and lightning. At last, discovering {{that it was impossible to}} subdue Veerabhadra by any ordinary methods, Vishnu decided to take his life once and for all by using his invincible Discus-Sudrasana - feared in all the worlds for its efficacy. So, twirling it around his right index finger, he let loose the mighty Sudarsana and it roared into the intervening space with such tremendous momentum and acceleration that it flew cleaving the air with incandescent jets of flame spouting off tangentially from its thousand revolving teeth. Seeing Vishnu's Discus approaching him thus, Veerabhadra coolly opened his vast mouth and swallowed it at one gulp; and was none the worse for it.|$|R
