500|$|Three {{classes of}} {{electrotherapy}} were in use. [...] One was the electric bath, {{which consisted of}} sitting the patient on an insulated stool with glass legs and connecting the patient to one electrode, usually the positive one, of an electrostatic machine. [...] The patient's skin became charged as {{if he or she}} were in a [...] "bath of electricity". [...] The second class of treatment could be performed while the patient was in the electric bath. [...] This consisted of bringing a negative electrode close to the patient, usually near the spine, causing sparks to be produced between the electrode and the patient. [...] Electrodes of various shapes were available for different medical purposes and places of application on the body. [...] Treatment was applied in several sessions of around five minutes, often blistering the skin. [...] The third class of treatment was electric shock therapy, in which an electric shock was delivered from a galvanic battery (later electromagnetic generators) via an induction coil to greatly <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>voltage.</b> [...] It was also possible to deliver electric shocks from the charge stored in a Leyden jar, but this was a much weaker shock.Simpson, pp. 7–8Morus, pp. 235–236 ...|$|E

500|$|A special link {{could be}} {{included}} in the chain which incorporated an interrupter circuit. [...] The purpose of the interrupter is to rapidly connect and disconnect the circuit so that the normally steady current of the battery is turned into a rapidly varying current. [...] The usual practice in the use of medical electrical batteries was to feed the output of the interrupter to an induction coil in order to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> applied to the patient by transformer action. [...] In Pulvermacher's patent however, {{there is no mention of}} using induction coils - the Pulvermacher battery could produce large voltages merely by adding more links to the chain. [...] However, the interrupter still had an effect in that an interrupted current produces a stronger sensation of electric shock in the patient than a steady current. [...] A novel feature of Pulvermacher's interrupter was that it was operated by the action of a vibrating spring kept in motion by the movements of the patient without the need for any external input. [...] Interrupters of the time typically had to be hand-cranked by the physician, although there were already some in existence using electro-mechanical automatic interrupters. [...] Later versions of the Pulvermacher chain used clockwork driven interrupters whose rate of interruption could be adjusted so that the rate of shock to the patient could be controlled. [...] Such a clockwork interrupter is fitted to the chain shown in figure 1. [...] It is wound up by turning the handle at the left end.Pulvermacher, p.2 ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantage}} of the ribbon microphone when introduced was that the light ribbon had a much higher natural resonant frequency than diaphragms in existing microphones, above hearing range, so it had flatter response at high frequencies. [...] The voltage output of older ribbon microphones is typically quite low compared to a dynamic moving coil microphone, and a step-up transformer is used to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> output and increase the output impedance. Modern ribbon microphones do not suffer from this problem due to improved magnets and more efficient transformers and have output levels that can exceed typical stage dynamic microphones.|$|E
