The portal has double Renaissance doors under archivaults decorated with fruit. Above the doors are seahorses on the main frieze and Moorish paneling on the doors themselves.

For the wise man may now {{everywhere}} discern that he must found on his manhood, not on the <b>garnitures</b> of his manhood. He who, in these Epochs of our Europe, founds on <b>garnitures,</b> formulas, culottisms of what sort soever, is founding on old cloth and sheep-skin, and cannot endure.

50|$|The {{influence}} of the painter François Boucher and of contemporary theater and ballet are equally in evidence in Falconet's subjects, and his sweet, elegantly erotic, somewhat coy manner. Right at the start, Falconet created for Sèvres a set of white biscuit table <b>garnitures</b> of putti (Falconet's Enfants), illustrating the Arts, meant to complement the manufacture's grand dinner services. The fashion for similar small table sculptures spread {{to most of the}} porcelain manufacturies of Europe.|$|R

2500|$|The close helmet {{was used}} {{on the field of}} battle, but was also popular for use in tournaments.

Mines can project small reports, serpents, small shells, as well as just stars. Although mines up to 12 inches in diameter appear on occasion, they are usually between 3 and 5 inches in diameter.|$|R
50|$|Bident and trident tamgas {{are known}} from the 8th and 9th centuries in the Khazar world {{in the details of}} belt <b>garnitures</b> (Podgorovsky tumulus), in the form of {{graffiti}} on the stone blocks and bricks of fortresses (Sarkel, Mayatsky, Semikarakorsky, and Khumarian settlements), and in the form of pottery stamps on vessels (Dmitrievsky tumulus).

50|$|Another form of sculptural {{art that}} uses bronze is ormolu, a finely cast soft bronze that is gilded (coated with gold) {{to produce a}} matte gold finish.

50|$|The <b>garnitures</b> {{with this}} design are those {{belonging}} to Sir James Scudamore, William Compton, 1st Earl of Northampton, and Thomas Sackville. However, comparison with surviving pieces shows that {{some details of}} the construction, such {{as the number of}} lames in a piece, are often different from the finished work - perhaps suggesting that the makers of the basic pieces were more free or ready to improve on designs as they worked than those working on the decoration.|$|R
50|$|Under the Kangxi Emperor's reign (1662-1722) the Chinese {{porcelain}} industry at Jingdezhen was reorganised and the export trade soon flourished again.

50|$|After Carême, {{the two men}} who {{probably}} had the greatest impact on French gastronomy and that of the world at large were Prosper Montagné and Georges-Auguste Escoffier.
