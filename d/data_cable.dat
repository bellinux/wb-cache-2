25|$|Serial ATA (SATA). The SATA <b>data</b> <b>cable</b> has one data pair for {{differential}} {{transmission of}} data to the device, and one pair for differential receiving from the device, just like EIA-422. That requires that data be transmitted serially. A similar differential signaling system is used in RS485, LocalTalk, USB, FireWire, and differential SCSI.|$|E

The range limitations of the <b>data</b> <b>cable</b> allows for external SCSI devices.|$|E

25|$|According to {{researcher}} Ralph Langner, once {{installed on}} a Windows system Stuxnet infects project files belonging to Siemens' WinCC/PCS 7 SCADA control software (Step7), and subverts a key communication library of WinCC called s7otbxdx.dll. Doing so intercepts communications between the WinCC software running under Windows {{and the target}} Siemens PLC devices that the software is able to configure and program when the two are connected via a <b>data</b> <b>cable.</b> In this way, the malware is able to install itself on PLC devices unnoticed, and subsequently to mask its presence from WinCC if the control software attempts to read an infected block of memory from the PLC system.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 10, {{the third}} spacewalk of the STS-134 mission was conducted. The spacewalk {{made use of}} a new spacewalk pre-breathe {{protocol}}, called In-Suit Light Exercise (ISLE), instead of the normal campout pre-breathe protocol. The new pre-breathe protocol had the astronauts breathe pure oxygen for 60 minutes in the airlock, which had its air pressure lowered to 10.2 Psi (703hPa). The astronauts then put their spacesuits on, performed light exercise and rested for an additional 50 minutes, breathing pure oxygen all the while. After astronauts Drew Feustel and Mike Fincke exited the Quest Airlock, the pair began installing the Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF). The fixture itself {{and most of its}} components were installed, but the <b>data</b> <b>cable</b> associated with it was to be installed later. The spacewalking pair then moved on and routed some new power cables from the Unity module to the Zarya module on the Russian segment of the ISS, providing a redundant power supply to the Russian segment. Feustel and Fincke then moved on to finish up the installation of the wireless video system which Fuestel and Greg Chamitoff had begun to install on EVA 1. The pair also took pictures of the Zarya module's thrusters and captured some infrared video of an experiment delivered on board the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3. Commander Mark Kelly documented the spacewalk from inside the station. While the EVA was going on, pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialist Roberto Vittori assisted Expedition 28 flight engineer Ron Garan in stowing new equipment and supplies on the ISS.|$|E

2500|$|Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE), later {{standardized}} {{under the}} name AT Attachment (ATA, with the alias P-ATA or PATA (Parallel ATA) retroactively added upon introduction of SATA) moved the HDD controller from the interface card to the disk drive. This helped to standardize the host/controller interface, reduce the programming complexity in the host device driver, and reduced system cost and complexity. The 40-pin IDE/ATA connection transfers 16bits of data at a time on the <b>data</b> <b>cable.</b> The <b>data</b> <b>cable</b> was originally 40-conductor, but later higher speed requirements for data transfer {{to and from the}} HDD led to an [...] "ultra DMA" [...] mode, known as UDMA. Progressively swifter versions of this standard ultimately added the requirement for an 80-conductor variant of the same cable, where half of the conductors provides grounding necessary for enhanced high-speed signal quality by reducing cross talk.|$|E
