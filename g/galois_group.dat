25|$|Galois' most {{significant}} contribution to mathematics is his development of Galois theory. He realized that the algebraic solution to a polynomial equation {{is related to the}} structure of a group of permutations associated with the roots of the polynomial, the <b>Galois</b> <b>group</b> of the polynomial. He found that an equation could be solved in radicals if one can find a series of subgroups of its <b>Galois</b> <b>group,</b> each one normal in its successor with abelian quotient, or its <b>Galois</b> <b>group</b> is solvable. This proved to be a fertile approach, which later mathematicians adapted to many other fields of mathematics besides the theory of equations to which Galois originally applied it.|$|E

Igor Shafarevich proved that every solvable finite group is the <b>Galois</b> <b>group</b> of some extension of Q. Various people have solved the inverse Galois problem for selected non-abelian simple groups.

25|$|In certain situations, the <b>Galois</b> <b>group</b> acts {{on other}} {{mathematical}} objects, for example a group. Such a group is then {{also referred to}} as a Galois module. This enables the use of group cohomology for the <b>Galois</b> <b>group</b> Gal(F), also known as Galois cohomology, which in the first place measures the failure of exactness of taking Gal(F)-invariants, but offers deeper insights (and questions) as well. For example, the <b>Galois</b> <b>group</b> G of a field extension L / F acts on L×, the nonzero elements of L. This Galois module plays a significant role in many arithmetic dualities, such as Poitou-Tate duality. The Brauer group of F, originally conceived to classify division algebras over F, can be recast as a cohomology group, namely H2(Gal (F), ×).|$|E
