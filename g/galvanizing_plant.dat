30|$|In recent years, {{heavy metal}} {{contamination}} in wastewater {{has become a}} major subject. Heavy metals in nature are hazardous to plants, animals, and humans even in slight concentrations. Therefore, the concentrations of ions of heavy metals solvable in effluents must be controlled well to prevent their toxicity effects. Chemists are trying to find ways to remove pollutants and contaminants. Among many heavy metals, zinc is one of the common pollutants in different industrial effluents. Zinc (ion) is usually found in industrial wastewater such as acid mine drainage, <b>galvanizing</b> <b>plants,</b> municipal and also natural materials. Many methods including physical and chemical methods, such as chemical precipitation [1], filter media [2], biosorption [3], flocculation [4] and ion exchange [5], have been used to solve this problem by removing heavy metals from wastewater. One of the most common methods is adsorption due to its easiness and simplicity. A study of the literature shows which diverse synthetic and natural adsorbents had been used for the adsorption of zinc from aqueous solution [6, 7]. However, adsorption is the maximum common, effective removal method, for many low-level pollutants.|$|R

30|$|Cu and Zn {{are among}} the most toxic metals {{affecting}} the environment. The primary sources of Cu in industrial wastewater are metal-process pickling baths and plating baths. Cu may also be present in wastewater from a variety of chemical manufacturing processes employing Cu salts or a Cu catalyst (Eckenfelder 2000). Many studies have shown that these metals are toxic even at very low concentrations. However, these metals have many applications in the industry. For example, Cu is known as an excellent conductor of electricity, widely used in the electrical industry in all gauges of wires for circuitry. Cu is also utilized in analytical reagents, in paints for ship keels and in electroplating. Cu acts as an irritant to the skin causing itching and dermatitis, and may cause keratinization of the hands and soles of the feet (Sitting 1981). Zn is often found in effluents discharged from industries involved in acid mine drainage, <b>galvanizing</b> <b>plants,</b> natural ores and municipal wastewater treatment plants and is not biodegradable and travels through the food chain via bioaccumulation (King et al. 2008). Therefore, a systematic study of the removal of Cu and Zn from wastewater is of considerable significance from an environmental point of view.|$|R

The key element in the developed processes is the membrane processes such as cross-flow filtration and electrodialysis. For the area of hydrochloric acid gas-washing solution (approximately 40. 000 m" 3 /a) from the incineration plant the process combination of microfiltration, electrodialysis and rectification proved to be technically and economically feasible when the problems involved with lead in separation were solved. In the smelting works approximately 30 t/a metal and approximatley 35. 000 m" 3 /h of water solution is recycled with the simultaneous production of approximately 3. 000 m" 3 /a of saleable azeotropic hydrochloric acid. No tests for the preparation of the gas water solution and storage battery solutions containing sulfate were begun during the period covered by the report.

40|$|Objectives Very {{little is}} known {{regarding}} the toxicokinetics of inhaled zinc, in particular {{in the case of}} female workers and for modern, low exposure settings. Our aim is to evaluate the relationship of external zinc levels to those of serum and urine for female workers. Material and Methods Eleven female workers (age: 41. 7 ± 8 years old, body mass index (BMI) : 23. 5 ± 4. 2 kg/m 2) in a <b>galvanizing</b> <b>plant</b> were investigated. Exposure assessment consisted of personal/environmental air samples, and measurement of zinc in serum (collected at the end of first shift of the working week (T 1)) and urine, collected before the first shift of the working week (T 0), T 1 {{and at the end of}} the last shift of the working week (T 2). Results Both environmental and personal air samplings for zinc and zinc compounds were below the recommended by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft – DFG) limit values of 2 mg/m 3 (7. 34 ± 2. 8 μg/m 3 and 8. 31 ± 2. 4 μg/ m 3, respectively). Serum (118. 6 ± 20. 9 μg /dl) and urine zinc levels were within reference values for female Italian subjects: the latter increased from 56. 4 ± 33. 5 μg/dl at T 0, to 59. 8 ± 37. 0 μg/dl at T 1, and ultimately 65. 4 ± 34. 4 μg/dl at T 2, but no significant trend was found. End of shift (Spearman’s correlation coefficient p value = 0. 027) and differential excretion of urinary zinc (both: T 0 vs. T 1 and T 0 vs. T 2) were correlated with airborne zinc concentration (p = 0. 002 and 0. 006, respectively). Conclusions In general, our data suggests that urine may be a useful medium also for female in order to assess zinc exposure. Further studies are required in order to evaluate whether differential excretion may be useful for the biomonitoring of zinc exposure in the workplaces also for male workers.

40|$|In the hot-dip {{galvanizing}} of steel, process solution arise {{out of the}} preparation of the surface which given {{the current state of the}} art cannot be de-centrally processed. Waste disposal is performed by outside parties, which means that reusable materials which the <b>galvanizing</b> <b>plants</b> could make use of are lost. Membrane procedures have been selected to create integral material cycles, although in the first phase of the project the suitability had to be checked by means of test with technical facilities in the galvanizing of Genthin. It became clear that processing of the acids grease-removal solutions is not possible by means of cross-flow current filtration. The phosphoric acid present in the acidic mixture combines with the free iron ions to stop up the ceramic membranes. The covering of iron phosphate cannot be removed by impulse regeneration. To improve the regeneration capability of the stripper it is planned to modify the grease-removal solution in such a manner that the phosphoric acid does not need to be used. A regeneration of the hydrochloric acid mordant, which has a varying zinc and iron contents, is technically possible with the aid of membrane electrolysis. As a result of the danger of an increase in the level of contaminants as well as economic investment and operating costs, only the zinc should be channeled out. The low-zinc iron mordant can be used in the manufacturing of flocculents in water chemistry. The electrodialysis membrane process has proven to be suitable for channeling water cycles of rising baths. Constant low levels of saline content can be achieved in the baths, which indirectly brings about a reduction of zinc loss in the galvanizing kettle. The separated material can be put in mordant baths as a concentrate. The production-integrated environmental protection achieved thus far can be quantified for a medium-scale works as having a re-circulation of approximately 100 m" 3 /year for hydrochloric acid and 12. 200 kg/year for zinc.

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the process of {{bacterial}} sulphate reduction, which is used to removal of heavy metals and sulphate ions from waste waters. The life of animals and plants depends on the existence of microscopic organisms  microorganisms (MO), which {{play an important role in}} cycle changes of biogenic elements on the earth. The sulphur cycle in the nature is considered as one of the oldest and most significant biological systems (Fig. 1). The sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) miss the assimilatory part of the cycle and produce sulphides. The microbial population of this dissimilatory part is called sulfuretum. The SRB can be found in anaerobic mud and sediments of freshwater, thermal or non-thermal sulphur springs, mining waters from sulphide deposits, oil deposits, sea and ocean beds, and in the gastrointestinal tract of man and animals. The SRB represent a group of chemoorganotrophic, strictly anaerobic and gramnegative bacteria, which exhibit a great morphological and physiological diversity. Despite of their considerable morphological variety, they have one property in common, which is the ability to utilise preferentially sulphates (occasionally sulphites, thiosulphates, tetrathionates) as electron acceptors, which are reduced to sulphides, during anaerobic respiration. The electron donors in these processes are simple organic compounds as lactate, malate, etc.,(heterotrophically reduction) or gaseous hydrogen (autotrophically reduction). SRB can produce a considerable amount of hydrogen sulphide, which reacts easily in aqueous solution with the cations of heavy metals, forming metal sulphides that have low solubility. The bacterial sulphate reduction can be used for the treatment of acid mine drainage waters, which is considered to be the major problem associated with mining activities. In order to remove heavy metals from waste waters, e. g., from <b>galvanizing</b> <b>plants,</b> mine waters (Smolnik, obov locality) and metallurgic plants (works Krompachy) by use of the activity of SRB, mixed strains were isolated, cultivated, and their production of hydrogen sulphide was assessed. The cultures were then tested for the ability to precipitate copper and sulphates from a model solution. The bacteria were isolated from water samples from two localities: Východoslovenské eleziarne (works)  VS and spring Gajdovka  Gj. Isolation, cultivation and eliminating Cu 2 + and SO 42 - was carried out under following conditions: statically, temperature 30 oC, pH 7, 5, nutrient medium by J. Postgate (medium B, C and D) and anaerobic conditions. Residual copper in the solution was measured by atomic absorption photometry. The concentracion of sulphates in the solution was measured by the nefelometric method. Our findings from the isolation of SRB from two Slovak water samples and testing the cultures for their ability to remove copper permit the following conclusions: SRB occur in sufficient numbers in sulphur mineral water from natural sources and in industrial waste waters reservoirs, the sulphate-reducing activity can be harnessed for the purification of some industrial waste waters.
