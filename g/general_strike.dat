In an attempt to quell the general unrest, the system of estates was abolished in the Parliamentary Reform of 1906, which introduced universal suffrage.

5|$|The {{position}} that the <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipbuilding}} boom in {{the early}} part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town; the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle <b>General</b> <b>Strike</b> of 1919, the first <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> in the country. A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the mass}} protests that {{occurred}} {{at that time}} were the winter 1981 <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> in Bielsko-Biała, the nationwide warning strike {{in the spring of}} that year and hunger demonstrations in summer. The warning strike took place {{in the aftermath of the}} Bydgoszcz events (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.|$|E

Occasioned by the {{emergence}} of the labour movement and socialism in Belgium, <b>general</b> <b>strikes</b> have been an enduring part of Belgian political life. Originally intended to encourage the reform of the franchise, more recent strikes have focused on issues of wages and opposition to government austerity. Since 1945, <b>general</b> <b>strikes</b> have been co-ordinated by the General Federation of Belgian Labour (ABVV-FGTB), a federation of Socialist trade unions, while most before World War II were organised by the parliamentary Belgian Labour Party (POB-BWP).|$|R

5|$|On May 3, {{striking}} workers in Chicago met near the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company plant. Union molders {{at the plant}} had been locked out since early February and the predominantly Irish-American workers at McCormick had come under attack from Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city. By {{the time of the}} 1886 <b>general</b> <b>strike,</b> strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as they crossed the picket lines.|$|E

5|$|The <b>General</b> <b>Strike</b> {{had begun}} as a dispute between miners and their {{employers}} outside London in 1925. On 1 May 1926 the Trades Union Congress called out workers {{all over the}} country, including the London dockers. The government had had over a year to prepare and deployed troops to break the dockers' picket lines. Armed food convoys, accompanied by armoured cars, drove down the East India Dock Road. By 10 May, a meeting was brokered at Toynbee Hall to end the strike. The TUC were forced into a humiliating climbdown and the <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> ended on 11 May, with the miners holding out until November.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, labor unions in Western Europe have mobilized {{large numbers of}} protesters in a rising number of <b>general</b> <b>strikes</b> against policy reforms by {{national}} governments. In over 40 percent of the cases, governments ceded concessions to unions in response. Which factors drive governments’ decisions to grant concessions {{in the wake of}} <b>general</b> <b>strikes?</b> We explain the variation in government responses to <b>general</b> <b>strikes</b> by examining properties of governments, such as type of government and party family. Drawing on an original dataset from 16 West European countries (1980 - 2009), we analyze the outcomes of 75 <b>general</b> <b>strikes</b> using logistic regression. We find that concessions to unions are more likely by coalition governments, and by governments led by center or Christian Democratic parties, compared to social democratic and conservative governments. We offer a possible explanation for this finding based on shifting ideological alliances in multi-party systems...|$|R

5|$|The final {{catalyst}} {{for the expansion of}} the investigation was the Seattle <b>General</b> <b>Strike,</b> which began the day before the Senate passed Resolution 439.

5|$|After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) {{and union}} members (over wage rates) {{resulted}} in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.|$|E
5|$|Euskadiko Ezkerra, the Communist Party of Spain and the People's Alliance also issued {{statements}} {{condemning the}} attack.

5|$|In the Basque Country, 3,000 {{people took}} part in a protest march in Azpeitia, while a larger {{demonstration}} in San Sebastián saw 30,000 people in attendance. Six people were injured after being shot by police during a demonstration in Algorta.

5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> must be a weapon {{in the hands of the}} proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, a pillar of Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E
