25|$|Investors, {{including}} {{the likes of}} Warren Buffett, and researchers have disputed the efficient-market hypothesis both empirically and theoretically. Behavioral economists attribute the imperfections in financial markets {{to a combination of}} cognitive biases such as overconfidence, overreaction, representative bias, <b>information</b> <b>bias,</b> and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing. These have been researched by psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Richard Thaler, and Paul Slovic. These errors in reasoning lead most investors to avoid value stocks and buy growth stocks at expensive prices, which allow those who reason correctly to profit from bargains in neglected value stocks and the overreacted selling of growth stocks. Investors prefer riskier funds in spring and safer funds in autumn.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore {{parenting}} as one potential route through which <b>information</b> processing <b>biases</b> for threat develop in children. It reviews <b>information</b> processing <b>biases</b> in childhood anxiety in the context of theoretical models and empirical research in the adult anxiety literature. Specifically, it considers how adult models have been used and adapted to develop a theoretical framework with which to investigate <b>information</b> processing <b>biases</b> in children. The paper then considers research which specifically aims to understand the relationship between parenting and the development of <b>information</b> processing <b>biases</b> in children. It concludes that a clearer theoretical framework is required to understand the significance of <b>information</b> <b>biases</b> in childhood anxiety, as well as their origins in parenting...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} {{and tests}} {{the hypothesis that}} <b>information</b> <b>biases</b> concerning the perceived extent of risk of educational options fuel social inequalities in track choice. In particular, {{it is argued that}} low-educated families are more concerned than college-educated families with the risks of dropout in the academic track, even when their children perform well at school. Moreover, they overestimate the risks of low occupational outcomes associated with academic diplomas. These <b>information</b> <b>biases</b> enhance their propensity to select vocational tracks, which are perceived as safer options, even when their children have the potential to succeed in the academic path. Survey data from Italy were used to assess these misperceptions and experimental evidence is presented concerning their causal effect on track choices. To correct these misperceptions, we designed a light information intervention, which was nested in a longitudinal survey {{to assess the impact of}} this intervention on students’ track choices. Both survey and experimental results corroborated our hypothesis that <b>information</b> <b>biases</b> contribute to social inequalities in track choice...|$|R

However, media are <b>biased</b> in transmitting <b>information.</b> Using a quantitative content analysis of ten years’ news reporting around water management policies in the Netherlands, we study how much media attention different groups of actors receive and how media biases relate to this attention. Executive politicians get on the news because of their authoritative position; less authoritative actors getting on the news is more related to <b>information</b> <b>biases.</b> <b>Information</b> <b>biases</b> can thus function {{as a form of}} checks and balances in news reporting on policy processes...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the role of}} parents {{in the development of}} a cognitive bias and subsequent fear levels in children. In Experiment 1, nonclinical children ages 8 – 13 (N =  122) underwent a training during which they worked together with their mothers on an information search task. Mothers received instructions to induce either a positive or negative <b>information</b> search <b>bias</b> in their children. Experiment 2 investigated to what extent mothers own cognitive <b>bias</b> predicted children's <b>information</b> search <b>bias.</b> Mothers of 49 nonclinical children ages 9 – 12 received no explicit training instructions before working together with their child on an information search task. Experiment 1 demonstrated that mothers had a significant impact on children's cognitive bias and fear. More precisely, children who had received a negative parental training displayed an increase in negative <b>information</b> search <b>bias</b> and fear, whereas children who had received a positive parental training showed an increase in positive <b>information</b> search <b>bias</b> and a decrease in fear. In Experiment 2, it was found that children's <b>information</b> search <b>biases</b> after working together with their mothers were predicted by their mothers' initial cognitive bias scores. These findings can be taken as support for the intergenerational transmission of cognitive biases from mothers to children...|$|R

40|$|Cognitive {{theories}} of depression posit that, when activated by an external stressor, negative self-schemas negatively <b>bias</b> <b>information</b> processing. The congruency hypothesis suggests that higher overlap between schema and stressor content results in greater degrees of schema activation. To evaluate these theoretical premises, {{the current study}} evaluated whether: 1) cognitive organization is predictive of negative <b>information</b> processing <b>biases</b> following a negative mood prime; and, 2) content domain of cognitive organization interacts with content of mood prime to predict <b>information</b> processing <b>biases.</b> Undergraduate students (N = 157) completed a measure of cognitive organization, underwent a negative mood prime, and completed a measure of interpretation biases. Consistent with hypotheses, cognitive organization in the negative achievement and interpersonal positive domains was predictive of <b>information</b> processing <b>biases.</b> Contrary to predictions, no interaction effects were found.

50|$|Stewart and Stasser (1998) {{state that}} shared <b>information</b> <b>bias,</b> {{and in turn}} hidden profiles, occur more often for judgment-based tasks because of the {{ultimate}} goal of reaching consensus. To support this, a meta-analysis of information sharing and teams by Mesmer-Magnus and DeChurch (2009) found that information sharing most affected intellectual tasks. These findings supported Laughlin’s (1980, 1996) claim that intellectual tasks require more information sharing. That is, tasks featuring a hidden profile were less affected by the shared <b>information</b> <b>bias</b> when they were intellectually based (i.e., goal of correctness) rather than judgmentally based (i.e., goal of consensus).|$|E

40|$|Self-deception is both commonplace and costly, {{which raises}} the {{question}} of what purpose it might serve. According to the dominant explanation in psychology and economics, self-deception is an intrapersonal process that fortifies and protects the self from threatening information. An alternative possibility is that self-deception evolved as an interpersonal strategy to persuade others. To investigate interpersonal aspects of self-deception, we gave people a persuasive task and measured their <b>information</b> processing <b>biases</b> and their persuasiveness. Results revealed that people who were financially motivated to persuade another person in a particular direction demonstrated a self-deceptive <b>information</b> processing <b>bias</b> consistent with their persuasive goals. This <b>information</b> processing <b>bias</b> led people to convince themselves of the veracity of their persuasive goal, and subsequently to be more persuasive to others. These findings suggest that self-deception has interpersonal benefits that offset its costs...|$|R

40|$|An {{observer}} detecting a noisy sensory {{signal is}} biased by {{the costs and}} benefits associated with its presence or absence. When these costs and benefits are asymmetric, sensory and economic information must be integrated to inform the final choice. However, it remains unknown how this information is combined at the neural or computational levels. To address this question, we asked healthy human observers to judge {{the presence or absence of}} a noisy sensory signal under economic conditions that favoured yes responses (liberal blocks), no responses (conservative blocks), or neither response (neutral blocks). Economic <b>information</b> <b>biased</b> fast choices more than slow choices, suggesting that value and sensory information are integrated early in the decision epoch. More formal simulation analyses using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process demonstrated that the influence of economic information was best captured by shifting the origin of evidence accumulation towards the more valuable bound. We then used the computational model to generate trial-by-trial estimates of decision-related evidence that were based on combined sensory and economic information (the decision variable or DV), and regressed these against fMRI activity recorded whilst participants performed the task. Extrastriate visual regions responded to the level of sensory input (momentary evidence), but fMRI signals in the parietal and prefrontal cortices responded to the decision variable. These findings support recent single-neuron data suggesting that economic <b>information</b> <b>biases</b> decision-related signals in higher cortical regions...|$|R
