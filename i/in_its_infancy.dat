5|$|On 13 December 1920, Betelgeuse {{became the}} first star outside the Solar System to have the angular size of its {{photosphere}} measured. Although interferometry was still <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>infancy,</b> the experiment proved a success. The researchers, using a uniform disk model, determined that Betelgeuse had a diameter of 0.047arcseconds, although the stellar disk was likely 17% larger due to the limb darkening, resulting in an estimate for its angular diameter of about 0.055". Since then, other studies have produced angular diameters that range from 0.042 to 0.069arcseconds. Combining these data with historical distance estimates of 180 to 815ly yields a projected radius of the stellar disk of anywhere from 1.2 to 8.9AU. Using the Solar System for comparison, the orbit of Mars is about 1.5AU, Ceres in the asteroid belt 2.7AU, Jupiter 5.5AU—so, assuming Betelgeuse occupying {{the place of the}} Sun, its photosphere might extend beyond the Jovian orbit, not quite reaching Saturn at 9.5AU.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan {{railways}} faced increased competition in central London from new, electric, deep-level tube lines. The City & South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890. After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat rate fare of 2d, the District and Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The use of steam propulsion led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. However, electric traction was still <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>infancy</b> and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties.|$|E

However, costs were prohibitive and the plan was abandoned. Josias Jessop, the son of William Jessop, believed that a wagonway would be much cheaper than a canal. On 2 May 1825 an Act of Parliament {{for the construction of}} a railway from Cromford to Whaley Bridge was passed. The proposal– backed by William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, Richard Arkwright junior, and several Manchester bankers– was ambitious; it was expected that steam locomotives would be used on the line, even though the technology was <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>infancy</b> and George Stephenson did not build his revolutionary Rocket until 1829. The south part of the railway, from Cromford Wharf to Hurdlow, south east of Buxton, opened on 29 May 1830, and on 6July 1831 the rest of the line opened to Whaley Bridge. The first steam locomotive on the line was introduced in 1841; before that, the traffic had been made up entirely of wagons.|$|E

We could observe a significant increase of -diversity with geographical distance across continents (12000 km). Measured environmental parameters explained {{only a small amount}} of data variation, and we found no evidence for dispersal limitation. Thus, we propose historical contingencies being responsible for the observed patterns. Furthermore, we performed an in-depth analysis of type II methanotroph pmoA distribution at the sequence level. We used ordination analysis to project sequence dissimilarities into a three-dimensional space (multidimensional scaling). The ordination suggests that type II methanotrophs in paddy fields can be divided into five major groups. However, these groups were found to be distributed in all soils independent of the geographic origin. By including tropical field sites (Indonesia and Vietnam) into the analysis, we further observed the first paddy fields harbouring a methanotroph community depleted in type II methanotrophs...|$|R
