5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} <b>diagrammatic</b> comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier. This made clear that, although the Cathedral was {{one of the largest in}} the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E
5|$|If the Bismarck {{has been}} intercepted or {{compromised}} by Royal Navy ships, {{the game will}} automatically shift to an arcade sequence which will give the player an opportunity to defend the ship against a British attack, or alternatively, if playing as the British, the sequence is utilised in order to destroy the Bismarck. The feature can be displayed at any time, though it is automatically enabled if either side comes into conflict. The interface of the feature is split into three sections; {{the upper part of}} the screen shows a view of the ocean in front of the ship and any hostile ship in the vicinity. The middle section contains buttons and icons which are used to control ship movement and to fire weapons.

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{extensive}} {{study of the}} sub-ohmic spin-boson model with power law density of states J(ω) =ω^s (with 0 <s< 1), focusing on the equilibrium dynamics of the three possible spin components, from very weak dissipation to the quantum critical regime. Two complementary methods, the bosonic Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) and Majorana <b>diagrammatics,</b> are used to explore the physical properties {{in a wide range}} of parameters. We show that the bosonic self-energy is the crucial ingredient for the description of critical fluctuations, but that many-body vertex corrections need to be incorporated as well in order to obtain quantitative agreement of the <b>diagrammatics</b> with the numerical simulations. Our results suggest that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics in dissipative models beyond the Bloch-Redfield regime should be reconsidered in the long-time limit. Regarding also the spin-boson Hamiltonian as a toy model of quantum criticality, some of the insights gained here may be relevant for field theories of electrons coupled to bosons in higher dimensions.
