It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the Southern Baptist Church. The church claimed Disney was turning <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> family values.|$|E
5|$|Today's lecture {{will include}} a {{repetition}} of a demonstration which failed last time. A large dog, stretched on <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> an operation board, is carried into the lecture-room by the demonstrator and the laboratory attendant. Its legs are fixed to the board, its head is firmly held in the usual manner, and it is tightly muzzled.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the present and lights its streets with candles. To {{mark the beginning of}} the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit. The procession of children and their families is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.|$|E

5|$|Next to {{the older}} and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse riders to ascend the hill without dismounting. The railings are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble renditions of Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E
5|$|The protests were to no avail. The statue {{was quietly}} removed before dawn on 10 March 1910 by four council workmen, {{accompanied}} by 120 police officers. Nine days later, 3,000 anti-vivisectionists gathered in Trafalgar Square to demand its return, {{but it was}} clear by then that Battersea Council had turned <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the affair. The statue was at first hidden in the borough surveyor's bicycle shed, according to a letter his daughter wrote in 1956 to the British Medical Journal, then reportedly destroyed by a council blacksmith, who melted it down. Anti-vivisectionists filed a High Court petition demanding its return, but the case was dismissed in January 1911.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1970s, Glenmalure Park {{regularly}} hosted attendances in {{the region}} of 20,000 people, but as the majority of the Irish public turned <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Irish football, those numbers declined and despite winning the League of Ireland four times in succession in the 1980s, the attendances for the period averaged approximately a quarter of that figure. The sale of the stadium contributed to a further decline in support. During the homeless years, particularly those spent on the Northside, attendances continued to fall with the exception of those recorded during the club's residence at the RDS, which included an opening attendance of 22,000. Prior to the relocation to Tallaght, the club's support base had been reduced to a hardcore group of over a thousand people. It currently includes approximately 2,700 season ticket holders.|$|E

25|$|During the Mintoff years, Libya had loaned {{several million}} dollars to Malta {{to make up for}} the loss of rental income which {{followed}} the closure of British military bases in Malta; These closer ties with Libya meant a dramatic new (but short-lived) development in Maltese foreign policy: Western media reported that Malta appeared to be turning <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> NATO, the UK, and Europe generally.|$|E
25|$|The reform {{movement}} turned <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the perceived corruption and decadence of cosmopolitan Istanbul and its Ottoman heritage, {{as well as}} electing to choose a capital more geographically centered in Turkey. During the disastrous 1912–13 First Balkan War, Bulgarian troops had advanced to Çatalca, mere miles from Istanbul, creating a fear that the Ottoman capital {{would have to be}} moved to Anatolia; the {{reform movement}} wanted to avoid a similar incident with Turkey.|$|E
25|$|The three-year EU {{aid program}} {{incorporating}} the €78 billion support package ended in May 2014.

25|$|A large dog, {{stretched}} on <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> an operation board, is carried into the lecture-room by the demonstrator and the laboratory attendant. Its legs are {{fixed to the}} board, its head is firmly held in the usual manner, and it is tightly muzzled. There is a large incision {{in the side of}} the neck, exposing the gland. The animal exhibits all signs of intense suffering; in his struggles, he again and again lifts his body from the board, and makes powerful attempts to get free.|$|E
25|$|From January 1993 {{until my}} {{resignation}} from the United Nations in August 1998, I witnessed first hand the duplicitous Iraq {{policies of the}} administration of Bill Clinton, the implementation of which saw a President lie to the American people about a threat he knew was hyped, lie to Congress about his support of a disarmament process his administration {{wanted nothing to do}} with, and lie to the world about American intent, which turned <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the very multilateral embrace of diplomacy as reflected in the resolutions of the Security Council Hillary Clinton so piously refers to in her speech, and instead pursued a policy defined by the unilateral interests of the Clinton administration to remove Saddam Hussein from power.|$|E
25|$|Basically {{the same}} Coalition, again {{led by the}} Republic and what now became Great Britain, soon fought France again in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which the States Army reached its {{greatest}} power and size: 119,000 men in 1712. It therefore formed {{the backbone of the}} Anglo-Dutch forces in the Southern Netherlands, led by the Duke of Marlborough (while the Republic also paid for many of the troops supplied by the allied German princes and Denmark, by way of subsidies); the British contribution was usually smaller in size at most of the battles fought during this conflict. The effort required from the Republic in this war almost brought it to financial exhaustion, just as France was financially brought to its knees. This, {{and the fact that the}} fruits of the allied victory over France were almost exclusively reaped by Great Britain (that had turned <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> its allies and concluded a separate peace) so disillusioned the Dutch government, that they decided to turn their back on European power politics for the remainder of the 18th century, adopting a policy of armed neutrality.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{staff writer}} Ken Tucker {{thought it was}} not [...] "the best Fringe episode", {{primarily}} because of [...] "its Twilight Zone construction, with a supernatural event serving as a big, obvious metaphor for... the rift between lovers (Peter and Olivia; the elderly couple Alice and Derek)". Tucker disliked Olivia's return to [...] "season-one-Olivia poker-faced dolorousnes" [...] and also [...] "worr about the imbalance between the series’ romantic, family, and mythology ingredients". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times felt that the episode's emphasis on emotions (instead of plain science) was [...] "turning <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the science that made [...] great". Hanson also wished the parallels between Walter and Walternate's decisions had been explored further.|$|E
500|$|Chimes at Midnight premiered to a {{positive}} audience reception at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. However, after New York Times critic Bosley Crowther's unfavorable advance review, American distributor Harry Saltzman decided to give the film little publicity and minimal distribution when it was released in the U.S. the next year. Critical reception on its first release was mostly negative; the film was not {{regarded as one of}} Welles' best until years later. Crowther criticized the film's poor audio track and called it [...] "a confusing patchwork of scenes and characters...designed to give major exposure to Jack Falstaff." [...] Welles' performance, he said, was [...] "a dissolute, bumbling street-corner Santa Claus." [...] Penelope Houston called it [...] "a film which seems to turn <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> brilliance." [...] A Time review also criticized Welles, stating that [...] " [...] is probably the first actor {{in the history of the}} theater to appear too fat for the role...he takes command of scenes less with spoken English than with body English", but that he is [...] "never entirely bad." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Middle Ages, the hill’s sacred {{function}} was obscured by its other {{role as the}} center of the civic government of Rome, revived as a commune in the 11th century. The city's government was now to be firmly under papal control, but the Capitoline was the scene of movements of urban resistance, such as the dramatic scenes of Cola di Rienzo's revived republic. In 1144, a revolt by the citizens against the authority of the Pope and nobles led to a senator taking up his official residence on the Capitoline Hill. [...] The senator’s new palace turned <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the ancient forum, beginning the change in orientation on the hill that Michelangelo would later accentuate. [...] A small piazza was laid {{out in front of the}} senator’s palace, intended for communal purposes. [...] In the middle of the 14th century, the guilds’ court of justice was constructed on the southern end of the piazza. [...] This would later house the Conservatori in the 15th century. [...] As a result, the piazza was already surrounded by buildings by the 16th century.|$|E
5000|$|Dominic Ponsford, {{editor of}} Press Gazette said [...] "The PR {{industry}} is getting <b>its</b> own <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the journalistic community with the Communicative Relations Awards from PR Professionals."

2500|$|Faced with a skyrocketing deficit, the New Democrats {{introduced}} cutbacks {{to social}} spending, and the Social Contract, which forced public-sector workers to take unpaid [...] "holidays" [...] or [...] "Rae Days" [...] every year. They also introduced wage freezes. [...] The Social Contract led {{to most of}} the labour movement, especially longtime NDP ally Buzz Hargrove and his Canadian Auto Workers union (CAW), the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, and other public sector unions turning <b>its</b> <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> Bob Rae. Many union members vowed to bring his government down. Rae also introduced unpopular revenue-raising taxes and operations that hurt his election prospects. Thousands of party members resigned from the NDP and it became evident that the party was headed for a defeat in the 1995 election.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, Constellation was {{folded into}} MCA, when the artists, {{including}} Klymaxx, {{were transferred to}} MCA.

500|$|During a {{music store}} {{autograph}} signing, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had recalled the album {{within hours of}} its release, despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching #63 on the Billboard 200. The group was also informed that its in-store signings and nationwide tour had been canceled, commercials for the album and the music video for [...] "Halls of Illusions" [...] (which had reached #1 on The Box video request channel) were pulled from television, and that the group was dropped from the label. It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the Southern Baptist Convention at the time because of Disney's promotion of [...] "Gay Days" [...] at Disneyland, in addition to presiding over the gay-themed television sitcom Ellen. The Convention accused Disney of turning <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> [...] "family values". Although Abbiss told the press that Disney had stopped production of The Great Milenko to avoid further controversy, Disney claimed instead that {{the release of the}} album was an oversight by their review board, and that the album [...] "did not fit the Disney image" [...] because of its [...] "inappropriate" [...] lyrics, which they claimed were offensive to women.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{announced}} [...] "Roar" [...] {{would be}} the first single from Prism with the release of a video teaser featuring the singer burning a blue wig. More video teasers were released onto YouTube, that showed Perry at a funeral with a coffin decorated with the singer's famous pink and white pinwheels dress, and entering a recording booth while dressed with a [...] "throwback" [...] jacket featured in the single's cover art, which was revealed on August 8, 2013. It features a tiger print border around Perry, who wears a blue Japanese silk sukajan jacket, with the image of a tiger printed on <b>its</b> <b>back.</b> <b>On</b> the same day of the song's digital release, a lyric video for it, produced by Joe Humpay, Aya Tanimura, Tim Zimmer, and Tuan Le, was released onto YouTube. It primarily shows Perry doing daily activities such as eating breakfast, going to the bathroom, and taking a bath, while texting the lyrics of [...] "Roar" [...] to friends. Some words are substituted with various Emoji characters. It was target of plagiarism accusations by music producer Dillon Francis, who felt it copied the concept of instant messaging from his video entitled [...] "Messages".|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1940 convention, Roosevelt {{described}} Willkie's nomination as a [...] "Godsend to our country", because it {{ensured that the}} presidential race would not turn {{on the issue of}} aid to Britain. Walter Lippmann believed Willkie's nomination to have been crucial to Britain's survival, [...] "second only to the Battle of Britain, the sudden rise and nomination of Willkie was the decisive event, perhaps providential, which made it possible to rally the free world when [...] was almost conquered. Under any other leadership but his the Republican party in 1940 would have turned <b>its</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Great Britain, causing all who resisted Hitler to feel abandoned". Charles Peters wrote that [...] "it is arguable that [...] impact on [...] and the world was greater than that of most men who actually held the office [...] At a crucial moment in history, he stood for the right things at the right time." [...] When Georgia Senator Zell Miller, a Democrat, gave the keynote address at the 2004 Republican National Convention, he urged unity instead of partisan strife in the War on Terror, and recalled Willkie's actions, [...] "He gave Roosevelt the critical support he needed for a peacetime draft, an unpopular idea at the time. And {{he made it clear that}} he would rather lose the election than make national security a partisan campaign issue." ...|$|E
