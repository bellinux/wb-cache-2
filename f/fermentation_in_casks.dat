2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{distinction between}} real and other ales {{is that the}} yeast is still present and living in the container from which the real ale is served, although it will have settled {{to the bottom and}} is usually not poured into the glass. Because the yeast is still alive, a slow process of <b>fermentation</b> continues <b>in</b> the <b>cask</b> or bottle {{on the way to the}} consumer, allowing the beer to retain its freshness. Another distinction is that real ale should be served without the aid of added carbon dioxide, or [...] "top pressure" [...] as it is commonly known. Common dispensing methods are the handpump, or [...] "by gravity" [...] direct from the cask. Electric pumps are occasionally seen, especially in the Midlands and Scotland.|$|R

50|$|Using {{distillate}} {{obtained from}} Jameson's nearby Bow Street Distillery, Mitchell & Son matured whiskey in {{a mix of}} casks which {{had been used to}} hold both dark and light sherries in their cellars under Fitzwilliam Lane, Dublin.

This combination prevented the darker wines from overpowering the whiskey. After five years, whiskeys from the respective light and dark sherry casks were then vatted together and allowed mature for a further five years in neutral oak.|$|R
