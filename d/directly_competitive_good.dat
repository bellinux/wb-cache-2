40|$|In a Cournot duopoly market, {{this paper}} studies {{the role of}} product {{differentiation}} in {{the resolution of the}} export subsidy dispute. It is shown that the optimal export subsidy decreases with the degree of product differentiation and the export subsidy will be eliminated completely when the <b>competitive</b> <b>goods</b> are made perfectly different. Furthermore, increasing the degree of product differentiation will also increase the profits of the firms and the welfare of the exporting countries. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{generalized}} wage-setting/price-setting model studying {{the impact of}} public spending on employment, {{in the presence of}} imperfect competition in labor and product markets. Public spending is shown to affect firms' profit margins and firms' labor demand schedules. The model highlights a new channel by which fiscal policy can improve employment. By reducing firms' mark-up, public spending helps countering the adverse effects of market power in imperfectly <b>competitive</b> <b>goods</b> markets...|$|R

5000|$|The United Provinces of the Netherlands {{were growing}} quickly when the truce was established. Their colonies spanned across five continents and their growth can be {{considered}} as what was ‘a new type of global trade and the formation of the world economy.’ [...] The Dutch trade differed from its rivals in many ways. They paid close attention to the relation between risk and profit. If the potential profit was greater than the imposed risk, they were willing (and managed to) trade with their wartime enemies. The middle class played a key role also; they had a large amount of capital accrued within. Due to the Netherlands deficiency in mineral affluence, they had to find another source of profit. They began specializing in <b>competitive</b> <b>goods.</b> <b>Competitive</b> <b>goods</b> are defined as: A production of goods that are not dependent on a particular climate, deposits, and can be produced anywhere in the world. These goods included, but were not limited to: Scandinavian wood, means for shipbuilding, iron, copper, wheat, rye, North Sea Fish, and English wool. The Dutch faced the pressure of competition with several growing competitors. The Dutch focused on their growing agriculture, their domination in continental trade markets, and their widely praised skills as seafarers.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{an account of}} Don Patinkin's long-time search for {{an explanation of the}} notions of an aggregate demand constraint and unemployment under the assumption of a perfectly <b>competitive</b> <b>goods</b> market. It is argued that Patinkin's quest is reflected {{on the development of the}} concept of an aggregate supply function in the goods market. Patinkin's interpretation of aggregate supply and unemployment is compared to similar ideas put forward by Jacob Marschak, Trygve Haavelmo and Lawrence Klein, his former colleagues at the Cowles Commission in Chicago.

30|$|Given {{these qualities}} do offer a {{critical}} {{insight into the}} ‘complex causalities of such factors’, it is perhaps not surprising to learn that it is this less <b>directly</b> <b>competitive</b> and more socially-inclusive, cum cultural and environmental definition, which is also adopted by those advocating a Triple Helix-inspired account of smart city developments. This is because as a normative statement, the purposeful and action-orientated nature of the definition also goes some way to overcome one of the methodological ambiguities of the smart city ranking approach: in short, the real possibility that any such performance {{may be the result}} of actions which are only ‘implicitly’ related to these developments and not the outcome of some consciously pursued strategy.|$|R
5000|$|Yamaha {{introduced}} the YZ400F in production in 1998 after a successful AMA season in 1997. It was [...] "the first modern production four-stroke motocrosser that was <b>directly</b> <b>competitive</b> against two-strokes." [...] Initially, Yamaha targeted a dry weight of 233 pounds (106 kg) (on {{par with the}} 250 two-strokes of the time), but by production, the bike weighed 250 pounds. The bike had an 11,600 rpm redline power and torque close to its 250 cc two-stroke rivals. It benefited from engine compression braking, which allowed the engine to slow the bike down during deceleration, giving the brakes a rest. [...] The 1998 YZ400F was the first bike to come stock with a Keihin FCR carburetor.|$|R
40|$|One {{strand of}} the {{macroeconomics}} literature explores {{the extent to}} which the indexation of nominal wages to a variable in addition to the price level can improve macroeconomic performance. The present paper contributes to this literature by developing a model in which the nominal wage is indexed not only to the price level but also to productivity. Two key features of the framework are a monopolistically <b>competitive</b> <b>goods</b> market and a unionized labor market in which wages are determined by a finite number of unions. A significant finding is that the multiparameter indexation scheme generally outperforms full-information wage setting...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{developed}} a new cost channel of monetary policy transmission in a small scale, dynamic, general equilibrium model. The new cost channel of monetary policy transmission implies that the frequency of price adjustment increases in the nominal interest rate. I found that allowing for the new cost channel can account both for the muted and delayed inflation response and for {{the persistence of the}} output response to monetary policy shocks. Without any additional assumption, my model can also generate the delayed output response, though for a slightly more <b>competitive</b> <b>goods</b> market calibrationPrice stickiness, Monetary policy, Price adjustment, Persistence...|$|R
40|$|We {{employ a}} computable general {{equilibrium}} model of the Russian economy {{to assess the impact}} of accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on income distribution and the poor. We incorporate all 55, 098 households from the Russian Household Budget Survey as agents in the model. The model includes FDI in services and Dixit-Stiglitz endogenous productivity effects in imperfectly <b>competitive</b> <b>goods</b> and services sectors, features which are crucial to the results. We show that incorporating the diversity of households though a real household model is important for assessing household impacts, but getting the key model features right is equally important. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} fiscal {{implications}} of trade liberalization in a North-South trade model with nonhomothetic preferences. Combining a Ricardian trade {{model with a}} continuum of <b>competitive</b> <b>goods</b> and a public good, nonhomothetic preferences imply that both the global income distribution and the local income distribution matter for gauging the effects of different trade liberalization regimes on income taxes and public good provision. The fiscal implications of tariff reductions are typically more adverse for poorer countries than for richer countries. We also find that unilateral trade liberalization by richer countries is a more viable policy option to pursue than multilaterally reducing tariffs...|$|R
50|$|They did so {{particularly}} through {{conflict and}} specialization. Now {{we see the}} importance of <b>competitive</b> <b>goods,</b> the Dutch traded what was in demand and the strategy proved to be very favorable for them. They were long distance tradesmen and had some breathing space as far as trade regulations went which also contributed to their growth. This is {{in comparison with the}} previous Habsburg restrictions. In his article, Acemuglu uses this evidence to prove that Atlantic trade led to the enrichment of merchants, which resulted in the development of political institutions. Said institutions are responsible for constraining the power of the crown.|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Over {{the past}} 10 years, Australian {{researchers}} have actively pursued {{the development of}} new structural systems utilising fibre composites, for the rehabilitation and replacement of deteriorating civil infrastructure. The result has been a range of new systems which offer unprecedented levels of functionality at a cost which is <b>directly</b> <b>competitive</b> with traditional structural materials. Several of these systems have been successfully demonstrated in real world projects. To encourage these developments, the Australian composites industry has been investing in programs to develop codes and standards, and to establish an appropriate regulatory framework to ensure confidence in manufacture, supply and installation of composite products. This paper presents an overview of Australian research into infrastructure applications of fibre composites and associated industry development programs...|$|R

40|$|Shifts in {{the extent}} of competition, which affect markups, are {{possible}} sources of aggregate fluctuations. Markups are countercyclical; during booms the economy operates more efficiently. In our benchmark model, markups correspond to the prices of differentiated inputs relative to that of undifferentiated final product. If nominal prices of differentiated goods are relatively sticky, unexpected inflation reduces markups, mimicking the effects of increased competition. Similar effects stem from reductions in markups of foreign intermediates and unexpected inflation abroad. The models imply that prices of less <b>competitive</b> <b>goods</b> are more countercyclical. We find support for this hypothesis using data of four-digit manufacturing industries.

50|$|Trademark law {{traditionally}} concerned {{itself with}} situations where an unauthorized party sold <b>goods</b> that are <b>directly</b> <b>competitive</b> with {{or at least}} related to those sold by the trademark owner. A trademark is diluted when the use of similar or identical trademarks in other non-competing markets means that the trademark {{in and of itself}} will lose its capacity to signify a single source. In other words, unlike ordinary trademark law, dilution protection extends to trademark uses that do not confuse consumers regarding who has made a product. Instead, dilution protection law aims to protect sufficiently strong trademarks from losing their singular association in the public mind with a particular product, perhaps imagined if the trademark were to be encountered independently of any product (e.g., just the word Pepsi spoken, or on a billboard).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of product {{substitutability}} on Nash equilibrium distribution structures in a duopoly where each manufacturer distributes its goods through a single exclusive retailer, which may be either a franchised outlet or a factory store. Static linear demand and cost functions are assumed, {{and a number of}} rules about players' expectations of competitors' behavior are examined. It is found that for most specifications product substitutability does influence the equilibrium distribution structure. For low degrees of substitutability, each manufacturer will distribute its product through a company store; for more highly <b>competitive</b> <b>goods,</b> manufacturers {{will be more likely to}} use a decentralized distribution system. channel management, distribution, vertical integration, industry analysis, game, pricing...|$|R

Oxygen electrode studies revealed that over half of these extracts inhibited C 4 acid driven photosynthesis in leaf slices. Seventeen extracts had a deleterious effect on C 4 plants in vivo within 24 h, whereas 36 caused an observable phytotoxic response in {{one or both of the}} C 4 plants used for in vivo testing. None of the extracts inhibited PPDK metabolism of pyruvate via a <b>directly</b> <b>competitive</b> mechanism, instead hindering the enzyme by either mixed or uncompetitive means. This screening strategy, using a suite of assays, led to the isolation and identification of the herbicidal marine natural product ilimaquinone...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{macroeconomic}} consequences of large military buildups using a New Neoclassical Synthesis (NNS) approach that combines nominal rigidities within imperfectly <b>competitive</b> <b>goods</b> and labour markets. They {{show that the}} predictions of the NNS framework generally {{are consistent with the}} sign, timing, and magnitude of how hours worked, after-tax real wages, and output actually respond to an upsurge in military purchases. The key factors leading to these findings are: (i) variations in the ratio of price to marginal cost resulting from nominal-price inflexibilities, (ii) staggered nominal-wage setting, and (iii) time-varying marginal tax rates. Unlike the standard neoclassical model, the NNS framework successfully explains the macroeconomic effects of military buildups when taxes are distortionary.
