5|$|Janáček always deeply admired Antonín Dvořák, {{to whom he}} {{dedicated}} some of his works. He rearranged part of Dvořák's Moravian Duets for mixed choir with original piano accompaniment. In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Janáček became increasingly interested in the music of other European composers. His opera Destiny was a response to another significant and famous work in contemporary Bohemia – Louise, by the French composer Gustave Charpentier. The influence of Giacomo Puccini is apparent particularly in Janáček's later works, for example in his opera Káťa Kabanová. Although <b>he</b> <b>carefully</b> observed developments in European music, his operas remained firmly connected with Czech and Slavic themes.|$|E
5|$|Through March and April {{the divers}} and ships' crews worked to recover {{all manner of}} treasure: silver coins, silver bullion, doubloons, jewelry, {{a small amount of}} gold, and other artifacts. Concerned about the {{possibility}} of mutiny, Phips guaranteed to the crew, who had been hired for seaman's wages, that they would receive shares in the find, even if he had to pay them from his own percentage. <b>He</b> <b>carefully</b> avoided putting in at any ports before anchoring at Gravesend, where he dispatched a courier to London with the news.|$|E
5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent {{to him by his}} brother Berend, a geologist. <b>He</b> <b>carefully</b> studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of symmetry. From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His Metamorphosis I (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In Metamorphosis I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III, which is four metres long.|$|E

5|$|In November 1844, the {{anonymously}} published popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, {{written by}} Scottish journalist Robert Chambers, widened {{public interest in}} the concept of transmutation of species. Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but <b>he</b> <b>carefully</b> reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped {{to pave the way for}} the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, Herbert Spencer became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Political {{conflicts}} in Vienna delayed Austria's {{entry into the}} Third Coalition until 1805. After hostilities of the War of the Second Coalition ended in 1801, Archduke Charles—the emperor's brother—took advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan. <b>He</b> <b>carefully</b> put this plan into effect beginning in 1803–04, but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when Karl Mack, Lieutenant Field Marshal and Quartermaster-General of the Army, implemented his own restructuring. Mack bypassed Charles' methodical approach. Occurring in the field, Mack's plan also undermined the overall command and organizational structure. Regardless, Mack sent an enthusiastic report to Vienna on the military's readiness. Furthermore, after misreading Napoleon's maneuvers in Württemberg, Mack reported to Vienna on the weakness of French dispositions. His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor, Francis II, to enter the conflict against France, despite Charles' own advice to the contrary. Responding to the report and rampant anti-French fever in Vienna, Francis dismissed Charles from his post as generalissimo and appointed his Francophobic brother-in-law, Archduke Ferdinand, as commander.|$|E
5|$|The ancient font by {{the west}} door dates from the twelfth century, and has an arcaded basin. The plain pointed arch forms the only {{ornament}} on the font, which has an octagonal ashlar shaft now mounted on a platform, and supporting the octagonal basin. Unfortunately the font has been subject to extensive and clumsy repair. Unusually, it is made of Purbeck marble, which is normally found in churches in south and eastern England; the only other example in Wales is in St David's Cathedral. Documentary {{evidence suggests that the}} massive stem dates from at least the nineteenth century, and stylistic evidence suggests that it is probably a lot earlier; the font basin itself is undoubtedly ancient. Seddon's restoration work in the church commenced in 1869, and included dismantling the font. <b>He</b> <b>carefully</b> cleaned and stored the stonework, and re-erected it on new platform of Radyr conglomerate stone. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway. The font previously stood on a three step platform, in the same position as it now stands. The font cover is nineteenth century, in oak and wrought iron.|$|E

5|$|William Crabtree (1610–1644) was a cloth {{merchant}} from Broughton Spout, a hamlet in {{the township}} of Broughton near Manchester, {{which is now}} part of Salford. The son of John Crabtree, a Lancashire farmer of comfortable means, and Isabel Crabtree (née Pendleton), he was educated at a grammar school in Manchester– probably the forerunner of Manchester Grammar School, which was then situated between the Collegiate Church and what is now Chetham's School of Music. He worked in Manchester, married into a wealthy family and in his spare time studied mathematics and astronomy. <b>He</b> <b>carefully</b> measured the movements of the planets, undertook precise astronomical calculations and rewrote the existing Rudolphine Tables with improved accuracy. He maintained an active correspondence, much of it now lost, with Horrocks, two other young astronomers– William Gascoigne and Christopher Towneley– and Samuel Foster, Professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London and alumnus of Emmanuel College. It is not known whether Horrocks and Crabtree ever met in person but from 1636 they corresponded regularly, and, because of their shared interest in the work of Johannes Kepler, referred to themselves, along with William Gascoigne, as nos Keplari (we Keplarians).|$|E

25|$|Shivaji was {{extremely}} {{devoted to his}} mother Jijabai, who was deeply religious.

25|$|Hipparchus {{devised a}} {{geometrical}} method {{to find the}} parameters from three positions of the Moon, at particular phases of its anomaly. In fact, Ptolemy did this separately for the eccentric and the epicycle model. Ptolemy describes the details in the Almagest IV.11. Hipparchus used two sets of three lunar eclipse observations, which <b>he</b> <b>carefully</b> selected to satisfy the requirements. The eccentric model he fitted to these eclipses from his Babylonian eclipse list: 22/23December 383, 18/19June 382, and 12/13December 382. The epicycle model he fitted to lunar eclipse observations made in Alexandria at 22September 201, 19March 200, and 11September 200.|$|E
25|$|The {{chairman}} of the company, J. W. Pattinson, died in April 1931, after serving as chairman for 24 years. He was replaced by J. C. Kidd, another long-standing director, and Captain Borlase's son-in-law. <b>He</b> <b>carefully</b> analysed {{the decline in the}} company's profitability, concluding that the price of lead was simply too low. Operations were gradually scaled down, and a loss of £1,635 was made in the year to March 1933. The amount of proven ore reserves was still increasing, but the company was unable to finance the exploitation of new ground. Knowing the mine could be made profitable, the manager made a last attempt, in February 1934, to persuade the board of directors to inject enough capital to make Greenside a large-scale producer. No action was taken on his report and the company went into liquidation in March 1935.|$|E
25|$|In due course, Derfelden's {{division}} {{arrived at}} the front and was hurled into a new attack near Novi. Kray's wing attacked once more and his attack stalled. Around 11:30 am Suvarov directed the Allied left wing under Melas to advance. However, Melas declined to attack Novi as ordered. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>carefully</b> reconnoitered the ground and decided to assault the French right flank. The Austrian sent Nobili's two battalions and two squadrons south along the east bank of the Scrivia River toward Serravalle to guard against any French threat from that direction. The remainder of the left wing moved down {{the west bank of}} the river with Mittrowsky's brigade on the left and the grenadier brigades on the right. Melas instructed Lusignan's brigade to attack to the east of Novi while Loudon's brigade made a wider sweep to the east.|$|E

25|$|Sheridan had {{received}} wrong information {{so he thought}} the V Corps was in the rear and almost on the flank of the Confederates and therefore he mistakenly thought V Corps could launch an early, severe attack on Pickett's force. Warren had to carefully move Griffin's and Crawford's divisions because {{of the possibility of}} attack from the Confederates as they withdrew from the White Oak Road Line and at positions near Dinwiddie where Confederates were earlier positioned and <b>he</b> <b>carefully</b> supervised this in person, putting him {{at the end of the}} column when they troops moved. At 6:00a.m., Meade's Chief of Staff Alexander S. Webb sent an order to Warren to report to Sheridan for orders. Two divisions had done so within the hour, and before Warren {{had received}} the order, but Warren did not personally meet with Sheridan until 11:00a.m.|$|E
25|$|Dmitri Shostakovich {{entered the}} Petrograd Conservatory at age 13, {{becoming}} the youngest student there. He studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev and composition with Rimsky-Korsakov's son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg. He {{proved to be}} a disciplined, hard-working student. Glazunov may have recognized in Shostakovich an echo of his younger self. <b>He</b> <b>carefully</b> monitored his progress in Steinberg's class and, in awarding him his doctorate, recommended Shostakovich for a higher degree which normally would have led to a professorship. Due to his family's financial hardship, Shostakovich was not {{able to take advantage of}} this opportunity. Glazunov also arranged for the premiere of Shostakovich's First Symphony, which took place on 12 March 1926 with the Leningrad Philharmonic under Nikolai Malko. This was 44 years after Glazunov's First Symphony had first been presented in the same hall. In another instance of déjà vu with Glazunov's early life, the symphony caused almost as much of a sensation as the appearance of the 19-year-old Shostakovich on the stage awkwardly taking his bow.|$|E
25|$|Many biographies {{published}} before Rispens' work, {{state that}} Debye {{moved to the}} US because he refused to accept German citizenship forced on {{to him by the}} Nazis. He planned his departure from Germany during a visit with his mother in Maastricht in late 1939, boarded a ship in Genoa in January 1940 and arrived in New York in early February 1940. He immediately sought a permanent position in the US and accepted such an offer from Cornell in June 1940. That month, he crossed the US border into Canada and returned within days on an immigration visa. He was able to get his wife out of Germany and to the US by December 1940. Although his son already was in the US before he departed, Peter Debye's 19-year-old daughter and his sister-in-law did not leave. They lived in his official residence in Berlin and were supported by Debye's official Berlin wages (<b>he</b> <b>carefully</b> maintained an official leave of absence for this purpose).|$|E
