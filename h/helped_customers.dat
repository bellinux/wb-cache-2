50|$|Revenue {{collection}} and metering had remained low until the government passed the Water Code in 2002. The Code allowed utilities to partially forgive debt from unpaid bills {{in return for}} meter installation. Customers then paid {{the remainder of the}} unpaid bills in installments. Improved continuity of supply also <b>helped</b> <b>customers</b> to accept metering and tariff increases. The code also allowed cutting off non-paying customers. The improvement in collection efficiency and metering thus is not only due to private sector participation, but also to a change in government policy.|$|E

5000|$|Dashew did {{not feel}} he had the mathematic and {{mechanical}} aptitude required for architecture or engineering.

50|$|The {{growth of}} the fashion {{industry}} in California encouraged the company’s expansion to the state. The firm employed {{the services of a}} buying office in Los Angeles as early as 1939 and by 1945 opened its own. In 1948, it leased three floors and the mezzanine in a wing of the Welton Becket - William Wurdeman designed Prudential Insurance Company building on Wilshire Boulevard’s Miracle Mile. The success of the Miracle Mile store led the firm in 1953 to open another branch in Downtown Los Angeles when it acquired the twelve-story Milliron's building at 5th and Broadway. The success at this branch was short lived, however; it first closed five floors as an economic move, but finally, in 1959, closed the branch because of poor results. In the 1960s, additional branches were opened in La Mirada and Panorama City. Ohrbach's was a major anchor for the Los Cerritos Center in Cerritos, California in the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, they opened another store in the Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California. The architecture of the Cerritos and Glendale store had an unusual tile front which <b>helped</b> <b>customers</b> know which store was Ohrbach's in these new large malls with several major department stores. In 1965, the Miracle Mile store was relocated in the former Seibu Department Store at Wilshire and Fairfax Avenue. This is the current location of the Petersen Automotive Museum.Ohrbach's supplied clothing for the television soap operas: All My Children, Dark Shadows, The Doctors, the short lived weekly drama Coronet Blue, the comedy Mister Ed, I Love Lucy, The Donna Reed Show and others.|$|E

30|$|We do {{not find}} this {{argument}} completely convincing. It is obvious that access to the U.S. financial market is vital, {{but it is not}} obvious that access to the EU financial market is less vital. So why was the U.S. so much more successful than the EU in its handling of Switzerland? We are not legal or political science scholars, but it is interesting that the EU was negotiating with the Swiss government, whereas the DoJ was attacking Swiss corporations. Its first target was the biggest bank in the country, no less. This is in line with the guidelines set by the DoJ with respect to charging corporations: “[…] corporations are likely to take immediate remedial steps when one is indicted for criminal conduct that is pervasive throughout a particular industry, and thus an indictment often provides a unique opportunity for deterrence on a massive scale […]” (Holder (1999), Section I.B). It is conceivable that this strategy was far more effective than the shaming and negotiating strategy of the OECD and the EU. We agree with Emmenegger (2017) about the aftermath of the program: after it was publicly established that Swiss banks had <b>helped</b> <b>customers</b> to avoid taxation, it was impossible to keep bank secrecy alive.|$|E
