40|$|The term “Musical generalizations” {{refers to}} <b>generalizations</b> of {{artefacts}} – signs and tools – in a music context. Issues about these <b>generalizations</b> {{are defined by}} means of cultural historical activity theory. Musical <b>generalizations</b> {{can be seen as}} as man’s acquisition of music culture and as the transformation of external conditions into internal (mental) representations. By <b>generalizations</b> musical artefacts are transformed into psychological tools. <b>Generalizations</b> on the basis of two aspects of language, the conceptual and the phonetic, result in conceptual and auditory <b>generalizations.</b> In turn, auditory <b>generalizations</b> comprise both language intonation and musical structures. Children’s auditory <b>generalizations</b> are unconscious and their function includes an ability to predict and to interpret development of musical structures. Infants’ auditory <b>generalizations</b> are associated with the emotionalcommunicative context. Both conceptual and auditory <b>generalizations</b> may involve some contradictions, by which a rich and dynamic relation within the music activity is indicated. Within the hierarchical structure of music activity, the learning activity consists of three levels and is also connected to different kinds of <b>generalizations.</b> Knowledge about musical <b>generalizations</b> seems to be of interest for musical learning, music education and for issues concerning music health.

5|$|For surfaces, the <b>generalization</b> {{from the}} {{geometry}} of a plane –a flat surface– {{to that of a}} general curved surface had been described in the early 19th century by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This description had in turn been generalized to higher-dimensional spaces in a mathematical formalism introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s. With the help of Riemannian geometry, Einstein formulated a geometric description of gravity in which Minkowski's spacetime is replaced by distorted, curved spacetime, just as curved surfaces are a <b>generalization</b> of ordinary plane surfaces. Embedding Diagrams are used to illustrate curved spacetime in educational contexts.|$|E

Such geodesics are the <b>generalization</b> of the invariance of lightspeed in special relativity. As one examines suitable model spacetimes (either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or, for more than a single mass, the post-Newtonian expansion), several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge. Although the bending of light can also be derived by extending the universality of free fall to light, the angle of deflection resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity.|$|E
