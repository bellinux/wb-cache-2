25|$|A staunch anti-Communist, he was {{a member}} of the Italian Chamber of Deputies from 1958 to 1972, for the centre-right <b>Italian</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party</b> (Partito Liberale Italiano – PLI).|$|E
25|$|His {{period in}} office lasted until 1962. It {{was marked by}} the {{ambition}} {{to bring about a}} gradual “opening to the left”, whereby the Socialists and the (still Stalinist) Communist Party would be brought back into the national government, and Italy would abandon NATO, becoming a non-aligned country. There was however stiff parliamentary opposition to this project, particularly by the small <b>Italian</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party,</b> which was deemed a necessary ingredient of any viable majority.|$|E
25|$|National Alliance, {{launched}} in 1994, was officially founded in January 1995, when the Italian Social Movement (MSI), the former neo-fascist party, merged with conservative {{elements of the}} former Christian Democracy, which had disbanded in 1994 {{after two years of}} scandals and various splits due to corruption at its highest levels, exposed by the Mani pulite investigation, and the <b>Italian</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party,</b> disbanded in the same year. Former MSI members were however still the bulk of the new party and former MSI leader Gianfranco Fini was elected leader of the new party.|$|E

50|$|Autonomists for Europe (Autonomisti per l'Europa, ApE) {{was a minor}} regionalist, Christian-democratic and <b>liberal</b> <b>Italian</b> {{political}} <b>party.</b> Founded in 2000 by splinters of Lega Nord as {{a potentially}} dangerous competitor, it became a rather marginal force. Its leading members were Vito Gnutti and Domenico Comino, both former Ministers for Lega Nord in the Berlusconi I Cabinet.|$|R
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I a number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914. Once the war began, Austrian, British, French, German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their country's intervention in the war. The outbreak of the war had resulted in a surge of Italian nationalism and the war {{was supported by a}} variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was Gabriele d'Annunzio who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war. The <b>Italian</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party</b> under the leadership of Paolo Boselli promoted intervention in the war {{on the side of the}} Allies and utilized the Società Dante Alighieri to promote Italian nationalism. Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it. Prior to Mussolini taking a position on the war, a number of revolutionary syndicalists had announced their support of intervention, including Alceste De Ambris, Filippo Corridoni, and Angelo Oliviero Olivetti. The Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors had been killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week.|$|E
25|$|Italian {{nationalism}} was {{stirred by}} {{the outbreak of}} the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was Gabriele d'Annunzio, who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war. The <b>Italian</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party,</b> under the leadership of Paolo Boselli, promoted intervention in the war {{on the side of the}} Allies and used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism. Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it; some were militant supporters of the war, including Benito Mussolini and Leonida Bissolati. However, the Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week. The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including Mussolini. Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist Il Popolo d'Italia and the Fasci Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista ("Revolutionary Fasci for International Action") in October 1914 that later developed into the Fasci di Combattimento in 1919, the origin of fascism. Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create Il Popolo d'Italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Pentapartito – the five {{governing}} parties, Christian Democracy (Democrazia Cristiana), the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Social-Democratic Party, the Italian Republican Party and the <b>Italian</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party</b> – {{lost much of}} their electoral strength almost overnight due to {{a large number of}} judicial investigations concerning the financial corruption of many of their foremost members (see the Mani Pulite affair). This led to a general expectation that upcoming elections would be won by the Democratic Party of the Left, the heirs to the former Italian Communist Party, and their Alliance of Progressives coalition – unless an alternative arose. On 26 January 1994, Berlusconi announced his decision to enter politics, ("enter the field", in his own words) presenting his own political party, Forza Italia, on a platform focused on defeating the Communists. His political aim was to convince the voters of the Pentapartito, who were shocked and confused by Mani Pulite scandals, that Forza Italia offered both a fresh uniqueness and the continuation of the pro-western free market policies followed by Italy {{since the end of the}} Second World War. Shortly after he decided to enter the political arena, investigators into the Mani Pulite affair were said to be close to issuing warrants for the arrest of Berlusconi and senior executives of his business group. During his political career Berlusconi repeatedly stated that the Mani Pulite investigations were led by communist prosecutors who wanted to establish a soviet-style government in Italy.|$|E

5000|$|In 1950, {{following}} {{the removal of}} party General Secretary Roberto Lucifero (who represented the extreme right of the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party)</b> and the arrival in the post of Bruno Villabruna, who subsequently launched a determined move to make the party more mainstream, attempting to create a broadly based plotical [...] "third force", Cattani {{was among those who}} began to look for ways of drawing together the fractured strands of political liberalism. Through the MLI he set out his conditions for a liberal reunification, calling for a new <b>Italian</b> <b>Liberal</b> organisation that completely excluded the political right. Despite failing to obtain agreement on that, in December 1951 at the party conference in Turin, Cattani was among those calling for a liberal reunification.|$|R

However he succeeded Fossombroni in the Italian Chamber of Deputies in August of that year.|$|E
2500|$|The social-democratic {{majority}} was loosely organised, while {{including several}} organised movements: the Labourites – Liberal Socialists, Reformist Europe and the Sicilian [...] "Reformist Movement", all three splinter {{groups of the}} Italian Socialist Party; the Social Christians, which had emerged from the left-wing of Christian Democracy; the Republican Left, from the left-wing of the Italian Republican Party; and the Liberal Left, from the left-wing of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party.</b> A dissident group left the Labourites in order to launch Socialists and Europeans {{as a vehicle to}} oppose the party's merger with DL.|$|E

Moreover, the reconstitution of all political parties was forbidden. [...] Despite this prohibition, representatives of the political parties met on 26 July in Milan, on the night of 27 July in Rome, under the direction of Ivanoe Bonomi, and again in Rome on the 2nd of August. [...] Members of Christian Democracy, the <b>Italian</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party,</b> the Italian Socialist Party, the Action Party, and the Italian Communist Party started the organization of a common action against the government; at the same time, several demonstrations against Badoglio resulted in 83 deaths and several hundreds wounded around the country.|$|E

6000|$|I cannot close these volumes without expressing my astonishment {{and regret}} at the {{facility}} with which the English {{allow themselves to be}} misled by any representations, however openly groundless or ridiculous, proceeding from the <b>Italian</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>party,</b> respecting the present administration of the Austrian Government. I do not choose here to enter into any political discussion, or express any political opinion; but it is due to justice to state the simple facts which came under my notice during my residence in Italy. I was living at Venice through two entire winters, and in the habit of familiar association both with Italians and Austrians, my own antiquarian vocations rendering such association possible without exciting the distrust of either party. During this whole period, I never once was able to ascertain, from any liberal Italian, that he had a single definite ground of complaint against the Government. There was much general grumbling and vague discontent; but I never was able to bring one of them to the point, or to discover what it was that they wanted, or in what way they felt themselves injured; nor did I ever myself witness an instance of oppression {{on the part of the}} Government, though several of much kindness and consideration. The indignation of those of my own countrymen and countrywomen whom I happened to see during their sojourn in Venice was always vivid, but by no means large in its grounds. English ladies on their first arrival invariably began the conversation with the same remark: [...] "What a dreadful thing it was to be ground under the iron heel of despotism!" [...] Upon closer inquiries it always appeared that being [...] "ground under the heel of despotism" [...] was a poetical expression for being asked for one's passport at San Juliano, and required to fetch it from San Lorenzo, full a mile and a quarter distant. In like manner, travellers, after two or three days' residence in the city, used to return with pitiful lamentations over [...] "the misery of the Italian people." [...] Upon inquiring what instances they had met with of this misery, it invariably turned out that their gondoliers, after being paid three times their proper fare, had asked for something to drink, and had attributed the fact of their being thirsty to the Austrian Government. The misery of the Italians consists in having three festa days a week, and doing in their days of exertion about one fourth as much work as an English laborer.|$|E
