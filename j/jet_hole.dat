In order to study the influence of transverse injection on the flow field of cavity in advanced vortex combustor, the turbulence flow and the fuel distribution under the influence of different assignments of <b>jet</b> <b>holes</b> were simulated numerically. The results show that the different assignments of <b>jet</b> <b>holes</b> have a bigger impact on the geometry and center of vortex, but lesser on the total pressure of combustor. The content of fuel reduces quickly in the jet direction, injection can improve the mixing of fuel and air.

The tests were carried out using a single test transient IR thermography technique. Evaluation of the cooling performance is obtained by estimated both film cooling effectiveness and heat flux ratios.

It was found that the interaction and diffusion of the coolant air with hot stream present moderate film temperature beyond the downstream row; this flow is mixed with the coming counter vortex pair from downstream row improved the film cooling effectiveness. Experimentally, staggered arrangement gives better coolant performance than that of inline arrangement. The investigation also showed that using the upstream staggered oriented jet over conventional single jet enhanced the average cooling performance by 20. 7 %, 28. 9 %, and 37. 8 % for BR = 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5, respectively...|$|R

The experiments were performed using a piccolo tube with three rows of aligned <b>jet</b> <b>holes</b> {{over a wide range}} of parameters: the jet Reynolds number (Rej) from 50, 000 to 90, 000, the relative tube-to-surface distance (H/d) from 1. 74 to 20. 0, the jet impingement angle (α) from 66 ° to 90 °, and the relative chordwise arc length in the jet impingement zone (r/d) from 13. 2 to 34. 8. Experimental results indicated that the heat transfer performance at the stagnation point was enhanced with increasing Rej and α, and an optimal H/d existed to achieve the best heat transfer performance at the stagnation point corresponding to specific operating parameters. It was found that the attenuation coefficient curve of jet impingement heat transfer in the chordwise direction exhibited an approximate bell shape with the peak located at the stagnation point, affected only by r/d in the peak zone. In the non-peak zone, however it was affected significantly by a variety of factors including Rej, H/d and r/d.

The governing equations comprise the Navier-Stokes equations plus additional transport equations for different species {{to simulate the}} non-reacting gas mixture of an air-like crossflow and a CO 2 cooling jet. The parameters governing the flow field have been chosen to mimic the conditions in a gas turbine, i. e., the freestream Reynolds number is Re ∞ = 400, 000, the streamwise inclination angle of the cooling jet injection is α = 30 o, the velocity ratio ranges from V R = 0. 1 − 0. 48, and the ratio of boundary layer thickness to <b>jet</b> <b>hole</b> diameter is δ/D = 2.

40|$|Numerical {{studies have}} been {{performed}} to visualize vortical flow structures emerged from jet cross-flow interactions. A single square jet issuing perpendicularly into a cross-flow was simulated first, followed by two additional scenarios, that is, inclined square jet at angles of 30 ° and 60 ° and round and elliptic jets at an angle of 90 °, respectively. The simulation considers a jet to cross-flow velocity ratio of 2. 5 and a Reynolds number of 225, based on the free-stream flow quantities and the jet exit width in case of square jet or minor axis length in case of elliptic jet. For the single square jet, the vortical flow structures simulated are in good qualitative agreement with the findings by other researchers. Further analysis reveals that the jet penetrates deeper into the cross-flow field for the normal jet, and the decrease of the jet inclination angle weakens the cross-flow entrainment in the near-wake region. For both noncircular and circular <b>jet</b> <b>hole</b> shapes, the flow field {{in the vicinity of}} the jet exit has been dominated by large-scale dynamic flow structures and it was found that the elliptic <b>jet</b> <b>hole</b> geometry has maximum “lifted-off” effect among three hole configurations studied.

40|$|The {{leading edge}} of a gas turbine engine nozzle guide vane or {{rotating}} blade is typically protected by a combined jet and effusion cooling. The compressed air jet, impinging on the interior surface of the leading edge, offers a high heat transfer coefficient. The coolant then exits partly through the effusion or film holes and partly along the edges or side ways of the gas turbine blade. Among various factors influencing the heat transfer rate, {{the ratio of the}} spacing (H) between the target plate and the jet exit and the diameter (D) of the jet plays a major role. Several researchers in the past analyzed the effect of H/D on the transport rate for single and multiple jets with and without film holes and ascertained its influence on a flat surface [1, 2]. However, very few studies are made on curved surfaces [3] and the effect of H/D on the combined jet impingement with effusion is not reported.

Square array impingement cooling geometries for the <b>jet</b> <b>holes</b> were used with a 152. 4 × 152. 4 mm experimental wall area. The impingement gap had a single sided exit which generated a cross-flow in the gap. The number of impingement holes N in the cross-flow direction was 5, 10, 15 and 25. A coolant mass flux G of 1. 93 kg/sm 2 bar was investigated at a constant impingement gap Z of 10 mm (Z/D 1. 53 – 7. 65 as n was varied).

Experimental results indicate that the surface curvature has opposite effects on heat transfer characteristics.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to increase the number and extent of entanglements in nonwoven fabrics produced with water jets while reducing water and energy expenditures to allow higher production rates and improved fabric properties. Recent studies of impinging jet flows have shown that momentum and heat transfer can be significantly improved if the jet flow is pulsed (Zumbrunnen, 1996). Moreover, when the <b>jet</b> <b>holes</b> are elliptical, <b>jet</b> free surfaces are formed into a helical structure. These helical structures in a jet flow can be readily observed by squeezing a garden hose into an elliptic shape. Upon pulsating the jet flow, the helical structure rotates and a strong twisting action can be imparted where the jet strikes a surface. The helical structure has greater definition in jets of very small diameter, such as those used in hydroentanglement systems, since surface tension forces are larger. Pulsations and elliptic free surfaces in impinging jet flows may thereby be an effective means of improving fiber entanglement. Pulsations might also be used to impart unique patterns in nonwoven fabrics since jet-to-jet interaction can be altered by changing pulsation frequency and magnitude. With this rationale, our objective is to perform controlled experiments where the effect of flow pulsation...|$|R
