40|$|In this talk, we {{determine}} {{the region of}} feasible post-impact states for a finite degree of freedom multi-body system in dependence of the known pre-impact state in a geometrical way. We model the perfect con-tacts by means of set-valued force laws on displacement level. These force laws define a translated convex cone in the tangent space specifying the kinetically feasible post-impact states. In addition to the kinetic and kinematic restrictions, the kinetic energy of an ideal constrained mechanical system is bounded with respect to {{what we call a}} reference velocity. Since some certain rheonomic multi-contact systems do not have reference velocities we are enforced to restate the energy concept applying the contact work concept. The goal of our approach is to end up with a general impact law by stating a parametrization of the set of all possible post-impact states. In the second part of our talk, we validate the general impact law based on the equations mentioned above with experiments on multi-contact collisions. Tested config-urations are chains of balls (Newton’s cradle). Configu-rations with chains of longitudinal <b>bars</b> and <b>forked</b> <b>bars</b> are scheduled. Based on the experimental data the post-impact states are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Single contact {{collisions}} of rigid {{bodies are}} treated by smooth {{as well as}} non–smooth theories in a, more or less, satisfying way. If the complexity of a system, namely the number of contacts, increases, non-smooth approaches show considerable advantages compared to smooth ones: The treatment of impacts as singleton downsizes the problem, since no compression and/or restitution periods have to be resolved. In exchange a general impact law, based on energetic and kinemati-cal considerations, is introduced. The cone of feasible post–impact–states given by the impact law is repre-sented e. g. by a matrix allowing each contact j to di-rectly interact with all other contacts i, as has been pro-posed by Frémond. To validate this general impact law, experiments on multibody collisions are necessary. Interesting impact configurations are chains of balls (Newton’s Cradle) as well as longitudinal bars of different length and <b>forked</b> <b>bars.</b> The influence of wave effects on the topology of the multi contact collision increases with increas-ing longitudinal dimension, whereas for balls the re-sults correlate {{to the theory of}} Hertz.

500|$|The Rhodes piano {{features}} a keyboard {{with a similar}} layout to a traditional acoustic piano, but some models contain 73 keys instead of 88. The touch and action of the keyboard {{is designed to be}} as close to a piano as possible. Pressing a key results in a hammer striking a thin metal rod called a tine connected to a larger [...] "tone bar". The whole [...] "tone generator assembly" [...] acts as a tuning <b>fork,</b> the tone <b>bar</b> reinforcing and extending the vibrations of the tine. A pickup sits opposite the tine, picking up its vibrations and inducing an electric current in a similar manner to an electric guitar. The basic mechanical act of hitting tines does not need an external power supply, and a Rhodes will make sound even when not plugged into an amplifier, though like an unplugged electric guitar the sound will be weak.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of small run-of-the-river projects such as Charles Tulloch's 1895 hydro plant, the first major hydroelectric project on the Stanislaus River was the 1916 Spring Gap Powerhouse near Strawberry, constructed by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and still in operation today. Water diverted from the South Fork plunges more than 1800 ft down a mountainside to a seven megawatt power station on the Middle Fork. In 1939 PG&E completed the much larger Stanislaus Powerhouse near {{the confluence of the}} Middle and North Forks. Water was diverted from the Middle <b>Fork</b> at Sand <b>Bar</b> Dam, and a 11.4 mi long tunnel was drilled through the mountains to carry it to the powerhouse. Because the water is diverted so far upstream, it affords a head of over 1000 ft to the Stanislaus Powerhouse; the much heavier flow of the Middle Fork means that more power can be generated - about 91 megawatts at full capacity.|$|R
60|$|So, on {{this morning}} when hell yawned for him, he was ready and eager to meet all comers. They came, {{equipped}} with formulas, nooses, and <b>forked</b> iron <b>bars.</b> Five of them tossed nooses in through the bars upon {{the floor of his}} cage. He snarled and struck at the curling ropes, and for ten minutes was a grand and impossible wild creature, lacking in nothing save the wit and the patience possessed by the miserable two-legged things. And then, impatient and careless of the inanimate ropes, he paused, snarling at the men, with one hind foot resting inside a noose. The next moment, craftily lifted up about the girth of his leg by an iron fork, the noose tightened and the bite of it sank home into his flesh and pride. He leaped, he roared, he was a maniac of ferocity. Again and again, almost burning their palms, he tore the rope smoking through their hands. But ever they took in the slack and paid it out again, until, ere he was aware, a similar noose tightened on his foreleg. What he had done was nothing to what he now did. But he was stupid and impatient. The man-creatures were wise and patient, and a third leg and a fourth leg were finally noosed, so that, with many men tailing on to the ropes, he was dragged ignominiously on his side to the bars, and, ignominiously, through the bars were hauled his four legs, his chiefest weapons of offence after his terribly fanged jaws.|$|R
50|$|Redline Engineering: January 1, 1986-November 9, 1986. Due to {{financial}} difficulties GHP {{could no longer}} field a factory team, not even Greg Hill himself who was paying his way to races from his own winnings and salary. As {{part of the deal}} with Redline, Greg Hill had to divest himself from GHP. GHP also could not use Greg Hill's name in any promotional advertising or any other association, which of course included the name of the company. His father ran the company under a new name for the remainder of its existence. This is the same terms that drove Pete Loncarevich from Scot Enterprises Racing (SER), when SE Racing wanted Pete Loncarevich's father to shut down Loncarevich Racing Products (LRP), which did not make bicycles or bicycle frames and forks, but other BMX accessories. Pete Loncarevich later had to accept these terms when he signed with Custom Works (CW). Companies do not want to potentially aid rivals in the same business as they are, and Greg Hill Products were clearly competitors that marketed its own line of complete bicycles and major components like frames, <b>forks</b> and handle <b>bars.</b> GHP was finally shut down in July 1986 some six months after Greg Hill signed with Redline. He was able to revive Greg Hill Products in 1992 after going into semi-retirement from racing and devote more time to it.|$|R
40|$|We explore several {{counting}} constructs for logics {{with team}} semantics. Counting {{is an important}} task in numerous applications, but with a somewhat delicate relationship to logic. Team semantics {{on the other side}} is the mathematical basis of modern logics of dependence and independence, in which formulae are evaluated not for a single assignment of values to variables, but for a set of such assignments. It is therefore interesting to ask what kind of counting constructs are adequate in this context, and how such constructs influence the expressive power, and the model-theoretic and algorithmic properties of logics with team semantics. Due to the second-order features of team semantics there is a rich variety of potential counting constructs. Here we study variations of two main ideas: forking atoms and counting quantifiers. Forking counts how many different values for a tuple w occur in assignments with coinciding values for v. We call this the <b>forking</b> degree of <b>bar</b> v with respect to <b>bar</b> w. <b>Forking</b> is powerful enough to capture many of the previously studied atomic dependency properties. In particular we exhibit logics with forking atoms that have, respectively, precisely the power of dependence logic and independence logic. Our second approach uses counting quantifiers E^{geq mu} of a similar kind as used in logics with Tarski semantics. The difference is that these quantifiers are now applied to teams of assignments that may give different values to mu. We show that, on finite structures, there is an intimate connection between inclusion logic with counting quantifiers and FPC, fixed-point logic with counting, which is a logic of fundamental importance for descriptive complexity theory. For sentences, the two logics have the same expressive power. Our analysis is based on a new variant of model-checking games, called threshold safety games, on a trap condition for such games, and on game interpretations...|$|R
