50|$|This flux {{conservation}} can {{be demonstrated}} from Maxwell's equations. The most intuitive explanation of this conservation of enclosed flux follows from the principle that any change in an electromagnetic system provokes an effect in order to oppose the change. For this reason, reducing {{the area of the}} surface enclosed by a conductor, which would reduce the magnetic flux, results in the <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> in the electrical conductor, which tends to return the enclosed flux to its original value. In magneto-explosive generators, this phenomenon is obtained by various techniques which depend on powerful explosives. The compression process allows the chemical energy of the explosives to be (partially) transformed into the energy of an intense magnetic field surrounded by a correspondingly large electric current.|$|E

I used a 3 -D modeling algorithm based upon an extension of a generalized thin sheet analysis due to Ranganayaki and Madden (1980) to examine field distortions in crustal environments. Three major physical mechanisms cause these distortions. These mechanisms are resistive coupling between the electrical mantle and upper crust, resistive coupling between conductive features within the upper crust, and local <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> loops within good conductors.

40|$|Using {{the balance}} of forces in the linear regime, it is shown that the ratio between the induced voltage in an open circuit Coulomb drag experiment, and the induced current in closed circuit, equals the {{internal}} resistence of the circuit in which the induction occurs. During the last decade much attention was given to a mechanism of current/voltage induction between two isolated systems (in the sense that momentum trans-fer via particles exchange is prohibited) made possible through Coulomb interaction between carriers at each of them. Such mechanism has been called Coulomb Drag (CD). The predictions made by Progrebinskii [1] and Price[2], have been conrmed later by Solomon et al [3] and, more recently, {{by a series of}} experiments involving quasi-two-dimensional systems in semicon-ductor double quantum wells [4, 5]. Placing two 2 D-dimensional electron systems close to each other, and separated by a potential barrier, when an electromotive force is applied in one of them, an induced voltage is observed in the other in an open circuit condition, or an induced current will appear, in the case of closed circuit. In linear regime, a transresistivity is dened as the ratio between the induced electric eld and the driving current density. Improvements, like the inclu-sion of phonons drag, indirect Coulomb interaction by virtual phonons, usage of eld theoretical techniques, etc., contributed to the fast development of this sub-ject in recent years. In general, experiments and calculations are per-formed in a open circuit set-up, since the existence of a current in the induced circuit makes the calculation much more complicate. In this work we used the Bal-ance Equations formalism [6] to study, in the linear regime of a CD experiment, the relation between in-duction of voltage and <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> in open and closed circuit situations.

The SLHs resulted from spontaneous transient outward currents (spontaneous TOCs) measured under voltage-clamp (- 40 or- 50 mV). Acetylcholine (ACh; 10 juM) increased SLHs and TOCs in amplitude and frequency. Atropine blocked the ACh effects. ACh-induced SLHs or TOCs were suppressed by bath application of tetraethylammonium (1 or 10 mM) or by cell dialysis with cesium, suggesting that they result from <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> potassium <b>currents.</b> In cell-attached patches, <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> <b>currents</b> through 130 -pS potassium channels was recorded when ACh was bath-applied.

Recordings showed that both normal and tumor cells exhibit an increase in K+ currents after treatment with radiation, H 2 O 2, and xanthine/xanthine oxidase but not with high specific activity [3 H]thymidine, suggesting that the signal for K+ channel activation originates at the cell membrane.
