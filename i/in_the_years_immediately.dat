40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} migration, residential location, and commute distance within Toronto‟s commuter shed. The study utilizes data from the master file of the 2006 Canadian Census. This master file contains the previous residential locations of recent migrants, thus allowing migrants to be disaggregated by duration of residence. Multivariate regressions indicate that living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most accessible rural areas and being a recent migrant are significantly associated with longer commutes. Furthermore, the Canadian Census distinguishes between those who migrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>immediately</b> prior to <b>the</b> Census, and those who migrated one to five-years prior to the Census date. Findings demonstrate that the commute distance of very recent migrants (those who migrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>immediately</b> prior to <b>the</b> census) have the longest commute distances. As residential duration increases, commute distanc...|$|R

5|$|Cædwalla's {{departure}} in 688 {{appears to}} have led to instability {{in the south of}} England.

This could indicate an unsettled period between Cædwalla's abdication and Ine's accession. The kingship also changed in Kent in 688, with Oswine, who was apparently a Mercian client, taking the throne; and there is evidence of East Saxon influence in Kent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>immediately</b> following Cædwalla's abdication.|$|E

Under the terms of Article II of the treaty, South Carolina and her sister Michigan were to be scrapped. The ship was decommissioned on 15 December, but was not formally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register until 10 November 1923.
