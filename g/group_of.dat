In 1981, Alabama won both the Vocal <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> the Year and Instrumental <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> the Year honors from the CMAs. It also won the ACM's Vocal <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> the Year award, and Billboard New <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> the Year honors. The group won the CMA's prestigious Entertainer of the Year award for three {{consecutive}} years (1982–84), and the ACM's Entertainer of the Year award five times (1982–86). In 1989, Alabama was named Artist of the Decade by the ACM. In addition, Alabama has also received the NARM Gift of Music award, the Alabama Hall of Fame Distinguished Service award, the Country Radio Broadcasters Humanitarian Award, the Prince Matchabelli National Hero Award, the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.|$|E
