25|$|The {{chemotherapy}} or irradiation given immediately {{prior to}} a transplant is called the conditioning regimen, the purpose {{of which is to}} help eradicate the patient's disease prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ablated (destroyed) with dose-levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. In allogeneic transplants a combination of cyclophosphamide with total body irradiation is conventionally employed. This treatment also has an <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effect</b> that prevents rejection of the HSC by the recipient's immune system. The post-transplant prognosis often includes acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease that may be life-threatening. However, in certain leukemias this can coincide with protection against cancer relapse owing to the graft-versus-tumor effect. Autologous transplants may also use similar conditioning regimens, but many other chemotherapy combinations can be used {{depending on the type of}} disease.|$|E

40|$|Immunoregulatory {{functions}} of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) were examined. As in fibroblasts isolated from other tissues, HGF were activated with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to express HLA-DR molecules. Despite {{the fact that}} the IFN-gamma-treated HGF showed phenotypical resemblance to so-called antigen-presenting cells (APC), the IFN-gamma-treated HGF were ineffective stimulators of alloreactive peripheral T cells. Conversely, IFN-gamma-treated HGF dramatically inhibited the proliferative responses of allogeneic APC (allo-APC) or phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated T cells. <b>Immunosuppressive</b> <b>effects</b> of culture supernatant (CS) of IFN-gamma-treated HGF were low and were completely abrogated by the addition of indomethacin. Moreover, the production of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) by HGF was not affected by IFN-gamma. These results suggest that IFN-gamma-dependent <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effects</b> of HGF were not due to PGE 2 produced by HGF. In order to investigate further the mechanism(s) of IFN-gamma-dependent <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effects</b> of HGF, activated T cells and IFN-gamma-treated HGF were separately cultured in the same well by collagen films which were assembled in cylindrical cells and disturbed physical interactions between T cells and HGF. The proliferative responses of T cells which directly contacted with IFN-gamma-treated HGF were inhibited more significantly than those of T cells which did not contact with IFN-gamma-treated HGF. This suggests that IFN-gamma-dependent <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effects</b> of HGF were mediated by direct interactions between T cells and activated HGF. The present results suggest that IFN-gamma-stimulated HGF would modulate the immune responses of locally infiltrated T cells in periodontal lesions...|$|R

50|$|In the {{treatment}} of sickle-cell disease, hydroxycarbamide increases the concentration of fetal hemoglobin. The precise mechanism of action is not yet clear, {{but it appears that}} hydroxycarbamide increases nitric oxide levels, causing soluble guanylyl cyclase activation with a resultant rise in cyclic GMP, and the activation of gamma globin gene expression and subsequent gamma chain synthesis necessary for fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production (which does not polymerize and deform red blood cells like the mutated HbS, responsible for sickle cell disease). Adult red cells containing more than 1% HbF are termed F cells. These cells are progeny of a small pool of immature committed erythroid precursors (BFU-e) that retain the ability to produce HbF. Hydroxyurea also suppresses the production of granulocytes in the bone marrow which has a mild <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effect</b> particularly at vascular sites where sickle cells have occluded blood flow.|$|E
50|$|Other models {{suggest that}} ManLAM acts to mediate <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effects</b> through {{suppression}} of LPS-induced IL-12 p40 protein production.

The present study was performed to reveal the involvement of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) axis in the <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effects</b> of AFB 1 on C 57 B/ 6 mice. Splenic lymphocy 1 es were assayed to investigate their phenotyping using flow cy 1 ometry, proliferative response against mitogen and allogenic lymphocy 1 es, cy 1 oly 1 ic cell activity, and IL- 2 production. In addition, antibody-mediated immunocompetence was checked using sheep red blood cell (SRBC) -challenged animals by plaque-forming cell (PFC) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in brain hypothalamus and cerebral cortex, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and corticosterone were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Hypothalamic catecholamine and its metabolites were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The adrenalectomized animals and their respective control animals were used to evaluate corticosterone involvement in AFB 1 <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effects.</b> A relatively higher dose was applied in the present study, compared to the previous studies that used different strains of mice. <b>Immunosuppressive</b> <b>effects</b> were observed in blastogenic response, IL- 2 production, and primary antibody production of splenic cells. The amount of circulating anti-SRBC antibody was also affected. Decreases were observed in the helper-T cell and B cell percentage in phenotyping splenic lymphocyte. No significant changes were observed in natural killer cell activity, mixed lymphocyte response, brain biogenic amine concentrations, concentration of CRF in the hypothalamus, and those of ACTH and corticosterone in plasma. However, the expected effect of adrenalectomy to compensate for the immunosuppression of AFB 1 was not observed. The results indicate that the HPA axis {{does not appear to have}} a major role in AFB 1 -induced immunotoxicity...|$|R

50|$|Fisher’s {{discoveries in}} HIV were {{extensive}} and critical {{for future research}} of the virus’s characteristics. She produced the first functional copies of HIV, allowing her and other scientists to access biologically active material for future research of the virus’s genes. She determined the roles {{of several of the}} genes in HIV. These findings have been significant in studying and understanding different characteristics of HIV and Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Whilst at the NIH, Fisher developed approaches that allowed the successful introduction of exogenous DNA onto human blood cells. Two methods, protoplast fusion and electroporation, proved successful and allowed Fisher to test whether molecular clones isolated from HIV-infected cultures could generate infectious retrovirus upon transfection. Fisher showed in 1985 that molecular clones of HIV, contained within approximately 18kb of contiguous proviral DNA, were biologically active and generated cytopathic virus when introduced into primary human T-cells. This discovery was important s it established that products of the viral genome itself, rather than a cofactor or contaminant, were capable of killing human T cells and were therefore potentially capable of mediating the <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effect</b> of HIV. it also provided the basis for dissecting the molecular function of each of the viral genes and for developing DNA-based diagnostic tests for HIV infection. In the following 4 years, Fisher showed that the transactivator gene tat was essential for virus replication, that truncation of the 3' open reading frame disrupts virus cytopathogenicity, and that sor (now called vif) is required for efficient cell to cell transmission of HIV virus. With clinical collaborators from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Redfield and Looney), Fisher showed that patient antisera displayed type-specific neutralising properties and that multiple HIV isolates derived from a single patient were biologically diverse and contained replication-competent as well as replication-incompetent cytopathic variants. These studies performed more than 20 years ago, gave some of the first hints that a successful HIV vaccine might prove difficult to engineer.|$|E

Addition of macrophages could not counteract the in vitro <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effects</b> of lymphocyte IF, suggesting that the main effect is exerted directly on lymphocytes. Sendai virus-induced leucocyte (type I) IF was also shown to have suppressive effects in vivo and in vitro.

40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that {{morphine}} induces significant immunosuppression, the potential immunosuppressive activity of morphine derived drugs commonly used in the treatment of pain (codeine, hydromorphone, oxycodone) has never been evaluated. We evaluated in the mouse the effect of the natural opiates (morphine and codeine) and synthetic derivatives (hydromorphone, oxycodone, nalorphine, naloxone and naltrexone) on antinociceptive thresholds and immune parameters (splenocyte proliferation, Natural Killer (NK) cell activity and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production). Morphine displayed a potent <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effect</b> that was not dose-related to the antinociceptive effect, codeine possessed a weak antinociceptive effect and limited immunosuppressive activity; nalorphine, a μ-antagonist and κ-agonist, exerted a potent <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effect,</b> but had very weak antinociceptive activity. The pure κ-antagonist nor-BNI antagonized the antinociceptive, but not the immunosuppresive effect of nalorphine. Hydromorphone and oxycodone, potent antinociceptive drugs, were devoid of immunosuppressive effects. The pure antagonists naloxone and naltrexone potentiated immune responses. Our data indicate that the C 6 carbonyl substitution, together with the presence of a C 7 - 8 single bond potentiates the antinociceptive effect, but abolishes immunosuppression (hydromorphone and oxycodone). The single substitution of an allyl on the piperidinic ring resulted in a molecule that antagonized the antinociceptive effect but maintained the <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effect.</b> Molecules that carry modifications of C 6, the C 7 - 8 bond and C 14, together with an allyl or caboxymethyl group on the piperidinic ring antagonized both the antinociceptive and the <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effect</b> of opiates and were themselves immunostimulants...|$|E

A PHA response was not affected. Using a conventional lymphocyte culture technique, PHA response was unchanged during treatment with all three MoAbs, indicating that the <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effect</b> of OKT 3 and T 3. G 2 a is probably dependent upon the presence of MoAb in culture medium and is reversible. In addition, we tested in vitro inhibition of aspecific mitogen- or antigen-induced lymphocyte stimulation by OKT 3, T 3. A and T 3. G 2 a. It appeared that at low concentrations (< 25 ng/ml) T 3. G 2 a and OKT 3 exerted a stronger <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>effect</b> than T 3. A. However, at higher concentrations T 3. A, OKT 3 and T 3. G 2 a were equally immunosuppressive.
