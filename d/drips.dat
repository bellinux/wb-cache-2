5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that <b>drips</b> out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E

5|$|Spines, {{which are}} {{modified}} leaves, are present on even those cacti with true leaves, showing {{the evolution of}} spines preceded the loss of leaves. Although spines have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, at maturity they contain little or no water, being composed of fibers made up of dead cells. Spines provide protection from herbivores and camouflage in some species, and assist in water conservation in several ways. They trap air near {{the surface of the}} cactus, creating a moister layer that reduces evaporation and transpiration. They can provide some shade, which lowers the temperature of the surface of the cactus, also reducing water loss. When sufficiently moist air is present, such as during fog or early morning mist, spines can condense moisture, which then <b>drips</b> onto the ground and is absorbed by the roots.|$|E
5|$|In 1910s, London, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) {{is called}} to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a {{sapphire}} ring on its finger. Chester steals it, accidentally tipping over {{a glass of water}} which <b>drips</b> on the floor; she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and witnesses strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her, and the lights in her apartment go out as the sound of the dripping water is heard from various locations. Chester finds the woman's corpse lying in her bed. It rises and floats toward her. Chester begs for forgiveness, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chester's body and calls the police. The pathologist arrives to examine the body and only finds a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor announces this observation, the concierge appears distressed and hears the dripping of water.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} chapel's ceiling, Michelangelo {{designed}} his own scaffold, a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from {{holes in the}} wall {{near the top of}} the windows, rather than being built up from the floor. Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber. According to Michelangelo's pupil and biographer Ascanio Condivi, the brackets and frame that supported the steps and flooring were all put in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen, possibly cloth, was suspended beneath them to catch plaster <b>drips,</b> dust, and splashes of paint. Only half the building was scaffolded at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages. The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas across the bottom of the lunettes. The holes were re-used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration.|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{interacting}} protein 205 (<b>DRIP</b> 205) is {{a mediator}} complex protein that anchors the complex to the estrogen receptor (ER) and other nuclear receptors (NRs). In ZR- 75 breast cancer cells treated with 17 ?-estradiol (E 2) and transfected with a construct containing three tandem estrogen responsive elements (pERE 3), <b>DRIP</b> 205 coactivates ER?-mediated transactivation. <b>DRIP</b> 205 ? 587 - 636 is a <b>DRIP</b> 205 mutant {{in which both}} NR boxes within amino acids 587 - 636 have been deleted and, in parallel transfection studies, <b>DRIP</b> 205 ? 587 - 636 also coactivates ER?. Moreover, both wild-type and variant <b>DRIP</b> 205 also colocalize with ER? in the nuclei of transfected cells. AF 1 and AF 2 of ER? are both required for <b>DRIP</b> 205 coactivation. Extensive deletion analysis of <b>DRIP</b> 205 shows that multiple domains of this protein {{play a role in}} coactivation of ER? and in interactions with ER?. On the other hand, both <b>DRIP</b> 205 and <b>DRIP</b> 205 ? 587 - 636 coactivate E 2 -induced transactivation of ER?/Sp 1 in cells transfected with a construct containing three GC-rich sites (pSp 13). Coactivation of ER?/Sp 1 by <b>DRIP</b> 205 is dependent on AF 1 of ER?. Enhancement of ER? and ER?/Sp 1 by <b>DRIP</b> 205 does not require NR boxes of <b>DRIP</b> 205, and deletion mutants <b>DRIP</b> 205 (1 - 714) and <b>DRIP</b> 205 (516 - 1566) significantly coactivate ER? and ER?/Sp 1. RNA interference study showed that <b>DRIP</b> 205 coactivation of ER?/Sp was abolished in cells transfected with iSp 3 and iSp 4, suggesting that Sp 3 and Sp 4 are required for coactivation of ER?/Sp by <b>DRIP</b> 205 in ZR- 75 cells...|$|R
40|$|Fog <b>drip</b> {{and related}} microclimatic factors were {{measured}} between January 1999 and December 2002 at a tropical seasonal rain forest in Xishuangbanna, South-West China. During the study period, the annual average fog <b>drip</b> was 89. 4 +/- 13. 5 mm (mean +/- 1 SD). Fog <b>drip</b> contributes an estimated 5 '% {{of the annual}} rainfall, with 86 % of the fog <b>drip</b> occurring in the dry season (November-April). Annual fog <b>drip</b> was negatively correlated with annual rainfall. Monthly variation in fog <b>drip</b> was also negatively correlated with monthly rainfall. Average daily fog <b>drip</b> was 0. 38 +/- 10. 2 7 mm d(- 1) for all days on which fog <b>drip</b> occurred. Daily fog <b>drip</b> was negatively correlated with minimum air temperature and positively correlated with mean above-canopy wind speed.

5|$|Although The Human Centipede {{is set in}} Germany, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in the Netherlands due to the neighboring countries' similar landscapes. Heiter's home, where most of The Human Centipede takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear in shot. Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, for example, a cinema room was converted to form Heiter's basement operating theatre, with real hospital beds and intravenous <b>drips</b> rented from a local hospital. The paintings of conjoined twins that were displayed throughout the house were painted by Tom Six, which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house. The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near Amsterdam. The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film. The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot {{on the last day of}} filming.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the <b>drips</b> were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{broke out}} in the factory at around 2:30 IST, as workers slept. Once they became aware of the blaze, the {{employees}} found they were unable to break through the factory's locked doors. Five fire tenders were sent to the scene, but by the time they arrived, local residents had broken down two locked gates and already rescued the surviving workers. These impromptu Rescue efforts were delayed however, when an individual carrying keys to open the door nervously dropped them while attempting to open the gate. At least 10 people were dead by the time rescuers reached the factory's interior, with a further eighteen injured. The survivors, many suffering from burns over 70 percent of their bodies, were taken to the National Medical College and Hospital, where victims had to be left on the floor due to a shortage of beds. The hospital did not have a burns unit, and the only treatments available at the hospital were ointments and saline <b>drips.</b> The patients were eventually moved to other hospitals. Local MLA Javed Khan later said that the death toll is actually at least twelve, but there has been no official confirmation of this. The Rapid Action Force was also deployed to maintain calm.|$|E

40|$|<b>Drip</b> {{irrigation}} lines placed 15 cm deep or 5 cm shallow below {{soil surface}} and furrow irrigation were compared on calcareous soils of southern Arizona. Crops grown were zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) 1982 and 1983 summers, and cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.), 1982 fall. Furrows received a preplant application of phosphorus (P) {{at a rate}} of 100 kg P₂O₅/ha. Urea phosphate (UP) (17 - 44 - 0) solution was injected twice in <b>drip</b> lines during the growing season to give a total rate of 100 kg P₂O₅/ha on cabbage and 50 kg P₂O₅/ha on squash. Deep <b>drip</b> lines produced 52 and 34 % higher yield than shallow <b>drip</b> in squash 1982 and 1983 experiments respectively. Deep <b>drip</b> yields were comparable to fertilized furrow yields with half the water and half the fertilizer rate of the furrow used by the deep <b>drip.</b> Unfertilized furrow yielded least. Application of UP in deep <b>drip</b> raised PO₄-P and NO₃-N concentration in squash leaves to comparable values in fertilized furrow plants. Shallow <b>drip</b> and unfertilized furrow plants had low nutrient concentrations. Soil analysis for NaHCO₃ extractable P and NO₃-N showed higher levels under <b>drip</b> than furrow treatments. Available P increased to 20 cm from emitters. EC was lower under <b>drip</b> than furrow. Soil pH was reduced by 0. 5 units around emitters. Soil moisture in root zone was highest under furrows. Deep <b>drip</b> had more moisture than shallow <b>drip.</b> Injection of UP reduced water pH to 1. 8 which prevented P precipitation. Cabbage yields were comparable under all fertilized treatments. Deep <b>drip</b> yielded 19 % higher than shallow <b>drip.</b> Tissue analysis showed higher nutrient concentration under <b>drip</b> than furrow treatments. Soil analysis showed higher available P and NO₃-N and lower EC and pH under <b>drip</b> than furrow treatments. Mobility of PO₄ from UP was about 20 cm in soil columns. Rate of P fixation was high.

25|$|Loki's {{relation}} with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. Loki is a shape shifter and in separate incidents he appears {{in the form of}} a salmon, a mare, a fly, and possibly an elderly woman named Þökk (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god Baldr and Loki is eventually bound by Váli with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, the goddess Skaði is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent <b>drips</b> venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that <b>drips</b> in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of Ragnarök, Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the jötnar, at which time he will encounter the god Heimdallr and the two will slay each other.|$|E

40|$|The DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN 2 A (DREB 2 A) {{transcription}} factor controls water deficit– inducible gene expression and requires posttranslational modification for its activation. The activation mechanism {{is not well}} understood; however, the stability of this protein in the nucleus was recently found to be important for its activation. Here, we report the isolation of Arabidopsis thaliana DREB 2 A-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (<b>DRIP</b> 1) and <b>DRIP</b> 2, C 3 HC 4 RING domain–containing proteins that interact with the DREB 2 A protein in the nucleus. An in vitro ubiquitination assay showed that they function as E 3 ubiquitin ligases and are capable of mediating DREB 2 A ubiquitination. Overexpression of <b>DRIP</b> 1 in Arabidopsis delayed the expression of DREB 2 A-regulated drought-responsive genes. Drought-inducible gene expression was slightly enhanced in the single T-DNA mutants of <b>drip</b> 1 - 1 and <b>drip</b> 2 - 1. By contrast, significantly enhanced gene expression was revealed in the <b>drip</b> 1 <b>drip</b> 2 double mutant under dehydration stress. Collectively, these data imply that <b>DRIP</b> 1 and <b>DRIP</b> 2 function negatively in the response of plants to drought stress. Moreover, overexpression of full-length DREB 2 A protein was more stable in <b>drip</b> 1 - 1 than in the wild-type background. These results suggest that <b>DRIP</b> 1 and <b>DRIP</b> 2 act as novel negative regulators in drought-responsive gene expression by targeting DREB 2 A to 26 S proteasome proteolysis...|$|R
