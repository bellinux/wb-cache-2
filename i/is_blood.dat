25|$|Bleeding, {{also known}} as hemorrhaging or haemorrhaging, <b>is</b> <b>blood</b> {{escaping}} from the circulatory system.

25|$|The Yoreh De'ah {{argues that}} if there <b>is</b> <b>blood</b> in the egg yolk, then {{hatching}} must have begun, and therefore consumption of the egg would be forbidden. Modern Orthodox Jews adhere to these requirements; however, the Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews treat an egg as nonkosher if blood is found anywhere within it. Sephardi Orthodox Jews consider only blood in the yolk to be a problem, and treat eggs with blood in the albumen as legitimate food if the blood is removed before use.|$|E
25|$|Unintended {{consequences}} {{may occur}} as improvements in safety are undertaken. It {{may not be}} possible to attain maximum safety goals in healthcare without adversely affecting patient care in other ways. An example <b>is</b> <b>blood</b> transfusion; in recent years, {{to reduce the risk of}} transmissible infection in the blood supply, donors with only a small probability of infection have been excluded. The result has been a critical shortage of blood for other lifesaving purposes, with a broad impact on patient care. Application of high-reliability theory and normal accident theory can help predict the organizational consequences of implementing safety measures.|$|E
25|$|Historically, medical {{practitioners}} {{expected a}} person to present with three findings. This classic triad is 1: haematuria, which is when there <b>is</b> <b>blood</b> present in the urine, 2: flank pain, which is pain {{on the side of}} the body between the hip and ribs, and 3: an abdominal mass, similar to bloating but larger. It is now known that this classic triad of symptoms only occurs in 10–15% of cases, and is usually indicative that the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is in an advanced stage. Today, RCC is often asymptomatic (meaning few to no symptoms) and is generally detected incidentally when a person is being examined for other ailments.|$|E

500|$|The {{late nineteenth}} century also brought the {{systematic}} study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as Vincent van Gogh. Describing his painting, The Night Cafe, to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall <b>is</b> <b>blood</b> red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens." ...|$|E

500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked.

2500|$|Subtitled [...] "Heroic and Tragic Tales", Sade {{combines}} {{romance and}} horror, employing several Gothic tropes for dramatic purposes. There <b>is</b> <b>blood,</b> banditti, corpses and, of course, insatiable lust. Compared to works like Justine, here Sade is relatively tame, as overt eroticism and torture is subtracted {{for a more}} psychological approach. It {{is the impact of}} sadism instead of acts of sadism itself that emerge in this work, unlike the aggressive and rapacious approach in his libertine works. The modern volume entitled Gothic Tales collects a variety of other short works of fiction intended to be included in Sade's Contes et Fabliaux d'un Troubadour Provencal du XVIII Siecle.|$|E
