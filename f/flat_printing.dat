25|$|Using the {{printing}} technique employed with the Bureau triangle issues of 1894, the paper used to print the Washington-Franklin issues was first dampened so that printing ink would be absorbed more thoroughly and evenly. However, {{this resulted in}} paper shrinkage when the sheets of stamps dried, causing the rows of stamps to be drawn closer together. As the <b>flat</b> <b>printing</b> plates for this issue had individual stamp impressions spaced 2mm apart the resulting dried sheet would leave stamps spaced about 1½ mm apart, making {{it very difficult to}} line up rows of perforations accurately between the rows of stamps. Many sheets were issued with perforations somewhat off center, while roughly 20% of the sheets emerged with perforations so off-center that they were deemed unsalable and had to be destroyed. Paper shrinkage would lead the Bureau to try various approaches to the problem in the following issues. Finding well-centered stamps with wide margins in any denomination in this early issue is a challenge for the collector and well centered examples command prices that far exceed average catalog values.|$|E

40|$|Two {{critical}} {{questions were}} put to the team: 1. Do shared or similar requirements and processes exist for submission of fingerprint checks to OPM/FBI across agencies that can be leveraged to streamline the enrollment process? 2. What standards must be supported by the enrollment stations to provide usable fingerprints to agencies? Summary of Results: The confusion around HPSD- 12 fingerprinting {{is a result of}} differing language around fingerprint processing and lack of adoption of the Type 14 submission in the Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification (EFTS) 1 by the personnel security community. The FBI does accept and process <b>flat</b> <b>prints</b> via Type 14 EFTS. OPM’s rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) estimate for updating internal systems to support receipt, processing, and relay of Type 14 prints is ~ 6 months. The central issue to be addressed is in fact the personnel security community has not yet approved acceptance of <b>flat</b> <b>prints</b> in background investigations (BI).

50|$|<b>Flatbed</b> Digital <b>printing</b> is the {{reproduction}} of digital images using typically on plastic or paperboard, although {{a wide variety of}} materials can be printed (common, photographic paper, film, cloth, plastic, etc.). Flatbed digital printers use inks made of acrylic monomers that are then exposed to strong UV-light to cure, or polymerize them. This process allows for printing {{on a wide variety of}} surfaces such as wood or metal, carpet, tile, and even glass. The adjustable printing bed makes it possible to print on surfaces ranging in thickness from a sheet of paper often up to as much as several inches. Typically used for commercial applications (retail and event signage), <b>flatbed</b> <b>printing</b> is often a substitute for screen-printing. Since no printing plates or silkscreens must be produced, digital printing technology allows shorter runs of signs to be produced economically.Environmentally, <b>flatbed</b> digital <b>printing</b> is based on a more sustainable system than its commercial predecessor of solvent printing as it produces fewer waste cartridges and less indoor air pollution.The resolution of flatbed printers range from 72 DPI (dots per inch) to about 1700 DPI. One of the advantages of a flatbed printer is its versatility of printable materials although this is limited to only flat materials.|$|R
50|$|Lithography uses simple {{chemical}} processes {{to create an}} image. For instance, the positive part of an image is a water-repelling ("hydrophobic") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining ("hydrophilic"). Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible printing ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image. This allows a <b>flat</b> <b>print</b> plate to be used, enabling much longer and more detailed print runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., intaglio printing, letterpress printing).|$|R

The measurements are carefully designed to atch the average visual impression but are independent of the subjectivity of a visual evaluation and allow objective comparisons of different printing machines. The paper focuses on the parameters that can be measured on <b>flat</b> field <b>prints</b> like process color density, density variations within sheet and its special attributes like streaks, banding, mottle, granularity, background and satellites.

40|$|Objective: Boluses {{are used}} in high-energy {{radiotherapy}} in order to overcome the skin sparing effect. In practice though, commonly used flat boluses fail to make a perfect contact with the irregular surface of the patient’s skin, resulting in air gaps. Hence, we fabricated a customized bolus using a 3 -dimensional (3 D) printer and evaluated its feasibility for radiotherapy. Methods:We designed two kinds of bolus for production on a 3 D printer, {{one of which was}} the 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>flat</b> bolus for the Blue water phantom and the other was a 3 D printed customized bolus for the RANDO phantom. The 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>flat</b> bolus was fabricated to verify its physical quality. The resulting 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>flat</b> bolus was evaluated by assessing dosimetric parameters such as D 1. 5 cm, D 5 cm, and D 10 cm. The 3 D printed customized bolus was then fabricated, and its quality and clinical feasibility were evaluated by visual inspection and by assessing dosimetric parameters such as Dmax, Dmin, Dmean, D 90 %, and V 90 %. Results: The dosimetric parameters of the resulting 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>flat</b> bolus showed that it was a useful dose escalating material, equivalent to a commercially available flat bolus. Analysis of the dosimetric parameters of the 3 D printed customized bolus demonstrated that it is provided good dose escalation and good contact with the irregular surface of the RANDO phantom.

40|$|Microstrip reflect arrays offer a {{flat profile}} and light weight, {{combined}} {{with many of}} the electrical characteristics of reflector antennas. Previous work [1]-[7] has demonstrated a variety of microstrip reflect arrays, using different elements at a range of frequencies. In this paper we describe the use of crossed dipoles as reflecting elements in a microstrip reflectarray. Theory of the solution will be described, with experimental results for a 6 " square reflectarray operating at 28 GHz. The performance of crossed dipoles will be directly compared with microstrip patches, in terms of bandwidth and loss. We also comment on the principle of operation of reflectarray elements, including crossed dipoles, patches of variable length, and patch elements with tuning stubs. This research was prompted by the proposed concept of overlaying a <b>flat</b> <b>printed</b> reflectarray on the surface of a spacecraft solar panel. Combining solar panel and antenna apertures in this way would lead to a reduction in weight and simpler deployment, with some loss of flexibility in independently pointing the solar panel and the antenna. Using crossed dipoles as reflectarray elements will minimize the aperture blockage of the solar cells, in contrast to the use of elements such as microstrip patches...|$|R

50|$|A {{problem with}} the {{multilayer}} zoneplate reflector is the complexity introduced, which might offset the advantage of using Fresnel zoneplate antennas. One solution is to print an inhomogeneous array of conducting elements on a grounded dielectric plate, thus leading to the so-called single-layer <b>printed</b> <b>flat</b> reflector 2. This configuration bears {{much in common with}} the printed array antenna but it requires the use of a feed antenna instead of a corporate feed network.
