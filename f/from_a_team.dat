5|$|Austria's Alexander Wurz {{drove through}} the field in his Williams from 19th at the start to finish third by taking one pitstop, {{completing}} 40 laps on super soft tires. By finishing third Wurz, recorded his third career podium, in the race that marked ten years since his debut race in F1. Nick Heidfeld finished in second place after trailing Hamilton {{for the majority of}} the race. The safety car deployments also allowed Heikki Kovalainen to move up to fourth after starting at the back of the grid. The race was the first time in the 2007 season where a driver <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> other than Ferrari or McLaren made the podium.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, McAleer became player-manager of the Cleveland Lake Shores (a {{predecessor}} of the Cleveland Indians) {{and continued}} with the franchise in 1901, when the American League {{became a major}} league and the club was renamed as the Blues, a name borrowed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that {{had participated in the}} National League during the 1870s and 1880s. The Blues made their major league debut on April 24, 1901, with an 8–2 loss to the Chicago White Sox. Two other league games were canceled due to inclement weather, and the contest between the Blues and White Sox served as the inaugural game of the AL.|$|E
5|$|Sanctions {{for such}} infractions may be levied on {{individuals}} or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English and Scottish leagues will often deduct 10 points <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that enters financial administration. Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited {{a game or}} had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.|$|E

50|$|His {{personal}} honesty {{extended to}} his bridge career. He created a precedent when he withdrew <b>from</b> <b>a</b> British <b>team</b> {{on the grounds}} that <b>a</b> pair <b>from</b> <b>a</b> continental <b>team</b> were cheats. Others also thought so but had nevertheless played.|$|R
5|$|The Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters {{were ranked}} {{second in the}} country and was {{expected}} to challenge Tennessee for the national title. Tech returned all five of its starters <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that had beaten the Vols twice the previous year. Tech came out on a 9–2 run, but led at the half by only a point. The teams played evenly for the beginning of the second half, before Louisiana Tech raised the lead to five with just over twelve minutes remaining. Summitt put her four freshman into the line-up, which went on a 12–0 run, giving Tennessee a lead they would never relinquish. Holdsclaw finished with a double-double (24 points, 11 rebounds), and Catchings contributed 17 points.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team.</b> By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} the Blue Jackets' approach to building their team changed, moving <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> of young developing players into one with established players. The first deal General Manager Scott Howson made was {{the acquisition of}} All-Star forward Jeff Carter on June 23, 2011. The deal sent Jakub Voracek, Columbus' first-round draft choice, the eighth overall, and their third-round pick in the 2011 Draft to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Carter. The trade received a positive response in Columbus from fans and management who felt they finally had a number one center to play alongside of their best player, Rick Nash. Next, they traded for the negotiating rights of soon to be free agent James Wisniewski. Wisniewski scored a career high 51 points during the 2010–11 season, splitting time between the New York Islanders and Montreal Canadiens. The point total was fifth-highest in the league for defenseman scoring, tying Tobias Enstrom. The Blue Jackets came to terms with Wisniewski, just an hour {{prior to the start}} of free agency, signing him to a six-year, $33 million deal.|$|E
5000|$|With only 50 {{available}} spots, {{this means}} that decisions must be made carefully so as to ensure the team's future viability. Depending on circumstances, a player may be added or removed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team’s</b> List at any time.|$|R

5|$|To {{handle this}} new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable trust, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) catamaran Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel Sleipner, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project went <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|E

50|$|For example, before game 5 of the 2012 NBA Finals, the Miami Heat were {{expected}} to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder. The line read: Miami -3, Oklahoma City +3. To determine who wins against the spread, the line is either added or subtracted <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team's</b> final score.|$|R
50|$|In some competitions, points can be deducted <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team’s</b> {{score for}} testifying with {{information}} outside {{the scope of}} the mock trial materials and for unsportsmanlike conduct or abuse of objections. However, scores are completely at a judge's discretion, meaning that scores are subjective based on different evaluation criteria.|$|R

25|$|Brice {{is among}} the group of capable Washington staff {{officers}} who have been largely forgotten by modern historians, {{even though there was}} a surprisingly low turnover. While President Abraham Lincoln's created a cabinet of the brightest and most capable minds <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> of his political rivals, Ulysses S. Grant is recognized for reorganizing the staff departments under the finest officers in their fields, including Brice. Brice was brevetted to brigadier general on December 2, 1864, and major general on March 13, 1865, for his wartime service.|$|E
25|$|Born in Karachi, Aamir, a left-handed batsman and left-arm {{orthodox}} spinner, played underage matches {{for several}} Karachi-based sides. Although he was 20 {{years old at}} the time, he played a single match for the Karachi Greens under-19s side in Pakistan's Grade-II Under-19 Tournament in September 2002. The following year, Aamir, now 21, played under-19 district matches for Karachi's Zone IV. He captained the side in one match, against Zone III, and scored 101 not out <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> total of 213, coming in third in the batting order. His Zone IV teammates in later matches included two future Pakistan Test players, Khurram Manzoor and Fawad Alam. Aamir played no senior-level matches in Pakistani domestic competitions, with his last under-19 match in the country coming in July 2003.|$|E

25|$|When a team {{is willing}} to sign an {{upcoming}} free agent, but the player's current team wants something in return, it {{might be in the}} best interest of both clubs to execute a sign-and-trade deal. This occurs when one team signs one of its free agents and immediately trades that player to another team. A sign-and-trade is beneficial to both the player and the teams; the player receives a bigger contract than he might ordinarily get <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that he would like to play for, while the trading club gets something in return for a free agent, and the recipient of the trade gets the player they desire. Sign-and-trades are a reality in the NBA because of the CBA's rules: unlike baseball, where teams losing free agents are compensated with draft picks or cash, NBA teams that lose free agents receive no compensation.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} Alex Murphy as coach in 1986 {{produced}} some colourful displays <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that was {{widely regarded as}} an entertaining team to watch, but seemed to be constant runners-up.

Success was achieved in 1988 when St Helens lifted their one and only John Player Trophy with a 15–14 victory over Leeds in January 1988, at Central Park, Wigan.
