25|$|LNG {{facilities}} provide <b>delivery</b> <b>capacity</b> {{during peak}} periods when market demand exceeds pipeline deliverability. LNG storage tanks possess {{a number of}} advantages over underground storage. As a liquid at approximately −163°C (−260°F), it occupies about 600 times less space than gas stored underground, and it provides high deliverability at very short notice because LNG storage facilities are generally located close to market and can be trucked to some customers avoiding pipeline tolls. There is no requirement for cushion gas and it allows access to a global supply. LNG facilities are, however, more expensive to build and maintain than developing new underground storage facilities.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that metabolic rates scale across species approximately as the 3 / 4 power of mass in most {{if not all}} groups of organisms.

The 3 / 4 exponent and other observed scaling relationships follow when mass-specific metabolic demands match the changing <b>delivery</b> <b>capacities</b> of the network at different body sizes. Deviation from the 3 / 4 exponent suggests either inefficiency or compensating physiological mechanisms.
