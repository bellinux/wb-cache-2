500|$|The band {{entered the}} studio {{with most of the}} songs {{finished}} and rehearsed; producer Nick Raskulinecz, who also worked on One by One, stated that while [...] "One By One was very loose, [...] "In Your Honor was more planned out. Dave was more meticulous on that one". The electric album was done in segments by instrument, starting with the drums and guitars, then vocals, and finally bass. Mendel would write a bass line on Pro Tools at home before showing it to Grohl and Raskulinecz. The bass was recorded after the vocals, which Raskulinecz said was done because [...] "By doing bass last, you can really tailor it for tuning, parts and sound. If you do the drums and then the guitars, you can fill the hole that's left with bass. And sometimes that hole wants a certain frequency that isn't traditional for bass, but you have to go with it, which is even more fun." [...] During the last three weeks of work in the rock songs, the band was in the studio [...] "from noon to eight in the morning, making the rock record the most devastating thing we've ever done". After two months working with the rock songs, the band was approaching their established deadline and had a meeting where they decided that to finish the album [...] "Everyone has to be <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> we need to do one song a day and no one's leaving until that song is done." [...] Grohl would listen to a click track, and [...] "we'd find a tempo and I'd just roll an arrangement {{off the top of my}} head." [...] As the bandmembers recorded their parts, Grohl would write the lyrics. The rushed approach prevented Mendel from writing bass lines, so he ended up [...] "concentrating on just finding the notes and getting the rhythm right." ...|$|E

Both Rob Jones and Robbie Fowler gave two interviews in 2012–13 in which they stated McManaman was the greatest player they ever played alongside, with Fowler saying, [...] "I've played with many, many great players. Paul Gascoigne was fantastic and I could sit <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> and talk about Liverpool players – John Barnes, Ian Rush, Jan Molby, Ronnie Whelan and Steven Gerrard, who is an unbelievable player.
