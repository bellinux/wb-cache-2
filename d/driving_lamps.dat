25|$|The H1 lamp was {{the first}} tungsten-halogen {{headlamp}} light source. It was introduced in 1962 by a consortium of European bulb and headlamp makers. This bulb has a single axial filament that consumes 55 watts at 12.0 volts, and produces 1550 lumens ±15% when operated at 13.2V. H2 (55W @ 12.0V, 1820lm @ 13.2V) followed in 1964, and the transverse-filament H3 (55W @ 12.0V, 1450lm ±15%) in 1966. H1 still sees wide use in low beams, high beams and auxiliary fog and <b>driving</b> <b>lamps,</b> as does H3. The H2 {{is no longer a}} current type, since it requires an intricate bulb holder interface to the lamp, has a short life and is difficult to handle. For those reasons, H2 was withdrawn from ECE Regulation 37 for use in new lamp designs (though H2 bulbs are still manufactured for replacement purposes in existing lamps), but H1 and H3 remain current and these two bulbs were legalised in the United States in 1993. More recent single-filament bulb designs include the H7 (55W @ 12.0V, 1500lm ±10% @ 13.2V), H8 (35W @ 12.0V, 800lm ±15% @ 13.2V), H9 (65W @ 12.0V, 2100lm ±10% @ 13.2V), and H11 (55W @ 12.0V, 1350lm ±10% @ 13.2V). 24-volt versions of many bulb types are available for use in trucks, buses, and other commercial and military vehicles.|$|E

Bespoke five-spoke alloy wheels were used and a new silver-coloured front grille design was used.

The drivetrain was the standard 2.4-litre diesel and six-speed manual permanent four-wheel-drive transmission. The SVX edition was available as a 110 (only available outside the UK), a 90 and a brand-new design of 90 soft top- the first time a soft top model had been available through showrooms in the UK since 1992. SVX soft tops had only the two front seats- the rear load bay being used to accommodate the spare wheel and a lockable storage box. A new design of hood was used, sloping down towards the rear over a jointed folding frame, unlike the standard square-framed hood used on other soft top Land Rovers.|$|E

40|$|Recently, 2 -dimensional flat light {{sources have}} been {{attracting}} much attention {{for its use}} in LCD backlight applications because of its high luminous efficiency and uniformity. A long-gap discharge, mercury-free flat fluorescent lamp has been developed, which shows a high brightness (> 5000 cd/m 2) and high luminous efficacy (60 lm/W). Additionally, it has a wide operating margin and stable driving condition {{with the aid of}} an auxiliary electrode. For <b>driving</b> the <b>lamp,</b> a narrow pulse power to maintain the glow discharge state is required. Since there has been no research for this kind of <b>lamp</b> <b>driving,</b> this paper proposes a newly developed short-pulse, high-voltage lamp-driving scheme. The proposed lamp system uses a ballast with a coupled-inductor in order to raise the short pulse voltage up to the lamp ignition level and to obtain energy-recovery action during the glow discharge mode. The operation principles are presented and also the system performances such as the lighting efficiency, spatial and angular uniformities are evaluated by hardware experiments. The results show that the proposed lighting system is a good candidate for the next-generation of LCD backlight systems...|$|R
50|$|The Shift Up lamp can {{be found}} on OBD II cars. The lamp helps the driver to drive economically. The lamp is {{supplied}} by ignition power (+15) and is grounded in the Trionic ECU, pin 55.

40|$|Summary The weekly {{incidence}} of headaches among office workers was compared when the offices were lit by fluorescent lighting where the fluorescent tubes were operated, by Ca) a conventional switch-start circuit with choke ballast providing illumination that pulsated with a modulation depth of 43 - 49 % and a principal frequency component at 100 Hz; Cb) an electronic start circuit with choke ballast giving illumination with similar characteristics; Cc) an electronic ballast <b>driving</b> the <b>lamps</b> at about 32 kHz {{and reducing the}} 100 Hz modulation to less than 7 %.

50|$|The car shared its 10 ft {{wheelbase}} {{with its}} predecessor, the Jaguar Mark VII, which outwardly it closely resembled.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{study examined the}} possibility of <b>driving</b> a fluorescent <b>lamp</b> at high frequency with no serially connected passive elements.

Lamp V-I characteristics and lamp resistances were found to be comparable to those measured when the lamp is driven by a conventional HF electronic ballast. The measured light output of a lamp driven by proposed ballast was found to be slightly higher than the light output of same lamp when driven by a conventional HF ballast for the same input power.

40|$|An Analog Electro-Optical Multiplier, {{a simple}} and compact buiid state device with no moving parts, has been designed, constructed, and tested. Functionally, this device is the direct analog of the {{familiar}} servo-multiplier, being capable of multiplying one analog variable by up to seven other individual analog variables. The servo-driven potentiometer arm {{has been replaced by}} a photoconductive cell, illuminated by a low-power lamp, connected in a bridge circuit with two fixed resistors. The servomechanism driving the potentiometer arm {{has been replaced by a}} solid state operational amplifier <b>driving</b> the <b>lamp</b> in response to the value of the multiplicand. Accuracies of 0. 62 per cent of full scale have been obtained with this multiplier which has a dynamic range of 4 cps.

Initial experiments were conducted using the Raytheon Raysistor, an electro -optical device consisting of a light source and a CdSe photoconductive cell. The effects of signal heating, hysteresis, and signal voltage across these cells is discussed and compared with the improved characteristics of the CdS photocells which were used in the final design. The problem of uniformly illuminating several of these cells with a single lamp is discussed. In addition, the properties of miniature lamps with regard to light output, power requirements, and speed of response is considered. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|The Diablo VT Roadster was {{introduced}} in December 1995 and featured an electrically operated carbon fiber targa top which was stored above the engine lid when not in use.

The main benefits of these products are: • Small Printed-Circuit Board (PCB) footprint, and compact solution • High efficiency (up to 93 %) • High input power factor (> 0. 95); low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD; 0. 7); low ripple (< 5 %); minimum external component count • Enhanced power capability • Low electronic Bill Of Material (BOM) The SSL 5015 TE operates in Boundary Conduction Mode (BCM) with peak current modulation, providing an input power factor correction. The IC is typically configured to a buck converter. It can start up directly from the HV pin using an internal high-voltage current source. When the converter is switching, VCC is supplied through the DVDT pin by a capacitor coupled to the DRAIN pin or by an auxiliary supply. This feature simplifies the VCC supply.

40|$|An {{arbitrary}} wave-form-pulsed {{power source}} for <b>driving</b> pulsed flash <b>lamps</b> electrically to pump quasi-continuous-wave Nd:YAG lasers has been developed. It {{is based on}} a high-frequency switching converter as opposed to conventional pulse-forming network or linear power amplifier circuit-based pulse generators. The system can generate rectangular pulses through the flash lamp with fine adjustment in pulse parameters over a wide range. The system can also generate an arbitrary-shaped pulsed current within a bandwidth of 500 Hz. The design of the system and the results in the form of rectangular- and arbitrary-shaped pulsed-current wave forms with different pulse parameters are presented. In addition, a burst of consecutive pulses with different arbitrary shapes can also be generated as desired or as programed. The developed pulsed power source offers advantages of more flexibility in control and adjustment of output pulse parameters, arbitrary-shaped pulse generation, better efficiency, compactness, and higher reliability as compared to the pulsed power sources based on normal schemes. The electronic system developed is of immense value in studying the dependence of flash-lamp impedance, spectral output, and energy-transfer efficiency on pulse parameters as well as optimization of these parameters for use in various laser material processing applications...|$|R
