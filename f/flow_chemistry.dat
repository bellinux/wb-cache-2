The {{goal of this}} study is to assess the accuracy of low-dimensional FGM databases for the prediction of these species in turbulent, partially-premixed reacting flows. It will be examined to what extent turbulent, partially-premixed jet flames can be described by FGM databases based on premixed or counterflow diffusion flamelets and to what extent the chosen molecular transport model for the flamelet influences the accuracy of species mass fraction predictions in CFD-simulations. For LES and RANS applications a model that accounts for subgrid fluctuations has to be added introducing additional errors in numerical results.

40|$|Water {{passing through}} mine-rock dumps either enters the {{underlying}} groundwater system or exits at the toe. For {{the case of}} toe seepage, the water is often collected in ditches and diverted out of the area. In light of the variability in <b>flow</b> and <b>chemistry</b> expected in toe seepage, questions arise as to the appropriate monitoring program including, for example, the importance of variable sampling frequency. Alternatively, for many mines in British Columbia, the more important question is "Are we missing anything important by sampling on a routine basis such as monthly?". Rather than answering the question based on theory, this paper answers with actual data from a minesite in British Columbia. At the Island Copper Minesite on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, an ambitious monitoring program of toe seepage took place over a six-month period. Eight stations were monitored basically either (1) once daily for <b>flow</b> and <b>chemistry</b> or (2) hourly for flow and every four hours for chemistry. Based on statistical analyses of data from selected stations, answers are provided for important technical questions, such as monitoring frequency, and for regulatory questions, such as permit limits.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{coupling}} of autocatalytic reactions, {{such as the}} oscillating Belousov- Zhabotinsky reaction, with vortical flows produced in a Couette cell. Similarly to many Reaction-Diffusion-Advection (RDA) systems found in nature, the resulting systems are characterised by chemical cycles maintained out of equilibrium by transport processes involving complex flow properties, such as periodicity and vorticity. In this project, an integrated approach was developed, combining optical and magnetic resonance techniques with modelling, to study transport and reaction in vortical flows. Flow structure and molecular displacements within stationary and translating vortices were investigated {{using a combination of}} magnetic resonance (MR) velocity and diffusion mapping with MR propagator experiments. A model based on MR experimental data was developed to simulate molecular displacements and provide quantitative information on micro-mixing and long time-scale axial dispersion. Simulations of molecular displacements allow linkage of molecular transport with the propagation of chemical waves travelling through vortical flows. The macroscopic patterns arising from these RDA systems, in combination with modelling results, allowed understanding coupling mechanisms between <b>flow</b> and <b>chemistry</b> and characterising inter- and intra- vortex mixing. Finally, MR imaging of chemical waves was shown to compare well with molecular displacement simulations, providing with a means for characterising the interplay of <b>flow</b> and <b>chemistry</b> in reactive <b>flow</b> systems...|$|R
