In it she includes numerous documented case histories from her practice and from footnoted medical journals. She explains the functions and food sources of over forty nutrients considered essential to human health, including vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and proteins.|$|E
25|$|After {{writing a}} promotional {{pamphlet}} for a milk company in 1932, she wrote two non-published treatises: Optimum Health (1935) and You Can Stay Well (1939). In 1942 Davis wrote a 524-page, forty-one chapter nutrition textbook for Macmillan, Vitality Through Planned Nutrition. But she received public acclaim with her subsequent books {{written for the}} general public: Let's Cook it Right (1947); Let's Have Healthy Children (1951); Let's <b>Eat</b> <b>Right</b> to Keep Fit (1954); and Let's Get Well (1965). By 1974, when she died, her books had sold over 10 million copies.|$|E

It was a splendid idea! He went to work on it at once. And then he made a discovery--such a splendid discovery! There was plenty of food to <b>eat</b> <b>right</b> down under ground--worms and grubs--all he needed. After that, Mr. Mole spent all his time in his tunnels and seldom put his nose outside.

60|$|But Bunny was not asleep. He was thinking. He {{was trying}} to make up his mind about something. There was no way of finding out what it was that he {{was trying to}} make up his mind about.

Or he might have been trying to determine whether it would be better for him to go over to 'Lijah Ford's garden, and try to get a bite at some cabbage-leaves; or to run down to the field just outside of the woods, where he would very likely meet a certain little girl rabbit that he knew very well.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect of}} this simple {{question}} on Mr. Burrowes was stupendous. He dropped away from Fillmore's coat-button like an exhausted bivalve, and his small mouth opened feebly. It {{was as if a}} child had suddenly propounded to an eminent mathematician some abstruse problem in the higher algebra. Females who took an interest in boxing had come into Mr. Burrowes' life before---in his younger days, when he was a famous featherweight, the first of his three wives had been accustomed to sit at the ringside during his contests and urge him in language of the severest technicality to knock opponents' blocks off--but somehow he had not supposed from her appearance and manner that Sally was one of the elect. He gaped at her, and the relieved Fillmore sidled off like a bird hopping from the compelling gaze of a snake. He was not quite sure that he was acting correctly in allowing his sister to roam at large among the somewhat Bohemian surroundings of a training-camp, but the instinct of self-preservation turned the scale. He had breakfasted early, and if he did not <b>eat</b> <b>right</b> speedily {{it seemed to him that}} dissolution would set in.|$|E

Indeed, {{he was a man}} hated by the Catholics, for his special rapacity on them. 'He is of no {{religion}} at all,' said the Catholic Prelate of Neisse, one day, to Nussler; (greedy to plunder the Monasteries here; has wrung gold, silver aud jewels from them,--nay from the Pope himself,--by threatening to turn Protestant, and use the Monasteries still worse. And the Pope, hearing of this, had to send him a valuable Gift, which you may see some day.' Nussler did, one day, see this preciosity: a Crucifix, ebony bordered with gold, and the Body all of that metal, on the smallest of altars,--in Walrave's bedroom. But it was the bedroom itself which Nussler looked at with a shudder," [...] Nussler and we: [...] "in the middle of it stood Walrave's own bed, on his right hand that of his Wife, and on his left that of his Mistress:"--a brutish polygamous Walrave! [...] "This Mistress was a certain Quarter-Master's Wife,"--Quarter-Master willing, it is probable, to get rid of such an article gratis, much more on terms of profit. [...] "Walrave had begged for him the Title of Hofrath from King Friedrich,"--which, though it was but a clipping of ribbon contemptible to Friedrich, and the brute of an Engineer had excellent talents in his business, I rather wish Friedrich had refused in this instance. But he did not; [...] "he answered in gibing tone, 'I grant you the Hofrath Title for your Quarter-Master; thinking it but fit that a General's'--What shall we call her? (Friedrich uses the direct word)--'should have some handle to her name.'" [...] [Busching, Beitrage, i. 343-348.] ...|$|E

She didn't tell me then, but I saw it. An' she couldn't avoid him, except by stayin' in her room, which she did a good deal. Then Jack showed a streak of bein' decent. He surprised everybody, even Collie. He delighted Old Bill. But he didn't pull the wool over my eyes. He was like a boy spoilin' for a new toy, an' he got crazy over Collie. He's sure terribly in love with her, an' for days he behaved himself in a way calculated to make up for his drinkin' too much. It shows he can behave himself when he wants to. I mean he can control his temper an' impulse. Anyway, he made himself so good that Old Bill changed his mind, after what he swore that day, an' set another day for the weddin'. Right off, then, Collie goes down on her back.... They didn't send for me very soon.
