40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that teacher research, {{as an international}} movement, {{has the potential to}} become a counter-hegemonic strategy to construct critical teacher education approaches in a globalized world. It begins by describing globalization and discussing the distinction between hegemonic and counter-hegemonic globalization, or between "globalization from above " and "globalization from below. " Next, it describes teachers research as a potential counter-hegemonic global movement, defining teacher research, offering a brief history of the teacher research movement, and looking at the primary characteristics of the current teacher research movement. Finally, the paper connects primary features of the movement with the question of whether current teacher research is a global movement and whether it is a counter-hegemonic initiative. It concludes that the teacher research movement has the potential to become a strategy to overcome traditional teacher education approaches.

40|$|High street optometric {{practices}} are for-profit businesses. They mostly provide sight testing and eye examination services and sell optical products, such as spectacles and contact lenses. The sight testing services are often {{sold at a}} vastly reduced price and profits are generated primarily through high margin spectacle sales, in a loss leading strategy. Published literature highlights weaknesses in this strategy as it forms a barrier to widening the scope of services provided within optometric practices. This includes specialist non-refraction based services, such as shared care. In addition this business strategy discourages investment in advanced diagnostic equipment and <b>higher</b> <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications.</b> The aim of this thesis {{was to develop a}} greater understanding of the traditional loss-leading strategy. The thesis also aimed to assess the plausibility of alternative business models to support the development of specialist non-refraction services within high street optometric practice. This research was based on a single independent optometric practice that specialises in advanced retinal imaging and offers a broad range of shared care services. Specialist non-refraction based services were found to be poor generators of spectacle sales likely due to patient needs and presenting concerns. Alternative business strategies to support these services included charging more realistic professional fees via cost-based pricing and monthly payment plans. These strategies enabled specialist services to be more self-sustainable with less reliance on cross-subsidy from spectacle sales. Furthermore, improving operational efficiency can increase stand-alone profits for specialist services. Practice managers may be reluctant to increase professional fees due to market pressures and confidence. However, this thesis found that patients were accepting of increased professional fees. Practice managers can implement alternative business models to enhance eye care provision in high street optometric practices.

40|$|Higher {{education}} provision typically requires {{learners to}} physically attend sessions on campus. The economic climate has changed significantly {{over the past}} few years in the UK and globally. Inevitably changes to student funding and the increased competitive nature of the job market have impacted on university teaching. The use of work based learning (WBL) is an alternative flexible form of learning that attempts to tackle these issues. It enables students to learn whilst they work, addressing the funding issues, and enhancing their employability through the acquisition of <b>higher</b> <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications.</b> Often such WBL programmes are designed, delivered and supported from the view of the student and academic staff with little consideration of other stakeholders such as employers, workplace mentors and professional bodies and the input they can bring to enrich the learning and teaching provision. This paper presents the findings from a survey conducted among stakeholders from all four pillars of WBL, namely the learner, the academic environment, the workplace and the external context. Online questionnaires and interviews were carried out with students, tutors, program leaders, employers and professional bodies from four postgraduate programmes at the university. The results show that while there is a reluctance to embrace technology among some academic staff, students are generally positive about using the technology. The survey also demonstrates that there is a lack of creativity and imagination in the use of technology, where often platforms such as virtual learning environments are used simply as repositories for presentation slides, handouts, etc. The results of the study conclude or rather remind all involving parties to pay more emphasis on quality of online programme delivery by embracing technology and use it in novel and imaginative ways to provide a learning and teaching provision fit for the twenty-first century...|$|E

There have been no previous studies comparing attitudes and knowledge of doctors in primary and secondary care towards EBM practice and teaching and this study sets out to investigate this area. We asked participants, a stratified sample of general practitioners, hospital consultants, GP registrars and junior hospital doctors in Leicester, Northamptonshire and Rutland, UK, to complete a self-administered survey questionnaire and written knowledge test which provided ‘positive to evidence based practice’ (PEP) attitude scores and Manchester Short EBM Questionnaire Education for Primary Care (2007) 18 : 45 – 57 # 2007 Radcliffe Publishing Limited WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN IN THIS AREA. There is little evidence on the relationship between attitudes and knowledge in relation to evidence-based medicine (EBM) in family doctors, consultants and doctors intraining. WHAT THIS WORK ADDS. This study showed that, although general practitioners and general practitioner trainers were significantly less positive in attitude to EBM compared to GP registrars, junior hospital doctors and consultant respondents, they had significantly higher knowledge scores. This study demonstrated that the attitude (PEP) score and knowledge questionnaire(MANSEBMQ) have high reliability but require further research to demonstrate validity. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH. There remain opportunities for refinement of the MANSEBMQ, validation against existing tools and further application in a larger study, including assessment of EBM knowledge and skills, before and after an educational process, involving students in clinically relevant and integrated EBM learning. Keywords: attitudes, evidence-based practice, general practice registrars, general practitioners, hospital doctors, primary care, secondary care(MANSEBMQ) knowledge scores of participants. The response rate was low which may have led to volunteer bias but there were sufficient responses to explore attitude scores and knowledge scores. Attitude(PEP) scores were highest in hospital consultants, intermediate in doctors in training and lowest in general practitioner (GP) respondents (mean score 71. 7 vs 70. 5 vs 67. 2; P = 0. 006).

40|$|Fish {{products}} {{contribute significantly}} to protein nutriture, food security, livelihoods and the economy in West Africa. Food safety of processed fish products however remains an important concern. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the safety of traditionally processed fish from Ghana. Microbiological analysis of selected traditionally processed fish products was conducted. Challenge tests were employed to determine the effects of storage temperature on survival of Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. The effects of salting, temperature, pH and inoculum size on the survival and enterotoxin production of S. aureus was also determined. Food safety surveys were conducted. Self-reported and observed food safety practices and the role of food safety inspectors were assessed. The pH levels observed in all samples were not at optimum levels to inhibit microbial growth. Water activity (aw) levels were: fried bonga (0. 82 – 0. 95), koobi (0. 53 – 0. 75), kako (0. 55 – 0. 70, smoked catfish (0. 72 – 0. 95), smoked herrings (0. 54 – 0. 94) and smoked mackerel (0. 84 – 0. 99). Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens were not detected in 25 g and 1 g, respectively, of any of the samples. Varying levels of Bacillus cereus, S. aureus and yeast and mould were detected in fried bonga and smoked fish samples. Aerobic bacteria and coliforms were present in 50 % and 44. 4 %, of fried bonga. Only yeast and moulds were detected in kako and koobi at levels of < 2 log to 4 log cfu/g in koobi and from < 2 log to 5 log cfu/g in kako. High levels of between 5 log 10 CFU/g and 6 log 10 CFU/g aerobic bacteria were recorded in smoked mackerel. On the basis of aw levels and microbial quality, smoked mackerel and fried bonga were classified as high risk fish products requiring time-temperature control, and salted koobi, kako, smoked herrings and catfish as low risk products. Challenge tests with S. aureus in salted smoked mackerel and catfish showed no growth and no enterotoxin A and B at 4 °C. S. aureus numbers increased in smoked catfish and mackerel samples stored at 30 oC but decreased with increasing NaCl concentration (p< 0. 001; r 2 = 0. 0507). At 30 oC, SEA and SEB were detected in samples formulated with 5 % (w/w) NaCl with high inoculum. Samples formulated with higher than 5 % (w/w) NaCl suppressed growth and enterotoxin production. Food safety knowledge among respondents was good and consumers were concerned with some aspects of food safety in Ghana although not fish in particular. Very few food handlers had received adequate food safety training, the majority of whom overestimated their food safety compliance, evidenced by observed poor hygiene practices. Only 43. 8 % of inspectors had <b>higher</b> <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications</b> and 29. 2 % were trained in HACCP. Inspectors identified lack of information (41. 7 %), support (41. 7 %) and operational costs (39. 6 %) among the barriers to food safety compliance. These findings suggest a need for education at all levels including food safety enforcement professionals. A framework model which integrates all aspects of the findings in developing a national regulatory and policy framework for fish food safety has been proposed.

The theme of the research was the assumption that the process of rehabilitation of disabled persons is achieved in a complex social system. Material and methods: A diagnostic survey with the use of a customised questionnaire was carried out in November/December 2013 among 108 persons with disabilities employed in sheltered workshops in the Świętokrzyskie Province. Results : The most common causes of disability among the respondents were the locomotor system, neurological, respiratory, and circulatory diseases. The obstacles in establishing interpersonal contacts would include the fear of negative feedback in their close environment, the lack of knowledge in society about disability, architectural barriers, and appearance. The disabled expected both economic and informative support. Conclusions : The activity of persons with disabilities depends on employment opportunities in the labour market, but also on the candidate’s education, age, and their degree of disability.
