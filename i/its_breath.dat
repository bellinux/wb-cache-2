5|$|The {{sea otter}} hunts in short dives, often {{to the sea}} floor. Although it can hold <b>its</b> <b>breath</b> {{for up to five}} minutes, its dives {{typically}} last about one minute and no more than four. It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may also pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth.|$|E
5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held <b>its</b> <b>breath</b> as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
25|$|When a brilliantly timed naval {{attack on}} Soviet bomber bases with submarine-launched cruise missiles, with a strike force that {{includes}} the USS Chicago, cripples the Soviet bomber force, the Soviets lose their most effective convoy and fleet-killing weapon. The U.S. Marines {{take this opportunity to}} stage an amphibious assault on Iceland backed by the NATO navies, retaking the island and closing the Atlantic to Soviet forces. A failed bomber raid on the NATO naval forces attacking Iceland (in which the remaining Soviet naval cruise missile bomber fleets are nearly wiped out) essentially means victory in the Atlantic, opening the USSR to direct attacks from carrier strike groups against its northern strategic areas and the free flow of convoys across the Atlantic. The Soviet occupation force is soon forced to unconditionally surrender, ending the threat of air raids on convoys. Simultaneously with the reversal in the Atlantic, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, a renowned poker player, makes an audacious gamble {{in the face of a}} final Soviet offensive that pushes NATO ground forces to the breaking point, launching an unexpected flanking manoeuvre that places heavy NATO forces in the rear of the Soviet spearhead, cutting off their last Category A regular army units behind the Leine River and interdicting their supplies. Intelligence gained from a prisoner on Iceland finally reveals the dire fuel situation in the USSR to NATO, which changes bombing priorities to wipe out the Red Army's forward fuel depots, essentially immobilizing the Soviet formations. Due to intense political pressure from Moscow to maintain an offensive into the Ruhr, the CINC-West refuses to allow Alekseyev to transfer his Category A troops east to close the salient. With the Soviet advance decisively halted, NATO catches <b>its</b> <b>breath</b> and prepares to move into a general offensive against the increasingly ineffective Soviet Category C reserves now being moved forward. At this time, Chairman Kosov confronts Minister Sergetov, and informs him that a power struggle is underway at the KGB between himself and a faction lead by the younger Jozef Larionov that has been favoured by the Politburo. At the next meeting, Sergetov pressures the Politburo into promoting Alekseyev to CINC-West, while his former superior is executed at Lefortovo Prison. Now forced to take direct orders from the Politburo, Alekseyev finds himself unable to secure a victory, and the NATO counteroffensive begins.|$|E

500|$|The {{great auk}} was {{generally}} an excellent swimmer, using its wings to propel itself underwater. While swimming, {{the head was}} held up but the neck was drawn in. This species was capable of banking, veering, and turning underwater. The great auk was known to dive to depths of [...] {{and it has been}} claimed that the species was able to dive to depths of [...] To conserve energy, most dives were shallow. It also could hold <b>its</b> <b>breath</b> for 15 minutes, longer than a seal. Its ability to dive this deeply reduced competition with other alcid species. The great auk was capable of accelerating under water, then shooting out of the water to land on a rocky ledge above the ocean's surface.|$|E
500|$|According to folklorist Jennifer Westwood, the stoor worm's {{head was}} [...] "like a great mountain"; <b>its</b> <b>breath</b> was putrid, contaminating plants and {{destroying}} any humans or animals with its blast. Traill Dennison reported the serpent's length was [...] "beyond telling, and reached {{thousands and thousands}} of miles in the sea". Giant sea swells and earthquakes were attributed to the beast yawning, a sign it wanted to be fed rather than of fatigue. Islanders were terrified of the serpent; it was described by Traill Dennison, who transcribed its story, as [...] "the worst of the nine fearful curses that plague mankind". A further tale recorded by Traill Dennison gives a brief mention of another stoor worm, described as the progeny of the Orcadian monster, which is killed when it is severed in two by an oversized mythical ship.|$|E
500|$|The {{polar bear}} {{is the most}} {{carnivorous}} species of bear, and its diet primarily consists of ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded (Erignathus barbatus) seals. Polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air; they only rarely catch seals on land or in open water. The polar bear's most common hunting method is still-hunting: The bear locates a seal breathing hole using its sense of smell, and crouches nearby for a seal to appear. When the seal exhales, the bear smells <b>its</b> <b>breath,</b> reaches into the hole with a forepaw, and drags it out onto the ice. The polar bear also hunts by stalking seals resting on the ice. Upon spotting a seal, it walks to within , and then crouches. If the seal does not notice, the bear creeps to within [...] of the seal and then suddenly rushes to attack. A third hunting method is to raid the birth lairs that female seals create in the snow. They may also feed on fish.|$|E

500|$|Tyrannosaurus was {{acknowledged}} by Spielberg as [...] "the {{star of the}} movie", even leading him to rewrite the ending to feature the T. rex for fear of disappointing the audience. Winston's animatronic T. rex stood , weighed , and was [...] long. Jack Horner called it [...] "the closest I've ever been to a live dinosaur". While the consulting paleontologists {{did not have a}} consensus on the dinosaur's movement, particularly regarding its running capabilities, animator Steve Williams decided to [...] "throw physics out the window and create a T. rex that moved at sixty miles per hour even though its hollow bones would have busted if it ran that fast". The major reason was the T. rex chasing a Jeep, a scene that took two months to finish. The dinosaur is depicted with a vision system based on movement, though later studies indicated the T. rex had binocular vision comparable to a bird of prey. Its roar is a baby elephant mixed with a tiger and an alligator, and <b>its</b> <b>breath</b> is a whale's blow. A dog attacking a rope toy was used for the sounds of the T. rex tearing a Gallimimus apart, while cut sequoias crashing to the ground became the sound of the dinosaur's footsteps.|$|E
500|$|... "Antes de las Seis" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

[...] Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly termed the song a [...] "gorgeous ballad" [...] and encouraged readers to download it. Jesus Yanez-Reyes from Northern Arizona News gave [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] a very positive review and praised its lyrics and Shakira's [...] "heartfelt" [...] vocal delivery as having the ability [...] "to overcome whatever language barriers may exist between the artist and the listener, truly making it a song of note within the release." [...] Jennifer Schaffer from the Stanford Daily complimented the sensitivity of the song and commented that [...] "Shakira offers her listeners a far more vulnerable persona" [...] through it. Carlos Macias from Terra Music picked [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] as his favourite track from the album and commended its lyrics, calling them [...] "classic Shakira" [...] and concluding that [...] "It'd been a while since the Colombian superstar offered us an insight into her heart." [...] At the Premios Nuestra Tierra awards ceremony in 2012, [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] was nominated for [...] "Mejor Interpretación Pop Del Año" [...] ("Best Pop Performance of the Year").|$|E
500|$|Though the Gila monster is venomous, its laggard {{movement}} {{means it}} poses little threat to humans. However, it {{has earned a}} fearsome reputation and is often killed by humans because of fear. Among Native American tribes, the Gila monster had a mixed standing. The Apache believed <b>its</b> <b>breath</b> could kill a man, and the Tohono O'Odham and the Pima believed it possessed a spiritual power that could cause sickness. In contrast, the Seri and the Yaqui believed the Gila monster's hide had healing properties. The Gila monster has even starred as a monster in a B movie, The Giant Gila Monster (though the titular monster was actually portrayed by a Mexican beaded lizard). It played a minor role in the motion picture The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. [...] Myths about the animal include that the animal's breath is toxic enough to kill humans, that it can spit venom and that it can leap several {{feet in the air}} to attack. Another myth held that the Gila monster did not have an anus and therefore expelled waste from its mouth, the source of its venom and [...] "fetid breath". The official mascot of [...] Eastern Arizona College located in Thatcher, Arizona, is Gila Hank, a gun-toting, cowboy-hat-wearing Gila monster. A similar character as an old western outlaw was seen in 2011 animated film Rango, called Bad Bill; the character was voiced by Ray Winstone.|$|E
