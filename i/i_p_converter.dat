50|$|The {{transition}} was gradual and {{has extended}} into the 21st century, {{due to the}} huge installed base of 3-15 psi devices. As the operation of pneumatic valves over motorised valves has many cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation is still an industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but allows the use of pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (<b>I</b> to <b>P)</b> <b>converters</b> are available from manufacturers. These are usually located locally to the control valve and convert 4-20 mA to 3-15 psi (or 0.2 - 1.0 bar). This signal is then fed to the valve actuator or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. The positioner is a dedicated controller which has a mechanical linkage to the actuator movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position. It also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation.|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{our project}} is to replace the PID {{instrument}} with virtual PID that has equal controlling capabilities as that of instrument. This designing is possible on software called LabVIEW developed by National Instruments. We also intend to use a DAQ card for interfacing with the hardware. This DAQ card is product of the same company National Instruments. The hardware is a Multiloop Trainer Kit mounted with a tank whose level has to be controlled using a feedback control loop. The flow of project execution is: The designed PID will be generating the necessary controlling electronic signal. This signal will be acquired by DAQ card. The DAQ card transfers it to the <b>I</b> to <b>P</b> <b>converter</b> which will convert the electrical pulses 4 - 20 mA into pneumatic signal 3 - 15 psig to actuate the control valve. This conversion take place as the control valve acts on pneumatic signals only. The control valve controls the fluid flow to maintain the fluid level in tank. The tank is fitted with a capacitive level sensor and a transmitter. This assembly takes the level readings from tank and transmits it to the DAQ card. These values are called process values and are further processed into the designed PID. This way a closed loop system is formed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of grapheme-to-phoneme (G 2 <b>P)</b> <b>converters</b> in a speech recognition context. The precision and recall rates are investigated as potential measures {{of the quality of}} the multiple generated pronunciation variants. Very different results are obtained whether or not we take into account the frequency of occurrence of the words. Since G 2 P systems are rarely evaluated on a speech recognition performance basis, the originality of this paper consists in using a speech recognition system to evaluate the G 2 P pronunciation variants. The results show that the training process is quite robust to some errors in the pronunciation lexicon, whereas pronunciation lexicon errors are harmful in the decoding process.

We show that for-node-port bidirectional rings, a minimum number of R wavelengths are required to support all possible connected virtual topologies in a rearrangeably nonblocking fashion, and provide an algorithm that meets this bound using no more than <b>P</b> wavelength <b>converters.</b> This improves over the tight lower bound of Q wavelengths required for such rings given in [1] if no wavelength conversion is available. We extend this to the general-port case where each node may have a different number of ports, and show that no more than R CIwavelengths are required. We then provide a second algorithm that uses more wavelengths yet requires significantly fewer converters. We also develop a method that allows the wavelength converters to be arbitrarily located at any node in the ring. This gives significant flexibility {{in the design of}} the networks. For example, all <b>P</b> <b>converters</b> can be collocated at a single hub node, or distributed evenly among the nodes with �� � <b>P</b> CI <b>converters</b> at each node.

40|$|Background: Cylophosphamide is used {{alone or}} in combina-tion with other drugs for {{treatment}} of neoplastic diseases. Hemorrhagic cystitis is a major potential toxicity and dose limiting side effect of cyclophosphamide. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of lycopene compared with some antioxidants for the prevention of cyclophosphamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis in rats. Methods: In this study, male Sparague-Dawley rats divided into 17 groups of six animals. Group 1 received saline (10 ml/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p)</b> as normal control, group 2 received cyclophos-phamide (200 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p)</b> as a single dose, groups 3 - 10 received Mesna (40 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p),</b> N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>p),</b> di-thiotheritol (50 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p),</b> L-carnitine (200 and 400 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p),</b> grape seed extract (500 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>p)</b> and lycopene (0. 1 and 0. 5 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p)</b> alone. Groups 11 - 17 received Mesna (40 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p),</b> N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p),</b> dithiotheritol (50 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p),</b> L-carnitine (400 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p),</b> grape seed extract (500 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p)</b> and lycopene (0. 1 and 0. 5 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p),</b> 5 minutes before, and 2 and 6 hours after administration of 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. Pathological and biochemical analysis was evaluated 24 hours after cyclophosphamide administration. Results: Mesna and N-acetylcysteine resulted in some but not full protection against cyclophosphamide toxicity compared to the controls. Lycopene (0. 1 and 0. 5 mg/kg) was efficient in protecting the bladder from cyclophosphamide induced hem-orrhagic cystitis. However, dithiotheritol, L- carnitine and grape seed extract did not prevent hemorrhagic cystitis. Conclusion: Our results suggest that pre and co- treatment of lycopene (0. 1 and 0. 5 mg/kg) with cyclophosphamide may have therapeutic potential to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis by cyclophosphamide...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were made}} from CA 1 pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampal slice to study the processes that influence {{the time course of}} inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (<b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s) mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and conductance changes evoked by ionophoretically applied GABA. The GABA-uptake inhibitors, nipecotic acid and cis- 4 -OH-nipecotic acid (1 mM), greatly prolonged conductance increases associated with both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses to ionophoretically applied GABA. In contrast to their effects on GABA-evoked conductances, uptake inhibitors only slightly prolonged antidromically evoked <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s. Their primary effect occurred after the <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. had decayed to 5 - 30 % of its peak. 4 -OH-isonipecotic acid, a nipecotic acid analogue that does not inhibit GABA uptake, did not prolong <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s or ionophoretically evoked conductance changes. Sodium pentobarbitone (100 microM), a drug that prolongs the open time of GABA-activated chloride channels, potentiated both <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s and responses to ionophoretically applied GABA. Whereas pentobarbitone also prolonged <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s, it did not prolong responses to ionophoretically applied GABA. The prolongation of <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s by pentobarbitone occurred equally in both the early and late phases of the <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p., in contrast to the effects of GABA-uptake inhibitors. <b>I.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s did not usually decay exponentially. The observation that uptake inhibitors prolonged the late but not the early decay phase of the <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p., together with the previous finding that the conductance change persists {{for the duration of the}} <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p., indicate that GABA is present in the synapse throughout much of the <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. These data suggest that diffusion of GABA out of the synapse, a non-exponential process, is an important determinant of the <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. decay time course. Increasing the extracellular potassium concentration from 3. 5 to 8. 5 mM resulted in spontaneously occurring, synchronous burst firing of pyramidal cells. Cis- 4 -OH-nipecotic acid significantly reduced the number and amplitude of extracellularly recorded population spikes within each burst. We conclude that diffusion, channel open time and GABA uptake all influence the time course of GABA-mediated <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s. The time course of a single, brief <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. is determined predominantly by post-synaptic channel kinetics and diffusion of GABA out of the synapse, whereas the inhibition produced by prolonged synaptic bursts or relatively long application of exogenous GABA can be markedly influenced by GABA uptake.

When blood levels were extrapolated to infinity, these Rd (0 – 9 /∞) values were considerably lower with the Fab having the highest Rd at 4. 67. The <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> Rd advantage was almost solely due to the <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> antibody levels seen in the first 24 h after injection, as after that time, blood levels become comparable to those seen following i. v. injection.

(except for higher diaphragmatic levels following <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> delivery). In nude mice with <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> human-derived ovarian tumors, intact IgG clearance from the peritoneal cavity to the blood was considerably slower than in normal animals, and early <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> tumor uptake of specific antibody {{was significantly higher than}} that following i. v. antibody delivery.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} mediating bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced {{injury in the}} colon of neonatal rat pups aged 10 – 12 days was examined. Administration of LPS (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> caused a time-related increase in the plasma concentration of rat mast cell protease-II (RMCP-II) which was attenuated dose-dependently, by the non-selective mast cell stabilizer doxantrazole (0. 05 – 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.).</b> The selective connective tissue mast cell stabilizer ketotifen (5 – 25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> was without effect at the lower dose and had only a limited inhibitory effect at the higher dose. In addition, doxantrazole (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> inhibited mast cell degranulation in response to LPS in sections of neonatal rat colon, but ketotifen (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> was without effect. The increase in plasma RMCP-II concentration in response to LPS treatment preceded increases in tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity and tissue lipid peroxidation. These events were all attenuated by pretreatment with doxantrazole (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.),</b> antineutrophil serum (100 [*]μl[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.),</b> dexamethasone (2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> and the selective iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine (25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.).</b> In addition, lipid peroxidation was inhibited by pre-administration of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (2000 [*]u[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> and catalase (2000 [*]u[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.),</b> the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol (100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> and the peroxyl scavenger deferoxamine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, <b>i.</b> <b>p.),</b> suggesting the involvement of reactive oxygen metabolites in the colonic injury.

This indicates that the effect of ADX 47273 in combination with amphetamine may be specific, and also suggests a lack of sedative side effects. Moreover, ADX 47273 (30 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>p.),</b> haloperidol (0. 1 and 0. 2 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> and aripiprazole (5 and 10 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> reversed apomorphine (0. 5 mg/kg s. c.) -induced deficits of prepulse inhibition, whereas neither LY 354740 (1 – 10 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> nor olanzapine (1. 25 – 5 mg/kg <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> produced this effect.

BRC-induced yawning responses were potentiated by a low dose of apomorphine (0. 1 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> and reserpine (2 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> but were inhibited by high dose of apomorphine, low and high doses of haloperidol (0. 02 and 1 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p.),</b> sulpiride (20 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p.),</b> α -methyl-p-tyrosine (α -MPT; 300 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> and scopokamine (0. 5 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p.).</b> On the other hand, a high dose of apomorphine (4 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> completely inhibited physostigmine (0. 2 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> -induced yawning (physostigmine yawning) but did not affect plicarpine (4 mg/kg, <b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> - induced yawning (pilocarpine yawning). BRC (2. 5 mg/kg) increased physostigmine yawing but completely blocked pilocarpine yawning. Α-MPT (200 mg/kg) did not affect physostigmine yawning but diminished pliocarpine yawning. These results suggest that activation of postsynaptic dopamine receptor (primarily D- 1 receptors) may inhibit cholinergic neurons activated by cholinesterase inhibition, i. e., endogenous acetylcholine, and that the postsynaptic sensitivity of cholinergic neurons to a direct acetylcholine agonist may be reduced by stimulation of presynaptic dopamine receptors (D- 2 receptor) and/or inhibition of dopamine synthesis...|$|R

Recently, good clinical results were achieved with intraperitoneal (<b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> administration of cyclophosphamide and vincristine in cats. However, the bioavailability following <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> administration of cyclophosphamide and vincristine providing proof of principle has not been investigated and {{is the focus of}} the present study.

40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were made}} from motoneurones in the isolated spinal cord of neonatal rats. After action potentials had been abolished by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 10 (- 6) g/ml), small (approximately 0. 4 mV) depolarizing potentials occurred spontaneously in motoneurones at low frequencies (approximately 1. 5 Hz). These potentials were detectable only after the intracellular Cl- concentration of motoneurones was raised by using KCl electrodes {{and most of them}} were blocked by strychnine, suggesting that they are inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (<b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s). These spontaneous <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s under TTX are designated as 'miniature <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s' in order to distinguish them from <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s arising from spontaneous impulse activities of interneurones or afferent fibres. The miniature <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s were still observed after Ca 2 + in saline was substituted by Mg 2 + or Mn 2 +. In low Ca 2 + and high Mg 2 + saline, the amplitude distribution of miniature <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s was essentially the same as in normal saline. The frequency of miniature <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s increased when external Ca 2 + concentration was raised. The frequency decreased to about 60 % of the control when external Ca 2 + was substituted by Mg 2 + (2 - 4 mM), whereas it increased to more than 20 -fold when substituted by Mn 2 + (3 - 5 mM). When the external K+ concentration was raised, the frequency of miniature <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s under TTX increased non-linearly with the K+ concentration. The maximum slope in the relation between the log frequency and log K+ concentration was about 3. 6. When the osmotic pressure was increased by adding sucrose, miniature <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s increased in frequency. The effect of osmotic pressure was relatively mild compared with that reported for the miniature end-plate potentials (e. p. p. s) in the frog. When the temperature was raised, the frequency of miniature <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> s. p. s increased. The relation between frequency and temperature fitted approximately to a straight line in Arrhenius plot with a Q 10 of about 2. 6.
