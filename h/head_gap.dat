50|$|Metal in Gap (MIG) {{heads are}} ferrite heads {{with a small}} piece of metal in the <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> that {{concentrates}} the field. This allows smaller features to be read and written. MIG heads were replaced with thin film heads. Thin film heads were electronically similar to ferrite heads and used the same physics, but they were manufactured using photolithographic processes and thin films of material that allowed fine features to be created. Thin film heads were much smaller than MIG heads and therefore allowed smaller recorded features to be used. Thin film heads allowed 3.5 inch drives to reach 4GB storage capacities in 1995. The geometry of the <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> was a compromise between what worked best for reading and what worked best for writing.|$|E
50|$|Later, in 2009, she toured solo in Victoria and New South Wales, playing mostly new {{material}} {{with a number}} of Magic Dirt tracks included in her sets. During this tour, Adalita revealed that she had started recording the album, at <b>Head</b> <b>Gap</b> Studios in Melbourne, with Dean Turner co-producing and JP Shilo playing on the recordings. Despite being in the studio when well enough, Turner was largely housebound during the recording, and Adalita would go to his house, near <b>Head</b> <b>Gap,</b> to play him the demos. The track, ‘The Repairer’, was written about Turner when he became gravely ill. Adalita has said that she wrote song about her fear of losing Turner when she realised he may die. Recording for the album was completed in July 2009.|$|E
50|$|Like the DAT cassette, ProDigi and DASH {{machines}} also accommodated {{the obligatory}} 44.1 kHz sampling rate, but also 48 kHz on all machines, and a 96 kHz sampling rate on the last-generation units. They overcame {{the problems that}} made typical analog recorders unable to meet the bandwidth (frequency range) demands of digital recording {{by a combination of}} higher tape speeds, narrower <b>head</b> <b>gaps</b> used in combination with metal-formulation tapes, and the spreading of data across multiple parallel tracks.|$|R

40|$|Head {{fields of}} two {{recording}} <b>heads</b> (<b>gap</b> lengths 2. 1 and 2. 8 micrometer) have been measured {{with the help}} of a series of magnetoresistive transducers. The widths of these transducers are 1. 9, 4. 1 and 7. 0 micrometer and they have been positioned in the gap field region very accurately using optical methods. The transducer outputs have been compared with computer simulated results. A systematic deviation between theoretical and experimental results may lead to the assumption that the surface of the recording head is magnetically inactive over a few tenths of a micrometer...|$|R
5000|$|Three-head {{technology}} uses separate {{heads for}} {{recording and playback}} (the third of the three heads being the erase head). This allows different record and playback head gaps to be used. A narrower <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> is optimal for playback than for recording, so the <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> width of any combined record/playback head must necessarily be a compromise. Separate record and playback heads also allow off-the-tape monitoring during recording, permitting immediate verification of the recording quality. (Such machines can be identified {{by the presence of}} a [...] "monitor" [...] switch with positions for [...] "tape" [...] and [...] "source", or similar.) Three-head systems were common on reel-to-reel decks, but were more difficult to implement for cassettes, which do not provide separate openings for record and play heads. Some models squeezed a monitor head into the capstan area, and others combined separate record and playback gaps into a single headshell.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{negative}} aspects of narrow head gaps, particularly for magnetic recording. The narrower the <b>head</b> <b>gap,</b> the more bias signal must be used to maintain linearity of the signal on tape which in turn will reduce the high frequency headroom or SOL (Saturated Output Level), particularly with slower tape speeds. Manufacturers must find a compromise between intended tape speeds and head gaps for this reason.|$|E
5000|$|The band’s line-up was {{solidified}} in 2013, {{and they}} recorded The Hypnotiser at <b>Head</b> <b>Gap</b> Studios in Preston, Victoria, produced by Nick Finch (Graveyard Train) and engineered by Nao Anzai. The album {{was featured in}} year-end critic lists by Triple R, PBS 106.7FM, and Beat Magazine, and was finalist at the prestigious EG Awards for the album's lead single [...] "I’m In Love". The album was also named among the Top 25 Highly Recommended albums on the Coopers AMP Music Prize list.|$|E
5000|$|In later {{auto reverse}} machines, the [...] "auto reverse" [...] {{mechanism}} uses an ordinary two-track, quarter-width head, but operates by mechanically rotating the head 180 degrees {{so that the}} two <b>head</b> <b>gaps</b> access the other tracks of the tape. There is usually an azimuth adjustment screw for each position. Nevertheless, due to the repeated movement, the alignment (in particular, the azimuth) deviates with usage. Even in a machine with a four channel head, slight asymmetries in the cassette shell {{make it difficult to}} align the head perfectly for both directions.|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1982 / Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaHigh {{coercivity}} isotropic tapes {{recorded with}} very small <b>head</b> <b>gaps</b> (0. 2 - 0. 3 μ) support magnetic transition densities exceeding 10, 000 per millimeter (> 250 KFCI) with practical densities of 133 KFCI. The signal is recorded vectorially within the medium with both longitudinal and perpendicular components contributing in-phase fields. Even with very small record gaps, substantial portions of both components in {{proximity to the}} head trailing pole are erased by the head field gradient subsequent to the initial record zone. Comparisons are made between longitudinal and isotropic media with regard to linearity and NPR in analog recording, and NPR in digital recording is examined...|$|R
50|$|A record head, on {{the other}} hand, has a gap {{typically}} six times larger {{than that of the}} replay head, this gives a larger flux to magnetise the tape. The ideal gap size in a cassette deck are; wide record <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> and narrow playback head. The larger gap does not affect frequency response because the 'image' is largely made by the trailing edge of the gap. A combined record/replay head has a compromise size gap typically three times that of a replay only head.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{recording}} head, the playback head {{has a single}} core. The playback <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> covers both of the tracks created by the record head. The magnetic field changes across {{the width of the}} gap are effectively added in the playback head, so the playback head reproduces the audio signal, which is the same in both tracks. But the pilot tone cancels itself in the playback head: at a point on the tape where it has a certain intensity on the upper track, it has the opposite intensity on the lower track, and so always sums to zero.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flying height}} or {{floating}} height or <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> is {{the distance between}} the disk read/write head on a hard disk drive and the platter. The first commercial hard-disk drive, the IBM 305 RAMAC, used forced air to maintain a 0.002-inch (51-micron) spacing between the head and disk. The IBM 1301, introduced in 1961, was the first disk drive in which the head was attached to a [...] "hydrodynamic air bearing slider," [...] which generates its own cushion of pressurized air, allowing the slider and head to fly much closer, 250 microinches (6.35 micrometers) above the disk surface.|$|E

50|$|The IBM 729 Magnetic Tape Unit was IBM's iconic tape {{mass storage}} {{system from the}} late 1950s through the mid-1960s. It was used on late 700, most 7000 and many 1400 series computers. A new dual <b>gap</b> <b>head</b> {{assembly}} allowed read-after-write verification.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} superpara{{magnetic}} {{magnetic force microscopy}} (MFM) tips to obtain high spatial resolution MFM images of recording heads. Profiles of the magnetic field gradient above a thin-film recording head under 3 mA bias current to the head and various tip-head distance conditions are presented. At a low tip-head distance, the gap width, gap location, and gap-field structure can be well resolved in these MFM images. Superparamagnetic tips show promise for the magnetic imaging of recording <b>heads</b> with <b>gap</b> widths below 200 nm...|$|R
5000|$|The {{width of}} the <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> is also {{critical}} - the narrower the gap, the better the head will be - a narrow gap gives much better transcription in the magnetic domain (which equals to more output with high frequency signals in the case with playback heads). The desirability for a narrow gap means that most practical heads are made by forming a narrow V-shaped groove in the back face of the core, and grinding away the front face until the V-groove is just breached. In this way, gaps {{of the order of}} micrometres are achievable.|$|E
50|$|Azimuth {{recording}} {{is the use}} of {{a variation}} in angle between two recording heads that are recording data so close together on magnetic tape that crosstalk would otherwise likely occur. Normally, the head is perpendicular to the movement of the tape, and this is considered zero degrees. However, if the heads are mounted at slightly different angles (such as ±7 degrees in VHS), destructive interference will occur at high frequencies when reading data recorded in the cross-talking channel but not in the channel that is intended to be read. At low frequencies relative to the maximum allowed by the <b>head</b> <b>gap,</b> however, this technique is ineffective. Thus one head is slanted slightly leftwards and the magnetic gap of the other head slanted slightly rightwards.|$|E

50|$|The {{physical}} {{design of}} a head depends on whether it is fixed or rotating. In either case, {{the face of the}} head where the gap is must be made hard wearing and highly smooth to avoid excessive head wear. It can also be seen that due to the construction method of the <b>head</b> <b>gap,</b> head wear will tend to widen the gap, reducing the head's performance over time. The vertical alignment of the heads (the azimuth) must also match between recording and playback for good fidelity, and the gap should be as close to exactly vertical as possible for highest frequency response. Most tape transport mechanisms will allow fine mechanical adjustment of the azimuth of the heads. Sometimes this can be achieved by automatic circuitry - the actual mechanical azimuth adjustment being carried out by taking advantage of the piezo effect of certain types of crystal material.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1985, Sony would {{introduce}} a new feature, High Band or SuperBeta, by again shifting the Y carrier—this time by 800 kHz. This improved the bandwidth available to the Y sideband and increased the horizontal resolution from 240 to 290 lines on a regular-grade Betamax cassette. Since over-the-antenna and cable signals were only 300-330 lines resolution, SuperBeta could make a nearly identical copy of live television. However, the chroma resolution still remained relatively poor, limited to just under 0.4 MHz or approximately 30 lines resolution, whereas live broadcast chrominance resolution was over 100 lines. The heads were also narrowed to 29 μm to reduce crosstalk, with a narrower <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> to play back the higher carrier frequency at 5.6 MHz. Later, some models would feature further improvement, {{in the form of}} Beta-Is, a high band version of the Beta-I recording mode. There were some incompatibilities between the older Beta decks and SuperBeta, but most could play back a high band tape without major problems. SuperBeta decks had a switch to disable the SuperBeta mode for compatibility purposes. (SuperBeta was only marginally supported outside of Sony, as many licensees had already discontinued their Betamax line.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Tape {{speed is}} not the only factor {{affecting}} the quality of the recording. Other factors affecting quality include track width, tape formulation, and backing material and thickness. The design and quality of the recorder are also important factors, in many ways that are not applicable to digital recording systems. The machine's speed stability (wow-and-flutter), <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> size, head quality, and general head design and technology, and the machine's alignment (mostly a maintenance issue, but also a matter of design—how well and precisely it can be aligned) electro-mechanically affect the quality of the recording. The regulation of tape tension affects contact between the tape and the heads and has a very significant impact on the recording and reproduction of high frequencies. The track width of the machine, which is a question of format rather than individual machine design, is one of two major machine factors controlling signal-to-noise ratio (assuming the electronics have high enough S/N not to be a factor), the other being tape speed. S/N ratio varies directly with track width, due to the Gaussian nature of tape noise; doubling the track width doubles the S/N ratio (hence, with good electronics and comparable heads, 8-track cartridges should have half the signal-to-noise of quarter-track 1/4" [...] tape at the same speed, 3-3/4 IPS.) ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{his third}} trip to Egypt in 2001, he {{acquired}} his first violin , {{an event that}} {{eventually led to the}} formation of Baseball, a Middle East influenced fusion band. During a stint in Scotland he met Monika Fikerle (Love of Diagrams)in November 2002 and with bassist, Steve Begovich, they toured Europe, Scandinavia and Japan. After returning from overseas, the group began recording their first album, Gods and Stars, Priests and Kings, with new bassist and keyboardist, Yoshi Araki in mid-2003. In November of that year, Baseball returned to Europe with Love of Diagrams, playing 28 shows across eleven countries, finishing in Osaka, Japan. Araki was not allowed re-entry into Australia and so Baseball underwent the line up change in early 2005 that would cement the foundings for the rest of their career. Ben Butcher joined to play guitar (ex Jihad Against America) and Evelyn Morris joined on drums (Pikelet/True Radical Miracle) Now a four piece with Monika switching from Piano Accordion to bass, and Potts solely on violin and vocals, they were invited to play at the Hohaiyan Rock Concert in Taiwan with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and released an EP, Taiwan/Japan Tour EP in 2005. In 2007, the group recorded [...] "Animal Kingdom" [...] at <b>Head</b> <b>Gap</b> in Melbourne and then undertook an extensive self-funded tour of Europe, taking in Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia, before heading into Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and the UK. 2008 finally saw the release of the band's second album, Animal Kingdom, and three separate national tours followed.
