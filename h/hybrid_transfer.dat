For future experiments, {{it will be}} important to efficiently transfer these molecules from their initial internal quantum state at production to other quantum states of interest.

In single-modal scenario, similar problem is usually relieved by transferring knowledge from large-scale auxiliary datasets (as ImageNet). Knowledge from such single-modal datasets is also very useful for cross-modal retrieval, which can provide rich general semantic information that can be shared across different modalities. However, it is challenging to transfer useful knowledge from single-modal (as image) source domain to cross-modal (as image/text) target domain. Knowledge in source domain cannot be directly transferred to both two different modalities in target domain, and the inherent cross-modal correlation contained in target domain provides key hints for cross-modal retrieval which should be preserved during transfer process.

40|$|Cross-modal {{retrieval}} {{has drawn}} wide interest for retrieval across different modalities of data. However, existing methods based on DNN {{face the challenge}} of insufficient cross-modal training data, which limits the training effectiveness and easily leads to overfitting. Transfer learning is for relieving the problem of insufficient training data, but it mainly focuses on knowledge transfer only from large-scale datasets as single-modal source domain to single-modal target domain. Such large-scale single-modal datasets also contain rich modal-independent semantic knowledge that can be shared across different modalities. Besides, large-scale cross-modal datasets are very labor-consuming to collect and label, so it is significant to fully exploit the knowledge in single-modal datasets for boosting cross-modal retrieval. This paper proposes modal-adversarial <b>hybrid</b> <b>transfer</b> network (MHTN), which {{to the best of our}} knowledge is the first work to realize knowledge transfer from single-modal source domain to cross-modal target domain, and learn cross-modal common representation. It is an end-to-end architecture with two subnetworks: (1) Modal-sharing knowledge transfer subnetwork is proposed to jointly transfer knowledge from a large-scale single-modal dataset in source domain to all modalities in target domain with a star network structure, which distills modal-independent supplementary knowledge for promoting cross-modal common representation learning. (2) Modal-adversarial semantic learning subnetwork is proposed to construct an adversarial training mechanism between common representation generator and modality discriminator, making the common representation discriminative for semantics but indiscriminative for modalities to enhance cross-modal semantic consistency during transfer process.

40|$|In this dissertation, architectures, {{hardware}} design and prototypes for {{the realization of}} 2 -D filters are presented. These filtering architectures are capable of attaining real-time processing rates for advanced television systems and are economical in terms of hardware cost, fabrication cost, and power consumption. Sample-and-hold type realizations, operating on 2 -D sampled data, based on the standard 2 -D discrete-time transfer function H(z 1,z 2) are presented. Both IIR and FIR realizations are developed in terms of high-speed systolic architectures. The design process culminates {{in the development of}} a 2 x 2 recursive prototype. Instead of using the standard discrete-time transfer function it is also possible to develop 2 -D filters based on a 2 -D <b>hybrid</b> <b>transfer</b> function H(z,s) which involves both z-domain and s-domain variables. These are highly suitable for filtering a raster scanned image, which can be characterized as an input signal X(z,s), which is a function of these same two variables. Design considerations are presented which culminate {{in the development of a}} 1 x 1 recursive prototype. The sample-and-hold systolic architecture was employed together with switched-capacitor circuit techniques to develop a 2 -D real-time switched-capacitor recursive filter. This type of filter features greater accuracy than a conventional analog circuit as well as advantages for VLSI implementation. In addition to presenting novel design methodologies for hardware prototypes, a novel function block approach for the SPICE simulation of 2 -D modular systems with true 2 -D data is provided.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, construction and optimisation {{of a new}} apparatus to produce Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of 87 Rb atoms. The main aim in building this system was to include a high resolution imaging system capable of resolving single atoms. Optical access for the imaging system was created by including a stage of atom transport in which the atoms are magnetically transferred ~ 50 cm from a magneto-optical trap (MOT), where they are initially collected, to a glass science cell where experiments are carried out and imaging takes place. Two magnetic transport schemes have been demonstrated, based on approaches first used in other laboratories. First, a scheme in which the atoms are transferred in a moving pair of magnetic trapping coils. Second, a hybrid scheme where the atoms are translated part of the distance in the moving coils, {{and the rest of}} the way by switching the current in a chain of fixed coils. This second scheme was designed to allow optical access for a high numerical aperture microscope objective to be placed immediately next to the science cell for high resolution imaging. The atoms were first collected in a large pyramid MOT which can be loaded with 3 × 10 ^ 9 atoms in a time of 20 s. Around half of these atoms – those in the |F = 1, mF = − 1 > magnetic substate – were then magnetically trapped prior to transport. The typical fraction of the trapped atoms transferred to the science cell was ~ 30 % and ~ 18 % for the moving coils and hybrid schemes respectively. Evaporative cooling was carried out on the atom cloud following transport with the moving coils and loading into a time-orbiting potential trap. The optimised cooling sequence lasted for 28 s and consistently produced a pure condensate with 5 × 10 ^ 5 atoms. A BEC has also been produced by evaporative cooling following hybrid transport. The next experimental steps will be to optimise the <b>hybrid</b> <b>transfer</b> approach further and install the high resolution imaging system. The system is well-placed to continue an ongoing series of experiments in which ultracold atoms are trapped in RF-dressed potentials. These potentials will be used to study low-dimensional quantum gases as well as in experiments where small atom number BECs are rapidly rotated to enter the fractional quantum Hall regime. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a novel robust {{estimation}} {{strategy for}} observing the system state variables of robotic manipulators with distributed flexibility is established. Motivation for the derived approach {{stems from the}} observation that lightweight, high speed, and large workspace robotic manipulators often suffer performance degradation because of inherent structural compliance. This flexibility often results in persistent residual vibration, which must be damped before useful work can resume. Inherent flexibility in robotic manipulators, then, increases cycle times and shortens the operational lives of the robots. Traditional compensation techniques, those which are commonly used for the control of rigid manipulators, can only approach {{a fraction of the}} open-loop system bandwidth without inducing significant excitation of the resonant dynamics. To improve the performance of these systems, the structural flexibility cannot simply be ignored, as it is when the links are significantly stiff and approximate rigid bodies. One thus needs a model to design a suitable compensator for the vibration, but any model developed to correct this problem will contain parametric error. And in the case of very lightly damped systems, like flexible robotic manipulators, this error can lead to instability of the control system for even small errors in system parameters. This work presents a systematic solution for the problem of robust state estimation for flexible manipulators in the presence of parametric modeling error. The solution includes: 1) a modeling strategy, 2) sensor selection and placement, and 3) a novel, multiple model estimator. Modeling of the FLASHMan flexible gantry manipulator is accomplished using a developed <b>hybrid</b> <b>transfer</b> matrix / assumed modes method (TMM/AMM) approach to determine an accurate low-order state space representation of the system dynamics. This model is utilized in a genetic algorithm optimization in determining the placement of MEMs accelerometers for robust estimation and observability of the system’s flexible state variables. The initial estimation method applied to the task of determining robust state estimates under conditions of parametric modeling error was of a sliding mode observer type. Evaluation of the method through analysis, simulations and experiments showed that the state estimates produced were inadequate. This {{led to the development of}} a novel, multiple model adaptive estimator. This estimator utilizes a bank of similarly designed sub-estimators and a selection algorithm to choose the true value from a given set of possible system parameter values as well as the correct state vector estimate. Simulation and experimental results are presented which demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the derived method for the task of state variable estimation for flexible robotic manipulators.

40|$|Orbit {{averaging}} {{techniques are}} used to develop analytical approximations of circle-to-circle low-thrust trajectory transfers with plane-change about the Sun. Separate expressions are developed for constant acceleration, or thrust, electric propulsion, solar sail propulsion and combined, or hybrid electric (constant acceleration or thrust) / solar sail propulsion. The analytical expressions uniquely allow the structure of circle-to-circle low-thrust trajectory transfers with plane-change about the Sun to be understood, and the optimal trajectory structure is analytically derived for each propulsion system considered. It is found that the optimal fixed thrust electric propulsion transfer reduces the orbit radius with no plane change and then performs the plane-change, while the optimal solar sail and <b>hybrid</b> <b>transfers</b> combine the reduction of orbit radius with some plane change, before then completing the plane change. The optimal level of plane change during the reduction of orbit radius is derived and it is found the analytically-derived minimum time solar sail transfer is within 1 % of the numerically-derived optimal transfer. It is also found that, under the conditions considered, a sail characteristic acceleration of less than 0. 5 mm/s 2 can, in 5 -years, attain a solar orbit that maintains the observer-to-solar pole zenith angle below 40 degrees for 25 days; the approximate sidereal rotation period of the Sun.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{the authors}} propose a <b>hybrid</b> Wireless Power <b>Transfer</b> (WPT) - Power Line Communications (PLC) system, {{in which the}} WPT channel is interfaced to a PLC environment to allow data transfer when a cabled connection is no longer available. The system could be of potential use whenever charging and data transfer are performed at the same tame, for instance during electric vehicle battery charging in a Smart Grid Environment. The considered WPT structure is the four coils coupled resonators and the optimization is performed taking into account energy efficiency/power transfer and channel capacity...|$|R

This method creates an asymmetric mapping from the target to the source and takes into account bias issues of cross-domain correspondences. HHTL proposes using a Deep Learning [68] approach to perform cross-domain feature mapping and distribution bias reduction. It uses a labeled source, unlabeled target, and unlabeled correspondence data. When using correspondence data between source and target domains the method assumes that they are statistically representative (though this assumption may not always hold in real-world scenarios). An example of using correspondence data is when one has a cross-lingual, cross-domain review sentiment classification task in which we could use review-correspondences to learn a mapping between the two languages. The issue becomes that transforming the data from one language to another may not be effective due to distribution bias caused by the difference in product domains. Thus, this method aims to discover a latent feature representation to reduce such bias after transformation.|$|R
