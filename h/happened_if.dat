5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Relational or Debriefing (Polish: relacyjne) sejmiks {{heard the}} reports of deputies {{returned}} from the General Sejm, usually presenting the law (konstytucje sejmowe) decreed by the Sejm.

Such sejmiks could also receive special requests from the king; this <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> the sejmik deputy was bound by instructions not to vote on certain issues that subsequently were voted on and passed in the national sejm. In such cases the king would request the sejmik to reconsider their decision and support the national legislation. These sejmiks arose in the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest {{that he might have}} developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might {{not have been able to}} write what would become his greatest works.|$|E

25|$|The {{researchers}} found {{the results of}} this study to match their initial hypothesis that the gambler's fallacy could in fact be countered by the use of the hot hand and people's attention to the person who was actively flipping the coin. It is important to note that this counteraction of the gambler's fallacy only <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> the person tossing the coin remained the same. This study shed light on the idea that the gambler's and hot hand fallacies at times fight for dominance when people try to make predictions about the same event.|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} of land is somewhat obscure. One maxim suggests that the youngest son divided the land into equal parts. The eldest chose first, followed by the second and so on until the youngest received the remaining land. The intent was to make {{division of}} land equal. Other laws suggested that the eldest son had automatic claims to the buildings. However, there are some hints that this only <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> a younger son challenged a division. The normal practice was that the eldest son both divided and chose first, but had to divide equally. More rarely, a father might divide the land for his sons in his lifetime.|$|E

25|$|Pandemic was {{aided by}} Weta Digital in {{developing}} the game. They provided many of their digital models, including the fell beasts. Pandemic also used elements that were cut from the films, and have taken inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien's original fantasy series, such as a level based loosely around Balin's conquest of Moria, in which Gimli attempts to retake the dwarven city from the orcs. Some inspiration was less direct: the armies of Rohan and Gondor decide not to attack Minas Morgul in the novel, but a level in the game is based on what might possibly have <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> they had. The game uses Howard Shore's score to the films as its soundtrack.|$|E
25|$|Cave 1 {{was built}} on the eastern end of the horse-shoe shaped scarp and is now the first cave the visitor encounters. This cave, when first made, would have been a less {{prominent}} position, right {{at the end of the}} row. According to Spink, it is one of the last caves to have been excavated, when the best sites had been taken and was never fully inaugurated for worship by the dedication of the Buddha image in the central shrine. This is shown by the absence of sooty deposits from butter lamps on the base of the shrine image, and the lack of damage to the paintings that would have <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> the garland-hooks around the shrine had been in use for any period of time. Spink states that the Vākāţaka Emperor Harishena was the benefactor of the work, and this is reflected in the emphasis on imagery of royalty in the cave, with those Jataka tales being selected that tell of those previous lives of the Buddha in which he was royal.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Wilson {{remembers how}} {{he got a job}} at the local {{airfield}} thanks to Frank's dad. Frank quickly became a pilot, but Wilson didn't have the money to get flight certified and as such became a mechanic and fixed planes. Regardless he was still happy in life and eventually asked Amelia to marry him, and she agreed. That evening Amelia told Lawrence, who strangely didn't say anything at all, and left to do some work in the field. When Frank found out about the wedding, he privately told Wilson to cancel it saying that Amelia would never settle for a quiet life in Bastion Falls. Wilson ignored his request, confident he would soon have his pilots license and would be able to fly her to the Big City. Suddenly the bell from the hilltop church begins to ring in the Dreamscape, and Wilson heads over there. Once he does he remembers how on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, saying that this would never have <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> he hadn't asked her to marry him.|$|E
