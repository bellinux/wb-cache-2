50|$|Terrestrial {{studies on}} {{priority}} effects are rare. The aforementioned ISI Web of Science search retrieved only 19 studies on fully terrestrial organisms, {{and all of}} these studies were published during or after 1993. Most studies have focused on arthropods or <b>grassland</b> <b>plant</b> species. In a lab experiment, Shorrocks and Bingley (1994) showed that prior arrival increased survivorship for two species of fruit flies; each fly species had inhibitory impacts on the other. A 1996 field study on desert spiders by Ehmann and MacMahon showed that the presence of species from one spider guild reduced establishment of spiders from a different guild. More recently, Palmer (2003) demonstrated that priority effects allowed a competitively subordinate ant species to avoid exclusion by a competitively dominant species. If the competitively subordinate ants were able to colonize first, they altered their host tree’s morphology in ways that made it less suitable for other ant species. This study was especially important because it was able to identify a mechanism driving observed priority effects.|$|E

50|$|Dry grasslands are {{threatened}} and vulnerable habitats {{all across the}} globe because they contain both endangered plant and animal species. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to maintain dry grasslands, to prevent the extinction of these species. A program by Life-Nature is set up with the aim of increasing the overall area of grasslands and improving the conditions of the already existing ones. This project is co-financed by the European Union. A problem for the majority of these areas is that they are not grazed sufficiently or not grazed properly. This leads other plant species to thrive and take over, causing the dry <b>grassland</b> <b>plant</b> species to have a lack of natural resources that are needed for survival. The aim of this program is to get rid of the overgrowth, as well as start and maintain proper grazing in the future. Besides this, it is also equally important to make the public (more) aware of these areas and the problems that they are facing. This can be done by organizing field trips to the areas so that the people can witness it themselves.|$|E

Method: A 15 N tracer methodology with 15 N enriched ammonium-sulphate placed at three different soil depths (0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 2 m) was applied to determine the depth dependent soil N-access measured as plant 15 N-uptake in pure stands, two-species and four-species <b>grassland</b> <b>plant</b> communities. Important findings: The study showed that herbage yield of the four-species mixture including deep- and shallow rooted <b>grassland</b> <b>plant</b> species was generally greater than both the pure stands and the two-species mixture, besides for lucerne in pure stand. This positive plant diversity effect in the four-species mixture on above-ground herbage yield could not be explained by complementary soil 15 N uptake from 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 2 m soil depths, even though chicory indicated deep soil 15 N uptake. Perennial ryegrass demonstrated relatively deep soil 15 N uptake when grown in pure stand, but showed increasing shallow 15 N uptake from grown in a two-species to a four-species mixture. Total soil 15 N uptake from three soil depths of a mixture 51 comprising two deep-rooted and two shallow-rooted plant species was not greater compared with a shallow-rooted two-species mixture. 15 Nitrogen uptake from 1. 2 m may have been too small to determine any differences.

In the first study, <b>grassland</b> <b>plant</b> diversity was found to be strongly correlated to 18 th and 19 th century land use, more so than to current land use. Furthermore, the particular sequence by which one land use changed into another from the 18 th century until the mid 20 th century was an important predictor of plant diversity. In the second study, detailed comparison of 18 th century and current grassland management revealed that current grassland management lacks several ecological factors that the literature deems important for <b>grassland</b> <b>plant</b> reproduction. The third and the fourth study explore how plant species richness in specific grasslands is related to the surrounding landscape by studying how current, 19 th and 20 th century grassland connectivity and area are reflected in current species richness of grassland plants. They revealed that the response of <b>grassland</b> <b>plant</b> diversity to different fragmentation components can differ widely between two superficially similar landscapes, although historical components were important in both landscapes for explaining current diversity patterns. Moreover, the direction of livestock movement within the pre-industrial landscape appears to have been an important determinant regarding the functional connectivity between different grassland patches. Given the strong correlation between historical agricultural practices and current plant diversity patterns, this thesis discusses this diversity as a biocultural heritage. The historical aspects of grassland diversity ought to be taken into account in conservation and restoration measures...|$|E

Nevertheless, the linear landscape element such as forest edge vegetation along roads might have functioned as habitats for many native grassland species under the condition of regular mowing for traffic safety reason.

Bird abundance was more strongly influenced by the amount and type of grassland within 400 m of breeding parcels than at larger spatial scales. Grassland specialists responded similarly to habitat and landscape type over both years and provinces. Sprague’s pipit (Anthus spragueii) and Baird’s sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) were most common in native grassland parcels surrounded by native grassland and were more likely to occur in <b>planted</b> <b>grasslands</b> surrounded by native grassland. Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) were most common in <b>planted</b> <b>grassland</b> parcels, but their abundance increased with the amount of native grassland surrounding these parcels.
