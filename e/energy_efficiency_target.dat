40|$|The {{increasing}} number of energy and climate targets both at national and inter-national level induces a rising demand for regular monitoring. In this paper, we analyse the possibilities and limits of using <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> indicators {{as a tool for}} monitoring these targets. We refer to the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets</b> of the German "Energiewende" and calculate and discuss several <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> indicators for Germany both {{at the level of the}} overall economy and the main energy consumption sectors. We make use of the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> indicator toolbox that we have developed within the ODYSSEE database in recent years and find that there is still a considerable gap to close to achieve the overall <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets</b> in Germany by 2020. We also show that progress in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> slowed down between 2008 and 2012, i. e. compared to the base year of most of the German <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets</b> and find that <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> progress in the industrial sector during the last decade has been especially slow. We conclude that improvements in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> have to speed up considerably in order to achieve the targets for 2020. Although the use of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> indicators is limited by data constraints and some methodological problems, these indicators give a deep insight into the factors determining energy consumption and can therefore complement the official monitoring process of the German "Energiewende" which only relies on highly aggregated indicators for <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{national}} or EU-wide <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets,</b> a variety of policies is available. Apart from the traditional set of regulative, financial, fiscal and informative instruments, market-oriented instruments as e. g. <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> obligations (EEOs) {{become more and more}} important. The new EU <b>Energy</b> <b>Efficiency</b> Directive (EED) even suggests EEOs as the preferred instrument for promoting <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> in all Member States. Their actual impact, however, depends highly on the national framework. With a multi-criteria, semi-quantitative approach we evaluate {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these instruments, taking Germany as an example. The evaluation shows that none of the instruments alone can achieve the prescribed <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets,</b> but that a mix of instruments is necessary. The possibility of a budget-independence of the funding in particular supports a supplementary deployment of new market-oriented instruments such as an EEO as part of the future mix of policy instruments in Germany...|$|R

40|$|The German Energy Concept of 2010 proposes {{measures}} for industry to advance <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{in the industry}} sector e. g. energy management system (EMS). In our study, we characterize various experiences with policy instruments to accelerate the improvement of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> We define implementation options which describe how the achievement of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets</b> and financial incentives can be linked {{on the base of}} an EMS. The implementation options are characterized by their <b>target</b> type (<b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> improvements or installation of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures), the level at which targets have to be achieved (branch or company level) and in the type of indicators for verification (energy intensity improvement vs. <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> investment). All implementation options aim at setting pertinent incentives for <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> improvement in each company. One evaluation criterion is the capability of dealing with the variance of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> improvements over time. We conducted an analysis of the historic annual energy savings in the period 2000 - 09. The results show a large variance, which results from the discontinuity of various impact factors. This must be considered, if consistent incentives for energy savings shall be provided over time. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability to formulate effective <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets.</b> The study quantifies the energy savings potential of the German industry until 2020 under different scenarios. We discuss for each implementation option how well it supports the realization of the resulting energy savings potentials. A third criterion relates to the integration of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets</b> into a companies' decision-making process. A company will consider the implementation of an <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measure, if the payback period for additional investment cost is short enough or sufficient financial incentives exist. We expect that {{by the time of the}} Summer Study we can report about the outcome of the actual discussions in Germany...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{the energy}} {{transition}} process, the German government has set far-reaching <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets,</b> including doubling the annual rate of building renovation to upgrade energy performance from one to two percent. DIW Berlin has estimated the additional energy-savings-related investment required to meet these targets and analyzed the impact this could have on the economy. In the long term, the savings on household energy bills far exceed the additional investment. This, combined with further measures to increase <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> in other sectors, substantially reduces energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Even allowing for some elements of uncertainty, these measures to improve <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{have a positive impact}} on income and domestic demand. They could also result in significantly positive effects on employment, depending on the ratio of productivity gains and new jobs. Nevertheless, the most recent savings are not nearly enough to achieve the German government's <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets.</b> Clear and reliable framework conditions are needed soon to increase the number of buildings being renovated to upgrade energy performance. Given the present analyses, which indicate that forcing the pace of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> improvements has a positive impact on German economic growth and employment, the government's hesitation seems even less justified...|$|R
40|$|Due to megatrends, such as {{climate change}} and {{population}} growth, energy issues have become very important in political discussion. In addition to energy savings, {{and the use of}} different <b>energy</b> sources, <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> – consuming less energy to produce the same or more value – is an essential matter, and one of the important goals for the European Union. In this thesis, the targets of the EU 2020 / 2030 agreements – decreasing <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> 20 % by 2020 and 27 % by 2030 compared to 1990 – have served as a preferred future vision for <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> exploration. Finland and Germany were chosen as case countries for this thesis, because of their interesting, but different energy policies. Both forecasting and backcasting scenario techniques were utilized to see whether these countries will reach the set <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets</b> of the EU by 2020 and 2030. Also, Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis and de-linking energy consumption from GDP growth were examined to get better understanding of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Five future scenarios – business-as-usual BAU, industry, service, non-renewable, and renewable – were created for both countries by using LINDA accounting framework model. In addition, three intensity scenarios were conducted for Finland and Germany. All of the scenarios were based on the historical data as well as future visions, strategies, and plans of the countries. In this thesis, all the scenarios of Finland and Germany reached the EU 2020 / 2030 <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets.</b> The service and renewable scenarios had the best efficiency figures, whereas the industry and non-renewable scenarios had lower efficiencies than BAU scenario. The EK-Curve did not occur in Finland BAU, but it did appear in Germany. In Finland, de-linking energy consumption from economic growth was weak, whereas in Germany, de-linking appeared to be strong. Because of the challenges in interpreting the several <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets,</b> more convenient and coherent ways are needed for measuring. Even though the <b>efficiency</b> <b>targets</b> of the EU are good in trigger action, there might be a need for even more strict targets.

40|$|Abstract—Target {{tracking}} and localization are important applications in wireless sensor networks. In these applications, sensor nodes collectively monitor and track {{the movement of}} a target. They have limited energy supplied by batteries, so energy efficiency is essential for sensor networks. Most existing target tracking protocols need to wake up sensors periodically to perform tracking. Some unnecessary energy waste is thus introduced. In this paper, an energy efficient protocol for target localization is proposed. In order to preserve energy, the protocol fixes the number of sensors for target tracking, but it retains the quality of target localization in an acceptable level. By selecting a set of sensors for target localization, the other sensors can sleep rather than periodically wake up to track the target. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed protocol saves a significant amount of energy and also prolongs the network lifetime.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{experiences}} gained from tradable green certificate (TGC) schemes and extract some policy lessons {{that can lead}} to a successful design of a market-based approach for energy efficiency improvement, alias tradable white certificate schemes. We use tradable green certificate schemes existing in the Netherlands and Sweden as case studies. Departing from an assessment of both TGC schemes, we identify several institutional and market aspects that have affected their performance. We conduct the analysis by addressing key evaluation criteria (i. e., cost and energy effectiveness, administrative burden, technological innovation, political feasibility, and transaction costs). It is not our intention to demonstrate to the reader a normative aspect of designing tradable white certificate schemes. Rather, we identify some key policy lessons which can be summarized as: a binding long-term target must be clearly expressed in terms of policy time frame and certainty, a proper liquid market must be ensured for tradability of certificates, the scheme should be technology neutral, transaction costs should be kept low, and the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>target</b> should not only address ‘low hanging fruits’ but also promote innovation...|$|E
