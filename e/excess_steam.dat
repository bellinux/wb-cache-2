40|$|In many {{industrial}} processes, {{large quantities}} of energy are often wasted {{in the form of}} low pressure steam and low-grade heat. Economical recovery of these waste energy sources is often difficult due to such factors as low temperature levels and contamination of the steam. In industrial processes that utilize steam directly or as a mode of energy transport, waste energy can be efficiently recovered and upgraded in the form of high-pressure steam by means of an open-cycle steam heat pump system. Recovery and upgrading of these waste steam or heat sources offer a great potential for energy conservation. Thermo Electron has developed, under sponsorship by the Gas Research Institute, Southern California Gas Company, and the Consolidated Natural Gas Service Company, an open-cycle steam heat pump to recover this waste energy in the form of high-pressure process steam. The system utilizes <b>excess</b> low-pressure <b>steam</b> (or that produced from an excess heat source with a waste heat boiler) and compresses this steam to the desired pressure level for process use.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of water-gas shift {{were studied}} over ferrochrome catalysts under conditions with high carbon dioxide partial pressures, such {{as would be}} expected in a membrane reactor. The catalyst activity is inhibited by increasing carbon dioxide partial pressure. A microkinetic model of the reaction kinetics was developed. The model indicated that catalyst performance could be improved by decreasing the strength of surface oxygen bonds. Literature data indicated that adding either ceria or copper to the catalyst as a promoter might impart this desired effect. Ceria-promoted ferrochrome catalysts did not perform any better than unpromoted catalyst at the conditions tested, but copper-promoted ferrochrome catalysts did offer an improvement over the base ferrochrome material. A different class of water-gas shift catalyst, sulfided CoMo/Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } is not affected by carbon dioxide and may be a good alternative to the ferrochrome system, provided other constraints, notably the requisite sulfur level and maximum temperature, are not too limiting.

40|$|The {{effect of}} quench {{conditions}} on the properties of fumed silica generated using an arc process was studied. The process consisted of vaporizing quartz particles in a batch transferred arc reactor using the radiative energy from an Ar/NH$ sb 3 $ thermal plasma. Ammonia was used to increase the vaporization rate of quartz. The hot gas stream exiting the reactor contained a mixture of the decomposition products of NH$ sb 3 $ and SiO$ sb 2 $. This included SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$, O$ sb 2 $, H$ sb 2 $ and N$ sb 2 $. Rapid quenching of this gas stream with steam resulted {{in the production of}} a fumed silica aerosol. Collection of the product took place in a baghouse filter. The quench conditions studied included pre-quench temperature, T$ sb{ rm q}$, and supersaturation, P$ sb{ rm s}$, quench rate, R$ sb{ rm q}$, and quench stoichiometry, S$ sb{ rm q}$. P$ sb{ rm s}$ was defined as the molar ratio of SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$ flow, calculated from the quartz weight loss during an experiment, to the SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$ flow predicted at equilibrium. S$ sb{ rm q}$ was the molar ratio of steam to SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$ flow. In general, high pre-quench temperatures, high quench rates, and low pre-quench supersaturation ratios, produced high surface area powders. Quench stoichiometry did not have an effect here, but the use of a large <b>excess</b> of <b>steam</b> in the quench caused the degree of surface hydroxylation to be high.

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges of our time in an environmental point of view is greenhouse gas emissions and specially carbon dioxide emissions. Higher levels of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere leads to a raise of the average temperature on earth, which results in disasters such as drought, storms and flooding. Carbon capture and storage is therefore a necessary technology to develop, especially for fossil fuels but also for biomass. With carbon capture and storage from fossil fuels the emissions can at the very best be reduced to zero but {{it is not possible to}} remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, this is made possible by using biomass combined with storage. In order to achieve so called negative emission levels, which results in lower greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, it is necessary to implement new technologies. There are currently a few proposed technologies for carbon capture and storage and this report aims to study a new process technique, wet oxidation with oxygen, which is intended to be implemented in the pulp- and paper industry to make carbon capture and storage possible for the carbon dioxide produced by oxidation of black liquor. The process is intended to replace the recovery boiler and the evaporator and since two major process units are replaced this can enable economic savings and significant emission reductions. A modelling of a reactor was included in the project and it shows that by replacing air with oxygen a higher temperature can be achieved in the reactor. Furthermore, the degree of conversion is higher when using oxygen, partly because of the higher temperature but also because of a higher concentration of oxygen in the reactor. The process optimization shows that the process is self-sufficient and that <b>excess</b> process <b>steam</b> can be exported.

40|$|The Rio Tinto Alcan - Yarwun (RTA Y) alumina {{refinery}} {{is currently}} undergoing a major expansion, {{with the possibility}} of further expansion in the future. The current expansion sees the addition of a Gas Turbine (GT) and Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) to the utility system, resulting in significant excess high pressure (HP) steam generating capacity in the utility system. Additionally, an excess of low pressure (LP) flash steam is generated from the HP condensate and is currently vented to atmosphere. The aim of this thesis was to determine if it is worthwhile utilising any of this excess LP and HP steam for additional power generation. In order to achieve this, a process model was developed to determine process steam demands under various refinery flow configurations allowing calculation of available <b>excess</b> HP <b>steam</b> generating capacity. Models for steam turbines, gas turbines and HRSGs were also developed and in combination with the process model allowed an overall utility system model to be created to study the impact on efficiency, C 02 -e emissions and operating costs of a number of different turbine configurations for varying refinery production rates. The impacts of a carbon tax as well as seasonal variations in electricity prices were also studied. It was shown that the installation of a HP turbine is detrimental to the operating cost of the utility system when operated primarily as a condensing (as opposed to a backpressure) turbine due to the poor overall efficiency of the power generation when not being run as part of a cogeneration system. On the other hand, the installation of an LP turbine would be quite beneficial to the refinery as it is utilising what is effectively waste energy to generate power. At current coal and gas prices, utilisation of supplementary firing in the HRSG is preferred to coal firing of the boiler as not only are C 02 -e emissions significantly reduced, but the overall efficiency is increased with a corresponding reduction in operating costs. The variation in electricity prices between summer and winter has a significant impact on utility operating costs and can even result in negative returns on power generation. Interestingly, the introduction of a carbon tax may in fact be of benefit to the operation due to the expected increase in grid-generated (predominantly coal fired) power prices exceeding the increased cost of the refinery's gas fired power generation. This is of course highly dependent upon what form a carbon tax would take and how it would be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Steam {{reforming}} of CH 4 is {{an established}} industrial {{process for the}} formation of synthesis gas. It takes place in two reversible stages: Cf 4 reforming reaction (1) followed by the water-gas shift (2). Reaction (1) takes place at high temperature (approximately 1200 K) and pressure (15 - 30 bar) to maximise the efficiency and conversion while reaction (2) takes pl. ace at as Iowa temperature as possible. The biggest worry to the steam reforming industry is the formation ofcarbon which is produced favourably via three side-reactions: (3) Cf 4 C+ 2 H 2 &= 75 kJmorl (4) 2 CO C+C 02 MIo = - 171 kJ morl (5) CO +rr 2, b C+H 20 MIo = - 131 kJ morl The catalysts currently used for reaction (1) are based on Ni metal however, Ni is prone to formation of a type of carbon known as 'whiskers' (filamental carbon) which form when deposited carbon dissolves into the bulk metal. These structures result in a breakdown of the catalyst particles leading to reactor tube blockages and eventual costly damage. Certain measure can be taken to reduce carbon, namely, use ofexcess steam; partial poisoning of the catalyst with sulfur and alterations to the catalyst formulation such as alkali dopants and noble metals. In this project, the behaviour of eight supported noble metals (Rh, Pt, Ru and Ni supported on La-Zr 02 and Ah 03) during reactions (3) -(5) at 20 bar and 873 K was investigated. It has been shown previously that noble metal catalysts can be more active than Ni during steam reforming and are more carbon resistant. More significantly, noble metal catalysts do not form whisker carbon. High pressure reactions (3) and (4) combined with a series of low pressure ~ulses followed by mass spectrometry revealed the greater stability of the La-Zr 02 supported catalysts due to strong metal support interactions (SMSI) and a faster rate of O-transfer. Ni was always the more reactive catalyst although it was not compared at high pressure for risk of potential damage. Common mechanisms were proposed for all catalysts involving interaction of surface OH-groups with reactant species on all La-Zr 02 and Ah 03 catalysts. The reactivity of the Ah 03 catalysts was related to percentage metal dispersion although this was not apparent for the La-Zr 02 catalysts. Deactivation studies revealed the likely first and second order behaviour of reactions (4) and (3) respectively. These studies also showed how the r!lte of deactivation was greater over Pt than Rh. Theories on the type of carbon produced during reaction (3) were discussed. Each noble metal catalyst produced a unique reaction profile during reaction (5) and the greater reactivity of the La-Zr 02 catalysts was attributed to interfacial metalsupport interactions (IMSl). The reaction profile was clearly affected by the nature of. the metal and the support and so a mechanism was proposed with an explanation of each catalysts' behaviour in terms oftype ofmetal and support..

Plants have generally {{done a good job of}} stewarding the 90 % of savings available through Utility and Equipment related energy metrics, primarily because target setting is fairly straightforward. However, the 10 % of savings available from Process metrics, such as tower reflux ratios, pumparound rates, and steam stripping ratios, are typically missing from energy management systems due to the difficulty in first identifying them, and second in determining the optimum targets. Target setting is most difficult because with process metrics, yield considerations must be included in the target setting process. It is quite easy, for example, to save energy by cutting tower reflux rates. But too much reduction will sacrifice yield performance. Even at elevated energy prices, even the smallest reduction in yield will typically offset any energy savings that might have been captured. Therefore, in order to effectively incorporate Process energy metrics into the plant energy management system, knowledge of both energy and yield parameters is required. This paper will explore an effective methodology for determining what process unit energy metrics are important, how to effectively set their targets, and how to incorporate them into an effective energy management system. In terms of how to identify process energy metrics, the paper will discuss which energy intensive processes should be examined first, such as crude distillation and cat cracking. In terms of target setting, the paper will describe how process engineering experience is combined with simulation to develop meaningful targets that characterize the point where yield and energy are simultaneously optimized. Finally, the work process require...|$|R
