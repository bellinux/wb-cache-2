5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were positive, with Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club calling it [...] "an episode of Family Guy that rewards every viewer who liked the show in the past." [...] McFarland also gave high praise to the episode, writing, [...] "At first, I was simply pleased that 'Back to the Pilot' didn't screw things up at the beginning, but as the episode went, I <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the clock and being amazed that it hadn't dropped the ball yet. It used short cutaways and a plethora of self-referential jokes the writers must have stockpiled for years about the animation quality, voice quality, {{and structure of the}} pilot to every possible advantage." [...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight." [...] She continued, [...] "Treating its animated characters like real actors was a nice touch as well. [...] Watching the original family showed how much the characters evolved and changed throughout the series' long run." [...] Moon concluded her review by giving the episode a 4.2 out of 5. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number two on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pure genius". He added, [...] "Not only was the episode hilarious with amazing Brian and Stewie moments, but it was genuinely quite clever in the time-travel stakes, which is impressive on a nerd level." ...|$|E
60|$|Felicity said nothing. She <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> down <b>at</b> {{the grass}} {{on which she}} sat, absently pulling at the slender blades. Presently we saw two big tears roll down over her cheeks. The Story Girl looked surprised.|$|R
60|$|Christian {{could not}} eat; she sat, {{indifferent}} to the hoverings of Dominique, tormented by uneasy fear and longings. She answered Mrs. Decie at random. Greta <b>kept</b> stealing <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> her from under her lashes.|$|R
60|$|Poor Tessa's {{heart beat}} {{fast as she}} trudged away with Tommo, who slung his harp over his shoulder, and gave her his hand. It was rather a dirty hand, but so kind that Tessa clung to it, and <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> up <b>at</b> the {{friendly}} brown face for encouragement.|$|R
2500|$|After {{completing}} his BA degree in English Literature from the Government College, Lahore (then in British India, now in Pakistan), Dev Anand left his home-town for Bombay {{in the early}} 1940s. He began {{his career in the}} military censor's office at Churchgate, for a monthly salary of Rs. 165. Later he joined as a clerk in an accounting firm for a salary of Rs. 85. He joined his older brother, Chetan, {{as a member of the}} Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). Dev Anand aspired to become a performer after seeing Ashok Kumar's performance in films like Achhut Kanya and Kismet. [...] Dev Anand quoted in an interview that [...] "I remember when I gate-crashed into the office of the man who gave me the first break, he <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me– Babu Rao Pai of Prabhat Film Studios. At that time he made up his mind that this boy deserves a break and later mentioned to his people that ‘this boy struck me because of his smile and beautiful eyes and his tremendous confidence.'" [...] Then he was soon offered the lead role in Prabhat Films' Hum Ek Hain (1946), a film about Hindu-Muslim unity, where Dev Anand played a Hindu boy and was paired opposite Kamala Kotnis. While shooting the film in Pune, Anand befriended the actor Guru Dutt. Between them, they agreed that if one of them were to become successful in the film industry, he would help the other also to be successful. They formed a mutual understanding that when Anand produced a film, Dutt would direct it and when Dutt directed a film, Anand would act in it.|$|E

6000|$|She {{might have}} told him {{that there was no}} reason why she should be alone with him, and that it was very strange he should make this {{complaint}} of her. But she did not. She <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> down <b>at</b> the fan, and then she lifted her burning face and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the clock again. [...] "Mother and Irene will be sorry to miss you," [...] she gasped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Francie looked {{perfectly}} stunning. Everybody said so, and {{she sang}}- —well, she sang {{better than she}} did at home; but she was in an awful funk, though I <b>kept</b> on <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her, and shouting bravo to encourage her; and she must have heard my voice, for I was just in front." ...|$|R
60|$|The Story Girl here {{flew out}} {{to defend her}} pet, and we four boys sat on, miserably {{conscious}} of Great-aunt Eliza, who {{never said a word}} to us, despite her previously expressed desire to become acquainted with us.

2500|$|In 2015, Matt Millen {{said in a}} radio {{interview}} that he warned former Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis not to draft Russell in 2007. According to Millen, Russell struggled to pay attention during a pre-draft interview in his office {{during a visit to}} Detroit which had the No. 2 pick that year to the point where Millen kicked Russell out after he <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> down <b>at</b> his watch.|$|R
50|$|The famous, mouthless Green Man made {{an unforgettable}} {{impression}} on the posters of the 7th, 8th and 9th Jazz Fest Sarajevo in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and was proclaimed Jazz Fest Sarajevo's mascot by audiences who <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> for it <b>at</b> festival editions that followed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he laughed, {{and gave}} me a merry look as he lit on a tall, dry weed near by. He shook it hard with his little bill; when down fell a shower of seeds, and there was dinner all ready on a snow-white cloth. All the while he ate he <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> up <b>at</b> me with his quick, bright eyes; and, when he had done, he said, as plainly as a bird could say it: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose there's {{something}} in that." [...] He <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Matt, or rather, at {{the copy of}} the Abstract which Matt was hiding behind, and he said, [...] "What have you got there, Matt?" ...|$|E
60|$|Alfred {{was quite}} {{taken up with}} the history by this time, and <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Cope, {{as if he would}} eat it up with his eager eyes. Ellen asked compassionately who did for the poor boy all day.|$|E
60|$|Matt profited by the musing {{fit that}} came upon his father, {{to go and}} look at the picture over the mantel. It was not a new picture; but he did not feel that he was using his father quite frankly; and he <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it for that reason.|$|E
6000|$|But Dryfoos {{apparently}} <b>kept</b> {{himself from}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> these things. He rolled his head about {{on his shoulders}} {{to take in the}} character of the room, and said to his son, [...] "You didn't change the woodwork, after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was silent}} at first, and only helped her {{daughter}} and the maid to get the dinner, and an excellent dinner it was; but she <b>kept</b> on <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Bertram, and she quite started when she heard him called Mr. Trevor.

2500|$|Around 613 [...] Gallus, {{according}} to tradition an Irish monk and disciple and companion of Saint Columbanus, established a hermitage {{on the site}} that would become the monastery.

6000|$|She <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} her crude young clearness. [...] "I didn't know about that. Mother thinks she's more at home than almost any one. She does it on purpose: she knows what it is," [...] Nanda pursued with her perfect gravity, [...] "for people to be {{disappointed}} of finding her." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Perrott {{followed}} her to a curved green seat under a tree. They looked at the fountain in front of them, which had long ceased to play. Evelyn <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the fountain instead of thinking {{of what she was}} saying; the fountain without any water seemed to be the type of her own being.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly a dog bayed in the wood, and {{the dancers}} stopped, and going up two by two, knelt down, {{and kissed the}} man's hands. As they did so, a little smile touched his proud lips, as a bird's wing touches the water and makes it laugh. But there was disdain in it. He <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the young Fisherman.|$|E
50|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s {{the chicken}} farm {{lost much of}} its business, though people <b>kept</b> coming to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the animals, leading Ouwehand to turn his farm into a zoo. He visited European zoos to gather ideas, and opened his on 18 June 1932.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a sort}} of an all-round {{sound of}} sympathy and wonder as the last quarter opened, and then there began exactly what The Maltese Cat had foreseen. People crowded in close to the boundaries, and the Archangels' ponies <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> {{sideways}} <b>at</b> the narrowing space. If you know how a man feels to be cramped at tennis--not because he wants to run out of the court, but because he likes to know that he can at a pinch--you will guess how ponies must feel when they are playing in a box of human beings.|$|R
50|$|White {{entered the}} pornographic {{industry}} on her eighteenth birthday {{while still in}} high school. She shot her first scene with Robert Rosenberg in public {{in front of the}} University of Prague.

60|$|He again {{took the}} lead to the cottage, where the agent, a tall man named Oliver, with a heavy face and grizzled beard, welcomed them. During lunch, which Soames hardly touched, he <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Bosinney, and once or twice passed his silk {{handkerchief}} stealthily over his forehead. The meal {{came to an end}} at last, and Bosinney rose.|$|E
60|$|The nurse left her; and {{the landlady}} {{came in to}} lay the table. She {{understood}} that Joan would be dining with Mr. Phillips. There was no train till the eight-forty. She <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Joan as she moved about the room. Joan was afraid she would begin to talk, but she must have felt Joan's antagonism for she remained silent. Once their eyes met, and the woman leered at her.|$|E
60|$|We gave {{our names}} in return; upon which he bade us be seated; and, sitting down himself, asked {{us a great}} many questions, in mixed English and Tahitian. After giving some {{directions}} to an old man to prepare food, our host's wife, a large, benevolent-looking woman, upwards of forty, also sat down by us. In our soiled and travel-stained appearance, the good lady seemed to find abundant matter for commiseration; {{and all the while}} <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> us piteously, and making mournful exclamations.|$|E
60|$|But on Sunday evening, {{there he}} sat, rather stiff and brittle {{in the old}} Withams' pew, his head pressed a little back, so that his face and neck seemed {{slightly}} flattened. He wore very low, turn-down starched collars that showed all his neck. And he <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> up <b>at</b> her during the service--she sat in the choir-loft--gazing up at her with apparently love-lorn eyes and a faint, intimate smile--the sort of je-sais-tout look of a private swain. Arthur also occasionally cast a judicious eye on her, {{as if she were}} a chimney that needed repairing, and he must estimate the cost, and whether it was worth it.|$|R
60|$|He nodded {{slightly}} at that; {{and as he}} <b>kept</b> on <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me interrogatively, I enlarged a little, confessing that I had spent a little time {{on the way in}} the Mediterranean and in the West Indies. I did not want to present myself to the British Merchant Service in an altogether green state. It was no use telling him that my mysterious vocation was so strong that my very wild oats had to be sown at sea. It was the exact truth, but he would not have understood the somewhat exceptional psychology of my sea-going, I fear.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{dinner was}} over; the things were taken away, they both drew their chairs over the fire, {{and began the}} {{business}} of the evening--the making and consumption of punch. Barry had determined to begin upon the subject which lay so near his heart, at eight o'clock. He had thought it better to fix an exact hour, and had calculated that the whole matter might be completed before Colligan went over to the inn. He <b>kept</b> continually <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> his watch, and gulping down his drink, and thinking over and over again how he would begin the conversation.|$|R
