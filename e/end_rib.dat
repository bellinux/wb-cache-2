40|$|SUMMARY: We are {{adopting}} a new airworthiness directive (AD) to revise AD 68 - 17 - 03, which {{applies to all}} Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) PC- 6 series airplanes. AD 68 - 17 - 03 requires you to repetitively inspect the rudder <b>end</b> <b>rib</b> for cracks and replace the rudder <b>end</b> <b>rib</b> with a modified rudder <b>end</b> <b>rib</b> when you find cracks. Installing the modified rudder <b>end</b> <b>rib</b> terminates the repetitive inspection requirements of AD 68 - 17 - 03. Under a licensing agreement with Pilatus, Fairchild Republic Company (also identified as Fairchild Industries, Fairchild Heli Porter, or Fairchild-Hiller Corporation) produced Model PC- 6 series airplanes (manufacturer serial numbers 2001 through 2092) in the United States. AD 68 - 17 - 03 was intended to apply to all affected serial numbers of Model PC- 6 series airplanes listed on Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) No. 7 A 15, including the Fairchild-produced airplanes. Consequently, this AD clarifies that all models of the PC- 6 airplane on TCDS No. 7 A 15 (including those models produced under the licensing agreement by Fairchild Republic Company) {{are included in the}} applicability. We are issuing this AD to detect and correct cracks in the rudder <b>end</b> <b>rib,</b> which could result in failure of the rudder <b>end</b> <b>rib.</b> This failure could result in loss of rudder control...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{evaluation of}} the sternal end of the fourth rib through the İşcan's "phases method" {{is considered one of}} the most reliable method for age-at-death estimation of corpses of unknown identity. This study aims to develop a component model for age estimation alternative to İşcan's method. A numerical score, ranging from 3 to 9, was assigned based on the morphology of surface (S), antero/posterior walls (W) and articular margins (M) of the sternal end of the fourth rib in 71 white female corpse. For each component a regression formula was determined. The best correlation between <b>end</b> <b>rib</b> morphology and age-at-death was obtained through the formula of multiple regression with two independent variables (articular surface and antero/posterior walls) : Age (years) = 6. 37 (S) + 5. 33 (W) - 17. 15 ± 3. 3...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} preliminary studies relating to introducing advanced light weight truss based structural concepts in civil aircraft structures. A typical civil aircraft horizontal tail (HT) segment has been considered. The proposed composite structure is an unconventional structure with Iso-truss T-section spar, rib and orthogonal grid skin replacing the conventional full web, and thicker skin. The truss elements are made out of polyurethane foam and glass braids. Wet layup technique {{is used for the}} truss element, T-section and skin. The epoxy resin 5052 system is used. Both the main loading members (rib and spar) are made of the truss elements. The role of the skin is mainly to give an aerodynamic shape and transfer the load to the sub structure comprising of truss elements. The skin buckling is avoided by introducing the orthogonal grid. A GFRP truss based segment of HT has been designed, analyzed, fabricated and tested. The overall dimension of the fabricated segment is 780 * 1260 * 192 mm. Tensile tests have been carried out on Bi-directional GRFP (0 / 90) laminates and elemental truss elements for obtaining the material properties. A static test has been carried out on truss structure for Gust case which is the critical load case. The full load acting on the segment is 636 Kg. The GFRP segment is loaded up to 30 % of full load (191 Kg). For this load of 191 kg the maximum deflection of 14. 28 mm was observed. The deflections are monitored at the <b>end</b> <b>rib</b> and compared with the NASTRAN FE model. The correlation between analysis and testing is good. The truss based construction improves the stiffness of the structure and weight saving compared to the conventional method of fabrication.

40|$|The stress {{concentration}} {{that occurs when}} load is diffused from a constant stress member into thin sheet is an important problem {{in the design of}} light weight structures. By using solutions in biharmonic polar-trigonometric series, the {{stress concentration}} can be effectively isolated so that highly accurate information necessary for design can be obtained. A method of analysis yielding high accuracy with limited effort is presented for rectangular panels with transverse edges free or supported by inextensional <b>end</b> <b>ribs.</b> Numerical data are given for panels with length twice the width...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of ribs and diaphragm, is the change in volume of thorax that helps inspiration and expiration. In general, the ribs move around two axes. The anterior <b>end</b> of the <b>rib</b> is lower than the posterior end, therefore, during elevation of the <b>rib,</b> the anterior <b>end</b> also moves forwards. Movement at costovertebral joints 2 to 6 about a side-to-side axis results in raising and lowering the sternal <b>end</b> of the <b>rib,</b> the [...] "pump-handle" [...] movement.This occurs mostly in the vertebrosternal ribs. In elevation, this increases the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax.|$|R

50|$|The costal {{cartilage}}s are bars {{of hyaline}} cartilage that serve {{to prolong the}} ribs forward {{and contribute to the}} elasticity of the walls of the thorax. Costal cartilage is only found at the anterior <b>ends</b> of the <b>ribs,</b> providing medial extension.|$|R

40|$|The flow {{behavior}} in rib-roughened ducts {{is influenced by}} the inclination of ribs and the effect is investigated in the present study by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The local flow structures between two adjacent ribs were measured. The Reynolds number was fixed at 5800. The flow field description was based on the PIV results in planes both parallel and perpendicular to the ribbed walls at various locations. The rib angle to the main flow direction was varied as 30 deg, 45 deg, 60 deg and 90 deg. The ribs induce three dimensional flow fields. The flow separation and reattachment between adjacent ribs are clearly observed. In addition, the inclined ribs are found to alter the spanwise distribution of the streamwise velocity component. The streamwise velocity component has its highest values at the upstream <b>end</b> of the <b>ribs,</b> and decreases continuously to its lowest values at the downstream end. Strong secondary flow motion occurs over the entire duct cross section for the inclined ribs. The flow structures between two consecutive ribs show that the fluid flows along the <b>ribs</b> from one <b>end</b> of the <b>ribs</b> to the other end, and then turns back at the transverse center Downwash and upwash flows are observed at the upstream end and downstream <b>end</b> of the <b>ribs,</b> respectively...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of ribs and diaphragm is the change in volume of thorax that helps inspiration and expiration. In general, the ribs move around two axes. As the anterior <b>end</b> of <b>ribs</b> is about 4 cm lower than the posterior end, the middle part of rib is lower than anterior and posterior ends. Movement at costovertebral joints 7 to 10 about an anteroposterior axis results in raising and lowering the middle of the rib, the Bucket-handle movement. In elevation, this increases the transverse diameter of the thorax.|$|R
