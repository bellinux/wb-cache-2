To recover the full GF between two receivers using SI requires that these two receivers be surrounded by a surface of sources, with both monopole and <b>dipole</b> <b>sources</b> required for accurate amplitude estimates.

5000|$|Although it is {{impossible}} to determine where in the brain an ERP signal originated, extensive empirical research indicates that the ERN is most likely generated in the Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) area of the brain. This conclusion is supported by fMRI, and brain lesion research, as well as <b>dipole</b> <b>source</b> modeling. [...] The Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may also be involved in the generation of the ERN to some degree, and it has been found that persons with higher levels of [...] "absent-mindedness" [...] have their ERN sourced more from that region.There is some debate within the field about what the ERN reflects (see especially Burle, et al.) Some researchers maintain that the ERN is generated during the detection of or response to errors. Others argue that the ERN is generated by a comparison process or a conflict monitoring system, and not specific to errors. In contrast to the above cognitive theories, new models suggest that the ERN may reflect the motivational significance of a task or perhaps the emotional reaction to making an error. This later view is consistent with findings linking errors and the ERN to autonomic arousal and defensive motivated states, and with findings suggesting that the ERN is dissociable from cognitive factors, but not affective ones.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a fast and reliable whispering gallery mode (WGM) simulator capable of generating spectra that are comparable with experiment {{is an important step}} forward for designing microresonators.

The mode excitation methods model embedded nanoparticles, or fluorescent dye coatings, from which normalized power spectra with accurate representation of the mode coupling efficiencies can be derived.

50|$|Electric fields {{found in}} aquatic environments range from local fields to {{large-scale}} uniform fields produced by ocean currents. For example, uniform electric fields might {{provide information on}} the orientation of field intensity and can give information about the voltage of the electric field through the velocity {{and direction of the}} ocean current. Electric fields produced locally by an animate source represent more of an electric field produced by a dipole, which can be represented by two point charges, a positive and a negative. The electric field in water generates an electric current which flows from positive to negative, along lines resembling a dipole field. A field produced by a fish changes according to distance. In a field far away, a dipole produced by a fish looks more like a <b>dipole</b> <b>source.</b> Higher magnitude order multipole fields may dominate closer to the fish, where the current does not converge on one point for the anterior pole but makes a perpendicular gradient over the length of the fish. A dipole contribution is more accurate in fields farther from the source because in three dimensions the dipole contribution to the electric field decreases due to the inverse third power of distance. In contrast, the contributions from quadrupole sources decrease due to the a source decreasing by an inverse fourth power of distance.When fish use their electroreceptive sense to detect the electric fields, it is different from other senses such as vision, auditory, and vibration senses. This {{is due to the fact}} that stimuli such as light and sound travel in vectors that are associated from the propagation of the wave, and the velocity vector points to the source of the signal. The signal produced by fish used in electroreception exist rather as an electrostatic field rather than propagating as waves due to the fact the frequencies of the fields are very low and only reach up to several kilohertz. Propagating electromagnetic waves would have a wavelength measured in kilometers at this low frequency. The electric fields produced by biological organisms like fish attenuate rapidly in aquatic environments and have a field magnitude around zero at ranges of a few meters at which fish detect these fields. Unlike sounds waves in hearing, there is no velocity vector to describe propagation, shadow cast by the receiver’s body, or temporal delay associated with propagation. The non-propagating electric field only gives curved paths about signal direction, but no information about delay times or a direct path to the source. Instead of using precise coding such as in hearing, it is important that the receptors are able to detect the low frequency electric fields by relying on spatial information of intensity, orientation, and polarity of the fields.|$|E
